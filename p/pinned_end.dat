40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formulation for the modeling of a single-link flexible beam that is undergoing slewing motion at an actively controlled <b>pinned</b> <b>end,</b> {{where the other}} end of the beam is free. This <b>pinned</b> <b>end,</b> or slewing axis, is of fixed orientation such that the beam rotates in the horizontal plane. A geared dc electric motor is connected to the beam at the slewing axis. A position and a velocity sensor are placed at this hinged location, and their proportional feedback provides a position control system about the slewing axis. The motor characteristics, gear ratio, and the position feedback constant determine an equivalent rotational spring constant, often called the servo stiffness. This paper generalizes the structure's boundary conditions at the slewing axis to include the effects of the servo system. It is shown that the clamped-free beam assumption for the dynamics of the structure is a valid assumption if the ratio of the servo stiffness to beam flexibility is high. However, for moderate or low values of this ratio, the clamped-free beam leads to erroneous system models so that it becomes necessary to consider the effects of the driving servo on the dynamics of the flexible beam...|$|E

Because {{the main cause of}} out-of-plane collapses is the wall-to-wall level of connection, the application of a reinforced concrete (RC) ring beam at the eaves level of historic masonry buildings is an effective method to prevent an out-of-plane mechanism of a wall panel.

Laboratory compression tests were performed on 22 angle members of four different sizes and two different lengths. Additional tests were performed to determine the yield strength of the material.

A linearization of the surface coupling force is considered. Free cantilever and <b>pinned</b> <b>end</b> are considered as limit cases of the surface coupling.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Buried {{water and}} gas pipe systems {{form part of}} {{critical}} infrastructure providing essential services to the community. In many global population centres including in Australia, this vital infrastructure has been installed several decades ago, and dealing with frequent pipe failures become a major problem. There are clear evidences that pipe failures significantly depend on pipe strains induced by seasonal temperature and moisture changes. The past pipe failure data also indicate that the pipe failure increases when soils are more reactive. However, not much research work has been performed {{in order to understand}} the possible failure mechanisms of pipe buried in reactive soils. Therefore, in this study, the behaviour of a two meter long polyethylene pipe, which was buried in a box filled with reactive clay, was studied while the clay was subjected to wetting by supplying water to the bottom of the box. With soil wetting, it was observed that the soil swelled and the pipe deflected upwards. A simplified numerical analysis was then conducted on the pipe buried in the soil box using laboratory measured soil and pipe properties. The measured deflected shape of the pipe reasonably agrees with the shape obtained numerically assuming <b>pinned</b> <b>end</b> conditions of the pipe. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated that an axially loaded weightless circular rod buckles helically when constrained within a circular cylinder. The effects of pinned and fixed end conditions {{on the behavior of}} such a helically buckled rod are investigated. Both end conditions locate the rod end on the cylinder axis. The <b>pinned</b> <b>end</b> condition considers the rod end free to rotate about all three axes, allows axial translation, and prevents radial movement. The fixed end condition allows axial rotation and translation, requires the rod end to be tangent to the cylinder axis, and prevents radial movement. Both end conditions are found to perturb the helix in an exponentially decaying manner for a distance of less than one pitch length. Far from the end, the rod behaves as an undisturbed constant-pitch helix. The distance from the rod end to the point of initial contact with the cylinder wall is calculated. Closed form analytical solutions are obtained for the deflected shapes and internal reactions of the end sections. The maximum internal bending moment for the pinned-end case is 19. 5 % higher in the end section than in the helical section. The maximum bending moment for the fixed-end case also occurs in the end section and is 1 % higher than in the helical section. The solution procedure applies to rods of either finite or infinite length. Experimental results confirm the analytical findings...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} stability of pinned-clamped and clamped-pinned coaxial cylindrical shells conveying internal and/or annular incompressible viscous fluid flow. In the present analytical model, fluid viscous effects are taken into consideration. Generally, the viscous nature of the fluid results in both steady and unsteady viscosity-related loads being exerted on the shells, the latter of which are approximated by their inviscid counterpart in this thesis. Upstream pressurization of the flow (to overcome frictional pressure drop) and skin friction on the shell surfaces are taken into account, generating time-averaged normal and tangential loads on the shells. In this model, the shell motions are described by Flugge's shell equations, suitably modified to incorporate the time-averaged stress resultants arising from viscous effects. The unsteady fluid-dynamic forces in these equations are formulated from potential flow theory: the perturbation pressures on the shells are determined from the perturbation velocity potentials via the unsteady Bernoulli equation; those velocity potentials are governed by the Laplace equation, which is solved by the Fourier transform technique. For the clamped-pinned system, since the downstream end of the shell is simply supported, a so-called out-flow model is utilized in modelling the decay of flow perturbations beyond the <b>pinned</b> <b>end.</b> Comparison is made with the existing results for clamped-clamped and clamped-free cases. Finally, future work is suggested with regard to setting up a new analytical model with the unsteady viscous effects taken into account...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{temperature}} of the steel tube of a CFT column rises rapidly upon a fire causing the deterioration of its strength, while the concrete inside of the tube having large heat capacity provides fire-resistance performance. In order to employ CFT columns as fire-resistant structure, {{it is necessary to}} conduct studies on the factors exerting influence on structural capacities and the influence associated with each condition. Concrete’s compressive strength, cross-sectional size, axial load ratio and boundary condition are the major factors which are influential in fire-resistance performance. In particular, boundary condition between columns and beams {{is one of the major}} factors which decide fire-resistance performance because it exerts influence on load carrying capacity.

40|$|Presence of infill {{walls in}} the frames alters the {{behaviour}} of the building under lateral loads. However, it is common industry practice to ignore the stiffness of infill wall for analysis of framed building. Engineers believe that analysis without considering infill stiffness leads to a conservative design. But {{this may not be}} always true, especially for vertically irregular buildings with discontinuous infill walls. Hence, the modelling of infill {{walls in the}} seismic analysis of framed buildings is imperative. Indian Standard IS 1893 : 2002 allows analysis of open ground storey buildings without considering infill stiffness but with a multiplication factor 2. 5 in compensation for the stiffness discontinuity. As per the code the columns and beams of the open ground storey are to be designed for 2. 5 times the storey shears and moments calculated under seismic loads of bare frames (i. e., without considering the infill stiffness). However, as experienced by the engineers at design offices, the multiplication factor of 2. 5 is not realistic for low rise buildings. This calls for an assessment and review of the code recommended multiplication factor for low rise open ground storey buildings. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is defined as to check the applicability of the multiplication factor of 2. 5 and to study the effect of infill strength and stiffness in the seismic analysis of low rise open ground storey building. Infill walls can be modelled in commercial software using two-dimensional area element with appropriate material properties for linear elastic analysis. But this type of modelling may not work for non-linear analysis since the non-linear material properties for a two-dimensional orthotropic element is not very well understood. Seismic evaluation of an existing reinforced concrete (RC) framed building would invariably require a non-linear analysis. Published literature in this area recommends a linear diagonal strut approach to model infill wall for both linear (Equivalent Static Analysis and Response Spectrum Analysis) and nonlinear analyses (Pushover Analysis and Time History Analysis). An existing RC framed building (G+ 3) with open ground storey located in Seismic Zone-V is considered for this study. This building is analyzed for two different cases: (a) considering both infill mass and infill stiffness and (b) considering infill mass but without considering infill stiffness. Two separate models were generated using commercial software SAP 2000. Infill weights were modelled through applying static dead load and corresponding masses considered from this dead load for dynamic analyses. Infill stiffness was modelled using a diagonal strut approach. Two different support conditions, namely fixed end support condition and <b>pinned</b> <b>end</b> support condition, are considered to check the effect of support conditions in the multiplication factors. Linear and non-linear analyses were carried out for the models and the results were compared. The analysis results show that a factor of 2. 5 is too high to be multiplied to the beam and column forces of the ground storey of low-rise open ground storey buildings. This study conclude that the problem of open ground storey buildings cannot be identified properly through elastic analysis as the stiffness of open ground storey building and a similar bare-frame building are almost same. Nonlinear analysis reveals that open ground storey building fails through a ground storey mechanism at a comparatively low base shear and displacement and the mode of failure is found to be brittle. Linear and nonlinear analyses show that support condition influences the response considerably and can be an important parameter to decide the force amplification factor. ...|$|E
