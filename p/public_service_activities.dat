In 2003, the CUDC began a collaboration with the Dresden University of Technology, Kent State's sister university in Germany, with a joint vision on the revitalization of the lower Cuyahoga Valley in Cleveland.

40|$|Title: Television in the <b>Service</b> of the <b>Public</b> - a Study of the <b>Public</b> <b>Service</b> Concept (Television i allmänhetens tjänst - en studie av public service-begreppet). Author: Daniel Färnstrand Aim: To {{describe}} the ideals, or principles, that the <b>Public</b> <b>Service</b> Ideology or concept of Pub­lic Service is based upon. The two main questions the paper aims to answer are thus: · Which principles should, {{according to the}} theoretical norm, guide <b>Public</b> <b>Service</b> <b>activity?</b> · Which principles guide <b>Public</b> <b>Service</b> television in Sweden today, according to the actual guidelines for the <b>Public</b> <b>Service</b> organization SVT? Method / Material: A study of relevant literature is carried out. Further, the actual guidelines for SVT are summarized. The normative guidelines are then also summarized, and a compari­son is made between this summary and the actual guidelines for SVT. Main results: Although a comprehensive definition {{is hard to find}} within the theoretical frame­work, a summary of the theoretical ideal is carried out. Hereby, a broad definition of the theoretical, normative ideal for <b>Public</b> <b>Service</b> <b>activity</b> is created. A comparison between the actual guidelines for SVT and the theoretical ideal of <b>Public</b> <b>Service</b> <b>activity,</b> revealed that these show almost exact coherence. The ideal seems to have been fulfilled, at least when one analyses the guidelines for SVT. Whether these guidelines are then followed by the actual ac­tivity of SVT is a question outside the range of this paper. Number of pages: 41 Course: Media and Communication Studies C.
