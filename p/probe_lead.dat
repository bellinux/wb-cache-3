40|$|Abstract In nature, {{several species}} use {{flexible}} probes to actively explore their environment and acquire important sensory information, such as surface topology, texture, and water or air flow velocity.

The complex mechanisms by which mechanical deformations of the <b>probe</b> <b>lead</b> to neuronal activity in the animal’s nervous system are still far from being completely understood.

Understanding how these mechanosensory signals are transduced and extracted by the nervous system promises great insight into biological function, and has novel technological applications. To understand the mechanical aspect of sensory transduction, here we monitored the deformation of a rat’s vibrissa as it strikes rigid objects with different topologies (surface features) during locomotion, using high-speed videography.

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) is {{a treatment}} that involves insertion of a probe and stimulation of brain tissue {{with an electric}} potential (or injection of current). Electrical stimulation has been demonstrated {{to be an effective}} treatment in a variety of neurological conditions, serving to relieve motor-symptoms and tremors in advanced stage Parkinson’s disease and Essential tremor. Current DBS therapy involves electrically stimulating a specific region of the brain symmetrically about the <b>probe</b> <b>lead</b> via pulses of electrical potential. Currently-used leads apply potential symmetrically about the cylindrical probe’s central axis. This, however, is problematic, since stimulation needs to be highly specific, yet there is little {{that can be done to}} alter the applied electric field after the probes have been implanted. Asymmetric stimulation, on the other hand, allows increased control over direction within these complex regions of the brain, affording more targeted stimulation following the implantation procedure. A problem with any form of electrical stimulation, however, is heating. Even a 1 °C change in temperature can cause adverse effects due to strong membrane potential and pump kinetics dependence on temperature. Heat is generated due to both Joule heat from the applied potential and through increased metabolism rates caused by physiological shifts in neurons influenced by the stimulation. Our project focused on creating a computer model of electrothermal deep brain stimulation utilizing a novel probe design based upon the one proposed in Martens, et al in order to ensure safety and efficacy of this probe. We created a 3 D model in COMSOL representing a probe capable of asymmetric heating. A symmetric configuration of our model showed a similar temperature distribution to both computational models and experimental measurements made by Elwassif et al., as well as a similar electric potential profile to models by Martens, et al, demonstrating validity of our computational model. Stimulation due to asymmetric stimulation showed almost no significant temperature increase in the unstimulated direction when the probe was asymmetrically activated, and ultimately ensured safe deep brain stimulation and effective temperature and voltage control. The sensitivity analysis showed that voltage was the most important factor for temperature distribution. Because of this, we believe that optimization should be based on an individuals’ symptoms and geometry at which the probe is implanted. Models like ours lead to better understanding of heat distribution under asymmetric stimulation and more affective deep brain steering stimulation, ultimately leading to higher success rates for suffering neurological conditions and decreasing likelihood of brain damage...|$|E

40|$|The {{progress}} in micro-fabrication technologies {{makes it possible}} to address individual, tailored, mesoscopic structures with sizes on a nanometer to micrometer scale. The transport properties of such quasi zero- or one-dimensional systems are considerably influenced by the electron-electron interaction. In theoretical studies this often becomes apparent in the emergence of divergences in a perturbative treatment of the interaction. A successful approach may then be given by renormalization group (RG) methods which are based on the idea of treating energy scales successively from high to low. In the functional RG (fRG) an exact infinite hierarchy of flow equations for multi-particle Green or vertex functions is derived, that allows for systematic approximations on different levels. In numerous studies the fRG {{has been found to be}} a powerful tool for the investigation of low dimensional Fermi systems. Usually it is formulated within Matsubara formalism which applies to a system in thermal equilibrium. A central topic of this thesis is the implementation of the fRG within Keldysh formalism, providing the possibility to treat equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations on equal footing. The resulting Keldysh fRG is used in this thesis to explore the transport properties of quantum wires with several barriers and of the single impurity Anderson model. The thesis starts with an introduction to Keldysh formalism and to related concepts. Then the structure of the Green and vertex functions of Keldysh formalism is investigated. This includes studying the consequences of causality, characterizing thermal equilibrium, and formulating corresponding relations for the multi-particle functions. After that, the implementation of the fRG within Keldysh formalism is presented in detail. The flow equations for the vertex functions are derived via their diagrammatic expansion. Two especially useful flow parameters are determined: one of them cuts off the imaginary frequencies that appear as poles of the Fermi functions of the reservoirs. The second flow parameter is an artificially enhanced reservoir hybridization; on one hand it has the advantage to preserve the fluctuation dissipation theorem in equilibrium even in frequency dependent approximations; on the other hand, its use can be more cumbersome. One of the models studied in this thesis is a tight-binding chain with nearest-neighbour interaction. At weak and intermediate interactions it belongs to the class of Luttinger liquids (LLs) whose low energy properties are characterized by power laws. The transport properties of LLs have been studied experimentally for example on carbon nanotubes. However, the presence of transport barriers at the contacts make the interpretation of the experimental data difficult. A theoretical treatment with the fRG permits a rather large flexibility to model the barrier configuration. In this thesis the fRG is first used in its equilibrium Matsubara implementation in order to analyse the temperature dependence of the linear conductance in the presence of two, three or four barriers. It is shown that temperature induces an averaging over quantum phases of propagation, leading to combinations of the power law exponents of the individual barriers. An experimental set-up that allows to verify this behaviour is proposed. In a second step the Keldysh version of the fRG is applied to the problem of transport through a quantum wire at finite bias voltage. For a wire with two high contact barriers it is found that the non-equilibrium particle distribution in the wire is responsible for the appearance of a two-fold power law in the density of states. An additional weakly attached <b>probe</b> <b>lead</b> can be used to make the two different power laws visible in the conductance. The second model which is analysed is the one of the single Anderson impurity, often considered as a paradigm for the investigation of strong local electron correlations. The latter become noticeable in the appearance of the Kondo scale, an energy exponentially small in the interaction strength, that characterizes the low energy physics of the model in the regime of spin fluctuations. On the basis of this model an advanced frequency dependent approximation for the Keldysh fRG is developed in this thesis. Such an approximation can account for subleading effects of the interaction, namely the fact that two-particle interactions can generate decay rates for single-particle states. The derivation of a consistent approximation scheme is presented, that turns out to yield a good description of the model at moderate interaction strength...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} that the adsorption of a chiral 2 -butanol template on Pd(111) leads to enantioselective adsorption of chiral propylene oxide probe molecules. Enantioselectivity is expressed over a narrow coverage range where the maximum value of enantioselectivity ratio (ER defined as Θ(R-propylene oxide) /Θ(S-propylene oxide), where Θ is the coverage) reaches ~ 2. Probe coverages in this case were measured using either reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) or temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) [1, 2]. The enantioselectivity disappears when the 2 -butanol-covered surface was heated to ~ 200 K since the adsorbed butoxy species decomposes by a β-hydride elimination reaction to yield a non-chiral ketone. Monte Carlo calculations {{of the effect of}} chiral modifiers have yielded results that are consistent with these experimental observations [3, 4]. Similar experiments using 2 -methyl butanoic acid as a template, where the chiral center is identical to that in 2 -butanol but is now anchored by a carboxylate group rather than by an alkoxide, shows no enantioselectivity. In this case, propylene oxide coverages were measured using the King and Wells method. RAIRS experiments and density functional calculations suggest that the 2 -butyl group of the 2 -butoxy species is oriented parallel to the surface. A possible origin for the lack of enantioselectivity of a 2 -methyl butanoic acid-covered surface may be that the 2 -butyl group is farther from the surface, allowing it to rotate more freely, averaging out any asymmetry, resulting in a loss of chirality. In order to test this idea, the alkyl group on the carboxylic acid was functionalized with an amine to anchor the chiral center to the surface. Using the amino-acids alanine and 2 -amino butanoic acid as templates restored the enantioselectivity and yielded ER values of 2. 0 ± 0. 2 and 1. 75 ± 0. 15 respectively. These results suggest that a two-point attachment of the chiral template is required, one for surface adsorption and the other to allow the enantioselectivity to be expressed. Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) intensity versus energy (I/E) measurements are used to measure the structure of templates and probes on the Pd(111) surface, where these results will be compared with calculations carried out by the Sholl group. Since the aminoacids are relatively large, initial experiments were carried out to determine the structure of carboxylates on the surface to determine the carboxylate group anchoring site. Since carboxylates do not form ordered structures on Pd(111), we have exploited a method recently developed in collaboration with Professor Saldin to measure structures of disordered overlayers [5]. Results show that the formate OCO plane is oriented perpendicular to the surface with the oxygen atoms located across a short bridge on the (111) surface. The effect {{of the size of the}} functional group on the amino acid template (RCH(NH 2) COOH) was also investigated where the maximum ER values obtained using propylene oxide were 2. 0 ± 0. 2 (R=CH 3), 1. 75 ± 0. 15 (R=C 2 H 5), 1. 65 ± 0. 15 (R=C 3 H 6) and 1. 30 ± 0. 15 (R=CH 2 CH(CH 3) 2) thus showing a decreasing trend with increasing size of the side chain. The enantioselectivity of S-(1 -naphthyl) ethylamine-covered surfaces have been explored using propylene oxide as a probe, but these systems showed no enantioselectivity. However, using 2 -butanol as a <b>probe</b> <b>lead</b> to enantioselective chemisorption implying that one-to-one modification requires a direct hydrogen-bonding interaction between the probe and modifier. 1.

The detector {{is based on}} lead activation due to the following neutron scattering reactions: {sup 207 }Pb(n, n') {sup 207 m}Pb and {sup 208 }Pb(n, 2 n) {sup 207 m}Pb. Delayed gammas from the metastable state of {sup 207 m}Pb are counted using a plastic scintillator. The half-life of {sup 207 m}Pb is 0. 8 seconds. In the work reported here, MCNP was used to optimize {{the efficiency of the}} <b>lead</b> <b>probe</b> by suitably modifying the original geometry. A prototype detector was then built and tested. A 'layer cake' design was investigated in which thin (< 5 mm) layers of lead were sandwiched between thicker ({approx} 1 - 2 cm) layers of scintillator. An optimized 'layer cake' design had Figures of Merit (derived from the code) which were a factor of 3 greater than the original <b>lead</b> <b>probe</b> for DD neutrons, and a factor of 4 greater for DT neutrons, while containing 30 % less lead. A smaller scale, 'proof of principle' prototype was built by Bechtel/Nevada to verify the code results. Its response to DD neutrons was measured using the DD dense plasma focus at Texas A&M and it conformed to the predicted performance. A voltage and discriminator sweep was performed to determine optimum sensitivity settings. It was determined that a calibration operating point could be obtained using a {sup 133 }Ba 'bolt' {{as is the case with}} the original <b>lead</b> <b>probe...</b>|$|R
40|$|High angular {{momentum}} Rydberg wave packets are studied. Application of carefully tailored electric fields to low {{angular momentum}}, high- n (n ∼ 300) Rydberg atoms creates coherent superpositions of Stark states with near extreme values of angular momentum, [cursive l]. Wave packet components orbit the parent nucleus at rates {{that depend on}} their energy, leading to periods of localization and delocalization as the components come into and go out of phase with each other. Monitoring survival probability signals {{in the presence of}} position dependent <b>probing</b> <b>leads</b> to observation of characteristic oscillations based on the composition of the wave packet. The discrete nature of electron energy levels is observed through the measurement of quantum revivals in the wave packet localization signal. Time-domain spectroscopy of these signals allows determination of both the population and phase of individual superposition components. Precise manipulation of wave packets is achieved through further application of pulsed electric fields. Decoherence effects due to background gas collisions and electrical noise are also detailed. Quantized classical trajectory Monte-Carlo simulations are introduced and agree remarkably well with experimental results...|$|R

Despite EBNA 1 ’s potential as a therapeutic target, tools for the direct monitoring of EBNA 1 in vitro and in vivo are lacking. Here, we show that a peptide-based inhibitor that luminesces when bound to EBNA 1 inside the nucleus of EBV+ cells can regulate EBNA 1 homodimer formation and selectively inhibit the growth of EBV+ tumours of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (C 666 - 1 and NPC 43) and Burkitt’s lymphoma Raji cells. We also show that the peptide-based <b>probe</b> <b>leads</b> to 93 % growth inhibition of EBV+ tumours in mice. Our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} selective inhibition of EBNA 1 dimerization can be used to afford better EBV-related cancer differentiation, and highlight the potential application of the probe as a new generation of biotracers for investigating the fundamental biological function of EBNA 1 and for exploring its application as a therapeutic target...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] weather sensors are becoming increasingly important as a means to augment networks of automated weather stations and extend the capability of manned observations. The classification of hydrometeors is one of the principal tasks that is addressed by present weather sensors. In this paper, we discuss a new laser-based technology for this purpose. The system improves upon current precipitation monitors by using a derivative of phase Doppler anemometry techniques to accurately determine particle speed and size. The instrument is also capable of distinguishing between liquid droplets and solid polycrystalline hydrometeors and can be used to estimate visibility. The incorporation of this technology into a meteorological station with other sensors, such as temperature and relative humidity <b>probes,</b> <b>leads</b> to the accurate classification of particle type. The example data shown are taken from tests in Leicestershire, England and Utah, USA and show the differences between solid and liquid precipitation events...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is {{becoming}} clear that, {{in addition to}} structural properties, the mechanical properties of proteins {{can play an important}} role in their biological activity. It nevertheless remains difficult to probe these properties experimentally. Whereas single-molecule experiments give access to overall mechanical behavior, notably the impact of end-to-end stretching, it is currently impossible to directly obtain data on more local properties. We propose a theoretical method for probing the mechanical properties of protein structures at the single-amino acid level. This approach can be applied to both all-atom and simplified protein representations. The <b>probing</b> <b>leads</b> to force constants for local deformations and to deformation vectors indicating the paths of least mechanical resistance. It also reveals the mechanical coupling that exists between residues. Results obtained for a variety of proteins show that the calculated force constants vary over a wide range. An analysis of the induced deformations provides information that is distinct from that obtained with measures of atomic fluctuations and is more easily linked to residue-level properties than normal mode analyses or dynamic trajectories. It is also shown that the mechanical information obtained by residue-level probing opens a new route for defining so-called dynamical domains within protein structures.
