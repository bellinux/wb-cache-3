5|$|In October 1857 the inquisitor of Bologna, a Dominican friar called Father Pier Gaetano Feletti, {{learned of}} rumours {{to the effect}} that a secret baptism had been {{administered}} to one of the city's Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, this would make the child a Catholic {{in the eyes of the}} Church—a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since the Church stance was that children they considered to be Christians could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be taken from their parents in such circumstances. Cases like this were not uncommon in 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents' consent, except if a child was on the brink of death—in these cases the Church considered the customary deferment to <b>parental</b> <b>authority</b> to be outweighed by the importance of allowing the child's soul to be saved and go to Heaven, and permitted baptism without the parents' assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids; to counter this perceived threat some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.|$|E

25|$|The test {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} danger never matched the practical realities facing individuals where {{the consequences of}} a refusal to marry might not be immediate, but nevertheless serious. In Hirani v Hirani (1982) 4 FLR 332, the Court of Appeal considered the case of a nineteen-year-old Hindu woman who was dating a Muslim man. Her parents told the petitioner that unless she married a Hindu of their choosing, she would be ostracized socially from her family and left to fend for herself. Under the circumstances, the Court agreed that the petitioner had acted without full consent in marrying her parents' choice of husband. Thus, it is for the courts of all countries {{to strike a balance between}} well-intentioned <b>parental</b> <b>authority</b> to arrange marriages in the face of a reluctant child, and unreasonable threats that would overbear the will of any reasonable person, while maintaining the trust of local communities whose cultures have included arranged marriages for centuries. As to transnational recognition, it will be difficult to disturb the validity of the marriage if no complaint of coercion was made around the time the ceremony was performed in the lex loci celebrationis or immediately the parties entered the state where proceedings were commenced. It would be more usual to use the local divorce system to terminate the relationship.|$|E

The semi-structured interviews were conducted from 14 Single Fathers who divorced. They had preschool children when they divorced. They live in Kawasaki, near Tokyo in Japan. The period of research was from January to May 2015. In Japan, it was usual that mothers got the <b>parental</b> <b>authorities</b> when couples were divorced, so it was found that Single Fathers regarded living with their children as special cases. Second, there were some kinds of diﬃculties for Single Fathers to raise their children. They felt gender inequalities between single mothers and single fathers.

At home, Dan's poker buddy Arnie (Tom Arnold) makes a startling debut when he plants a passionate kiss on Roseanne. The Conners celebrate an outrageous Halloween that becomes an annual feature of the series. Roseanne wants 10 minutes to herself in the bathroom; this turns into a bizarre dream sequence which has the entire cast singing parodies of songs from musical comedies. Later, at Thanksgiving dinner, Dan takes wary notice of a growing romance between his father and Crystal. Jackie gets serious with new boyfriend Gary (Brian Kerwin). Becky repeatedly rebels against Roseanne and Dan's <b>parental</b> <b>authority</b> such as staying out late and breaking into the liquor cabinet with her friend Dana and getting drunk when Dan and Roseanne are out of town for the day. The reappearance of old biker buddy Ziggy (Jay O. Sanders) reminds Roseanne and Dan of their own rebellious past. Darlene first proves her talent for writing when she wins recognition for her poetry. Roseanne's own writing talents are given a boost when her family fixes up a basement room to serve as a writer's den. This is the first season where we hear Roseanne thinking out loud.|$|E

40|$|According to the power-control theory, growing {{independence}} of adolescent girls, manifest in more prevalent problem behaviors, {{may be explained}} by changes in family structure (increasing level of authority gained in the workplace by mothers). To verify this hypothesis, self-report data from Warsaw adolescents (N = 3087, age 14 – 15 years, 50 % boys) were used. Results indicate that parenting practices differ across child gender and structure of parents’ work authority. Girls, especially in patriarchal households, spend more time with mothers and perceive stronger maternal control. In egalitarian families, fathers tend to be more involved with sons than with daughters. When parental control, support and adolescents’ risk preferences are controlled, the gender-by-household type interaction effect is observed—girls in patriarchal families have the lowest risk of getting drunk.

For Freud, the super-ego comes into being through the psychic processes of repression, identification and introjection. Its central task is that of playing the role within the personality once occupied by the <b>parental</b> or other <b>authorities.</b> The super-ego tends to accent the harshness, severity and restrictiveness of the parents far more than their love and kindness.

2500|$|The main {{impediment}} to Japan's becoming {{a party to}} the convention was that it would require a change in attitude of the legal system towards child custody rights. Japanese family law considers issues of divorce custody, child support or alimony as predominantly private matters. Consequently, Japan has no enforcement mechanism to enforce foreign custody rulings or recommendations made by its own domestic courts. Furthermore, Japan does not recognise joint <b>parental</b> <b>authority</b> or shared [...] "residence" [...] after divorce. [...] As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, however, Japan is supposed to recognize the right of a child to obtain non-custodial parent visitation. However, the Supreme Court of Japan has ruled before entry into force of the convention that this does not amount to the right of non-custodial parents to see their children (it has ruled that state-enforced visitation is the right of neither parent nor children). This ruling, in effect, makes visitation without the cooperation of the custody-holding parent a practical impossibility.|$|E

2500|$|The typical 'deal' in Japan is that, upon divorce, {{the father}} pays {{nothing for the}} child's support, and he never sees his child. It is noted that the {{decision}} by family courts in Japan with regard to both visitation and child support are unenforceable. There are several consequences to this lack of enforcement. At first, the courts strongly prefer that divorcing couples agree to child custody arrangements in mediation. If mediation fails, the court can intervene and {{has the power to}} determine which parent shall have <b>parental</b> <b>authority.</b> Article 819 of Japanese Civil Code states that [...] "In the case of judicial divorce, the court shall determine which parent shall have parental authority." [...] The primary custodian, or caregiver, as defined by the Japanese legal system, is the parent who has physical possession of the child at the time the case is initially brought to court in Japan. In other words, the court will likely choose the parent who already has possession. Colin P.A. Jones, a professor at Doshisha Law School, states that parental rights are not recognised in Japanese law, pointing out an academic debate in Japan over whether visitation was a right of the parent or the child or something else. In regard to visitation/access, the Supreme Court held in 2000 that visitation was a right of neither parent nor child.|$|E

[...] "Philip Carey's struggle toward maturity is painfully messy…unconsciously he knows what he needs: connection to and then freedom from <b>parental</b> <b>authority</b> so that he can determine his own goals in life.

Methods—In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 clinicians, including physicians and advanced practice clinicians serving primarily low-income patients in high-risk communities throughout the U. S. Results—Most of the clinicians describe their influence on patients and protective behaviors as derived from medical authority and the presentation of information. The use of a <b>parental</b> style of <b>authority,</b> particularly for young or vulnerable patients, and emotional appeals to evoke negative emotions, such as fear, were also used to motivate protective behaviors. Many clinicians highlighted the importance of empathy, and understanding the cultural and social context of health behaviors.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued (Carsten 2004) that kinship {{involves}} not just rights, rules, and obligations but is also a realm of new possibilities, and what has been lacking in anthropology is {{an examination of the}} experience of kinship. Kin-ship or relatedness is a significant part of human experience, although it will take culturally and historically specific forms. Dominant themes that shape Western or Euro-American ideas of kin in parent-child relationships are to do with degrees of independence from <b>parental</b> control and <b>authority</b> coupled with a never-ending familial responsibility (Allan 1996). Young adults are in a transitional phase, one in which many are attempting to secure an independ-ent adult identity and become fully adult social beings. This has the potential for conflict between parents and adult children and to create emotional and/or physical distance from each other. However, the support of young people by parents and other close kin is also a significant factor for the individual resil-ience needed in times of distress. If a young person does not have kin to depend upon, an alternative may be friendship with the parent/s of one’s intimate partner. The danger with this is that if the intimate relationship ends, so too may the friendship. This paper examines these relationship experiences for a group of young adult New Zealanders...|$|R
