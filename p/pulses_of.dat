5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E

5|$|Plants grown under UVB light {{are more}} {{resistant}} to insect herbivory compared with plants grown under filters that exclude the radiation. When tomato plants are exposed to a pulse of UVB radiation and then weakly wounded, PIs accumulate throughout the plant. By themselves, neither the radiation nor weak wounding is sufficient to induce systemic PI accumulation. Tomato cell cultures respond similarly, with systemin and UVB acting together to activate MAPKs. Short <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> UVB also cause alkalisation of the culturing medium.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the season, a {{shift in}} the Hadley Circulation towards the Tasman Sea {{resulted}} in more frequent episodes of strong wind shear and regular <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> dry air into the deep tropics, significantly hindering tropical cyclogenesis. The below-average activity was also reflected in an unusually low number of damaging storms. Only two systems, Trina and Waka, had significant effects on land. The former caused extensive flooding on Mangaia while the latter was {{regarded as one of the}} most damaging storms in the history of Tonga. Approximately $51.3million in damage was attributed to Waka as well as an indirect fatality, the only tropical cyclone-related death of the year, due to cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|After {{three seasons}} of below average cyclone activity, the 2002–03 season was {{slightly}} above average, featuring ten cyclones and seven severe tropical cyclones. One of the cyclones, Cyclone Erica, originated from the Australian region but later {{moved into the}} South Pacific, where it impacted New Caledonia. Throughout the season, a moderately warm El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) generated a shift of cyclone activity away from Australia and towards the open waters of the southern Pacific. As a result, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) between November 2002 and June 2003 was negative, averaging -7.2. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Pacific were above average; {{for most of the}} tropical regions, SSTs were above 29°C (84°C). At various times, Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) pulses increased convective activity and thus cyclone development in the basin. Five <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> the MJO and Equatorial Rossby waves (ER) were responsible for most of the cyclone activity during the season. Cyclone Zoe, the strongest cyclone of the season, was the only cyclone with no connection to any identified MJO or ER wave. By April, an easterly trade wind anomaly took place, signifying the end of the El Niño pattern that had persisted for much of the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of delay line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic eruptions {{vary widely}} in strength. On the one extreme there are effusive Hawaiian eruptions, which are {{characterized}} by lava fountains and fluid lava flows, which are typically not very dangerous. On the other extreme, Plinian eruptions are large, violent, and highly dangerous explosive events. Volcanoes are not bound to one eruptive style, and frequently display many different types, both passive and explosive, even {{in the span of}} a single eruptive cycle. Volcanoes do not always erupt vertically from a single crater near their peak, either. Some volcanoes exhibit lateral and fissure eruptions. Notably, many Hawaiian eruptions start from rift zones, and some of the strongest Surtseyan eruptions develop along fracture zones. Scientists believed that <b>pulses</b> <b>of</b> magma mixed together in the chamber before climbing upward—a process estimated to take several thousands of years. But Columbia University volcanologists found that the eruption of Costa Rica’s Irazú Volcano in 1963 was likely triggered by magma that took a nonstop route from the mantle over just a few months.|$|E
