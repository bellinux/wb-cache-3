5|$|Combat is an {{important}} part of 4X gameplay, because 4X games allow a player to win by exterminating all rival players, or by conquering a threshold amount of the game's universe. Some 4X games, such as Galactic Civilizations, resolve battles automatically, whenever two units from warring sides meet. This is in contrast to other 4X games, such as Master of Orion, that allow players to manage battles on a tactical battle screen. Even in 4X games with more detailed control over battles, victory is usually determined by superior numbers and technology, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. 4X games differ from other combat-focused strategy games by <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> emphasis on research and economics. Researching new technology will grant access to new combat units. Some 4X games even allow players to research different unit components. This is more typical of space 4X games, where players may assemble a ship from a variety of engines, shields, and weaponry.|$|E
5|$|Meats {{were more}} {{expensive}} than plant foods. Though rich in protein, the calorie-to-weight ratio of meat was {{less than that of}} plant food. Meat could be up to four times as expensive as bread. Fish was up to 16 times as costly, and was expensive even for coastal populations. This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs. It was only after the Black Death had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people. The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages dramatically increased. It also left vast areas of farmland untended, making them available for pasture and <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> meat on the market.|$|E
5|$|The first Kanon manga {{illustrated}} by Petit Morishima was serialized in MediaWorks' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh between the February 2000 and July 2002 issues. The individual chapters were later collected into two separate tankōbon volumes published by MediaWorks under their Dengeki Comics imprint released in September 2000 and on July 27, 2002. There are six chapters in total, three in each volume. Aside from the prologue in volume {{one and the}} epilogue in volume two, the other four chapters concern four of the main heroines. From chapters one through four, the main heroines presented are: Shiori Misaka, Makoto Sawatari, Mai Kawasumi and Ayu Tsukimiya. To make up for Nayuki not getting a chapter of her own, the story is altered in that Nayuki is {{in most of the}} scenes Yuichi is in. The first manga is different from the visual novel in that Shiori's, Makoto's, and Mai's stories are not told in their entirety. Near the end of each of these girls' stories were originally intended to give the viewer the remaining answers, but the manga version ends these girls' stories prematurely. This was due to the manga <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> focus on Ayu's story.|$|E

Records pressed here include the Beatles' Abbey Road, Simon and Garfunkel's The Concert in Central Park and Richard Pryor's self-titled album. Capitol Records announced in late 1987 that it would end tape duplicating production in the US, in favor of offshore manufacturing, including in Winchester by early 1988, <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> than 500 employees out of work when they closed the Winchester plant.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in previous experiments, notably the Shiva laser, was that the infrared light provided by the Nd:glass lasers (at ~1054nm in vaco) couples strongly with the electrons around the target, losing {{a considerable amount of}} energy that would otherwise heat the target itself. This is typically addressed through the use of an optical frequency multiplier, which can double or triple the frequency of the light, into the green or ultraviolet, respectively. These higher frequencies interact less strongly with the electrons, <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> power into the target. HiPER will use frequency tripling on the drivers.|$|E
25|$|The 2012 Los Angeles Dodgers {{season was}} the 123rd for the {{franchise}} in Major League Baseball, and their 55th season in Los Angeles. The Dodgers celebrated the Golden Anniversary of Dodger Stadium, their home since 1962. It was a transitional {{year as the}} sale of the team from Frank McCourt to Guggenheim Baseball Management was not finalized until May 1. The new ownership group put their stamp on the team quickly by making a number of big trades and <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> money into the team than McCourt did. After a fast start, the team faded down the stretch and finished eight games behind the World Series Champion Giants.|$|E

25|$|DreamWorks began {{production}} in 2001, which was actually {{before the first}} film was even completed. DreamWorks made sure there was something new to see in Shrek 2 by <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> human characters in the film than there were in its predecessor and improving their appearance, {{with the use of}} a few systems that dealt with hair and fur to improve its appearance and movement. The set up for all the characters was done in the first three years of production. Puss in Boots required a whole new set of tools in the film to handle his fur, belt and feather plume in his hat. The character also required an upgrade in the fur shader for his introduction in the film.|$|E
25|$|In 1778, {{when the}} British {{commander}} in North America, William Howe, requested to be relieved, Amherst was {{considered as a}} replacement by the government: however, his insistence that it would require 75,000 troops to fully defeat the rebellion was not acceptable to the government, and Henry Clinton was instead chosen to take over from Howe in America. Following the British setback at Saratoga, Amherst successfully argued for a limited war in North America, keeping footholds along the coast, defending Canada, East and West Florida, and the West Indies while <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> effort into the war at sea. On 7 November 1778 the King and Queen visited Amherst at his home, Montreal Park, in Kent and on 24 April 1779 he became colonel of the 2nd Troop of Horse Grenadier Guards.|$|E
25|$|The opening {{match of}} the 2003 Six Nations Championship saw France, the reigning champions and Grand Slam winners, play England. Both teams were high in confidence, {{following}} successes in their end of year tests against nations from the Southern hemisphere. Many saw this game as the tournament decider and England won the match 25–17. Now considered favourites {{to win the}} tournament, as well as possibly a Grand Slam, England defeated Wales, Italy and Scotland. For the game against Italy, Wilkinson {{was chosen as the}} captain of the squad {{for the first time in}} his England career, as Martin Johnson was unavailable due to the birth of his first child. The final match was against Ireland at Lansdowne Road and would determine the tournament, and Grand Slam winner of 2003. By <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> than 40 points on their opponents, winning 42–6, England became the 2003champions and serious contenders for the upcoming 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. Wilkinson was named Man of the Match.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Wilder and Chandler had {{intended}} to retain as much of Cain’s original dialogue as possible. It was Chandler who first realized that the dialogue from the novella would not translate well to the screen. Wilder disagreed and was annoyed that Chandler was not <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> of it into the script. To settle it, Wilder hired a couple of contract players from the studio to read passages of Cain’s original dialogue aloud. To Wilder's astonishment, Chandler was right and, in the end, the movie’s cynical and provocative dialogue was more Chandler and Wilder than it was Cain. Chandler also {{did a lot of}} fieldwork while working on the script and took large volumes of notes. By visiting various locations that figured into the film, he was able to bring a sense of realism about Los Angeles that seeped into the script. For example, he hung around Jerry's Market on Melrose Avenue in preparation for the scene where Phyllis and Walter would discreetly meet to plan the murder.|$|E
25|$|Since Reroute to Remain was {{released}} in 2002, In Flames fan base has been split because of the gradual change in style towards a more alternative metal sound. Still, In Flames have a solid and growing worldwide fanbase. The stylistic changes include screamed and clean vocals, {{as opposed to the}} death growl on the early records, more prominent rhythm section and less guitar melodies and solos, more obvious use of synthesizers and electronics and a clear influence from modern American metal in especially the uplifting chorus melodies. This later style has been mostly described as alternative metal. Since Siren Charms, and more recently their latest studio album Battles, they have more extensively used clean vocals as opposed to screams and growls and have played a softer overall sound, <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> emphasis on a melodic alternative metal direction. Very minimal elements of their earlier Melodic death metal sound are utilized at this point. However, some very mild elements of this style can still sometimes be heard in their music. Anders' clean singing style has altered drastically as it is now more prominent and he has taken on a higher-pitched vocal range.|$|E
500|$|On August 30, 1994, LaFace {{released}} Usher's self-titled {{debut album}} behind the co-executive production of Sean [...] "P Diddy" [...] Combs. Usher peaked at number twenty-five on the Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart and {{was accompanied by}} three singles: [...] "Can U Get wit It", [...] "Think of You", and [...] "The Many Ways". The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date. The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex which the public {{had a hard time}} believing coming out of a 14-year-old's mouth. Again the LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn't as successful as they anticipated. At this time Jonetta Patton, Usher's mother took control of his career and put him in more talent shows the summer of 1995 building Usher a larger fan base and ultimately <b>putting</b> <b>more</b> confidence in L.A.
