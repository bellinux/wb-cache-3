5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Paul Neurath {{approached}} EA {{to discuss a}} port of Ultima Underworld to the <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC.</b> EA rejected the suggestion, but allowed him to look for possible developers; Neurath found that ZIO Interactive enthusiastically supported the idea, and EA eventually licensed {{the rights to the}} company. Doug Church and Floodgate Entertainment assisted with portions of its <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> development, and the port was released in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Windows Mobile {{is based}} on the Windows CE kernel and first {{appeared}} as the <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> 2000 operating system. It includes a suite of basic applications developed with the Microsoft Windows API, and is designed to have features and appearance somewhat similar to desktop versions of Windows. It allowed third party developers to develop software for Windows Mobile with no restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Software applications were purchasable from Windows Marketplace for Mobile during the service's lifespan.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version {{targeted}} at Windows XP. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
5|$|Rare co-founder Tim Stamper {{conceptualized}} a gardening {{game for}} the handheld <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> platform in 2002. A three-person team began work on a simple prototype while the company was still affiliated with Nintendo, prior to its Microsoft acquisition. Development transferred to the original Xbox and, ultimately, to the Xbox 360 for its enhanced graphical capabilities. The development team wanted its animals to have a unified style, which was how the concept artist arrived at the piñata conceit. The idea was exciting for the team, as piñatas were not commonplace in the United Kingdom. The connection between piñatas and candy-filled insides led to new gameplay directions.|$|E

5|$|Chahi {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Another Worlds intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming {{certain parts of the}} script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions. In July 2005, almost {{a decade and a half}} after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions. In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> version for Windows Mobile 5.0 OS or later in QVGA (320×240 resolution). Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio. The administrator's letter to stakeholders mentions that its assets will be sold, but does not indicate to whom or mention Another World assets by name.|$|E

Students ranging from first-quarter freshmen in English Composition to last-quarter seniors in Developmental Psychology use the <b>Pocket</b> <b>PCs</b> to respond to lectures, watch videos of laboratory procedures, and to submit writing samples for peer review. Professors using the mobile assessments can quickly gather feedback from students and pinpoint areas where further review is needed...|$|R

500|$|<b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> 2002, {{originally}} codenamed [...] "Merlin", {{was released}} in October 2001, and like <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> 2000, {{was based on the}} Windows CE 3.0 kernel.|$|E
500|$|It came in four editions: [...] "Windows Mobile 2003 for <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> Premium Edition", [...] "Windows Mobile 2003 for <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> Professional Edition", [...] "Windows Mobile 2003 for Smartphone" [...] and [...] "Windows Mobile 2003 for <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> Phone Edition". The {{last was}} {{designed}} especially for Pocket PCs which include phone functionalities. [...] The Professional Edition {{was used in}} <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> budget models. It lacked a number of features {{that were in the}} Premium Edition, such as a client for L2TP/IPsec VPNs. [...] Windows Mobile 2003 was powered by Windows CE 4.20.|$|E
500|$|Although {{targeted}} {{mainly for}} 240 × 320 (QVGA) <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> devices, <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> 2002 {{was also used}} for <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> phones, {{and for the first}} time, Smartphones. [...] These <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> 2002 Smartphones were mainly GSM devices. [...] With future releases, the <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> and Smartphone lines would increasingly collide as the licensing terms were relaxed allowing OEMs to take advantage of more innovative, individual design ideas. [...] Aesthetically, <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> 2002 was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released Windows XP. Newly added or updated programs include Windows Media Player 8 with streaming capability; MSN Messenger, and Microsoft Reader 2, with Digital rights management support. Upgrades to the bundled version of Office Mobile include a spell checker and word count tool in Pocket Word and improved Pocket Outlook. Connectivity was improved with file beaming on non-Microsoft devices such as Palm OS, the inclusion of Terminal Services and Virtual private networking support, and the ability to synchronize folders. Other upgrades include an enhanced UI with theme support and savable downloads and WAP in Pocket Internet Explorer.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pocket</b> <b>PCs</b> running prior {{versions}} of the operating system generally stored user-installed applications and data in RAM, which meant that if the battery was depleted the device would lose all of its data. Windows Mobile 5.0 solved this problem by storing all user data in persistent (flash) memory, leaving the RAM to be used only for running applications, {{as it would be}} on a desktop computer. As a result, Windows Mobile 5.0 <b>Pocket</b> <b>PCs</b> generally had more flash memory, and less RAM, compared to earlier devices.|$|R
500|$|It was {{the debut}} of what was later dubbed the Windows Mobile {{operating}} system, and {{meant to be a}} successor to the operating system aboard Palm-size PCs. [...] It retained backwards compatibility with such Palm-Size PC applications. [...] <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> 2000 was intended mainly for <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> devices; however, several Palm-Size PC devices had the ability to be updated also. [...] While, several <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> 2000 phones were released, Microsoft's smartphone hardware platform was not yet created. [...] The only resolution supported by this release was 240 x 320 (QVGA). [...] Removable storage card formats that were supported were CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard. [...] At this time <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> devices had not been standardized with a specific CPU architecture. [...] As a result, <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> 2000 was released on multiple CPU architectures; SH-3, MIPS, and ARM. Infrared (IR) File beaming capability was among the original hardware features.|$|E
500|$|Smartphones {{were the}} second {{hardware}} platform after <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> to run Windows Mobile, and debuted {{with the release}} of <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> 2002. Although in the broad sense of the term [...] "Smartphone", both <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> phones and Microsoft branded Smartphones each fit into this category, {{it should be noted that}} Microsoft's use of the term [...] "Smartphone" [...] includes only more specific hardware devices that differ from <b>Pocket</b> <b>PC</b> phones. Such Smartphones were originally designed without touchscreens, intended to be operated more efficiently with only one hand, and typically had lower display resolution than Pocket PCs. Microsoft's focus for the Smartphone platform was to create a device that functioned well as a phone and data device in a more integrated manner.|$|E
