40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational model for heat transfer in direct fired <b>pusher</b> <b>type</b> reheat <b>furnaces</b> for heating steel billets prior to plastic working. Radiation, {{which is the}} dominant mode of heat transfer in the furnace chamber, is modelled in a detailed manner. The model incorporates several features of radiation heat transfer that are typical of reheat furnaces, such as non-grey participating gas in the chamber and specular/diffuse reflection off the furnace surfaces. Radiation heat transfer in the furnace chamber and conduction within the billets are modelled using the finite volume method (FVM). Convection heat flux on the billets is calculated using correlations from the literature. Overall, the model is capable of predicting the radiative heat flux distribution within the furnace, {{as well as the}} resulting temperature distribution within the billets as they pass through various zones in the furnace. Several key process parameters have been identified, and their effects on the heating process of the billets are studied...|$|R

Though {{the quality}} of {{epitaxial}} wafer prepared by barrel <b>type</b> epitaxial <b>furnace</b> is inferior to that by traditional single wafer furnace, it has a series of advantages such as high yield and low cost. The key issues and difficulties of the epitaxy process for buried layers IC wafers prepared by barrel <b>type</b> epitaxial <b>furnace</b> were discussed. By optimizing the epitaxy process parameters and tightly controlling the production procedure such as cleaning and inspecting, barrel <b>type</b> epitaxial <b>furnace</b> can meet the special requirement for buried layer epitaxial process. The characteristics of the epilayers prepared by barrel <b>type</b> epitaxial <b>furnace</b> were close or equivalent to that by single wafer furnace.

50|$|Friction-disc {{clutches}} {{generally are}} classified as <b>push</b> <b>type</b> or pull type depending on {{the location of the}} pressure plate fulcrum points. In a pull-type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal pulls the release bearing, pulling on the diaphragm spring and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a <b>push</b> <b>type,</b> the release bearing is pushed into the clutch disengaging the vehicle drive. In this instance, the release bearing can be known as a thrust bearing (as per the image above).|$|R
