5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils {{as a tool for}} measuring electric and magnetic <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{is thought}} to consist of a dense core {{with a mixture of}} elements, a {{surrounding}} layer of liquid metallic hydrogen with some helium, and an outer layer predominantly of molecular hydrogen. Beyond this basic outline, there is still considerable uncertainty. The core is often described as rocky, but its detailed composition is unknown, as are the <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> at the temperatures and pressures of those depths (see below). In 1997, the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements, indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times that of Earth, or roughly 4%–14% of the total mass of Jupiter. The presence of a core during at least part of Jupiter's history is suggested by models of planetary formation that require the formation of a rocky or icy core massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the protosolar nebula. Assuming it did exist, it may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mixed with the molten core and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior. A core may now be entirely absent, as gravitational measurements are not yet precise enough to rule that possibility out entirely.|$|E

The basic mechanical <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> (such as elastic modulus, yield strength, ultimate strength, TEI (total elongation index) and EIU (elongation index of uniform)) with different spacing between neighbored heating-lines and different heating-lines number are presented. The stress-strain curves are complied with a modified Swift law, where the hardening coefficient and {{strain hardening exponent}} <b>of</b> <b>material</b> are controlled by strain. The influence of heating-lines number on tensional mechanical <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> is {{greater than that of}} the spacing between neighbored heating-lines.

25|$|Empirically based {{temperature}} scales rely {{directly on}} measurements of simple physical <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials.</b> For example, {{the length of}} a column of mercury, confined in a glass-walled capillary tube, is dependent largely on temperature, and is the basis of the very useful mercury-in-glass thermometer. Such scales are valid only within convenient ranges of temperature. For example, above the boiling point of mercury, a mercury-in-glass thermometer is impracticable. Most materials expand with temperature increase, but some materials, such as water, contract with temperature increase over some specific range, and then they are hardly useful as thermometric materials. A material is of no use as a thermometer near one of its phase-change temperatures, for example its boiling-point.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of ITER {{emphasize}} {{that the only way}} to test ideas for withstanding the intense neutron flux is to experimentally subject materials to that flux, which is one of the primary missions of ITER and the IFMIF, and both facilities will be vitally important to that effort. The purpose of ITER is to explore the scientific and engineering questions that surround potential fusion power stations. It is nearly impossible to acquire satisfactory data for the <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> expected to be subject to an intense neutron flux, and burning plasmas are expected to have quite different properties from externally heated plasmas.

500|$|Since {{neutrons}} are neutral particles, they do {{not have}} to overcome Coulomb repulsion as they approach charged targets, as experienced by protons or alpha particles. Neutrons can deeply penetrate matter. [...] The magnetic moment of the neutron has therefore been exploited to probe the properties of matter using scattering or diffraction techniques. These methods provide information that is complementary to X-ray spectroscopy. In particular, the magnetic moment of the neutron is used to determine magnetic <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> at length scales of 1–100Å using cold or thermal neutrons.

500|$|In 1767, the 700-page The History and Present State of Electricity was {{published}} to positive reviews. The {{first half of}} the text is a history of the study of electricity to 1766; the second and more influential half is a description of contemporary theories about electricity and suggestions for future research. Priestley reported some of his own discoveries in the second section, such as the conductivity of charcoal and other substances and the continuum between conductors and non-conductors. This discovery overturned what he described as [...] "one of the earliest and universally received maxims of electricity", that only water and metals could conduct electricity. This and other experiments on the electrical <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and on the electrical effects of chemical transformations demonstrated Priestley's early and ongoing interest in the relationship between chemical substances and electricity. Based on experiments with charged spheres, Priestley {{was among the first to}} propose that electrical force followed an inverse-square law, similar to Newton's law of universal gravitation.May we not infer from this experiment, that the attraction of electricity is subject to the same laws with that of gravitation, and is therefore according to the squares of the distances; since it is easily demonstrated, that were the earth in the form of a shell, a body in the inside of it would not be attracted to one side more than another? However, he did not generalise or elaborate on this, and the general law was enunciated by French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in the 1780s.|$|E
