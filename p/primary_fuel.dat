2500|$|Beryllium {{toxicity}} - The proposed salt mixture FLiBe, contains {{large amounts}} of beryllium, which is toxic to humans (although nowhere near as toxic as the fission products and other radioactives). The salt in the primary cooling loops must be isolated from workers and the environment to prevent beryllium poisoning. This is routinely done in industry. Based on this industrial experience, the added cost of beryllium safety is expected to cost only $0.12/MWh. After start up, the fission process in the <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> salt produces highly radioactive fission products with a high gamma and neutron radiation field. Effective containment is therefore a primary requirement. It is possible to operate instead using lithium fluoride-thorium fluoride eutectic without beryllium, as the French LFTR design, the [...] "TMSR", has chosen. This comes {{at the cost of}} a somewhat higher melting point, but has the additional advantages of simplicity (avoiding [...] in the reprocessing systems), increased solubility for plutonium-trifluoride, reduced tritium production (beryllium produces lithium-6, which in turn produces tritium) and improved heat transfer ( [...] increases the viscosity of the salt mixture).

Engine trials were made at 100 % and 40 % loads (power outputs) with varying amounts of high octane fuels up-to the maximum possible limit. The performance and emission characteristics of the engine were obtained and analysed. Results indicated significant improvement in brake thermal efficiency simultaneous reduction in smoke and NO emissions in dual fuel operation with all the inducted fuels.
