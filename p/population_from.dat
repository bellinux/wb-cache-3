40|$|RFLP {{analysis}} of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{was used to}} study variation within 13 populations of #Clarias batrachus$, sampled respectively in Vietnam, Thailand and in the Indonesian Archipelago. In this study an amplified region corresponding approximately to 2. 3 kilobases of the Cytochrome-b and D-loop genes was digested using 8 restriction enzymes (HinfI, Hin 6 I, MvaI, MspI, HaeIII, BanHI, NdeII, DraI). 12 mtDNA haplotypes were found in 40 specimens. Each sampling location was characterised by one haplotype, except Palembang (Sumatra, Indonesia) and Samarinda (Kalimantan, Indonesia) where 2 and 4 haplotypes were found respectively. The consensus tree calculated from 15 more parsimonious networks showed that mtDNA haplotypes are geographically distributed. Three well differentiated clusters were identified. The first cluster is composed by <b>populations</b> <b>from</b> both Thailand and Vietnam, the second cluster by two <b>populations</b> <b>from</b> West Sumatra between <b>populations</b> which come <b>from</b> highlands (altiude more than 1000 meters in Bukittingui, and 300 meters in Nias Island) and populations located in lowlands. The significant genetic relatedness observed between <b>populations</b> <b>from</b> Sumatra (Jambi, Palembang, Muara Tebo, Teluk Kuantan) and <b>populations</b> <b>from</b> Java indicate a possible common origin which is probably in Kalimantan.

40|$|Echinochloa crus-galli is an {{important}} maize weed with significant variation in herbicide sensitivity. This differential response may reflect differences in selection pressure caused by years of cropping system-related herbicide usage. The herbicide sensitivity of E. crus-galli <b>populations</b> <b>from</b> three divergent cropping systems was evaluated in dose-response pot experiments. <b>Populations</b> were collected <b>from</b> sandy fields with (i) a long-term organic cropping system, (ii) a conventional cropping system with maize in the crop rotation or (iii) a conventional cropping system with long-term monocropping of maize. Each cropping system was represented by six E. crus-galli populations. The effectiveness of three foliar-applied maize herbicides (nicosulfuron, cycloxydim and topramezone) and two soil-applied maize herbicides (S-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P) was tested at three doses and two runs. Foliar-applied herbicides were applied at the three true leaves stage. Soil-applied herbicides were applied immediately after sowing. The foliage dry weight per pot was determined 4 weeks after treatment. Plant responses were expressed as biomass reduction. Herbicide sensitivity was consistently lowest for <b>populations</b> <b>from</b> maize monocropping systems.
