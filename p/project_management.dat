5|$|Instead of {{directly}} {{ordering the}} aircraft from McDonnell Douglas, the Australian Government purchased its F/A-18s through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Ordering the aircraft via the US Government allowed the RAAF {{to take advantage}} of the superior purchasing power of the US military, and reduced the service's <b>project</b> <b>management</b> requirements. This led to a complicated arrangement whereby the aircraft were ordered by the US Government, delivered to the US Navy, and then transferred to the RAAF once initial flight testing had taken place.

5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting requirements and poor <b>project</b> <b>management</b> by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include requirements beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without regard for costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' final price and delivery schedule. The Navy's failure to maintain control of the design requirements and make cost-performance trade-offs {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E

The differences from the F-111A caused it to be designated the F-111C in 1966.|$|E

Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate Administrator D.

Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth) Marshall Space Flight Center (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.|$|E

5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and <b>project</b> <b>management.</b> Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and <b>project</b> <b>management,</b> through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E
5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features â€“ such as the gatehouses â€“ are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger <b>project</b> <b>management</b> function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E
5|$|In April 2016, {{after missing}} the initial October 2015 deadline, Caltrain {{requested}} {{a third party}} review of the CBOSS project from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). APTA noted that Caltrain was not effectively managing the project schedule and cost because of generally poor communication between Caltrain's <b>project</b> <b>management</b> and Parsons, and Caltrain's project manager {{did not have the}} technical experience or authority to resolve technical and contractual issues with Parsons. In February 2017, Caltrain terminated its contract with Parsons for failure to perform on time and budget and announced potential litigation. Parsons filed suit on February 22, saying delays were due to changing client requirements and circumstances beyond their control. Caltrain filed suit a week later, seeking $98million in damages; although the system has been mostly installed, testing is still incomplete.|$|E
