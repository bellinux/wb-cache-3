40|$|The novel {{consumables}} studied were abrasive-free copper CMP slurries and high-pressure {{micro jet}} technology {{as an alternative}} to diamond pad conditioning. Abrasive-free slurries were found to be effective in copper removal and were shown to demonstrate similar removal rate and coefficient of friction (COF) trends as conventional abrasive slurry CMP, while possibly decreasing wafer defects. Fundamental information from the friction spectrum indicated that the periodicity of the cyclic passivation layer formation and removal in copper CMP may be on the order of 10 milliseconds. HPMJ technology was found to be a possible alternative to diamond conditioning with some decrease in removal rate. A controlled atmosphere <b>polishing</b> (<b>CAP)</b> system was used and demonstrated that gaseous additives can feasibly be introduced real-time during a polish. Addition of complexing agents were found to increase removal rates, however it was found that direct etching of copper oxide on the copper surface was not the primary mechanism responsible for removal rate increases during CMP with low oxidant concentrations. Alternatively, it was found that direct etching of the copper oxide is significant in systems containing much higher oxidant concentrations, 1 wt% hydrogen peroxide for example. It was for this reason that a third removal step, chemical dissolution, was added to the two-step removal rate model. The remainder of the work in this dissertation was concerned with characterizing and modeling the copper oxidation and copper oxide dissolution steps of the three-step model separately and applying the appropriate expressions into the CMP removal rate model. The copper oxidation process was found to demonstrate oxide growth, or passivation behavior, at pH of 5 and higher. The oxide growth process was governed by oxidized copper migration through the oxide film. The copper oxide dissolution process was controlled by dissolution of the complexing agent through a dissolution byproduct film. These steps were characterized and applied to the three-step removal rate and predicted removal rate data quite well with one fitting parameter that varied within one order of magnitude. Two real-time experimental measurements, COF and leading pad temperature, can be input into the model to predict removal rates during a polish...|$|E
50|$|Uhlans {{typically}} wore a double-breasted jacket (kurtka) with a coloured panel (plastron) at the front, a coloured sash, and a square-topped <b>Polish</b> lancer <b>cap</b> (rogatywka, {{also called}} czapka). This cap or cavalry helmet {{was derived from}} a traditional design of <b>Polish</b> <b>cap,</b> made more formal and stylised for military use. Their lances usually had small, swallow-tailed flags (known as the lance pennon) just below the spearhead.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Julep {{launched}} its Plié Wand, an ergonomic nail polishing brush that bends, pivots, and {{attaches to the}} top of nail <b>polish</b> <b>caps.</b> Demand for the wand was first tested through a $75,000 crowdfunding campaign.|$|R
50|$|Lancers {{typically}} wore a double-breasted jacket (kurtka) with a coloured panel (plastron) at the front, a coloured sash, and a square-topped <b>Polish</b> <b>cap</b> (czapka). Their lances {{usually had}} small swallow-tailed flags (known as the lance pennon) {{just below the}} spearhead. The pennons were normally removed or wrapped in a canvas cover on active service. With the improved range and accuracy of infantry rifles, the high-profile presented by lancers with their conspicuous weapons became a problem. The ułans or uhlans, as lancers are known in the Polish and German languages respectively, were trained to lower their lances when scouting on hill-tops.|$|R
50|$|Internally the {{planning}} {{of the house is}} compact. The scale is successful giving the interiors a quality of amplitude despite their tight planning. The functionalist character is continued inside with elements and detailing such as the open stairwell with solid balustrading and <b>polished</b> timber <b>capping</b> surmounted by decorative curved chrome plated railings.|$|R
50|$|Especially British, {{after the}} Battle of Albuera, where the 1st Vistulan Lancers Regiment {{virtually}} annihilated {{three of four}} Colborne Brigade regiments, captured the Vistulan lancers' equipment together with their uniforms, and even a square-topped <b>Polish</b> lancer <b>cap.</b> These British lancers could still be seen even during the famous Charge of the Light Brigade in Crimea half a century later.|$|R
5000|$|He {{joined the}} Polish Resistance in August 1944 when the Warsaw Uprising broke out and was {{recruited}} by Stefan and Zofia Korbonski to prepare English dispatches that were transmitted to London via Morse Code. He prepared 64 eyewitness {{reports of the}} fighting as a war correspondent (behind enemy lines) for London's The Times. Ward participated in the clandestine activities of the Polish resistance movement's [...] "Błyskawica" [...] (Lighting) radio station during the uprising, airing the English-language broadcasts, in addition to contributing over 100 reports. He spoke Polish with a heavy accent. Despite the risk of execution if he was captured Ward wore the red and white armband and the <b>Polish</b> <b>cap</b> eagle of the Polish Home Army. He was wounded in action in the thigh by mortar shrapnel; the Polish force decorated him with the Cross of Valour for his bravery, awarded personally by General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski.|$|R

At the time the building was completed, it featured the largest plate-glass windows in Los Angeles.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{look up from}} my desk, I see Tunbridge Wells Common and the rocks, {{the strange}} {{familiar}} place which I remember forty years ago. Boys saunter over the green with stumps and cricket-bats. Other boys gallop by on the riding-master's hacks. I protest it is Cramp, Riding master, {{as it used to}} be in the reign of George IV., and that Centaur Cramp must be at least a hundred years old. Yonder comes a footman with a bundle of novels from the library. Are they as good as OUR novels? Oh! how delightful they were! Shades of Valancour, awful ghost of Manfroni, how I shudder at your appearance! Sweet image of Thaddeus of Warsaw, how often has this almost infantile hand tried to depict you in a <b>Polish</b> <b>cap</b> and richly embroidered tights! And as for Corinthian Tom in light blue pantaloons and Hessians, and Jerry Hawthorn from the country, can all the fashion, can all the splendor of real life which these eyes have subsequently beheld, can all the wit I have heard or read in later times, compare with your fashion, with your brilliancy, with your delightful grace, and sparkling vivacious rattle? ...|$|R
5000|$|The Polish {{equivalent}} is generał dywizji (literally, [...] "general of division").

50|$|The custom bottle {{design was}} created by {{designers}} Brian Adducci and Dan Baggenstoss of the Minneapolis design firm CAPSULE. It is uniquely flat and rectangular, unlike virtually any spirit container on the market, made from high-end French crystal, laser engraved custom calligraphy with 18th-century Slovakian poetry {{on the back and}} the Double Cross logo on the front, and topped with a heavy <b>polished</b> metal snap-on <b>cap.</b> The Double Cross name acknowledged the brand's heritage from the cross found in the Slovak flag and coat of arms.|$|R
60|$|There {{is a kind}} lady in the neighbourhood, {{who takes}} in {{dressmaking}} for the neighbouring maid-servants, and has a small establishment of lollipops, theatrical characters, and ginger-beer for the boys in Little Craggs Buildings, hard by the Running Footman public-house, where father and other gentlemen's gentlemen have their club: this good soul also sells Sunday newspapers to the footmen of the neighbouring gentry; and besides, has a stock of novels for the ladies of the upper servants' table. Next to Miss Cann, Miss Flinders is John James's greatest friend and benefactor. She has remarked {{him when he was}} quite a little man, and used to bring his father's beer of a Sunday. Out of her novels he has taught himself to read, dull boy at the day-school though he was, and always the last in his class, there. Hours, happy hours, has he spent cowering behind her counter, or hugging her books under his pinafore when he had leave to carry them home. The whole library has passed through his hands, his long, lean, tremulous hands, and under his eager eyes. He has made illustrations to every one of those books, and been frightened at his own pictures of Manfroni or the One-handed Monk, Abellino the Terrific Bravo of Venice, and Rinaldo Rinaldini Captain of Robbers. How he has blistered Thaddeus of Warsaw with his tears, and drawn him in his <b>Polish</b> <b>cap,</b> and tights, and Hessians! William Wallace, the Hero of Scotland, how nobly he has depicted him! With what whiskers and bushy ostrich plumes!--in a tight kilt, and with what magnificent calves to his legs, laying about him with his battle-axe, and bestriding the bodies of King Edward's prostrate cavaliers! At this time Mr. Honeyman comes to lodge in Walpole Street, and brings a set of Scott's novels, for which he subscribed when at Oxford; and young John James, who at first waits upon him and does little odd jobs for the reverend gentleman, lights upon the volumes, and reads them with such a delight and passion of pleasure as all the delights of future days will scarce equal. A fool, is he?--an idle feller, out of whom no good will ever come, as his father says. There was a time when, in despair of any better chance for him, his parents thought of apprenticing him to a tailor, and John James was waked up from a dream of Rebecca and informed of the cruelty meditated against him. I forbear to describe the tears and terror, and frantic desperation in which the poor boy was plunged. Little Miss Cann rescued him from that awful board, and Honeyman likewise interceded for him, and Mr. Bagshot promised that, as soon as his party came in, he would ask the Minister for a tide-waitership for him; for everybody liked the solemn, soft-hearted, willing little lad, and no one knew him less than his pompous and stupid and respectable father.|$|R
50|$|And {{then there}} is what may be called the Distorted Documentary {{a new form of}} visionary art, admirably {{exemplified}} by Mr. Francis Thompson’s film, NY, NY. In this very strange and beautiful picture we see the city of New York as it appears when photographed through multiplying prisms, or reflected in the backs of spoons, <b>polished</b> hub <b>caps,</b> spherical and parabolic mirrors. We still recognize houses, people, shop fronts, taxicabs, but recognize them as elements in one of those living geometries which are so characteristic of the visionary experience. The invention of this new cinematographic art seems to presage (thank heaven!) the supersession and early demise of non-representational painting. It used to be said by the non-representationalists that colored photography had reduced the old-fashioned portrait and the old-fashioned landscape to the rank of otiose absurdities. This, of course, is completely untrue. Colored photography merely records and preserves, in an easily reproducible form, the raw materials with which portraitists and landscape painters work. Used as Mr. Thompson has used it, colored cinematography does much more than merely record and preserve the raw materials of non-representational art; it actually turns out the finished product. Looking at NY, NY, I was amazed to see that virtually every pictorial device invented by the old masters of non-representational art and reproduced ad nauseam by the academicians and mannerists of the school, for the last forty years or more, makes its appearance, alive, glowing, intensely significant, in the sequences of Mr. Thompson’s film.|$|R
60|$|Almost all who {{had entered}} the castle had brought with them a supply of herbs and vegetables; these, with a handful or two of coarsely-ground meal boiled into broth, {{constituted}} their usual fare, {{and the addition of}} a portion of meat afforded them great satisfaction. Some of the men were still asleep, in preparation for a long night's work; others were standing about talking in little groups; some were on the walls watching with gloomy faces the smoke wreaths that still rose from what had been their homes. Ducks, geese, and hens walked about unconcernedly looking for any stray grains that had passed unnoticed when they had last been fed, and a chorus of dissatisfied grunting arose from the pigs that had a large pen in the yard next to the huts. These were still smarting under a sense of injury excited not only by their removal from their familiar haunts, but by {{the fact that most of}} them had been hastily marked by a clipping of some kind in the ear in order to enable their owners to distinguish them from the others. Boys were carrying buckets of water from a well in the court-yard to the troughs for the cattle and horses, and the men-at-arms were cleaning their armour and <b>polishing</b> their steel <b>caps.</b>|$|R
50|$|In September 1942 Grimson {{made his}} first solo escape attempt when {{he noticed that the}} German in charge of the stores where he helped out, looked very similar to himself. Grimson stole the German corporal’s pay book and camp pass and smuggled them into the camp for the prisoner's forgery {{department}} to quickly copy them so he could get them replaced before the soldier noticed. A copy of a German fatigue uniform was made for him with German badges, a leather belt and a pistol holder made from cardboard stained brown with boot <b>polish.</b> An RAF <b>cap</b> was adjusted to resemble the German version to complete the disguise. Dressed up he walked to the camp gate where the sentry opened the gate hardly looking at his papers and let him through reaching the outer gate the guard took {{a quick look at the}} papers and let him pass through. Grimson’s pass would not let him out of the main gate until darkness so he hid for 6 hours and escaped through the gate by the officer’s mess and into the woods where changed into his civilian outfit and made straight for the railway station. His papers passed scrutiny and he then purchased a ticket to a point on his journey to the Swiss border. His papers were checked at the next stop and he was arrested and returned to prison camp.|$|R
