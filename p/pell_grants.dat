40|$|We use {{regression}} discontinuity and regression kink {{designs to}} estimate the impact of need-based grant aid on the borrowing and educational attainment {{of students enrolled in}} a large public university system. <b>Pell</b> <b>Grant</b> aid substantially reduces borrowing: among students who would borrow {{in the absence of a}} <b>Pell</b> <b>Grant,</b> every dollar of <b>Pell</b> <b>Grant</b> aid crowds-out over $ 1. 80 of loans. A simple model illustrates that our findings are consistent with students facing a fixed cost of incurring debt. The presence of such a fixed cost may lead to the unintended consequence of additional grant aid decreasing some students’ attainment. Empirically, we rule out all but modest average impacts of <b>Pell</b> <b>Grant</b> aid on attainment, and we provide suggestive evidence of heterogeneous effects consistent with our fixed-borrowing-cost model. We estimate an augmented Tobit model with random censoring thresholds to allow for heterogeneous fixed borrowing costs, and find that eliminating the fixed cost would increase borrowing by over 250 percent...|$|R

The report chronicled an increase in average indebtedness from an average of $2,000 in 1980–81 to over $25,000 in 2009, as well as substantial decreases in Federal aid and <b>Pell</b> <b>grants</b> during that time period.|$|E

Democrats have the long-term aim of having low-cost, publicly funded college education with low tuition fees (like in much of Europe and Canada), which {{should be available to}} every eligible American student.
