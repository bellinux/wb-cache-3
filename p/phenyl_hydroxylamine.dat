40|$|SUMMARY-In the {{presence}} of yeast enzyme concentrate or purified yeast pyruvate decarboxylase, nitrosobenzene was con-verted in part to N-phenylacetohydroxamic acid. This transfor-mation had to be catalyzed by the enzyme, since the incuba-tion of nitrosobenzene with the cofactor of pyruvate decarboxylase did not produce the hydroxamic acid. Similar in-cubations conducted with <b>phenyl</b> <b>hydroxylamine</b> did not yield any detectable amounts of N-phenylacetohydroxamic acid. -J Natl Cancer Inst 55 : 1247 - 1248, 1975. Previously we reported that a-hydroxyethylthiamine (I) converts nitrosobenzene (II) to N-phenylaceto-hydroxamic acid (III) in basic media (1). The structures of the three compounds are shown in text-figure 1. Since I is the reactive intermediate for several important en-zymes involved in sugar metabolism (2), we speculate...|$|E
40|$|Voltammetric {{studies of}} {{nitrobenzene}} reduction on Cu, glassy carbon (GC) and Pb electrodes {{were carried out}} {{with a view to}} ascertaLi the choice of cathode material for p-aminophenol synthesis. Lead was found to give irreproducible responses due to some electrochemical mixed potential processes. However, on Cu and GC electrodes, the electroreduction was found to stop at the four electron stage in the first peak potential region which indeed is the condition required for phenylhydroxylamine formation. This conclusion was drawn based on voltammetric peak current calculations as well as the comparative voltammetric studies of nitrobenzene and p- nitrophenol which is known to follow a 6 electron path. Comparing the voltammetric curves on Cu and GC for nitrobenzene in alcoholic Hz SO 4 medium, it is noticed that the hydrogen evolution process starts at much more positive potentials on Cu as compared to GC. Since further reduction of <b>phenyl</b> <b>hydroxylamine</b> to the aniline along with Hz evolution would also occur on Cu, it is concluded that carbon electrode would be a better choice for p-aminophenol synthesi...|$|E
40|$|Oxenium ions {{are poorly}} {{understood}} reactive intermediates of the formula R-O+. This {{body of work}} is an accumulated computational and experimental investigation into understanding the electronic configuration, spectroscopic signatures, spin-selective reactivity, and lifetimes of these short-lived intermediates. Chapter 1 overviews our attempts to find a photochemical precursor to oxenium ions, which ultimately led to the first direct detection of the short-lived parent phenyloxenium ion. Laser flash photolysis studies were performed on the <b>phenyl</b> <b>hydroxylamine</b> tetrafluoroborate salt to form the singlet phenyloxenium ion. These studies were performed by Jiadan Xue in the lab of Dr. David Lee Phillips. The lifetime for the phenyloxenium ion {{was found to be}} about 5 ns. Product studies from both thermolysis and photolysis with added traps suggest the formation of the phenyloxenium ion along with the phenoxy radical. In order to better understand the effect of structure on the electronic configuration of oxenium ions, Chapter 2 provides an in depth study of heteroaryl oxenium ions by high-level multireference CASSCF/CASPT 2 calculations. 4 -pyridinyl, pyrizidinyl, and pyrimidyl oxenium ions all have singlet-triplet gaps (ΔEST) of less than - 4 kcal/mol, showing significantly changed electronics from the parent phenyloxenium ion. This small gap suggests the possibility that triplet states as well as open shell singlet states could be chemically relevant to these intermediates. In chapter 3, the synthesis of a photochemical precursor to the p-biphenylyl oxenium ion is described, and the ultrafast LFP experiments performed by Mingde Li in the lab of Dr. David Lee Phillips on this precursor suggest photolysis leads to the p-biphenylyl radical, as well as the p-biphenylyl oxenium ion as a closed shell singlet, open shell singlet, and a triplet state. Chapter 4 describes the synthesis of a photoprecursor to the m-dimethylamino phenyloxenium ion, which is computed to have a triplet ground state (+ 12 kcal/mol, B 3 LYP/cc-PVTZ). Photolysis of this precursor was studied using product studies as well as by matrix isolation EPR studies. The results obtained by matrix isolated EPR provide evidence that the ground state of the m-dimethylamino phenyloxenium ion is a ground state triplet...|$|E

The influence of calcium dipicrylamine on metabolism of Chlorella and some other aquatic and terrestrial plants was therefore studied. It inhibited photosynthesis even at lower concentrations (10 - 6 - 10 - 5 M), than other inhibitors such as ethyl urethane, <b>phenyl</b> urethane, <b>hydroxylamine,</b> 2, 4 -dinitrophenol and sodium azide. Autotrophic growth was inhibited at almost the same concentration. But heterotrophic growth of Chlorella was less inhibited. Respiration was stimulated by up to 60 %, even at 10 - 2 M. At this concentration, glucose-stimulated respiration was 50 % inhibited but at least partly reversibly. The same degree of inhibition (not reversible by washing) was observed with light saturation as with light limitation in Chlorella photosynthesis. This suggested a specific enzyme- inhibitor, influencing certain dark reactions {{as well as the}} energy transfer in photosynthesis. Lower temperatures severely increased inhibition of photosynthesis in Chlorella. Despite inhibition of growth and photosynthesis at low concentrations in water culture, the compound was less harmful in the field through the high adsorptive capacity of soil, especially of humus. Only with extreme artificial contamination was there a decrease in yield. <p/...|$|R

40|$|Two {{series of}} novel non acidic 3, 5 -diarylpyrazoline and 3, 5 diarylisoxazoline {{derivatives}} {{were designed to}} be synthesized and screened for anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. In addition, molecular modelling and docking of the designed compounds into cyclooxygenase II (COX-II) using Molsoft ICM 3. 4 - 8 C program was performed in order to predict the affinity and orientation of the designed compounds at the active site compared with its binding inhibitor celecoxib. The ICM score values show good agreement with predicted binding affinities, where all the designed compounds exhibit ICM score values (range from - 88. 89 to - 70. 40) less than celecoxib (- 60. 71) revealing higher binding affinity with the enzyme. Accordingly, synthesis of the designed compounds via reaction of various propenone derivatives with hydrazine hydrate, <b>phenyl</b> hydrazine or <b>hydroxylamine</b> hydrochlorides were carried out. Evaluation of their activity as anti-inflammatory and analgesics using dextran-induced rat paw edema, formaldehyde arthritis test and paw pressure test, respectively {{and their ability to}} induce gastric toxicity was also estimated. All the synthesized compounds exhibited significant activity as anti-inflammatory and analgesic, where compounds 2 and 8 were the most active as anti-inflammatory in dextran-induced rat paw edema, while compounds 7 and 10 were the most active as anti-inflammatory in formaldehyde-induced arthritis rat paw edema test. All compounds showed analgesic activity with the most potent compounds were 3, and 10 were the most active. No one of the tested compounds cause gastric toxicity. We can conclude that the synthesized compounds proved a successful hit and seem potentially attractive as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. Cairo universit...|$|R

(some col.) 29 cmSeveral {{groups of}} chemicals {{are known to}} react with DNA. Some of these are known mutagens while others are potential carcinogens. In this work, {{an attempt was made}} to observe if such reactions were random or if indeed there are preferred bases / sequences where adduct formation occurs. A simple model was used for this work in which the DNA chain synthesis is terminated when the Sequenase™ enzyme reaches an adduct. The DNA used was M 13 mp 18 (7. 30 kilobases). This DNA is available from commercial sources in either the single or the double stranded circular form. The reactions were carried out with chloroacetaldehyde, or with the methyl, ethyl and propyl derivatives of N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, or with 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine, <b>phenyl</b> hydrazine, <b>hydroxylamine</b> hydrochloride, hydrazine hydrate or with methyl methanesulfonate. Position 81 (thymidine) was found to be a common fall off point. with all these chemicals. The other positions of fall off had some overlap but each chemical class had a unique adduct pattern. The methyl, ethyl and propyl derivatives of N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine had the same positions of chain termination. Varying the salt concentration had a significant effect on the number of adducts formed when M 13 mp 18 DNA was reacted with chloroacetaldehyde. A large number of termination points were observed in the presence of 100 mM sodium acetate. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine if in fact the chloroacetaldehyde was reacting with the DNA or if the mutagen merely prevented the enzyme from acting in the labeling step. It was found that the chloroacetaldehyde reacted with the DNA both in the single and the double stranded forms. Both the absorption and the fluorescence spectra indicated this and that nearly every base was adducted in most of the experiments reported here. Chloroacetaldehyde was also found to affect the Sequenase™ enzyme causing additional points of chain termination when it was added in the labeling step. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed that chloroacetaldehyde did not alter the migration pattern of either M 13 mp 18 single or double stranded DNA or of the Hind III linear double stranded mixture. No evidence of hydrolysis was obtained. The ratio of supercoiled / relaxed forms of the double stranded M 13 mp 18 DNA was not altered by the chloroacetaldehyde treatment. The adducted DNA sequenced {{in the same way as}} the non reacted but there were some 'blank' reactions in the sequencing lanes of the former...|$|R
