40|$|The wheat aphids, Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus) and Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), are key pests on wheat crops worldwide. Management {{practices}} rely {{primarily on}} insecticides. The <b>pirimicarb</b> (carbamate) is used extensively {{as an effective}} insecticide to control these two aphids. In addition to the mortality caused by <b>pirimicarb,</b> various sublethal effects may occur in aphids when exposed to low lethal or sublethal doses. Understanding the general effect of <b>pirimicarb</b> on aphids could help increasing rational use of this insecticide. Under laboratory conditions, we assessed the sublethal effects of a low lethal concentration of <b>pirimicarb</b> (LC 25) on biological traits and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of R. padi and S. avenae. Both direct and transgenerational effects, i. e. on parent and the F 1 generations were assessed, respectively. We found that R. padi and S. avenae responded differentially to the LC 25 of <b>pirimicarb.</b> The parent generation of R. padi showed a 39 % decrease in fecundity and multiple transgenerational effects were observed in the F 1 generation; overall juvenile development, reproductive period, adult longevity and lifespan were longer {{than those of the}} control group. By contrast, LC 25 of <b>pirimicarb</b> showed almost no effects on S. avenae biological traits in both the parent and F 1 generations; only the pre-reproductive duration was reduced in F 1 generations.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate short-term and long-term effects of single pulse exposures of the organophosphate insecticide malathion and the carbamate insecticide <b>pirimicarb.</b> Acute toxicity tests were performed in order to evaluate effects of <b>pirimicarb</b> and malathion on daphnids, the endpoint being immobilization. The estimated EC 50 - 48 h of malathion and <b>pirimicarb</b> was used to determine the single pulse concentrations to be used in the single pulse exposure experiments which lasted for 21 days. The hypothesis for the pulse exposure experiments was that if the Area Under the Curve (the exposure time x concentration product) was the same for the treatments with either malathion or <b>pirimicarb,</b> the effects would be similar. The endpoints for the single pulse exposure experiments were growth, time to first offspring and the number of living offspring. D. magna (age < 24 h) were exposed to equal integrated pulses (the Area Under the Curve was kept constant) with malathion in nominal concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 8. 0 µg/L for 48, 24 and 3 hours exposure, respectively. For <b>pirimicarb</b> exposure nominal concentrations were 7. 5, 15 and 120 µg/L for 48, 24 and 3 hours exposures, respectively. Based on the pulse experiments with <b>pirimicarb</b> and malathion, it was found, that the chosen concentrations and exposure periods resulted in a significant effect on the average number of offspring pr. test animal compared to the controls. There were no differences in average number of offspring between long pulse exposure with high concentration and short pulse exposure with low concentration for both malathion and <b>pirimicarb.</b> The treatments with malathion, resulted in no significant change in the growth, whereas 2 of the three treatments with <b>pirimicarb</b> gave a significantly poorer growth of D. magna compared to the controls.

In this study EC 50 values for immobilization of H. azteca were found at 2486. 30 µg/L likewise an EC 50 value for D. magna were found at 1. 12 µg/L. This leads {{to a discussion of}} the validity of using only one model organism per trophic level in ecotoxicology when two relatively similar species can exhibit such different reactions towards the same insecticide. To investigate the low sensitivity of H. azteca further, the effect of <b>Pirimicarb</b> on AChE and CbE in H. azteca was investigated by conducting a two-pulse experiment during two integrated concentrations, high concentration during 4 hours and low concentration during 48 hours.

40|$|The {{presence}} of organic micro-pollutants in aquatic systems and drinking water {{is of concern}} in most highly populated regions of the planet. Extensive surveys of major river systems in Europe and the United States have measured {{a wide array of}} organic contaminants including industrial chemicals, surfactants, pharmaceuticals and pesticides. The European Union’s Water Framework Directive – aimed at achieving good environmental quality of surface waters at the catchment level - has a series of environmental quality standards that must not be exceeded {{for a wide range of}} water pollutants, including pesticides and other organic contaminants. To meet these demands and challenges of higher water quality, Arvia Technology Ltd. have developed a novel water treatment process known as the Arvia™ Process. The Arvia Process combines adsorption with in-situ electrochemical regeneration which leads to the electrochemical oxidation of the adsorbed organic contaminant. The aim of the present study was to test the individual stages of the Arvia Process, namely adsorption and electrochemical regeneration of the proprietary adsorbent Nyex™, for its ability to remove and treat two current-use pesticides, atrazine and <b>pirimicarb,</b> at trace level concentrations. Initial adsorption kinetic and isotherm studies indicated that the adsorbent, Nyex, could successfully remove both atrazine and <b>pirimicarb</b> when dissolved in water. This indicated that atrazine and <b>pirimicarb</b> could therefore potentially be removed using a combined adsorption and electrochemical process. During electrochemical regeneration of the adsorbent, ideally the adsorbed organic contaminant should remain adsorbed onto the sorbent and be fully oxidised to H 2 O, CO 2 and inorganic ions. However, in the present study during electrochemical regeneration, adsorbate molecules desorbed from the Nyex surface and were subsequently transferred back into solution. However, some treatment was observed as evidenced by the formation of degradation products. Two atrazine degradation products were formed and were tentatively identified as deethyl-deisopropyl-atrazine and 4 -ethylimino- 6 -isopropylamino-s-triazine. One <b>pirimicarb</b> degradation product was formed and was tentatively identified as 2 -methylamino- 5, 6 -dimethylpyrimidin- 4 -yl-dimethylcarbamate. Since there were only slight modifications to the structures of the original parent compounds, this indicated that the compounds were only partially oxidised. This may be the result of indirect electrochemical oxidation in the liquid phase as during this study there was desorption of the pollutants. This investigation revealed that under the experimental conditions used in the present study electrochemical oxidation could not effectively remove and treat atrazine and <b>pirimicarb</b> at trace level concentrations. The experimental conditions used were likely responsible for the desorption of atrazine and <b>pirimicarb</b> thereby making the assessment of the performance of the system difficult.

Two MLGs presented > 20 -fold resistance to <b>pirimicarb,</b> which was associated with the MACE mutation in the heterozygous condition. The kdr mutation was found in only four MLGs in the heterozygous condition and they showed resistance ratios (RR) to cyfluthrin of less than sevenfold. The super kdr mutation was not detected. Enhanced carboxyl esterase activity was predominantly found in the susceptible (S) to first level of resistance (R- 1) with RR to metamidophos less than eight-fold. Finally, RR to imidacloprid was also less than eight-fold in all MLGs tested. A few MLGs with resistance to <b>pirimicarb</b> were found, while susceptibility to cyfluthrin, metamidophos and imidacloprid was still predominant. A significant positive correlation between imidacloprid tolerance with <b>pirimicarb</b> resistance was detected, as well as between imidacloprid and metamidophos tolerance. With the increase in the use of neonicotinoid insecticides, better rotation of insecticides with different modes of action will be necessary to prevent further development of M. persicae insecticide resistance in Chile...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{concentration}} {{and loss of}} two herbicides (bentazone and MCPA), two fungicides (fenpropimorph and propiconazole) and two insecticides (dimethoate and <b>pirimicarb)</b> were measured in tile drainage water from a 2, 813 m 2 experimental grass field from May to August 2001. Three different pesticides were applied to the field and subsequently a rainfall of 10 mm was simulated during the first experiment and 16 mm during the second experiment. Bromide was applied as a conservative tracer in the first experiment and the concentration of bromide and suspended sediment was also measured in tile drainage water. In the first experiment, maximum concentrations of bentazone, fenpropimorph and dimethoate in drainage water were 5. 8 µg l– 1, 0. 33 µg l– 1 and 2. 29 µg l– 1, respectively. In the second experiment, maximum concentrations for MCPA, propiconazole and <b>pirimicarb</b> were 3. 6 µg l– 1, 0. 065 µg l– 1, 2. 3 µg l– 1, respectively. The loss:applied ratio was highest for bentazone (0. 088 %) and declined {{in the order of}} dimethoate (0. 057 %), <b>pirimicarb</b> (0. 050 %), propiconazole (0. 0031 %) and fenpropimorph (0. 00042 %).

40|$|Non-target {{effects on}} {{terrestrial}} arthropod {{communities of the}} broad-spectrum insecticides chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin and the selective insecticide <b>pirimicarb</b> were investigated in winter wheat fields in summer. Effects of chlorpyrifos on arthropod abundance and taxonomic richness were consistently negative whereas effects of cypermethrin were negative for predatory arthropods but positive for soil surface Collembola. <b>Pirimicarb</b> effects were marginal, primarily on aphids and their antagonists, with {{no effect on the}} Collembola community. Collembola-predator ratios were significantly higher following cypermethrin treatment, suggesting that cypermethrin-induced increases in collembolan abundance represent a classical resurgence. Observations in other studies suggest Collembola resurgences may be typical after synthetic pyrethroid applications. Collembola responses to insecticides differed among species, both in terms of effect magnitude and persistence, suggesting that coarse taxonomic monitoring would not adequately detect pesticide risks. These findings have implications for pesticide risk assessments and for the selection of indicator species...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} two mutations in the ace 1 gene of Aphis gossypii {{that are associated}} with insensitivity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to carbamate and organophosphate insecticides. The first of these, S 431 F (equivalent to F 331 in Torpedo californica), is associated with insensitivity to the carbamate insecticide <b>pirimicarb</b> in a range of A. gossypii clones. The S 431 F mutation is also found in the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), and a rapid RFLP diagnostic allows the identification of individuals of both aphid species with a resistant genotype. This diagnostic further revealed the presence of S 431 in several other pirimicarb-susceptible aphid species. The serine at this position in the wild-type enzyme has only been reported for aphids and provides a molecular explanation of why <b>pirimicarb</b> has a specific aphicidal action.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study focused}} on the {{development}} of a sensitive enzymatic biosensor for the determination of <b>pirimicarb</b> pesticide based on the immobilization of laccase on composite carbon paste electrodes. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) paste electrode modified by dispersion of laccase (3 %, w/w) within the optimum composite matrix (60 : 40 %, w/w, MWCNTs and paraffin binder) showed the best performance, with excellent electron transfer kinetic and catalytic effects related to the redox process of the substrate 4 -aminophenol. No metal or anti-interference membrane was added. Based on the inhibition of laccase activity, <b>pirimicarb</b> can be determined in the range 9. 90 × 10 − 7 to 1. 15 × 10 − 5 molL− 1 using 4 -aminophenol as substrate at the optimum pH of 5. 0, with acceptable repeatability and reproducibility (relative standard deviations lower than 5 %). The limit of detection obtained was 1. 8 × 10 − 7 molL− 1 (0. 04 mgkg− 1 on a fresh weight vegetable basis). The high activity and catalytic properties of the laccase-based biosensor are retained during ca. one month. The optimized electroanalytical protocol coupled to the QuEChERS methodology were applied to tomato and lettuce samples spiked at three levels; recoveries ranging from 91. 0 ± 0. 1 % to 101. 0 ± 0. 3 % were attained. No significant effects in the <b>pirimicarb</b> electroanalysis were observed by the presence of pro-vitamin A, vitamins B 1 and C, and glucose in the vegetable extracts. The proposed biosensor-based pesticide residue methodology fulfills all requisites to be used in implementation of food safety programs...|$|E
40|$|The {{hoverfly}} Episyrphus balteatus (Degeer) {{is one of}} {{the most}} abundant predators of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae (L.)) in brussels sprouts in Belgium. In the current laboratory study, the toxicity of several insecticides applied at maximum recommended field rates was investigated on the larvae of E. balteatus. Two-to 3 -day-old larvae were confined in glass petri dishes with dry residues of freshly applied insecticides. Their mortality was checked daily until adult emergence. Sub-lethal effects were investigated by assessing the reproductive performance of adult hoverflies, originating from the surviving larvae. Of the five compounds tested, only <b>pirimicarb</b> caused 100 % larval mortality. The corrected mortality for spinosad was 60 % and the adults obtained from the surviving larvae did not succeed in laying eggs. Therefore, <b>pirimicarb</b> and spinosad were rated "harmful" (International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control of Noxious Animals and Plants (IOBC) category 4) for the larvae of E. balteatus. In contrast, flonicamid, thiacloprid and spirotetramat yielded much lower mortality percentages. The hatching rate of hoverfly eggs treated with flonicamid was 25. 6 % vs 48. 7 % in the control. Hence, flonicamid was rated "slightly harmful" (IOBC category 2). The fertility of adults treated as larvae with thiacloprid or spirotetramat was not affected (IOBC category 1). These laboratory trials suggest that thiacloprid and spirotetramat can be used safely in integrated pest management programs to control the cabbage aphid. <b>Pirimicarb,</b> spinosad and flonicamid should be tested in semi-field and field situations to assess their toxicity under more realistic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Demographic {{toxicology}} {{is recommended}} for toxicity determination of the long term effects of a pesticide since it gives a more accurate and efficient measure {{of the effect of}} a pesticide. Thus, in the current study the sublethal effects of <b>pirimicarb</b> (carbamate insecticide) two concentrations of LC 30 and LC 10 were used against third instar larvae of Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) {{in order to determine the}} effects of the pesticide on demographic parameters of the predator under laboratory conditions. Results showed that <b>pirimicarb</b> did not affect individual life parameters such as development time of larva, pupa, adult longevity, female and male longevity, adult preoviposition period (APOP), and total preoviposition period (TPOP). However, population parameters such as intrinsic rate of increase (r), net reproductive rate (R 0), mean generation time (T), and finite rate of increase (λ) was affected by sublethal treatment. For example, intrinsic rate of increase (r) was 0. 18 day- 1 in the controls but it was 0. 13 and 0. 14 day- 1 in the treated insects with LC 10 and LC 30 concentrations, respectively. Also, there were significant differences between mean generation time (T) of the treatments and the controls i. e. mean generation time of the controls was 29. 03 days while mean generation time in the two treatments of LC 10 and LC 30 was 33. 93 and 31. 66 days, respectively. The finite rate of increase was also significantly affected by sublethal effects of the pesticide. The results showed that <b>pirimicarb,</b> even at low concentrations, has potential to adversely affect the predatory ladybird, therefore care should be taken when this insecticide is used in the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program...|$|E
40|$|Nasonovia ribisnigri, a main pest of salad crops, has {{developed}} resistance to Various insecticides in southern France, including the carbamate <b>pirimicarb</b> and the cyclodiene endosulfan, two insecticides widely {{used to control}} this aphid. Here we have investigated the mechanisms of resistance to these two insecticides by studying cross-resistance, synergism, activity of detoxifying enzymes, and possible modifications of the target proteins. Resistance to <b>pirimicarb</b> was shown to be mainly due to a decreased sensitivity of the target acetylcholinesterase; this modification confered also, resistance to propoxur but not to methomyl and the two tested organophosphates (acephate and paraoxon). Endosulfan resistance {{was associated with a}} moderate level of resistance to dieldrin, and resistance to both insecticides was due, in part, to increased detoxification by glutathione S-transferases (GST). The endosulfan resistant strain displayed the same amino acid at position 302 of the Rdl gene (GABA receptor) as susceptible aphids (e. g. Ala), indicating that the Ala to Ser (or to Gly) mutation observed among dieldrin resistant strains of other insect species was not present...|$|E

Coccinella undecimpunctata L. is a {{euryphagous}} predator {{established in}} Azores that offers interesting {{potential as a}} control agent {{in the context of}} integrated pest management (IPM). However, to further develop IPM against aphids, it is important to evaluate the effects that insecticides might have on voracity. Thus, we proposed to evaluate the effects of <b>pirimicarb</b> and pymetrozine on the voracity of 4 th instar larvae and adults of C. undecimpunctata, under distinct scenarios of exposure to chemicals within a prey/plant system. Voracity of C. undecimpunctata was not significantly affected by <b>pirimicarb</b> or pymetrozine when treatments were directly sprayed on the predator; however, when insecticides were sprayed on the prey/plant system, the predator’s voracity was significantly increased. Results suggest that C. undecimpunctata does not detect the insecticide on the aphids and indicate that the increase in voracity may be due to a decrease in the mobility of insecticide-treated aphids, since their capture should be easier than highly mobile non-treated prey. The consequences of such increase in the voracity for IPM programs are discussed...|$|E

(2016), 'Genetic variation in target-site resistance to pyrethroids and <b>pirimicarb</b> in Tunisian populations of the peach potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) ', Pest. Manag. Sci., 72 : 2313 ??? 2320, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. BACKGROUND We used molecular assays to diagnose resistance to pyrethroids and <b>pirimicarb</b> in samples of Myzus persicae from field crops or an insect suction trap in Tunisia. Genotypes for resistance loci were related to ones for polymorphic microsatellite loci in order to investigate breeding systems and patterns of genetic diversity, and to inform resistance management tactics. RESULTS The kdr mutation L 1014 F conferring pyrethroid resistance was found in all samples. The M 918 T s-kdr mutation also occurred in most samples, but only in conjunction with kdr. We discovered a previously unreported genotype heterozygous for L 1014 F but homozygous for M 918 T. Samples with modified acetylcholinesterase (MACE) conferring resistance to <b>pirimicarb</b> were less common but widespread. 16 % of samples contained both the kdr and MACE mutations. Many unique microsatellite genotypes were found, suggesting that M. persicae is holocyclic in Tunisia. There were no consistent associations between resistance and microsatellite markers. CONCLUSION This first study of insecticide resistance in M. persicae in North Africa showed genetic variation in insecticide resistance within microsatellite multilocus genotypes (MLGMs) and the same resistance mechanisms to be present in different MLGMs. This contrasts with variation in northern Europe where M. persicae is fully anholocyclic.

40|$|Abstract—Amphibian species inhabiting {{agricultural}} areas may {{be exposed to}} pesticides during their aquatic larval phase. We tested the toxicity of six commonly used pesticides on Rana temporaria spawn and tadpoles. In acute tests, tadpoles were exposed to relatively high concentrations of azoxystrobin, cyanazine, esfenvalerate, MCPA ([4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxy] acetic acid), per-methrin, and <b>pirimicarb</b> for 72 h. Chronic exposure tests were performed from fertilization to metamorphosis with azoxystrobin, cyanazine, and permethrin at concentrations {{similar to those found}} in surface waters in {{agricultural areas}} in Sweden. The most lethal pesticides in the acute exposure were azoxystrobin, permethrin, and <b>pirimicarb.</b> Also, negative effects on the growth of the tadpoles were observed with azoxystrobin, cyanazine, and permethrin. The chronic exposure at lower pesticide concentrations did not result in increased mortality or impaired growth. However, we found a positive effect of permethrin on growth and size at metamorphosis. The results suggest that the examined pesticides can inflict strong negative effects at high concentrations but have no or relatively weak effects on R. temporaria spawn or tadpoles at concentrations found in Swedish surface waters.
