Sampling and preparation of the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> (RIVM). Sampling and preparation of the products made from the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> (RIVM). Manufacturing of the products and determination of their physical properties (INTRON). Determination of the particle size and the surface area of the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> (RIVM). Chemical analysis of the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> (ECN). Characterization of the leaching behaviour of the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> (RIVM and TNO). Characterization of the leaching behaviour of the crushed products (TNO). Characterization of the leaching behaviour of the products (ECN). Verification of the practical reliability of the standard leaching test by means of a large scale column leaching test (RIVM). The leaching behaviour of some <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> used in pilot- scale roadbases (TNO). Development and use of the leaching data base (ECN). The results of the characterization of the leaching properties of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> generally show a good reproducibility of the chemical composition {{as well as of the}} leaching parameters. The studies have also shown that it is technically feasible to replace <b>primary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> partially by secondary materials. In most cases, the technical requirements of the products were met. From the results of the standard leaching tests of granular materials and products it was found that the availibility test can be used as a first screening method for the determination of the leaching behaviour of <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and products. The leaching of elements from <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and products (<b>primary</b> and secondary) depends strongly on the pH value present in the leaching system. Comparison of the results of the standard leaching test (small scale laboratory test) and the same test carried out in lysimeters (pilot-scale) shows the standard leaching test on laboratory scale to be a reliable test procedure in order to estimate the leaching behaviour in at least the first 100 years. The leaching database, which was developed as part of this project, has demonstrated its usefulness in evaluating and interpreting the results of this study. In addition, it will be a useful tool in the future for mutual comparison of materials as well as for certification of materials...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper applies {{a simple}} model {{to examine the}} links between primary (extracted) and {{secondary}} (recycled) <b>raw</b> <b>materials.</b> The model serves to illustrate that in a growth-based economy, the reliance on <b>primary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> is inevitable, let alone because of the residence time of the material in the economy, which generates a delay between the total production of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> (<b>primary</b> and secondary) and the material that enters the waste stream and therefore becomes available for recycling. An examination of the underlying model hypotheses highlights the questionable nature of the "fixed stock" paradigm, which is not consistent with either geological knowledge of metal concentrations, or the continuous improvement of ore-treatment process efficiencies...|$|R

An ambitious implementation of the circular economy package would reduce the European demand for <b>primary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and thus would also decrease the material footprint as presented in this paper. Moving to a circular economy is therefore also closely connected to economic issues, such as import dependence and stable supply of <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> for European industries (European Commission 2015).|$|R
