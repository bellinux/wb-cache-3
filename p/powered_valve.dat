Engine parts from these two bikes will directly swap with the Derbi. It uses the Yamaha Yamaha <b>Power</b> <b>Valve</b> System, a two-stroke <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> system, which consists of a rotary valve located in the exhaust port which changes the exhaust port timing and area.

50|$|Two-stroke engines use a <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> {{system to}} get similar results to VVT.|$|R
50|$|Because {{driving the}} <b>power</b> <b>valves</b> this hard also means maximum volume, {{which can be}} {{difficult}} to manage in a small recording or rehearsal space, many solutions have emerged that in some way divert some of this <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> output from the speakers, and allow the player to generate <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> distortion without excessive volume. These include built-in or separate power attenuators and power-supply-based power attenuation, such as a VVR, or Variable Voltage Regulator to drop the voltage on the valves' plates, to increase distortion whilst lowering volume. Guitarists such as Edward Van Halen have been known to use variacs before VVR technology was invented. Lower-power valve amps (such as a quarter-watt or less), speaker isolation cabinets, and low-efficiency guitar speakers are also used to tame the volume.|$|R

25|$|Because {{the valve}} {{industry}} {{had begun to}} fade and Marshall became worried that the standard <b>power</b> <b>valve,</b> the venerable EL34, would soon become unavailable, a number of JCM 800s were factory equipped with the 6550 beam tetrode <b>power</b> <b>valve,</b> a valve with a different tonal character, which not all users loved. Marshall would not return to full-time use of the EL34 {{in all of its}} valve amps until the rise of vacuum tube factories in the mid and late 1990s when former-Soviet countries made most valve types plentiful again.|$|R

50|$|Two <b>power</b> <b>valves</b> (may be triodes or tetrodes) being {{differentially}} {{driven to}} form a push-pull output stage, driving a push-pull transformer load. This output stage makes much better use of the transformer core than the single-ended output stage.|$|R
50|$|Many modern {{two-stroke}} engines {{employ a}} <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> system. The valves are normally in {{or around the}} exhaust ports. They work {{in one of two}} ways: either they alter the exhaust port by closing off the top part of the port, which alters port timing, such as Rotax R.A.V.E, Yamaha YPVS, Honda RC-Valve, Kawasaki K.I.P.S., Cagiva C.T.S. or Suzuki AETC systems, or by altering the volume of the exhaust, which changes the resonant frequency of the expansion chamber, such as the Suzuki SAEC and Honda V-TACS system. The result is an engine with better low-speed power without sacrificing high-speed power. However, as <b>power</b> <b>valves</b> are in the hot gas flow they need regular maintenance to perform well.|$|R
50|$|The unique {{feature that}} gave the 1989 and onward models their Exup name (for Exhaust Ultimate <b>Power</b> <b>Valve)</b> was Yamaha's {{four-stroke}} <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> system, a servo motor-driven exhaust valve. This allowed large bore exhaust header pipes (for excellent gas flow at high engine speeds) coupled with the valve restricting flow at lower revs, to speed the gas through. It gave pulling power from low revs, seamlessly, up to the red line at 11,500 rpm. It also allowed extremely radical high lift cams that gave a very lumpy idle when unplugged {{in the open position}} or when using a full aftermarket exhaust. Yamaha used this valve system on the YZF models which followed (Thunderace) and the R1 models from 1998.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>valves</b> (tubes) can be overdriven in {{the same}} way that {{pre-amplifier}} valves can, but because these valves are designed to output more power, the distortion and character they add to the guitar's tone is unique. During the 1960s to early 1970s, distortion was primarily created by overdriving the <b>power</b> <b>valves.</b> Because they have become accustomed to this sound , many guitar players [...] favour this type of distortion, and thus set their amps to maximum levels in order to drive the power section hard. Many valve-based amplifiers in common use have a push-pull output configuration in their power section, with matched pairs of tubes driving the output transformer. Power amplifier distortion is normally entirely symmetric, generating predominantly odd-order harmonics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>valve</b> {{actuation}} can be by mechanical (RPM dependent) {{or electric}} (servo motor) means increasingly with electronic control. Electronic control offers {{a greater degree}} of accuracy as well as being able to vary the opening of the valve and be tuned to conditions.|$|R
5000|$|All <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> systems {{vary the}} {{duration}} of the exhaust port open time, which gives the engine usable low end power combined with excellent top end power. Manufacturers have also included sub exhaust chambers that extend the 'tuned length' of the expansion chamber.|$|R
50|$|Only class A {{can be used}} in {{single-ended}} mode, as part of {{the signal}} would otherwise be cut off. The driver stage for class AB2 and B valve amplifiers must be capable of supplying some signal current to the <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> grids ("driving power").|$|R
5000|$|A {{disadvantage}} of Class A operation for <b>power</b> <b>valves</b> is a shortened life, because the valves are always fully [...] "on" [...] and dissipate maximum power {{all of the}} time. Voltage amplifier valves not operating at high power are not affected in this way.|$|R
50|$|The 3XV {{came out}} in 8 {{variants}} with different carbs, ignitions, wet & dry clutches, 3 versions of <b>power</b> <b>valves,</b> cylinders and each depicted by different colour number boards on the side panels and front fairing.

30|$|There is {{no common}} {{accepted}} way for calculating the <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss of modular multilevel converter (MMC). <b>Valve</b> <b>power</b> loss estimation based on analytical calculation is inaccurate {{to address the}} switching <b>power</b> loss and <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss estimation based on detailed electro-magnetic simulation is of low speed. To solve this problem, a method of <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss estimation based on the detailed equivalent simulation model of MMC is proposed. Results of <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss analysis of 201 -level 500 MW MMC operating at 50 Hz~ 1000 Hz are presented. It is seen that the <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss of a MMC increased by 12, 40 and 93 % under 200 Hz, 500 Hz and 1000 Hz operating frequency. The article concludes that in a device with isolated inner AC system, MMC operating at higher frequency will be more competitive than typical 50 Hz/ 60 Hz MMC with moderate increase of operating power loss and significant reduction {{of the size of}} the AC components.|$|R

25|$|Marshall {{currently}} manufactures a professional, all-valve bass rig {{called the}} VBA400. It houses eight 6550 <b>power</b> <b>valves</b> plus three ECC83 and one ECC82 preamp valves.

30|$|Currently, {{there are}} no {{commonly}} accepted standards for determining the power loss for MMC. The IEC has a draft standard (IEC 62751) in preparation [5]. An intuitive way of obtaining the <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> losses of a converter station is comparing the measured power at the AC side and the DC side. However, {{the difference between these}} two measured values is small, and a good accuracy will be very difficult to reach [5]. Also, such method is not able to observe the distribution of value power loss and the factors that impact <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> losses. For most cases, therefore, the losses have to be estimated from component characteristics, using suitable mathematical models of the converters [6]. From traditional PWM modulated two-level and three-level voltage source converter (VSC), the <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> loss can be obtained analytically [7, 8]. <b>valve</b> <b>power</b> lossvalve power losses The analytical method requires variables such as power factor, dc voltage, valve current and switching occasion of the semiconductors.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} versions of the engine. The original has a <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> and produces around , and is used by racers aged 15 or older.

50|$|Low {{to medium}} <b>power</b> <b>valve</b> {{amplifiers}} for frequencies below the microwaves were largely replaced by solid state amplifiers during the 1960s and 1970s, initially for receivers and low power stages of transmitters, transmitter output stages switching to transistors somewhat later.

5000|$|In a race bike, {{this is not}} {{a problem}} as the engine will be {{operating}} at high RPM almost all the time. However, in a road/commuter bike, the limited power range is a problem.
