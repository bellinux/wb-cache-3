50|$|The lactone of {{artemisinin}} could selectively {{be reduced}} with mild hydride-reducing agents, such as sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride, and lithium borohydride to dihydroartemisinin (a lactol) in over 90% yield. It {{is a novel}} reduction, because normally lactone cannot be reduced with sodium borohydride under the same reaction conditions (0-5 ˚C in methanol). Reduction with LiAlH4 leads to some rearranged products. It was surprising {{to find that the}} lactone was reduced, but that the <b>peroxy</b> <b>group</b> survived. However, the lactone of deoxyartemisinin resisted reduction with sodium borohydride and could only be reduced with diisobutylaluminium hydride to the lactol deoxydihydroartimisinin. These results show that the <b>peroxy</b> <b>group</b> assists the reduction of lactone with sodium borohydride to a lactol, but not to the alcohol which is the over-reduction product. No clear evidence for this reduction process exists.|$|E
50|$|A {{potential}} {{side reaction}} {{that may occur}} is the Baeyer-Villiger reaction of intermediate 2, {{where there is a}} rearrangement of the <b>peroxy</b> <b>group</b> that results {{in the formation of the}} relative ester. The extent of this side reaction declines with the rise of pH, and increases the nucleophilicity of the oxone, making basic conditions favorable for the overall epoxidation and reactivity of the catalytic species.|$|E

30|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that H 2 forms during rock–water reactions (e.g., cataclasis) between fresh rock surfaces containing radicals (Sugisaki et al. 1983) and by the redox conversion of hydroxyls to <b>peroxy</b> <b>groups</b> in silicates (Freund et al. 2002). H 2 can also be formed in uranium-, thorium-, and potassium-rich geological settings, by the radiolysis of water and/or organic matter, and also by the reaction of water with newly formed elements (Savchenko 1958; Lin et al. 2005). However, the quantities of H 2 that can be produced by these mechanisms are limited, and therefore they cannot explain the H 2 flows estimated in this study.|$|R

40|$|A novel (main chain) -(side chain) vinyl polyperoxide, poly(alpha-(tert-butylperoxymethyl) styrene peroxide) (MCSCPP), an {{alternating}} copolymer of alpha-(tert-butylperoxymethyl) styrene (TPMS) and oxygen, has been synthesized by the oxidative polymerization of TPMS. The MCSCPP {{was characterized by}} H- 1 NMR, C- 13 NMR, IR, DSC, EI-MS, and GC-MS studies. The overall activation energy (E(a)) for the degradation of MCSCPP {{was found to be}} 27 kcal/mol. Formaldehyde and alpha-(tert-butylperoxy) acetophenone (TPAP) were identified as the primary degradation products of MCSCPP; TPAP was found to undergo further degradation. The side chain <b>peroxy</b> <b>groups</b> were found to be thermally more stable than those in the main chain. Polymerization of styrene in the presence of MCSCPP as initiator, at 80 degrees C, follows classical kinetics. The presence of peroxy segments in the polystyrene chain was confirmed by both H- 1 NMR and thermal decomposition studies.

50|$|It is {{the ease}} of {{splitting}} the <b>peroxy</b> <b>group</b> to give two free radicals that makes organic peroxides so useful. However, the presence of energetic free radicals during decomposition, particularly in hot gases or mists, can cause auto-ignition to occur at a lower temperature than would otherwise be normal for a similar chemical structure without the peroxy functional group. Organic peroxides do not generally consume oxygen {{as part of the}} decomposition so there is little risk of enhanced burning rates due to oxygen enrichment. This is unlike the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and solid oxidizers that can liberate oxygen.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{molecular}} iodine as a heterogeneous {{catalyst for the}} peroxidation of adamantan- 2 -one with 30 % H 2 O 2 resulted in an unexpected hydroperoxydiadamantyl peroxide and oxahomoadamantan- 5 -one, {{in addition to the}} expected adamantanyl bishydroperoxide. The crystal structures of both the hydroperoxides are reported for the first time. Crystallographic studies revealed that these peroxides are stabilized by extensive intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which are combined in hydrogen-bonded double layers. These bilayers envelop the hydrophilic interiors consisting of sensitive <b>peroxy</b> <b>groups</b> with the outer surface covered by hydrophobic adamantane groups. The bilayers are held together by weak van der Waals interactions at the layer boundary, which further enhances the thermal stability. Thermal studies demonstrate the remarkable stability of crystalline hydroperoxides at room temperature. A computational study rationalizes the stability of these peroxides. NCI (non-covalent interactions) plots help to decipher the nature of the interaction between the adamantane units as stabilizing dispersion contacts.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} molecular {{modeling of}} the reaction mechanism, complemented by ab initio microkinetic studies of the catalytic decomposition of N 2 O {{on a series of}} the alkaline earth oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO), was performed. The DFT level of theory was used to study the intimate mechanism of conceivable elementary steps of the de N 2 O reaction over the terrace sites of the most stable (100) planes. The principal mechanistic events were thoroughly analyzed in terms of the frontier molecular orbital picture, and a multiple role of the anionic redox active centers constituted by surface O 2 − (surf) ions was revealed. The harmonic transition state theory along with the calculated free enthalpies of activation were used to model the reaction progress with the elementary step resolution in pulse (transient) and steady state regimes. For modeling the surface di ff usion and recombination {{of the reaction}} key intermediates (<b>peroxy</b> <b>groups),</b> a Monte Carlo approach was applied to rationalize dioxygen formation along the static and dynamic routes. The developed kinetic scheme was able to reproduce the results of temperature- programmed surface reaction (TPSR) and isothermal steady state experiments with high accuracy without fi tting any parameters. On the basis of obtained results, a complete molecular mechanistic description of the de N 2 O reaction was proposed, resolving de fi nitely the dependence of the particular elementary steps on the strength of anionic redox centers and their Lewis basicity...|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} type of defect {{of concern}} in quartz crystals is the substitution of an Al(III) for a Si(IV) atom in the crystal lattice. The aluminium ion has an associated interstitial charge compensator present nearby, {{which can be a}} H+ ion (attached to the nearby oxygen and forming a hydroxyl group, called Al−OH defect), Li+ ion, Na+ ion, K+ ion (less common), or an electron hole trapped in a nearby oxygen atom orbital. The composition of the growth solution, whether it is based on lithium or sodium alkali compounds, determines the charge compensating ions for the aluminium defects. The ion impurities are of concern as they are not firmly bound and can migrate through the crystal, altering the local lattice elasticity and the resonant frequency of the crystal. Other common impurities of concern are e.g. iron(III) (interstitial), fluorine, boron(III), phosphorus(V) (substitution), titanium(IV) (substitution, universally present in magmatic quartz, less common in hydrothermal quartz), and germanium(IV) (substitution). Sodium and iron ions can cause inclusions of acnite and elemeusite crystals. Inclusions of water may be present in fast-grown crystals; interstitial water molecules are abundant near the crystal seed. Another defect of importance is the hydrogen containing growth defect, when instead of a Si−O−Si structure, a pair of Si−OH HO−Si groups is formed; essentially a hydrolyzed bond. Fast-grown crystals contain more hydrogen defects than slow-grown ones. These growth defects source as supply of hydrogen ions for radiation-induced processes and forming Al-OH defects. Germanium impurities tend to trap electrons created during irradiation; the alkali metal cations then migrate towards the negatively charged center and form a stabilizing complex. Matrix defects can also be present; oxygen vacancies, silicon vacancies (usually compensated by 4 hydrogens or 3 hydrogens and a hole), <b>peroxy</b> <b>groups,</b> etc. Some of the defects produce localized levels in the forbidden band, serving as charge traps; Al(III) and B(III) typically serve as hole traps while electron vacancies, titanium, germanium, and phosphorus atoms serve as electron traps. The trapped charge carriers can be released by heating; their recombination is the cause of thermoluminescence.|$|R

40|$|The {{products}} and mechanism of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formations from 1 -alkenes, internal alkenes, and 2 -methyl- 1 -alkenes (OH radical reaction only) with OH and NO 3 radicals (in {{the presence of}} NO x for OH radical reactions) were investigated in an environmental chamber, and quantitative chemical mechanisms with gas-partiticle partitioning corrections were developed for some systems to estimate SOA yields. Aerosol products chemical compositions were analyzed using a thermal desorption particle beam mass spectrometer, and volatile compounds were quantified using a gas chromatograph with flame-ionization detector. Nitrate products were analyzed using a high-performance liuid chromatograph with UV-vis detector for yield measurements and 1 H NMR for identification. The major products observed in OH radical-initiated reactions with linear alkenes were β -hydroxynitrates, dihydroxynitrates, cyclic hemiacetals, dihydrofurans, and dimers formed from dihydroxycarbonyls. Trihydroxynitrates and trihydroxycarbonyls were observed for 2 -methyl- 1 -alkene reactions {{in addition to the}} products listd above, but dimers were not observed due to reduction of driving force of the formation. The yields of β -hydroxynitrates, dihydroxynitrates, and trihydroxynitrates were measured to calculate the relative ratios for forming primary, secondary, and tertiary β -hydroxyalkyl radicals by OH radical addition to the double bond, calculated as 1. 0 : 1. 9 : 4. 3, and the branching ratios for forming β -hydroxynitrates from reactions of primary, secondary, and tertiary β -hydroxyperoxy radicals with NO, calculated as 0. 12, 0. 15, and 0. 25. The branching ratios of β -hydroxynitrate formations were lower than that of alkylnitrate formations due to hydrogen bonding between hydroxy and <b>peroxy</b> <b>groups</b> in hydroxyperoxy radical-NO complexes. The effect is enhanced with the addition of NH 3 for 1 -alkene reactions. SOA yields estimated with a developed model agreed well with the measured SOA yields for 2 -methyl- 1 -alkene reactions, but the agreement was limited for 1 -alkenes to the region where gas-particle partitioning does not affect due to difficulty in vapor pressure estimation of the products. The major products observed in NO 3 radical-initiated reactions with linear alkenes include β -hydroxynitrates, carbonylnitrates, dihydroxynitrates, and hydroxyl and oxo dinitrooxytetrahydrofurans which have not been observed previously. The products through the pathway of isomerizing δ -hydroxycarbonyls to cyclic hemiacetals were observed in all linear alkene and 2 -methyl- 1 -alkene reactions, and second-generation products were observed in NO 3 radical-initiated reactions...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} dopant-type polyaniline-polyacrylic acid {{composite}} (PAn-PAA) films with porous structures were prepared and developed for an enzyme-free hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) sensor. The composite films were highly electroactive {{in a neutral}} environment as compared to polyaniline (PAn). In addition, the carboxyl group of the PAA was found to react with H 2 O 2 to form <b>peroxy</b> acid <b>groups,</b> and the <b>peroxy</b> acid could further oxidize the imine structure of PAn to form N-oxides. The N-oxides reverted to their original form via electrochemical reduction and increased the reduction current. Based on this result, PAn-PAA was used to modify a gold electrode (PAn-PAA/Au) as a working electrode for the non-enzymatic detection of H 2 O 2. The characteristics of the proposed sensors could be tuned by the PAA/PAn molar ratio. Blending PAA with PAn enhanced the surface area, electrocatalytic activity, and conductivity of these sensors. Under optimal conditions, the linear concentration range of the H 2 O 2 sensor was 0. 04 to 12 mM with a sensitivity of 417. 5 μA/mM-cm 2.

A hexacoordinated system Ti(O-CH 2 -CH 2 -O) (O-O-Me) (O-CH 2 -CH=CH 2) (H 2 O) (10) was first studied in detail. Transition structures were fully optimized with the nonlocal density functional approximation (BLYP) and the 3 - 21 G basis set. Energies were further calculated with the HW 3 basis set (equivalent to the 6 - 31 G* basis set). The calculated activation energy is close to those observed experimentally. The titanium center in each transition structure has a distorted octahedral geometry. The Ti-O-O unit has a perfect η 2 - structure. The Ti-O-O approaches the C=C in a spiro fashion with the two C⋯O bonds forming to similar extents. There is a significant conformational preference for the <b>peroxy</b> alkoxy <b>group</b> to be away from the bridging oxygen. The allylic alcohol substrate strongly favors a conformation with the allylic C-O bond gauche to the Ti-O water bond if the oxidant is tert-butyl peroxide.

The photooxidation process continued {{even after}} the total consumption of the sensitizer, possibly due to the excitation of the ketyl groups formed during the first stages of the process. The rate of oxidation, {{as well as the}} formation of hydroxy, <b>peroxy,</b> and ketyl <b>groups</b> was faster for polymers with larger ester groups. The decrease of the molecular weight of the degradated polymers was also larger for the hexyl substituted polymer.
