Oldman met with Oswald's wife, Marina, and her two daughters to prepare for the role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with Marina Oswald. Since the script {{contained}} few lines for the Oswalds, Poźniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with Gary Oldman.|$|E

5|$|Most of Acapulco {{remained}} {{closed for}} at least a week after the hurricane. Initially, authorities around Acapulco gave preference to clean up tourist areas, which resulted in the scenic highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed. Tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane, causing some hotels to charge 40percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back. One airline offered two <b>plane</b> <b>tickets</b> for the price of one from Mexico City to Acapulco. Most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} the character Maude Flanders, who had previously been voiced by cast member Maggie Roswell. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show. Since 1994, she had been flying between her Denver home and Los Angeles twice a week to record episodes of The Simpsons. She eventually grew tired of this, and the price of <b>plane</b> <b>tickets</b> was constantly increasing. As a result, she asked Fox for a pay raise from $2,000 per episode to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit.|$|E

5000|$|In October 1986, Vincent Askew was {{involved}} in a possible transfer to the University of Kansas. He did not transfer, and re-enrolled at Memphis State University in the fall of 1986. While Askew was visiting the Jayhawks, then-coach Larry Brown provided Askew with a <b>plane</b> <b>ticket</b> to fly back to Memphis to see his dying grandmother.

Success was confirmed when they graced the January 1985 cover of the influential UK magazine NME, which predicted it would be 'The Year of The Triffids'.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors {{charged that}} Elmann would send {{potential}} clients to Siminovsky, who would then in turn enlist Salerno or Sarnell to steer his clients' divorce cases (which {{were supposed to}} be assigned randomly) to Garson.

Billington himself, however, has claimed that the Rougeau incident was not the final straw that drove {{him to leave the}} WWF. Rather, he has stated, it was a dispute with WWF management over issuing of complimentary <b>plane</b> <b>tickets,</b> over which he resigned from the company on principle and, to his surprise in retrospect, Smith followed suit.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, Google {{released}} Google Trips, an app that, {{based on}} information from a user's Gmail messages, automatically generates travel cards.

Competing providers differ little on their time-honoured formula, offering three different services regarding the number of stops and type of seats: the Regular, Semi-cama (semi-bed), and Cama (bed), with Cama being similar to an airline's business class but the names vary. They may also be called Ejecutivo, Cama-vip, Cama-suite and some other names. Some services, usually {{the ones that are}} more expensive, have also on-board dining, while others stop at restaurants by the road.

25|$|First {{introduced}} in season 15 (and not repeated until season 18 and {{being used in}} subsequent seasons), the start line of the Race has featured a task that teams had to complete before being allowed to continue racing (earlier seasons simply had teams run towards their backpacks and first clue). The task generally features an item that provides a hint to their first destination, such as a number plate particular to the city or {{the name of the}} country's national airline. Teams that complete this task first may be given tickets for the first of two or more departing flights to their first city, giving those teams a time advantage on the first leg. In the 18th and 19th seasons, the last team to complete the task was given a penalty on top of having their last place departure; in the 15th season, the last place team was eliminated after having been unable to complete the task (out of 12 teams, there were only 11 clues and sets of <b>plane</b> <b>tickets</b> for their first destination).|$|E
