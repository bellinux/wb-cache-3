50|$|By {{the time}} of the Norman Conquest, {{elements}} of feudalism existed in England from the rule of the Anglo-Saxon and Danish kings to the degree that it was easy to introduce it in full. What the Norman Conquest did was not to change all at once allodial into feudal tenure, but to complete the association of territorial with personal dependence in a state of society already prepared for it. Nulle terre sans seigneur was one of the fundamental axioms of feudalism. There might be any number of infeudations and subinfeudations to mesne lords, but the chain of seigniory was complete, depending in the last resort upon the king as lord paramount. Land was not owned by free owners owing only necessary militia duties to the state, but was held of the king by knight-service. The folkland became the king's land; the soldier was a landowner instead of the landowner being a soldier. Free owners tended to become tenants of the lord, the township to be lost in the manor. The common land became in law the waste of the manor, its enjoyment resting upon a <b>presumed</b> <b>grant</b> by the lord. On the other hand, the whole of England did not become manorial; the conflict between the township and the manor resulted in a compromise, the result of which affects land tenure in England to this day. But it was a compromise much to the advantage of the privileged class, for in England more than in any other country the land law is the law of the nobility and not of the people. One reason of this is that, as England was never so completely feudalized as were some of the European continental states, the burden of feudalism was not so severely felt, and has led to less agitation for reform.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court {{considered}} six arguments by the railroad.

500|$|First, the Ninth Circuit {{disagreed}} with the District Court's holding that Mexican land grants had extinguished the Chumash's title. [...] Instead, the court applied the same standards to Mexican land grants as would have been applied to federal land grants: [...] the <b>grants</b> were <b>presumed</b> to <b>grant</b> an interest subject to the tribe's aboriginal title. [...] Next, the Ninth Circuit rejected the tribe's arguments that the islands were not within the land ceded by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. [...] Third, the court rejected the Chumash's argument that the Treaty converted the tribe's aboriginal title into recognized title.|$|R
50|$|Santa Sofia in Padua is {{the oldest}} church {{structure}} in the city. It {{was built in the}} 10th century on the site of a <b>presumed</b> Mithraeum. A <b>grant</b> was made to bishop Sinibaldo of this church in 1123, which had already been in construction. The Romanesque facade was constructed from 1106 to 1127, and is now somewhat inclined to subsidence of the soil. The interior is now relatively sparse.|$|R
40|$|Rural {{settings}} in the United States have characteristics that present a unique context for small business, often portrayed as adverse. Studies of rural entrepreneurs and small businesses, however, frequently fail to provide {{data on the}} rural context and its potential relationship to small business, taking for <b>granted</b> <b>presumed</b> attributes and adverse effects. To develop {{a better understanding of}} a rural setting's importance, this research investigated effects of rural geo-demographic and socio-cultural features on 76 small businesses. Results demonstrate that rural geo-demography adversely affects marketability of products and services although there is little adversity for small businesses due to constrained resources (financing, technology, and transportation) or labor issues. Business owners manage their businesses consistent with rural socio-cultural values by relying on strong social ties and word of mouth reputation. However, women-owned businesses experience little adversity due to gender stereotypes. The rural setting considered in the study has varying implications for different types of businesses and for business owners according to how long they have lived in the community. Its effects are neither adverse in all respects nor universal for all small businesses. Rural location, rurality, rural business, small business, entrepreneurship...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the uses of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) technologies in everyday domestic settings. In contrast to goal-oriented technology adoption (e. g. in the workplace), the integration of pervasive technology in the home faces not only social but also physical and technical constraints. We propose a design framework for the introduction of ubicomp technology into today’s homes that, firstly, considers a holistic approach to integrating pervasive technology; secondly, takes into account social factors and domestic activity when defining the nature of the system’s interaction; and thirdly, allows the user to adapt the system’s interaction and collaboration. Most of the work to date on domestic ubicomp takes the customization of domestic spaces for <b>granted,</b> <b>presuming</b> that the integration of sensing technologies can be accomplished to any required degree and usually assuming that context-aware systems have to be proactive, limiting users to the role of consumers of the system’s actions rather than allowing them a more participative or cooperative role. We have applied our framework to design a domestic ubicomp system to support parents with childcare in the home. The “Context-Aware Room” and the “The Parent-Child Companion Tool” prototypes are built to take account of the interaction between the social and physical and the social and digital contexts in order to address issues of integration of sensing technology, socially respectful collaboration and system adaptation. Two studies explore the potential social acceptance of the PChCT. The panel study considers parents’ overall perceptions of whether these kinds of ubicomp tools might help with parental tasks. The usability study considers the usefulness and usability of the PChCT. The results of the study reflect a positive attitude to the PChCT. Parents liked the collaborative resources and facilities to tailor collaboration. Further work might be done to assess how the system’s adaptation might fit within a wider context of user needs. Nevertheless, we argue that the use of our framework can lead to more socially acceptable ubicomp experiences in the home...|$|R
