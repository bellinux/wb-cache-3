40|$|SummaryBackgroundAllergic {{rhinitis}} is {{a chronic}} respiratory disorder with a detrimental impact on health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQOL) and health status. Enhancement and maintenance of patient function and well-being are therefore considered as essential. ObjectiveTo determine whether long-term treatment with levocetirizine 5 mg improves HRQOL and health status in persistent allergic rhinitis (<b>PER)</b> <b>patients</b> assessed with RQLQ and SF- 36 scales over a 6 -month period. MethodsThe Xyzal® in PER Trial (XPERT™) was a multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group study. A total of 551 patients were randomized to receive levocetirizine 5 mg or placebo once daily for 6 months and assessed for symptoms, HRQOL (Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire: RQLQ) and health status (SF- 36). Sensitivity of the RQLQ and SF- 36 to disease severity was tested to ensure their suitability for use in <b>PER</b> <b>patients.</b> Treatment effect was assessed by means of repeated measures analyses. ResultsOver the 6 -month treatment period, levocetirizine showed statistically significant improvements over placebo in HRQOL (P< 0. 001 for all RQLQ domains and overall scores) and health status (P⩽ 0. 004 for SF- 36 physical and mental summary scores; P< 0. 05 for all SF- 36 scales). The relative improvement of levocetirizine over placebo exceeded the predefined clinically meaningful threshold of 30 % for all RQLQ scores and the improvement from baseline was 3 times the established MID for RQLQ. ConclusionThe RQLQ and SF- 36 {{could be used to}} measure HRQOL and health status in <b>PER</b> <b>patients.</b> Long-term treatment with levocetirizine provides sustained improvement of HRQOL and reduces disease burden in <b>PER</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the impact of}} practice {{size and scope of}} services on average physician workload in primary care practices in The Netherlands, and to examine the associations between average physician workload, average assistant volume and organisational practice characteristics. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in 1188 general practices in The Netherlands. Measures included physician workload per week <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients,</b> assistant volume <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients,</b> practice size defined by number of registered patients (10 classes), scope of disease management services (seven classes), and nine organisational characteristics of the practice. RESULTS: Physician workload <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients</b> differed across levels of practice size, but was not related with the range of disease management services provided. In the smallest practices physicians worked on average 26. 2 h <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients</b> and in the largest practices 18. 1 h. A higher average assistant volume was overall not associated with a lower average physician workload. Large practices had lower assistant volume <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients,</b> but provided a wider range of disease management services compared to small practices. Delegation of medical tasks was associated with reduced physician workload <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients,</b> mainly in smaller practices, and with higher assistant volume <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients,</b> particularly in larger practices. CONCLUSIONS: In The Netherlands the optimum regarding average physician workload was found in the largest practices, while no obvious association with scope of disease management services appeared. It may be that in large practices medical tasks were delegated to practice assistants to provide a wider scope of disease management services and in small practice to reduce average physician workload...|$|R

25|$|In March 2001, 40 multi-national {{pharmaceutical}} companies brought litigation against South Africa for its Medicines Act, which allowed the generic production of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for treating HIV, {{despite the fact}} that these drugs were on-patent.

Design, setting and method: Data {{were collected in}} two national surveys: 96 general practices (n = 344 449 patients) in 1987 and 90 general practices (n = 358 008 patients) in 2001. Outcome measures were: (1) antibiotic prescribing rates for acute otitis media (AOM), common cold, sinusitis and acute tonsillitis; (2) number of antibiotic prescriptions <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients</b> <b>per</b> year; (3) incidence rates <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients</b> <b>per</b> year. Results: Antibiotic prescribing rates in AOM and common cold were increased in 2001 compared to 1987 (from 27 % to 48 %; from 17 % to 23 %, respectively), while the rates for sinusitis and acute tonsillitis were about the same (72 % and 70 %; 74 % and 72 %, respectively). Except for AOM, the number of antibiotic prescriptions <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients</b> decreased by 30 % to 50 %. As incidence rates of common cold, tonsillitis and sinusitis decreased, {{the decline in the}} total volume of antibiotic prescriptions <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patients</b> for these three categories has mainly to be attributed to a fall of incidence rates. Conclusion: Antibiotic prescribing rates for URTIs have not declined between 1987 and 2001, but the volumes for common cold, sinusitis and tonsillitis have fallen down mainly attributable to declined incidences, which have probably been caused by a reduced inclination of patients to present respiratory illness to their GP.

40|$|Background The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{antibiotic}} pre-scribing within the United Kingdom for three of the Standing Medical Advisory Committee recommendations ‘four things which could be done’. Methods We conducted a retrospective survey of morbidity and antibiotic prescribing data between 1993 and 2001 using the national General Practice Research Database. Antibiotic prescribing was linked to diagnoses of cough/cold and sore throat; length of antibiotic course for uncomplicated cystitis. Results The rate of antibiotic prescribing for cough/cold declined between 1993 (43. 7 <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patient</b> years at risk) and 1999 (23. 5 <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patient</b> years at risk) and has since increased slightly (to 30. 5 <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patient</b> years at risk in 2001). Antibiotic prescribing for sore throat declined between 1995 (80. 6 <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patient</b> years at risk) and 1999 and has since remained static (42. 1 <b>per</b> 1000 <b>patient</b> years at risk in 2001). Trimethoprim was the most commonly used antibiotic for episodes of uncomplicated cystitis and the prescription of 3 day (or less) courses has increased from 16. 4 per cent in 1998 to 41. 5 per cent in 2001. Conclusions For the SMAC recommendation to limit pre-scribing for uncomplicated cystitis to 3 days in otherwise fit women there has been demonstrable impact since the publication of the SMAC report.

40|$|Introduction. Atrial {{fibrillation}} {{increases the}} risk of ischemic stroke five fold, while the application of long-term anticoagulant therapy is associated with the occurrence of hemorrhagic complications. The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation during antithrombotic treatment. Material and Methods. The study included 504 patients that were administered the primary (n= 345) or secondary thromboprophylaxis after ischemic stroke (n= 159), by applying vitamin K antagonists, or the combination of vitamin K antagonists and low-dose aspirin. The patients were followed for five months in the period of 24 years from 1988 to 2012, the total number of patient’s years being 1884, at the Clinical Center of Vojvodina. Thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications were registered during regular check-up examinations. Results and Discussion. Our results indicate the low incidence of thromboembolic complications (0. 01 <b>patient</b> <b>per</b> a year), with a lower incidence in the vitamin K antagonists group than in the group with the combination of vitamin K antagonists and aspirin (0. 008 <b>patient</b> <b>per</b> a year versus 0. 01 <b>patient</b> <b>per</b> a year). The incidence of hemorrhagic complications was higher in the group with the combined treatment compared to the group treated with vitamin K antagonists (0. 1 <b>patient</b> <b>per</b> a year versus 0. 06 <b>patient</b> <b>per</b> a year). The frequency of major bleeding was as low as 0. 01 <b>patient</b> <b>per</b> a year and more frequent in the group with combined treatment (0. 03 <b>patient</b> <b>per</b> a year). Conclusion.

2500|$|Doctors and {{hospitals}} are generally funded by payments from patients and insurance plans {{in return for}} services rendered (fee-for-service or FFS).
