5|$|The Altiplano {{started to}} form during the Eocene, when {{subduction}} of the Nazca <b>Plate</b> beneath the South American <b>Plate</b> caused compression along the <b>plate</b> margin. Strong volcanism and tectonic uplift occurred between 15and 20million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} Japan {{are located in}} a {{volcanic}} zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over {{hundreds of millions of}} years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene {{as a result of the}} subduction of the Philippine Sea <b>Plate</b> beneath the continental Amurian <b>Plate</b> and Okinawa <b>Plate</b> to the south, and subduction of the Pacific <b>Plate</b> under the Okhotsk <b>Plate</b> to the north. The Boso Triple Junction off the coast of Japan is a triple junction where the North American <b>Plate,</b> the Pacific <b>Plate</b> and the Philippine Sea <b>Plate</b> meets. Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|A gold <b>plating</b> {{process in}} the {{electronics}} industry can be classified as (i) all surface <b>plating</b> or (ii) selective <b>plating.</b> Selective <b>plating</b> is more widely used than all surface <b>plating</b> because it can save more gold used in the <b>plating</b> process and takes less <b>plating</b> time. In this research, the selective <b>plating</b> process called jet <b>plating</b> was studied. Factors that possibly affected the gold usage and <b>plating</b> voltage were also studied to reduce the production cost. These factors included (a) <b>plating</b> temperature, (b) crystal (inhibitor) amount, (c) distance between workpiece and anode, (d) <b>plating</b> current and (e) <b>plating</b> speed. A two-level Full Factorial design with center points was first performed to screen the factors. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was then employed to optimize the factors in jet <b>plating.</b> The amount of gold usage should be reduced to 0. 366 g / 10, 000 pieces, the <b>plating</b> speed should be increased to 4 m/min and the <b>plating</b> voltage should not exceed 8. 0 V. According to the analysis, the optimal settings should be as follows: the <b>plating</b> temperature at 55. 5 deg C, the crystal amount at 90 %, the distance at 0. 5 mm, the <b>plating</b> current at 2. 8 A, and the <b>plating</b> speed at 4. 5 m/min. This optimal setting led to gold usage of 0. 350 g / 10, 000 pieces and a <b>plating</b> voltage of 7. 16 V. Confirmation runs of 30 experiments at the optimal conditions were then performed. It {{was found that the}} gold usage and the <b>plating</b> voltage of the confirmation runs were not different from the optimized gold usage and <b>plating</b> voltage. The optimal condition was then applied in production, which could reduce the gold usage by 4. 5 % and increase the <b>plating</b> speed by 12. 5 % while the <b>plating</b> voltage did not exceed the limit...|$|R
5|$|At the {{latitude}} of Incapillo, the Nazca <b>plate</b> subducting beneath the South America <b>plate</b> abruptly shallows towards the south. This shallowing forms the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic Zone and the magmatically inactive Pampean flat slab region farther south. This magmatic inactivity occurs because the flat slab removes the asthenospheric wedge.|$|E
5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>plating</b> {{chemistry}} on palladium deposition, <b>plating</b> efficiency and membrane microstructure {{have been studied}} for two palladium electroless <b>plating</b> solutions, hydrazine-based and hypophosphite-based <b>plating</b> baths.

40|$|Abstract Retrofitting by <b>plating</b> {{structures}} {{has been}} found to be very efficient. However, tests have shown that externally bonded longitudinal <b>plates</b> are prone to premature debonding. Furthermore, a comprehensive study of published research has also shown that there can be large discrepancies between debonding mathematical models and tests. To overcome this problem and to allow structural engineers to adhesively bond <b>plates</b> with safety and efficiently, a structural engineering approach is suggested whereby many of the debonding mechanisms can be prevented by judicious detailing; this approach can be applied to tension face <b>plates,</b> compression face <b>plates,</b> side <b>plates,</b> U-sectioned <b>plates,</b> and angle-sectioned <b>plates.</b> Four continuous reinforced concrete beams have been retrofitted with adhesively bonded longitudinal <b>plates</b> and tested in order to illustrate this design approach, to directly compare the performance of longitudinal side <b>plates</b> with longitudinal tension face <b>plates,</b> to compare FRP <b>plating</b> with steel <b>plating,</b> and in particular to illustrate the effect of debonding on the sectional ductility of longitudinally <b>plated</b> continuous RC beams.

25|$|Another {{advantage}} is that mechanical <b>plating</b> evenly coats all surfaces and features, unlike electroplating which has issues <b>plating</b> recesses. Mechanical <b>plating</b> can evenly coat up to 75 μm thick. For thicker <b>plating</b> mechanical <b>plating</b> is especially cost advantageous versus electroplating, because the cycle time does not increase much for the thicker <b>plating,</b> unlike electroplating.|$|R
5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific <b>Plate</b> and North American <b>Plate</b> is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda <b>Plate</b> is converging with the North American <b>Plate</b> at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda <b>Plate</b> are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E

5|$|The Andean Volcanic Belt {{consists}} of three main volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone (from 2° N to 5° S), the Central Volcanic Zone (16° to 28° S) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (33° to 46° S). Active volcanism occurs where the Nazca <b>Plate</b> subducts beneath the South American <b>Plate.</b> The plates are separated by shallower subduction zones, with no present-day volcanism. These shallower zones {{have been attributed to}} the high speed of the <b>plate</b> collision, the young age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the curvature of the subducting <b>plate.</b> The most plausible theory is that variations in buoyancy of a subducting <b>plate</b> creates a flat subduction zone. The Cocos, Juan Fernandez and Nazca Ridges are associated with such volcanic gaps where they collide with the oceanic trench. The subduction of spreading ridges can also diminish volcanism, as observed in the Chile Rise further south. The buoyancy of these crustal structures may hinder subduction, reducing water supply to the mantle and inducing the formation of melts.|$|E
5|$|The Willamette River basin {{was created}} {{primarily}} by <b>plate</b> tectonics and volcanism and was altered by erosion and sedimentation, including some related to enormous glacial floods as recent as 13,000years ago.
