5|$|Acetic acid is a {{chemical}} reagent for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> chemical compounds.

5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, {{if there is no}} increase in productive resources, increasing <b>production</b> <b>of</b> a first good entails decreasing <b>production</b> <b>of</b> a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> the second good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing <b>production</b> <b>of</b> the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.|$|E
