In contrast to <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>char,</b> the addition of HTC char increased respiration and enhanced the growth of fungi. The addition of glucose to soil-char mixtures containing either pyrolysis or HTC char induced an additional increase of respiration, but was 35 % and 39 % lower compared to soil-glucose mixtures, respectively, providing evidence for a negative priming effect. No significant difference was observed comparing the soil mixtures containing pyrolysis char+glucose and HTC char+glucose. The addition of glucose stimulated the growth of most microbial taxa under study, especially of Actinobacteria at the expense of fungi. Adding pyrolysis or HTC char to soil induced a decline of all microbial taxa but did not modify the microbial community structure significantly. Addition of pyrolysis or HTC char in combination with glucose however, increased the abundance of Actinobacteria and reduced the relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Betaproteobacteria while fungi were further increased in case of HTC char.

40|$|To {{improve the}} design and {{operation}} of a biomass gasifier, mathematical modelling is important and helpful. In this dissertation, the physical and chemical processes occuring in the gasifier are investigated, Three models for different proto-types and purposes are formulated. Balance Model: Chemical equilibrium is assumed in this model. The equilibrium compositions and adiabatic flame temperature are calculated by "equilibrium constant method" and "mass and energy balance". The simple algorithm can get convergence rapidly. Using this model, air, steam, oxygen, hydro and steam-external-heat-supplied gasification are studied under different operational conditions. One-Dimensional model for Circulating-Fluidized Bed Gasifier: The model {{is a combination of}} "balance model" and "Kinetic model". In the char oxidation zone, which is composed of circulating char and hot sand, balance model mentioned above is used to calculate the temperature and gas compositions. In the pyrolysis-reduction zone, kinetic model is developed, which incorporates mass and energy convervation, kinetics of wood fast <b>pyrolysis,</b> <b>char</b> reduction and water-gas shift reaction. The model can be used to predict the necessary dimensions for this kind of gasifier. One-Dimensional model for Up-Draft Gasifier: The important processes considered are conventive heat and mass transfer between gas and solid phase, heat conduction of the solid phase, kinetics of wood slow <b>pyrolysis,</b> <b>char</b> reduction, char oxidation and has phase reactions. The conduction term in the energy equation has empirically accounted for particle-particle radiative heat transfer by "effective thermal conductivity" of the solid phase. In the high-temperature packed-bed reactor, where gas and solid flow rate is low, the conductive and radiactive heat transfer may be as important as conventive heat transfer. The overlooking of these processes will cause numerical stiffness of the differantional equations describing mass and energy conservation. The set of second-order, non-linear differentional equations and auxiliary algebraic equations are integrated along the reactor height, yielding the temperature profile, gas composition and carbon conversion profile. Gas and solid phase residence time are also calculated. 本文应用固体生物质热化学转换基础理论研究的知识，结合化学热力学、化学动力学、流动与混合、传热与传质的有关知识，建立了固体生物质气化器的平衡模型、载汉床气化器一维数学模型和固定床气化器一维数学模型，应用上述模型，研究了各种气化方案的运行条件和气化效果，分析计算了载流床气化器和固定床气化器的合适的气化器尺寸，模型的建立对于发展固体生物质气化器的设计理论有重要的意义...|$|E

Using the single droplet apparatus and the procedures developed, true gas formation rate data were determined under conditions simulating those in kraft recovery processes. The mass spectrometer allowed the formation rates of several compounds to be determined simultaneously. All major permanent, hydrocarbon, and sulphurous pyrolysis gases, with the exception of H$ sb 2 $, were determined, along with <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>char</b> and tar yields. The rate data reveal that sulphurous gas formation occurs relatively early as compared to that of the other gases determined. The data also reveal that pyrolysis gases are formed during droplet drying. While CH$ sb 3 $SH and CH$ sb 3 $SCH$ sb 3 $ yields decrease sharply with temperature, and those of H$ sb 2 $S and CH$ sb 2 $SSCH$ sb 3 $ remain quite constant, the CS$ sb 2 $ formation increases to a significant level at 900 $ sp circ$C. The yields of ethane and methanol also decrease sharply with temperature, but those for ethylene, methane, CO, and CO$ sb 2 $ correspondingly increase.

The presence of adsorbed elemental sodium in black liquor pyrolysis chars was found to be responsible for the pyrophoric nature of some chars. This reduced sodium reacts with water to produce hydrogen. In a recovery boiler, sufficient hydrogen could be formed to produce an explosive mixture above the char bed, which upon detonation could trigger a smelt-water explosion.

40|$|Pyrolysis is an {{attractive}} alternative for the conversion of solid fuels to valuable chemicals and bio-fuels. In order to obtain more H 2 and syngas from pyrolysis of coal and biomass, microwave has been adopted to enhance the co-pyrolysis of coal and biomass, which has been investigated systematically in this study. Firstly, conventional pyrolysis of coal and biomass was carried out using a vertical tube furnace. Characterizations of pyrolytic gas, liquid and solid products were conducted to study the different properties of products from the pyrolysis of coal and biomass. More gas products were produced at higher temperatures and biomass samples produced more H 2 and syngas than coals. Bio-oils produced from conventional pyrolysis of biomass samples have relatively simpler compositions compared with those produced from conventional pyrolysis of coals. Char samples produced from conventional pyrolysis of coal and biomass samples show different morphologies due to the different nature of original coal and biomass. Secondly, microwave-induced pyrolysis of coal and biomass was carried out and compared {{with the results of}} conventional pyrolysis. Microwave-induced pyrolysis was found to produce pyrolytic gas products with higher contents of H 2 and syngas than conventional pyrolysis. The bio-oils produced from microwave-induced pyrolysis were not as complicated as those from conventional pyrolysis. The reason for this is believed to be that both microwave irradiation and the longer residence time favour more complete decomposition of large hydrocarbon molecules in coal and biomass, which subsequently results in less complicated composition compared with bio-oil produced via conventional <b>pyrolysis.</b> <b>Char</b> samples from microwave-induced pyrolysis undergo more complete pyrolysis than char samples from conventional pyrolysis, and results in less volatiles remaining.

No significant difference in crystallinity was observed for the chars from different size fractions of the parent coals, while more crystallinity was observed for the chars from demineralized coals, which suggests that minerals in the coal play a role in the reduction of char crystallinity during <b>pyrolysis.</b> <b>Char</b> reactivity for raw coals decreased with the increasing of the particle size. For the demineralized coal samples, the change in char reactivity with the increasing of the particle size was reduced. Both the secondary reactions of volatiles and mineral distribution are believed to cause the influence of coal particle size on char reactivity...|$|E
40|$|While the {{operational}} conditions of a fluidized bed {{are known to}} influence the fuel axial mixing, {{the effect of the}} resulting axial location of the fuel particles on the char gasification rate remains unexplored. In this work, a laboratory-scale bubbling fluidized bed was used to investigate how the gasification rate of biomass char was influenced by the fuel axial location (during <b>pyrolysis</b> and <b>char</b> gasification), the <b>pyrolysis</b> atmosphere, the fuel size, and the fuel concentration. When pyrolysis at the bed surface was followed by char gasification inside the dense bed the char gasification rate was up to 2 -fold lower than the other combinations of the fuel axial location, which held similar rates. Cooling the <b>char</b> after <b>pyrolysis</b> decreased the <b>char</b> gasification rate in all cases studied. The gasification rate increased when the fuel particle size was decreased, and its dependence on the degree of char conversion was also affected. Thus, {{the operational}} conditions of a fluidized bed reactor, through modified fuel axial mixing, can influence the char gasification rate. Furthermore, experimental determination of reactivity data in laboratory-scale systems must account for the axial location of the fuel at the desired end-scale, using similar fuel particle sizes...|$|R

The pyrolysis products are those formed by the thermal degradation of nylon-phenolic resin and silicone elastomer composites. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} nature and extent of chemical reactions of the pyrolysis products and the char, along with the energy absorbed by the combined <b>pyrolysis</b> and <b>char</b> zone. Chemical reactions with thermodynamically consistent kinetic data are determined in order to develop a realistic analysis for predicting the thermal performance of ablative heat shields...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} {{of a solid}} in burning is a complex process. It involves flame heat transfer, evaporation or <b>pyrolysis,</b> possibly <b>charring,</b> and transient thermal effects. Although specific models have been developed, they are limited to classes of materials and do not apply. in general. Test apparatuses, such as the Cone Calorimeter, provide a means for dynamically measuring the mass loss and energy release of solid materials, but {{the interpretation of the}} data is limited by the lack of a simple model. The purpose of this presentation is to describe a simple model that represents 'the significant effects in 'the burning of a solid, and to use that as a potential means for analyzing burning rate data...|$|R
