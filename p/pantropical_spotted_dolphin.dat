25|$|The {{dolphins}} are hunted as food, {{for their}} teeth, and for live export. The teeth of certain species have a value for trade, brideprice ceremonial traditions, funeral feasts, and compensation. The teeth of melon-headed whale were traditionally the most desirable; however, they were over-hunted and became locally rare. The other species hunted are spinner dolphin and the <b>pantropical</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphin.</b> While Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) have been captured for live export, the Bottlenose Dolphin is not hunted as the teeth {{are not considered}} to have any value.|$|E
2500|$|Dolphin group sizes vary quite dramatically. River {{dolphins}} usually congregate {{in fairly}} small groups from 6 to 12 in number or, in some species, singly or in pairs. The individuals in these small groups know and recognize one another. Other {{species such as}} the oceanic <b>Pantropical</b> <b>Spotted</b> <b>Dolphin,</b> Common Dolphin and Spinner Dolphin travel in large groups of hundreds of individuals. It is unknown whether {{every member of the}} group is acquainted with every other. However, {{there is no doubt that}} such large packs can act as a single cohesive unitobservations show that if an unexpected disturbance, such as a shark approach, occurs from the flank or from beneath the group, the group moves in near-unison to avoid the threat. This means that the dolphins must be aware not only of their near neighbors but also of other individuals nearby in a similar manner to which humans perform [...] "Audience waves". This is achieved by sight, and possibly also echolocation. One speculative hypothesis proposed by Jerison (1986) is that members of a pod of dolphins are able to share echolocation results with each other to create a better understanding of their surroundings.|$|E
50|$|Whale watchings {{are popular}} among {{the region to}} observe mainly Humpback Whales that come to warm, calm waters around the peni nsula during their {{migration}} seasons, and some species of <b>dolphins</b> such as <b>Pantropical</b> <b>Spotted</b> <b>Dolphins</b> and Spinner Dolphins can be found as well.|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Marine Mammal Protection Act {{requires}} that the abundance of marine mammals in U. S. waters be assessed. Because this requirement had not been met for {{a large portion of}} the North Atlantic Ocean (U. S. waters south of Maryland), a ship-based, line-transect survey was conducted with a 68 m research ship between Maryland (38. 00 °N) and central Florida (28. 00 °N) from the 10 -m isobath to the boundary of the U. S. Exclusive Economic Zone. The study area (573, 000 km 2) was surveyed between 8 July and 17 August 1998. Minimum abundance estimates were based on 4163 km of effort and 217 sightings of at least 13 cetacean species and other taxonomic categories. The most commonly sighted species (number of groups) were bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (38); sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus (29); Atlantic <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins,</b> Stenella frontalis (28); and Risso’s dolphins, Grampus griseus (22). The most abundant species (abundance; coeffi cient of variation) were Atlantic <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins</b> (14, 438; 0. 63); bottlenose dolphins (13, 085; 0. 40); <b>pantropical</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins,</b> S. attenuate (12, 747; 0. 56); striped dolphins, S. coeruleoalba (10, 225; 0. 91); and Risso’s dolphins (9533; 0. 50). The abundance estimate for the Clymene dolphin, S. clymene (6086; 0. 93), is the first for the U. S. Atlantic Ocean. Sperm whales were the most abundant large whale (1181; 0. 51).

40|$|Understanding {{gene flow}} and {{dispersal}} patterns {{is important for}} predicting effects of natural events and anthropogenic activities on animal populations. In Hawaii, most species of odontocetes are managed as single populations. Recent exceptions include false killer whales, spinner dolphins, and common bottlenose dolphins, for which studies have shown fidelity to individual islands or groups of islands. Our study focused on <b>pantropical</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins.</b> We analyzed mitochondrial control region and 11 microsatellite loci from 101 individuals from 4 areas: Hawaii, Maui/Lanai, Oahu, and Kauai/Niihau. We examined FST, F′ST, RST, Jost‘s D, and ΦST and used TESS to estimate number of populations and assignment probabilities. Our results support genetic differentiation among Hawaii, Maui/Lanai, and Oahu and suggest that <b>pantropical</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins</b> near Kauai/Niihau are likely transient and in low numbers. Between island regions, FST for microsatellites ranged from 0. 016 to 0. 045 and for mtDNA, from 0. 011 to 0. 282. F′ST, ranged from 0. 098 to 0. 262 for microsatellites and 0. 019 to 0. 415 for mtDNA. RST and ΦST showed similar results to FST for micro-satellites and mtDNA respectively, and Jost‘s D fell between FST and F′ST. TESS supported 3 populations, and greatest mean assign-ment probability by island region ranged from 0. 50 to 0. 72. The private alleles method indicated migration rates among regions from 1. 49 to 3. 45, and effective population size of the island of Hawaii {{was estimated to be}} 220. There was no strong evidence to support sex-biased dispersal or group fidelity. Considering this study in the larger context of other odontocete population studies and stud...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{published}} and unpublished {{information on the}} mortality of cetaceans in gillnets in Mexico, Central America and the wider Caribbean. Data on this incidental mortality are provided from only nine of the 36 nations in the area (Colombia, the Dominican Republic. French Guiana, Honduras, Mexico.

We surveyed those types of passive fishing gear which potentially or actually entrap cetaceans in this large area; these included gillnets with mesh sizes of 18 to 400 mm. At least 14 species of cetaceans have been caught in fishing nets in this area: vaquitas, common dolphins, bottlenose <b>dolphins,</b> tucuxis, Atlantic <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins,</b> spinner dolphins, clymene dolphins, Risso's dolphins, killer whales, pygmy sperm whales, botos, gray whales, humpback whales and balaenopterids.

40|$|Within the Gulf of Guinea {{high levels}} of fisheries-related {{cetacean}} mortality (bycatch and direct-capture) has been documented. For locally rare species such removals could potentially lead to significant population level effects. However, information on the cetacean abundance and distribution is scarce. Similarly, it remains largely unreported where fishing fleets operate offshore. A cetacean survey took place during geophysical surveys (2013 - 2014) along the coasts of Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. This provided {{a unique opportunity to}} study both offshore cetacean and fishing communities. Due to large group-sizes, melon-headed whales were the most abundant (0. 34 animals km- 1) followed by Fraser’s dolphins and short-finned pilot whales. Range state records were confirmed for melon-headed whale and Fraser’s dolphin in Ivoirian waters and ten further species represented first at-sea sightings. The artisanal fishing canoe was most abundant (92 % of all vessels) and recorded up to 99. 5 km from the Ghanaian coast. Asian trawlers operated over shelf areas and tuna purse-seine vessels in deep oceanic and slope waters. Fraser’s <b>dolphins,</b> melon-headed whales, <b>pantropical</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins,</b> bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales were recorded in areas with the highest fishing densities. Melon-headed whales, pilot whales and rough-toothed dolphins were observed in vicinity of trawlers; bottlenose <b>dolphins,</b> <b>pantropical</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dolphins</b> and pilot whales in vicinity of canoes. Some notable differences were found in the species composition between the present surveys and port-based surveys of landed cetaceans (bycatch/direct-captures). These may be explained by (1) feeding strategies (nocturnal vs. diurnal; surface vs. deep water); (2) different attractions to vessels/fishing gear; (3) variable body sizes; and (4) difficulty to positively identify species. Despite these differences, both cetaceans and fishing vessels predominantly occurred in shelf and slope waters (< 1, 000 m depth contour), making fishery-related mortality likely. The poor knowledge on population trends of cetaceans in this unique upwelling region, together with a high demand for cetacean products for human consumption (as ‘marine bushmeat’) may lead to a potential decline of some species that may go unnoticed. These new insights can provide a foundation for the urgently required risk assessments of cetacean mortality in fisheries within the northern Gulf of Guinea...|$|R
