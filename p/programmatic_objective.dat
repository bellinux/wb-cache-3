40|$|Abstract: The {{focus of}} {{effort in the}} ITER Engineering Design Activities (EDA) since 1998 has been the {{development}} of a new design to meet revised technical objectives and a cost reduction target of about 50 % of the previously accepted cost estimate. Drawing on the design solutions already developed and using the latest physics results and outputs from technology R&D projects, the Joint Central Team and Home Teams, working jointly, have been able to converge towards a new design which will allow the exploration of a range of burning plasma conditions, with a capacity to progress towards possible modes of steady state operation. As such the new ITER design, whilst having reduced technical objectives from its predecessor, will nonetheless meet the <b>programmatic</b> <b>objective</b> of providing an integrated demonstration of the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy. The main features of the current design and of its projected performance are introduced and the outlook for construction and operation is summarised. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Program (formerly know as Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative, ASCI) has led {{the world}} in {{capability}} computing {{for the last ten}} years. Capability computing is defined as a world-class platform (in the Top 10 of the Top 500. org list) with scientific simulations running at scale on the platform. Example systems are ASCI Red, Blue-Pacific, Blue-Mountain, White, Q, RedStorm, and Purple. ASC applications have scaled to multiple thousands of CPUs and accomplished a long list of mission milestones on these ASC capability platforms. However, the computing demands of the ASC and Stockpile Stewardship programs also include a vast number of smaller scale runs for day-to-day simulations. Indeed, every 'hero' capability run requires many hundreds to thousands of much smaller runs in preparation and post processing activities. In addition, there are many aspects of the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) that can be directly accomplished with these so-called 'capacity' calculations. The need for capacity is now so great within the program that it is increasingly difficult to allocate the computer resources required by the larger capability runs. To rectify the current 'capacity' computing resource shortfall, the ASC program has allocated {{a large portion of the}} overall ASC platforms budget to 'capacity' systems. In addition, within the next five to ten years the Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for major nuclear weapons systems must be accomplished. These LEPs and other SSP programmatic elements will further drive the need for capacity calculations and hence 'capacity' systems as well as future ASC capability calculations on 'capability' systems. To respond to this new workload analysis, the ASC program will be making a large sustained strategic investment in these capacity systems over the next ten years, starting with the United States Government Fiscal Year 2007 (GFY 07). However, given the growing need for 'capability' systems as well, the budget demands are extreme and new, more cost effective ways of fielding these systems must be developed. This Tri-Laboratory Linux Capacity Cluster (TLCC) procurement represents the ASC first investment vehicle in these capacity systems. It also represents a new strategy for quickly building, fielding and integrating many Linux clusters of various sizes into classified and unclassified production service through a concept of Scalable Units (SU). The <b>programmatic</b> <b>objective</b> is to dramatically reduce the overall Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of these 'capacity' systems relative to the best practices in Linux Cluster deployments today. This objective only makes sense in the context of these systems quickly becoming very robust and useful production clusters under the crushing load that will be inflicted on them by the ASC and SSP scientific simulation capacity workload...|$|E

The criminal violation of trust theory guided the study as it provides healthcare leaders {{with an understanding of}} the portion of the fraud triangle over which they have the most control to combat fraud: the opportunity to commit fraud.

The context is the growing numbers of students, demands and expectations made on Study Abroad programs. Approach and Methodology The survey was carried out by analyzing publicly available data and information, as it would be available to students, of all the accredited institutions of higher education within the six States of New England. Findings The findings confirm that albeit for Community Colleges, the vast majority of institutions offer Study Abroad programs. However this survey also revealed the important role providers are playing in offering generic programs to students from multiple institutions. Research Limitations/ implications The findings call for further investigation into Institutional strategies concerning the choice of programs, particularly those involving providers who potentially imply loosing tuition and control over educational outcomes. Limitations are discussed suggesting the need to widen the geographical area studied as well as analyzing in more detail the Community College offerings that are not easily accessible with the methodology I used in this study. The findings also raise some questions and future avenues of research particularly in the area of examining the integration of generic Study Abroad programs within particular institutional and <b>programmatic</b> <b>objectives.</b> It is also suggested that {{further research is needed to}} better evaluate if/how Study Abroad programs are designed to capitalize on the employability advantage they offer to participating students when they enter the job market. Original value The number of US students participating in Study Abroad programs is expected to continue to grow and it seems these programs will become part of mainstream offerings in most institutions. Similar trends are observed in Europe between member states. Besides giving a broad overview of the current offerings, this pilot study principally reveals several important avenues for future research that should help institutions in their choices of programs and the orientation they give to Study Abroad...|$|R

Within Phase 1 of the W- 314 project, the waste transfer system upgrades are further broken down into six major packages which align with the project`s work breakdown structure. Each of these six sub-elements includes the design, procurement, and construction activities necessary to accomplish the specific tank farm upgrades contained within the package. The first design package (AN Valve Pit Upgrades) was completed in November 1997, and the associated design verification activities are documented in HNF- 1893.
