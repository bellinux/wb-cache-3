This fighting gives way to play-chasing {{with the development of}} running skills at 4–5 weeks. Wolf pups possess more-developed jaw muscles from 2 weeks of age, when they first show signs of <b>play-fighting</b> with their siblings; serious fighting occurs during 4–6 weeks of age. Compared to wolf and dog pups, golden jackal pups develop aggression at the age of 4–6 weeks, when <b>play-fighting</b> frequently escalates into uninhibited biting intended to harm. This aggression ceases by 10–12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed. Once the lactation period concludes, the female drives off the pups. Pups born late remain with their mother until early autumn, at which time they leave either singly or in groups of two to four individuals. Females reach sexual maturity after 10–11 months and males at 21–22 months.|$|E

[...] Later that night, returning from hospital after an injury sustained to his foot while <b>play-fighting</b> backstage with manager Steve O'Rourke, Waters spoke with music producer Bob Ezrin, and a friend of Ezrin's, a psychiatrist sharing their car, about the feelings of alienation he was experiencing on the tour.

[...] While Gilmour and Wright were in France recording solo albums, and Nick Mason was busy producing Steve Hillage's Green, Waters began to write new material.

5000|$|The {{time spent}} observing groundhogs by field {{biologists}} represents {{only a small}} fraction of time devoted to the field research. W.J. Schoonmaker reports that groundhogs may hide when they see, smell or hear the observer. Ken Armitage, marmot researcher, states that the social biology of the groundhog is well understudied.Despite their heavy-bodied appearance, groundhogs are accomplished swimmers and occasionally climb trees when escaping predators or when they want to survey their surroundings. They prefer to retreat to their burrows when threatened; if the burrow is invaded, the groundhog tenaciously defends itself with its two large incisors and front claws. Groundhogs are generally agonistic and territorial among their own species, and may skirmish to establish dominance.Outside their burrow, individuals are alert when not actively feeding. It is common to see one or more nearly-motionless individuals standing erect on their hind feet watching for danger. When alarmed, they use a high-pitched whistle to warn the rest of the colony, hence the name [...] "whistle-pig". Groundhogs may squeal when fighting, seriously injured, or caught by a predator. Other sounds groundhogs may make are low barks and a sound produced by grinding their teeth. When groundhogs are frightened, the hairs of the tail stand straight up, giving the tail the appearance of a hair brush. David P. Barash wrote he witnessed only two occasions of upright <b>play-fighting</b> among woodchucks and that the upright posture of <b>play-fighting</b> involves sustained physical contact between individuals and may require a degree of social tolerance virtually unknown in M. monax. He said it was possible to conclude, alternatively, that upright <b>play-fighting</b> is part of the woodchuck's behavioral repertory but rarely shown because of physical spacing and/or low social tolerance.|$|E

40|$|Not all {{fighting}} or {{aggression in}} young children is bad, and some kinds of teacher intervention may be beneficial. <b>Play-fighting</b> refers primarily to rough and tumble play and chasing, and several {{studies have shown that}} play and serious fighting can be clearly distinguished {{in young children}}. Numerous authors have pointed out the value and positive aspects of aggression. Aggressive behavior is often the most immediate way for a child to communicate his or her desires and needs, and teachers need to try to understand what children are communicating rather than judge their behavior. <b>Play-fighting</b> is a very common occurrence among boys, and seems to occur less with girls. Girls who display aggressive behavior have generally been socialized like boys. Boys often use aggressive behavior and <b>play-fighting</b> to make friends, exhibit frustration due to failure at making friends, and to become more assertive and overcome their fear of aggressive boys. It is crucial for adults and teachers to encourage children to respond to aggression by asserting their feelings with statements such as "Stop it " or "I don't like that, " rather than by simply hitting back or running to the teacher. A child's self-esteem can build when encouraged to take responsibility for his or her own feelings. Teachers can play a positive role in assisting children to express and channel their aggressive behavior.

Patterns of sparring, kicking and wrestling occur between mothers and young (especially males), in formalized contests between males, and in escalated conflicts over resources (shelter, water, oestrous females). Observations were made of fighting behaviour in free-living and captive individuals. The frequency of fighting between various age/sex classes in the field was determined {{and the structure of}} fighting over a water resource was analysed from a 12 h videotape record. These results were compared with an analysis of 85 videotaped plus 35 other fights observed in a captive group of eight males (age 1 - 7 year). These fights were formalized contests  which did not involve or resolve any immediate conflict over a resource. Such fights share many of the properties ascribed to <b>play-fighting.</b> They are initiated with invitational behaviour that does not include characteristic threat behaviour seen in fights over a resource. They involve self-handicapping, some lack of dominance distinctions, and usually several bouts occur interrupted by mutual pauses. The structure of the fight suggests that the main goal is to push or wrestle the opponent off balance and down to the ground rather than inflict potentially injurious kicks as seen in resource conflicts. Furthermore larger opponents often adopt an inferior flat-footed stance and dominants and/or winners kick significantly less than losers. The  context, goals and structure of these non-resource based fights suggest that they are a form of <b>play-fighting.</b> Selection of play partners on the basis of size/dominance or kinship indicate that such <b>play-fighting</b> in red kangaroos is neither truly cooperative nor disruptive and selfish. The behaviour most likely functions as a form of non-damaging assessment of opponents with benefits in skill development in younger individuals...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this qualitative, {{descriptive}} study was to obtain insight into how Grade 9 learners (average age of 15 years) in a secondary rural school conceptualise school violence. The study was framed by a social constructionism paradigm, focusing on the co-construction of knowledge and meanings by the researcher and participants through personal engagement. Bronfenbrenner‟s Bioecological Theory of Human Development, operationalised by the Process-Person-Context-Time Model, provided a theoretical grounding for the inquiry. An instrumental case study design was followed, whereby nine Grade 9 learners (4 boys and 5 girls) in a rural secondary school participating in an academic service learning project were conveniently selected as the unit of study. Qualitative data from a focus group and task-based activities were transcribed, whilst participant observations were documented in a research journal through photographs. Constructivist grounded theory principles guided the thematic analysis. Three primary themes emerged: Violence as behaviour; Violence as experience and Power and authority. Findings indicate that school violence was perpetuated by both peers and teachers, in physical and verbal forms. Corporal punishment {{continued to be a}} prevalent strategy for maintaining discipline and authority within the school. It was also evident in the findings that learners differentiated between acts of school violence and <b>play-fighting</b> according to the intentions and responses of those involved. Contradictory sentiments regarding the acceptability of school violence emerged. On the one hand participants wanted school violence to stop, describing it as hurtful. However, they also expressed views that when used by someone in authority for the purpose of discipline or protection, school violence was appropriate and acceptable. Therefore, the current study suggests that participants view school violence in a duplicitous role – used negatively to cause harm, but also positively to enforce order and protect. This study contributes to literature by providing youth-generated conceptualisations of school violence. Dissertation (MEd) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Groups of {{translocated}} orphaned juvenile African elephants {{were studied}} in holding pens and following their release {{to assess how}} they re-organize and restructure socially by adopting roles, and if they show behavioural signs of stress. An adult female adopted a young individual. In all groups allomothering was observed to some degree. One 5 year old female prematurely {{assumed the role of}} leader and this role appears to be learned. Most groups established a linear dominance hierarchy. Placing the trunk tip into a partner's mouth correlated with <b>play-fighting</b> and aggression. This behaviour is suggested to be one of appeasement to reduce aggressive motivation and prevent escalation thereof, and that the behaviour is ritualised. Four possible evolutionary steps are presented. Nearest Neighbour analyses illustrated the changing social positions of some juveniles relative to other individuals. Tight grouping was assumed to indicate insecurity. There was a marked difference in behaviour pattern during resting times. Groups without adults were within touching distance of one another whilst resting. In a group containing an adult female some juveniles dispersed more and some juveniles formed a subgroup. It appears that dominance hierarchies, individual social relationships and caretaking of young were important factors which affected group cohesion and could influence a more central position within a group. Certain behaviour patterns were defined as being stress related and compared among the groups. There was a significant decrease in arousal behaviour after the introduction of an adult female. Aggressive behaviour was the most frequent behaviour in four groups whilst penned and following their release. Play behaviour was absent in three penned groups, and tended to gradually increase following the release. Temporal gland secretion occurred during excitement, anticipation and nervousness. Secretion occurred in all age and sex classes. Females tend to secrete more frequently than males and older individuals more than younger ones. Frustrated or stressed animals vocalized more frequently than relaxed ones, as did calves below 2 years of age who tended to use louder calls, than older juveniles. Acoustical analyses of four vocalizations are presented. Very young individuals appear to vocalize using marginally higher frequencies. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 1997.
