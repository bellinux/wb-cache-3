In London especially, the aged ale would take on a tart note from a secondary fermentation with brettanomyces yeast which was present either in the <b>pitching</b> <b>yeast</b> or in the wooden equipment. Because of the time required for the aging process, some investors would buy mild ale from brewers, age it into old ale, and sell it at the higher price. Eventually, brewers began to keep some beer behind at the brewery, age it themselves and sell it to the pubs. In some cases old ale was a blend of young and old.

40|$|The liquid {{equivalent}} of universal beer agar, designated universal beer liquid medium, and its beer-free equivalent, universal liquid medium (UL), were equally effective in demonstrating bacterial contamination in 120 of 200 samples from {{different stages of}} a commercial brewing process.

A yeast-water substrate medium failed to reveal many contaminants detected with UL in 392 samples from three breweries and revealed only a few not detected with UL. The use of UL and a lactose-peptone medium, with microscope examination of the media for bacterial growth, permitted detection of 93 % of the known contaminants compared to 87 % detected with UL alone; this combination or universal beer liquid medium plus lactose-peptone medium can therefore be recommended {{for the detection of}} bacterial contaminants in brewery samples.

40|$|Industrial <b>pitching</b> <b>yeast</b> for {{production}} of alcoholic beverages or fuel ethanol should ferment the sugars fast and completely. Fresh optimal propagated yeast can normally fulfill these industrial demands. However, cropped, treated, stored or dried yeast is {{in most cases}} not a good <b>pitching</b> <b>yeast</b> due to its bad physiological condition. The amount of storage polysaccharides - glycogen and trehalose - can be too low, the fluidity of the membrane for active transport of fermentable sugars can be insufficient, ATP regeneration can be too slow and the enzymes for glycolysis can have limited activity. Quality parameters for yeast are viability and vitality. Vitality is a measure for the metabolic capacity of the yeast. Yeast with high vitality can ferment well under stress conditions such as high temperature, high alcohol concentration, osmotic pressure and hydrostatic pressure. <b>Pitching</b> <b>yeast</b> with the same viability can have a completely different fermentation capacity. Most of the methods described in literature for determination of viability and vitality of yeast were tested by us. For the study of industrial yeasts, the following methods were used: plating (as a reference method for the viability), methylene blue staining (microscope and Cellometer), fluorescence flow cytometry with propidiumjodide-Syto 13 and determination of intracellular pH (ICP) and number of scars. The ICP is important for glycolysis and glucogenesis and thus for metabolic capacity of the yeast. The ICP is determined with the pH-sensitive SNARF fluorochrome. Average bud scar numbers are counted microscopically after Calcofluor white staining and allow cell age estimation of yeast. A further complication of industrial fermentations is that the exact composition of the fermentation liquid is not known. Even if the yeast is in good condition, fermentation can stuck due to shortening of zinc, essential amino acids and fatty acids. Also the sugar spectrum can be out of balance, yeast inhibitors present in the fermentation liquid or the fermentation liquid can have a PYF (Premature Yeast Flocculation) potential. We have shown for brewery fermentations that the differences between industrial used yeasts are huge, even under the same fermentation conditions, showing {{the importance of a}} good yeast management and the need for more investigation in this field. By using good prepared <b>pitching</b> <b>yeast</b> with the necessary metabolic capacity and by adapting the composition of the fermentation liquid, it is possible to guarantee successful fermentation. Case studies of industrial yeast fermentations will provide the essential information needed therefore. Especially for new industrial fermentations, as high gravity, short, and simultaneous saccharification fermentations, yeast quality and composition of the fermentation liquid are critical. This stresses the need for good control of the latter to solve the fermentation problems...|$|E
40|$|For beer wort {{fermentation}} {{the addition}} of unsaturated fatty acids has sometimes been suggested {{as an alternative to}} wort oxygenation. This can however negatively affect the synthesis of acetate esters and consequently beer flavour. This work investigates the effect of supplementing a cropped yeast with an unsaturated fatty acid on the fermentation performance of the <b>pitching</b> <b>yeast.</b> Cropped yeast is in a different physiological state to yeast pitched in unfermented wort. Using a synthetic medium for the fermentations, {{it was found that the}} incubation of cropped yeast with linoleic acid resulted in two important changes in the yeasts composition: (1) the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to total fatty acids increased from 0. 53 to 0. 66 and (2) the ratio of trehalose to glycogen increased from 0. 17 to 0. 49. The performance of this yeast in subsequent fermentations was compared to unsupplemented yeast under three conditions: medium pre-aeration, de-aerated medium and de-aerated medium with newly added unsaturated fatty acid. It was found that the supplemented <b>pitching</b> <b>yeast</b> showed growth, attenuation and ethanol formation profiles similar to those obtained with unsupplemented yeast in pre-aerated medium, which simulated the normal brewing practice. Compared to fermentations with unsaturated fatty acids added to the medium, the supplemented cropped yeast did not induce a reduction in acetate ester synthesis. Results indicated that the supplementation of cropped yeast with unsaturated fatty acids could be an interesting alternative to wort oxygenation to restore the optimal membrane fluidity of the yeast. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|An ultrasensitive chemiluminescent enzyme {{immunoassay}} (CLEIA) {{was developed for}} the rapid detection and quantification of Lactobacillus brevis contaminants in beer and <b>pitching</b> <b>yeast</b> (Saccharomyces cerevisiae slurry collected for reinoculation). L. brevis cells trapped on a 47 -mm nucleopore membrane (0. 4 -micron pore size) were reacted with a peroxidase-labelled Lactobacillus group E antibody and then subjected to an enhanced CLEIA analysis with 4 -iodophenol as the enhancer. The combination of a nucleopore membrane with low background characteristics that enables the antigen-antibody reaction to proceed through the pores of the membrane and a labelled antibody prepared by the maleimide hinge method with minimal nonspecific binding characteristics was essential to minimize background in the detection of single cells. An ultrahigh sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) camera equipped with a fiber optics image intensifier permitted the imaging of single cells. A clear correlation existed {{between the number of}} luminescent spots observed and the plate count [y (CLEIA) = 0. 990 x (plate count) + 15. 9, where n = 7, r = 0. 993, and P < 0. 001]. Microscopic observation confirmed that the luminescent spots were produced by single cells. This assay could be used to detect approximately 20 L. brevis cells in 633 ml of beer within 4 h. Our ultrasensitive CLEIA could also be used to detect microcolonies approximately 20 microns in diameter which had formed on a membrane after 15 to 18 h of incubation. This method, which we called the microcolony immunoluminescence (MIL) method, increased the signal-to-noise ratio dramatically. The MIL method could be used to detect a 10 (0) level of L. brevis contamination in 633 ml of beer and a 1 / 10 (8) level of L. brevis contamination in <b>pitching</b> <b>yeast</b> within 1 day (15 to 18 h to form microcolonies and 2 h for CLEIA) ...|$|E

40|$|Mead is a {{traditional}} drink that contains 8 % and 18 % (v/v) of ethanol, resulting from the alcoholic fermentation of diluted honey by yeasts. Mead fermentation is a time-consuming process {{and the quality of}} the final product is highly variable. Therefore, the present investigation had two main objectives: first, to determine the adequate inoculum size of two commercial wine-making strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the optimisation of mead fermentation; and second, to determine if an increase in <b>yeast</b> <b>pitching</b> rates in batch fermentations altered the resulting aroma profiles. Minor differences were detected in the growth kinetics between the two strains at the lowest pitching rate. With increasing pitching rates net growth of the strain ICV D 47 progressively decreased, whereas for the QA 23 the increasing inoculum size had no influence on its net growth. The time required to reach the same stage of fermentation ranged from 24 to 96 h depending on the inoculum size. The final aroma composition was dependent on the yeast strain and inoculum size. Fourteen of the twenty-seven volatile compounds quantified could contribute to mead aroma and flavour because their concentrations rose above their respective thresholds. The formation of these compounds was particularly pronounced at low pitching rates, except in mead fermented by strain ICV D 47, at 106 CFUs/mL. The esters isoamyl acetate, ethyl octanoate and ethyl hexanoate were the major powerful odourants found in the meads. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that yeast strain and inoculum size can favourably impact mead’s flavour and aroma profiles.

In this work, a brewer yeast strain was submitted to high gravity fermentations to evaluate the influence and the limits of the environmental parameters on the fermentation performance and final product profile. The variables included in this study were the primary fermentation temperature, wort concentration (extract) and <b>yeast</b> <b>pitching</b> rate. Static fermentations were carried out anaerobically in 2 L tall tubes (EBC recommendation for small scale brewing fermentations) with 15, 18 and 22 ºP wort, at constant temperature of 12, 15 and 18 ºC. The yeast was grown aerobically at 27 ºC in 15 ºP wort (saturated with air) and collect by filtration to inoculate by mass at different pitching rates of 12, 18 and 22 million cells/ml. Fermentations were monitored daily measuring the ethanol, extract, pH, temperature, biomass in suspension and viability. At the end of the primary fermentation, the green beer was analysed concerning diacetil, esters and high alcohols by gas chromatography. Fermentation data were statistically treated in order to obtain an optimum approach for the studied parameters. For statistical proposes, the fermentation performance was measured by ethanol produced, apparent extract and the fermentation time. Although the temperature has a positive effect on the indicators of the fermentation performance, the wort concentration has not a positive effect for all indicators. When the wort has higher concentration {{at the beginning of the}} fermentation, as expected, the fermentation takes longer to be finished with more ethanol produced. Considering that the produced ethanol, the fermentation time and the residual extract have the same level of interest for the brewing process, the statistical analysis showed that the optimal point for the wort concentration, fermentation temperature and pitching rate is 20 ºP, 18 ºC and 20 x 106 cell/ml, respectively.

Among changes that occur during ferinentation is an increase in temperature and ethanol concentrations, which both are known to cause a stress response in. yeast. In order to understand the yeast response, I used proteomics technology to quantify levels of identified proteins during industrial fermentations. Increased levels of stress proteins and proteases were among the significant changes in the soluble proteome of distiller's yeast, as the fermentations progressed. The proteomic data set was complemented with an expression analysis of-selected yeast genes, which included a detailed analysis of genes and proteins involved in sugar uptake and metabolism. Proteomics technology was also used to study molecular differences in distiller's yeast that occurred when changing the volumetric scale from industrial (400, 000 1) to laboratory (0. 5 1), and in a second series of experiments, increasing the <b>yeast</b> <b>pitching</b> rate from 1 g- L to 4 g L. The results showed that up-regulation of proteases was not observed at laboratory scale, and increasing pitching rate led to a significant:increase in. the levels of heat shock proteins during fermentation. The mitochondrial proteome of distiller's yeast was also investigated at 30 min and 48 h of laboratory fermentations, leading to quantification of mitochondria-associated proteins that may be important for metabolism and/or yeast survival under fermentative conditions. Gene deletion of the HSP 26 gene in distiller's yeast revealed that four copies were present, and ploidy analysis confirmed that distiller's yeast indeed is a tetraploid strain. The deletion of the HSP 26 gene did not influence yeast sensitivity against lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol or oxidative stress. Interestingly, prolonged fermentations (> 72 h) with IlHSP 26 mutants showed that ethanol yield was reduced compared to wild type cells. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Most breweries collect yeast from a {{previous}} fermentation cycle for further use in a subsequent cycle. However, the cropped cells are deficient in membrane sterols and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) which are required for good fermentation performance in the next cycle. Consequently, the cellular levels of these compounds must be restored to obtain an optimal fermentation performance. There are currently three possibilities to satisfy this requirement. The common practice is aeration of the wort before pitching, thus providing oxygen needed for lipid synthesis during the first stages of fermentation. Oxygenation (aeration) of cropped yeast slurries is a second alternative. Finally, {{the addition of the}} required lipids to wort is sometimes suggested as an alternative to aeration. We examined a fourth possibility, namely the supplementation with UFA of cropped cells. Previously, we reported that the supplementation of stationary phase cropped brewer's yeast with linoleic acid is a good alternative to wort aeration. This conclusion resulted from results obtained with a well-defined stir-red synthetic fermentation medium. We also showed that cells cropped from non-stirred tall-tube fermented malt wort incorporated linoleic acid into different cellular lipid fractions, when suspended and supplemented in fermented wort. Now, we report that such <b>yeast,</b> <b>pitched</b> in malt wort in non-stirred tall-tubes, showed growth and attenuation profiles comparable to unsupplemented yeast in pre-aerated wort. Moreover, the synthesis of acetate esters, which is known to be affected when UFAs are added directly to the wort, was not significantly affected. We hypothesize that the active uptake of linoleic acid during fermentation and its activation by coenzyme A (CoA) and phospholipid synthesis are responsible for the effects on ester synthesis, through repression of the alcohol acetyltransferase-encoding gene, ATF 1. In supplemented cropped yeast, these reactions occur prior to fermentation, thus avoiding interferences with acetate ester synthesis. In serial repitching experiments with repeated linoleic acid supplementation of the cropped yeast, the fermentation performances of the yeast remained comparable to those of non-supplemented yeast in pre-aerated wort. However, due to a progressive increase of cellular UFA, negative effects on acetate ester synthesis appeared. Nevertheless, the supplementation of cropped yeast with UFAs can be considered as an interesting alternative to wort oxygenation to restore optimal membrane functions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Traditional beer {{fermentation}} is a {{batch process}} in which an amount of yeast cells are suspended in the wort. The fermentation process usually takes five to ten days for complete attenuation. To increase the productivity, several strategies could be adopted, such as increasing the fermentation temperature, increased agitation, the application of continuous fermentation, the use of immobilised yeast, or a combination. However, these variables have a pronounced influence on beer flavour and on the physiology of the yeast. Another promising strategy may be to enhance the amount of suspended yeast cells in the batch fermenter, as this has beenproven effective in decreasing the fermentation time without major deleterious influences on beer quality. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} work was to contribute to a more systematic and complete understanding of the yeast physiology in relation to flavour formation upon so-called high cell density (HCD) fermentations. First of all, the response of different lager yeast strains to the HCD fermentation conditions was investigated. The results pointed out that the rate of fermentation was 2 - 4 times increased when high initial cell levels were used. High viabilities for all yeasts were observed throughout the fermentations. Except for diacetyl, the cell density had only an moderate influence on the flavour profile. Furthermore, yeast strain specific characteristics could not be overlooked as they determined the sensitivity of the yeast to the application of higher cell densities. As the oxygen availability decreased when higher <b>yeast</b> concentrations were <b>pitched,</b> the build-up of unsaturated fatty acids in the initial phase of the fermentation was repressed, and consequently, lower yeast growth rates were obtained. The expression levels of the genes HSP 104 and HSP 12 and the concentration of trehalose were higher with increased pitching rates, suggesting a moderate exposure to stress in case of higher cell concentrations. Though, the viability and the vitality of the yeast population were not affected. With exception of totaldiacetyl and the limited aerobic formation of essential membrane lipids, these results demonstrate that most aspects of the yeast physiology and flavour balance were not negatively affected when the pitching rate was changed. The decreased yeast net growth observed in HCD fermentations can have anegative impact on the physiological stability throughout subsequent yeast generations. Therefore, the use of different oxygen conditions was investigated to improve the growth yield during HCD fermentations. The results showed that increasing the oxygen supply to the yeast, by means ofpreoxygenation or intensive wort oxygenation, stimulated the build-up of essential membrane lipids essential for yeast growth. Wort oxygenationhad a significant decreasing effect on the formation of esters, which was caused by a decreased expression of ATF 1, compared with the other conditions. Lower glycogen and trehalose levels at the end of fermentation were observed in case of the HCD fermentations with oxygenated wort. Next to this, oxidative stress markers (CTT 1 and SOD 1) were induced in case of oxygenated wort, but this had no effect on the viability. However, repetitive exposure to too high concentrations of oxygen is known to be deleterious for the yeast viability. Therefore, optimum oxygen levels for HCD fermentations are needed through the application of yeast preoxygenation in combination with wort aeration. Preoxygenation increased the extent of growth without significantly affecting the yeast physiology, and was selected for further research. Next, successive fermentations of HCD populations were evaluated. It was shown that preoxygenating the yeast was essential for the yeast physiological stability and beer flavour compound consistency of high cell density fermentations during the process of serial repitching. In contrast,the use of non-preoxygenated yeast resulted in inadequate growth, whichcaused insufficient yield of biomass to repitch all eight generations, a decrease in viability, a moderate increase of yeast age, and a dramatic increase of the unwanted flavour compounds acetaldehyde and total diacetyl during the sequential fermentations. Therefore, in order to achievesustainable HCD fermentations throughout serial repitching, adequate yeast growth turned out to be essential. The combination of HCD and high gravity brewing (HGB) was investigated. It was shown that HGB exerted an extra source of stress upon the yeast cells in HCD populations. It was postulated that increased osmotic stress and ethanol stress, as a result of HGB, induced the expression of stress related genes (e. g., GPD 1, HSP 12, SSA 3, and CTT 1) and also triggered higher trehalose levels. Notonly the wort density, but also the relative proportion of sugars dramatically influenced the yeast fermentation performance. As sucrose fully activated the cAMP/PKA signal pathway, stress resistance decreased, lowering the viability of the yeast populations. Hence, it was suggested that the use of sucrose should be restricted to maintain a healthy yeast population. In addition, it was shown that optimisation of the wort FAN content clearly reduced the residual amount of total diacetyl in the HCD beers. Finally, pilot-scale fermentation trials showed that HCD beers could beproduced with similar characteristics as conventionally brewed beers. In conclusion, provided that an appropriate yeast strain is used and that the oxygen supply and wort composition are optimised, HCD fermentations do not negatively affect the yeast physiology and can produce beer ofacceptable quality with great time savings.
