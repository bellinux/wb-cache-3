William Conner, the only settler living in the area at the time, and his wife Mekinges Conner, a Lenape woman, established the first trading post in central Indiana in 1802 and lived in the first log cabin in the area. William Conner and Josiah Polk laid out what is now downtown Noblesville in 1823, which was designated as the Hamilton County seat in 1824 and incorporated in 1851.

500|$|The {{area that}} would become Monte Ne was known to have had two establishments often {{considered}} essential to a <b>pioneer</b> <b>settlement,</b> a grist mill and a distillery. It is unknown when the distillery was built. It was owned in the 1830s by Abe McGarrah and his brother-in-law; they also operated a small store. The distillery's output each day was given as thirty gallons by the Federal whiskey gauger who resided in the area. The grist mill was built in 1856, and was owned by J.R. Pettigrew. It would later be owned by James Wyeth and Amelia Crowder Blake, the parents of Betty Blake, who {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "Leading Lady" [...] of Rogers, and who married entertainer Will Rogers in 1908. In 1875, the post office in the area changed its name from Mountain Springs to Pettigrew's Mill. The Blakes owned the mill until 1882, when James Blake died. The mill was later operated by David Portnell from 1889 to 1895. He sold his interest in the mill to a retired Congregational minister J.G. Bailey. Bailey later became postmaster. He petitioned the Post Office Department to change the name of the office to Vinola, in honor of a well-known vineyard that belonged to his neighbor Carl A. Starek. The letter was written in longhand, and the o and l were spaced too close together. As a result, the clerk misread the name as [...] "Vinda", which is how it was recorded. The area's name was later changed to Silver Springs. Bailey sold 325 acres of land and a cabin to Harvey.|$|E

2500|$|During 1788, Benjamin Tupper {{and other}} pioneers of the Ohio Company of Associates {{arrived at the}} {{confluence}} of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers to establish Marietta, Ohio as the first permanent American settlement in the Northwest Territory. In August 1788, he invented a screw propeller, positioned in the stern of a boat, and turned with a crank.

2500|$|Before <b>pioneer</b> <b>settlement</b> in the 19th century, {{the area}} was covered by the primeval forest that {{stretched}} between the provincial capital of York {{and the town of}} Hamilton, and was home to various First Nations peoples. In 1792, John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, named the western end of Lake Ontario [...] "Burlington Bay" [...] after the town of Bridlington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. By the time land beside the bay was deeded to Captain Joseph Brant {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, the name [...] "Burlington" [...] was already in common use. With the completion of the local survey after the War of 1812, the land was opened for settlement. Early farmers prospered in the Burlington area because of the fertile soil and moderate temperatures. Produce from the farms was shipped out via the bustling docks of the lakeside villages of Port Nelson and Wellington Square, as well as Brown's Wharf in the nearby village of Port Flamborough (which was to become Aldershot). Lumber taken from the surrounding forests also competed for space on the busy docks. However, in the latter half of the 19th century, increased wheat production from Western Canada convinced local farmers to switch to fruit and vegetable production.|$|E
2500|$|Flanigan Ditch was {{constructed}} about 1880 by the Flanigan family, Mormon pioneers in the Zion valley. The Flanigans acquired water rights for {{a portion of}} the flow of the Virgin River in 1880 to water the family's lands along the river. The family was prominent, with the feature now known at [...] "The Watchman" [...] called [...] "Flanigan Peak", while the location of the present Watchman campground was called Flanigan Field. Over time, the farmlands on the lower portion of the ditch were abandoned below the present outlet at the Watchman campground. [...] The buried portion of the ditch is regarded as a potential archeological feature relating to the period of <b>pioneer</b> <b>settlement.</b> The lands surrounding the ditch were acquired by the Park Service from the Flanigans in 1960. [...] Of the original [...] of ditch, about [...] are within the park, with the upper third largely intact but unwatered for part of its length. [...] A portion continues to carry water for irrigation of the Watchman campground. Expansion of the park boundaries has included a buried and abandoned portion of the lower ditch. The ditch shares its headworks with the Springdale Consolidated Irrigation Company's pipeline, which provides municipal water to the town through a pipeline installed in 1988. Flanigan Ditch was listed on the NRHP on January 12, 1998, reference number 97001630.|$|E
