40|$|Patient-focused or patient-centered {{care is not}} a new concept, but {{its value}} has been {{overlooked}} in preference to the technology-based, disease-centered model that has prevailed in medicine for the last 50 years. <b>Patient-focused</b> <b>care</b> includes four broad areas of intervention: communication with patients, partnerships, health promotion, and physical care (medications and treatments). We can conceptualize <b>patient-focused</b> <b>care</b> as being the care we would like our loved ones to receive. There is considerable evidence that patients prefer a patient-focused approach. Unfortunately, there are also many studies detailing physicians 2 ̆ 7 disconnection with patients 2 ̆ 7 needs, particularly the need for information, and misunderstandings and assumptions based on poor communication. However, it is possible to develop physicians 2 ̆ 7 skills in <b>patient-focused</b> <b>care</b> and provide physicians with the tools to overcome the barriers to this approach.

40|$|AbstractPurposeBisphosphonates relieve metastatic bone pain, prevent, reduce {{and delay}} {{skeletal}} morbidity in metastatic bone disease and are recommended in European guidelines but safety concerns, specifically renal dysfunction and osteonecrosis of the jaw, necessitate specific precautions when administered intravenously. Pan-European guidance for nurses {{at the forefront}} of <b>patient-focussed</b> cancer <b>care</b> is required to minimise patient risk. MethodsA panel of urology and oncology nurses from seven European countries collaborated to decide what constituted best practice for bisphosphonate administration when indicated for prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with advanced urological malignancies. ResultsThe panel agreed that urology, oncology, and home-care nurses who are {{at the forefront of}} <b>patient-focussed</b> <b>care</b> are well placed to ensure best practice is followed but across Europe nurses have insufficient training on bisphosphonate administration for urological cancers. Based on extensive clinical experience in administering bisphosphonates the panel propose best practice for identifying those patients who could benefit, for example those with bone pain or at risk of fracture, and for minimising risk of adverse events by checking renal function, adjusting dosing, ensuring adequate hydration, and regularly assessing dental health, as well as providing information and support. ConclusionsSharing this best practice across Europe could assist nurses who care for patients with urological cancers and bone metastases or indeed those caring for cancer patients in general, to take the lead, or at least be aware of what is the best practice that helps to ensure effective and safe IV bisphosphonates administration to patients under their care...|$|R

40|$|Health {{workforce}} {{training in}} the 21 st century is still based largely on 20 th century healthcare paradigms that emphasise professionalisation {{at the expense of}} <b>patient-focussed</b> <b>care.</b> This is illustrated by the paradox of increased training times for health workers that have corresponded with workforce shortages, the limited career options and pathways for paraprofessional workers, and inefficient clinical training models that detract from, rather than add to, service capacity. We propose instead that a 21 st century health workforce training model should be: situated in the clinical setting and supported by outsourced university training (not the other way around); based on the achievement of specific milestones rather than being time-defined; and incorporate para-professional career pathways that allow trainees to ‘step-off’ with a useable qualification following the achievement of specific competencies. Such a model could be facilitated by existing technology and clinical training infrastructure, with enormous potential for economies of scale in the provision of formal training. The benefits of a clinically based, competency-based model include an increase in clinical service capacity, and clinical training resources become a resource for the delivery of healthcare, not just education.

The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the long-term effects of a regional care pathway for patients with rectal cancer. Patients and methods Data on almost 400 patients with rectal carcinoma from three hospitals were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit. Results on seven structure and process indicators were analysed and compared before and at two time points after implementing a regional care pathway over a total period from 2007 to 2012. To determine motivation and interpret the results, relevant professionals of the participating hospitals were interviewed. Results After implementing the care pathway, the performance of computed tomography (CT) scans in the diagnostic phase significantly improved (p[*]=[*] 0. 007 / 0. 07). The number of patients discussed in the preoperative multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting improved significantly (p[*]=[*]< 0. 001), and after implementing the care pathway, 94 % of the patients were discussed. Further, a significant reduction in time between the first tumour biopsy and the MDT meeting was realised (p[*]=[*] 0. 01). Professionals stated that the regional care pathway has led to more clarity about the patient route and more awareness about complying with evidence-based guidelines.

40|$|Using Casebook Ethnography, nine {{registered}} Adult Nurses {{were observed}} and interviewed {{to explore the}} ways in which they undertook their daily work and the place of reflection in that. The participants were employed in one of two units; a surgical breast care and an acute palliative care unit, both of which were in a large National Health Service trust hospital in central England. Data collection was illuminated by the researcher’s reflective journal. The data collected, rather than simply describing reflective practice, led to wider and more broadly focussed findings which, when analysed, generated one central theme - Communication, Interaction and Discourse and three linked associate themes - Being and Caring, Practical Action, and Knowing. These themes were considered in the light of the key literature around nursing practice and reflection. The findings point to a new understanding of contemporary nursing practice, which illustrates ‘what our kind does’, amongst the groups of participants in order to deliver <b>patient-focussed</b> <b>care.</b> This practice was directed towards working with colleagues who shared the same values and understandings, and who used these shared beliefs to adapt their practice to achieve individualised and exquisite care. As they communicated and interacted with one another, the participants went about their work with attention to empathy and caring, articulated as a common humanity with their patients. They prioritised action where patient need was clear, and used a form of knowledge that was negotiated and validated within a community of practice. As they maintained a dialogue in their teams, the participants developed a sense of their professional identity and of who qualified as ‘our kind’.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} emphasis on providing <b>patient-focused</b> health <b>care</b> and ensuring patient {{involvement in the}} design of health services. As health technology assessment (HTA) is meant to be a multidisciplinary, wide-ranging policy analysis that informs decision making, it would be expected that patients' views should be incorporated into the assessment. However, HTA is still driven by collection of quantitative evidence to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of a health technology. Patients' perspectives about their illness and the technology are rarely included, perhaps because they are seen as anecdotal, biased views. There are two distinct but complementary ways in which HTAs can be strengthened by: (i) gathering robust evidence about the patients' perspectives, and (ii) ensuring effective engagement of patients in the HTA process from scoping, through evidence gathering, assessment of value, development of recommendations and dissemination of findings. Robust evidence eliciting patients' perspectives can be obtained through social science research that is well conducted, critically appraised and carefully reported, either through meta-synthesis of existing studies or new primary research. Engagement with patients can occur at several levels and we propose that HTA should seek to support effective patient participation to create a fair deliberative process. This should allow two-way flow of information, so that the views of patients are obtained in a supportive way and fed into decision-making processes in a transparent manner...|$|R
