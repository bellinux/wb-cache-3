40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{addition}} of selected inorganic phosphates to emulsion meat products were studied. All studies were designed to test basic theories regarding inorganic phosphates and meat under practical conditions. For the most part, evaluations were made on raw emulsions made in a small laboratory food chopper. In an attempt to stress the emulsions, low sodium chloride levels were frequently used. Evaluations included emulsion stability, soluble protein level, pH, emulsion viscosity and reflected surface color. At reduced sodium chloride levels, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and tetrapotassium pyrophosphate improved emulsion stability more than sodium tripolyphosphate or <b>potassium</b> <b>tripolyphosphate.</b> Preblending with tetrasodium pyrophosphate was {{not found to be}} detrimental to the stability of reduced sodium chloride meat emulsions. The addition of sodium hydroxide was similar to the effect of tetrasodium pyrophosphate on emulsion stability, but when combined with phosphates reduced soluble protein level and cooked product yields. The high emulsion pH due to sodium hydroxide and alkaline phosphates reduced cured color development; however, treatments were investigated which improved the cured color of phosphate-treated emulsions. In an attempt to reduce sodium in meat products, combinations of sodium chloride and magnesium chloride were studied. Increased magnesium chloride proportions increased soluble protein levels but decreased emulsion stability...|$|E
40|$|Ab s t r a c t. The {{effect of}} {{addition}} of wheat cellulose preparation {{on the quality}} and structure of finely ground model products was tested. Apart from <b>potassium</b> <b>tripolyphosphate,</b> the wheat cellulose preparation WF- 400 {{was added to the}} stuffing, at different levels of addition of techno-logical water: 30, 50 and 80 %. The testing of the model processed meat products covered: determi-nation of heat leakage, evaluation of the basic composition in the preserved product block according to the relevant PN ISO standards, quality and profile sensory evaluation, analysis of texture profile and tensile strength of slices with the universal machine Zwick model 1445. The values of the evaluated parameters of texture profile and quality and sensorial profile of model products were substantially affected by the level of addition of technological water. The higher level of water addition substantially lowered the values of the tested parameters. The preparation of tripolyphos-phate as well as tripolyphosphate and cellulose effectively reduced cooking losses and they had a structure-creating action, the cellulose preparation “strengthened ” the action of phosphates. In result of the trial the use of cellulose preparation as a functional additive and/or with potassium tripoly-phosphate to finely ground meat products was found reasonable and, in particular, to the products of different level of addition of technological water.
