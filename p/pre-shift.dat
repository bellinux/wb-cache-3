40|$|Background: Perchloroethylene (PCE) is {{the most}} widely used solvent in dry cleaning. Objectives: The aim was to {{evaluate}} PCE pollution and to identify the most reliable biological indicators for the assessment of workers’ exposure. Methods: The study was performed in 40 dry cleaning shops covering a total of 71 subjects. Environmental monitoring was carried out with personal diffusive samplers (Radiello) for the entire work shift; biological monitoring was performed by measuring PCE in urine and blood and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in urine on Thursday evening at end-of-shift and on Friday morning <b>pre-shift.</b> Results: The mean concentration of PCE in air was 52. 32 mg/m 3, about 30 % of the TLV-TWA and the mean value of the PCE in <b>pre-shift</b> blood samples was 0. 304 mg/l, slightly more than 50 % of the BEI. In dry cleaning shops employing less than 3 persons PCE in air exceeded the TLV-TWA in 7. 8 % of cases; the size of the shops was inversely related to pollution. Statistically significant correlations were found between PCE exposure and PCE in blood end-of-shift (r= 0. 67) and <b>pre-shift</b> (r= 0. 70), and PCE in urine end-of-shift (r= 0. 68); no correlation was found between exposure and PCE in urine <b>pre-shift</b> and urinary TCA. Conclusions: Dry cleaning shops still register conditions of exposure and pollution by PCE, although to a lesser extent than in the past.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{detail the}} design and control of a linear long stroke fast tool servo (FTS) with {{integral}} balance mass. The long stroke fast tool servo consists of an air bearing stage driven by a unique three phase oil cooled linear motor. The linear FTS has a travel range of 25 mm and is capable of 100 m/s² accelerations. The FTS is mounted to a T-base diamond turning machine (DTM). The FTS {{is attached to a}} hydrostatic bearing supported in-feed stage which is driven by a second linear motor. The in-feed stage is allowed to move in response to the FTS actuation forces and thus acts as an integral balance mass. We have developed a unique control structure to control the position of both the FTS and the reaction mass. The FTS controller employs a conventional lead-lag inner loop, an adaptive feedforward cancelation (AFC) outer loop, and command <b>pre-shifting.</b> For the FTS controller, the AFC resonators are placed in the forward path which creates infinite gain at the resonator frequency. The controller for the hydrostatic stage consists of a conventional lead-lag control inner-loop and a base acceleration feedback controller. The acceleration feedback controller consists of a high-pass filter, a double integrator for phase compensation, and an array of AFC resonators. For the base acceleration controller, the AFC resonators are placed in the feedback path and thus act as narrow-frequency notch filters. The notch filters allow the hydrostatic stage/balance mass to move freely at the commanded trajectory harmonics thus attenuating the forces introduced into the DTM. The AFC control loops are designed using a new loop shaping perspective for AFC control. In this thesis, we present two extensions to AFC control. (cont.) The first extension called Oscillator Amplitude Control (OAC) is used to approximate the convergence characteristics of an AFC controller. The second extension termed Amplitude Modulated Adaptive Feedforward Cancelation (AMAFC) is designed to exactly cancel disturbances with a time varying amplitude. by Marten F. Byl. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This study {{exploits}} nadir spectral measurements in 325 - 335 nm {{range to}} infer total column ozone (TCO) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) and SCaning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY(SCIAMACHY) instruments. TCO {{from these two}} instruments retrieved using the Weighting Function Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (WFDOAS) are presented. Unlike in standard DOAS where the fitting procedure results inozone slant column which needs to be converted into vertical column (TCO) by using air mass factor (AMF), in our novel approach direct retrieval of vertical column amounts of ozone is possible by fitting vertically integratedozone weighting function to the sun-normalized radiances. Other implementations include proper modelling of the Ring effect including Raman correction for ozone absorption, the implicit use of the effective albedo and effective sceneheight accounting for cloud effects, and an ozone temperature correction. The new algorithm has been extensively validated with ground-based Dobson andBrewer TCO measurements. In general, the agreement between GOME WFDOAS and ground stations data is very good and the validation shows that the retrieval accuracy of WFDOAS is within the uncertainty of current ground-based instruments. Better agreements are observed in the comparison withBrewer measurements than with Dobson measurements. This may be explained {{to a large extent}} by the neglect of ozone temperature correction in the standard retrieval for Dobson and Brewer. Temperature correction has a larger effect onthe Dobson results. The accuracy of WFDOAS retrievals makes GOME data very attractive for evaluating the ground-based network data. Eight years of GOME data are used to assess the quality of the WOUDC-archived Brewer data. It is shown that monitoring of Brewer data quality and identification ofproblems in Brewer instruments are possible. This method can also be applied to other ground-based instruments. Despite improvement with WFDOAS, somewhat larger differences between satellite TCO and ground based measurements remain at high latitudes under low sun conditions. The persistent TCO differences are due in part to profile shape sensitivity of satellite TCO retrieval algorithms. Improved ozone and temperature profile climatologies, which is prepared and presented in this thesis, will lead to improved satellite ozone measurements. The effect of ozone and temperature profiles on TCO retrievals is explored. The studydemonstrates that an improved and updated ozone and temperature climatological profiles can reduce the systematic errors in the retrieved GOME TCO, inparticular at high solar zenith angles. For SCIAMACHY application, the only change of algorithm is for calculating the reference spectra online in each iteration during retrievals rather than using look-up tables. Scaled SCIAMACHY FM ozone cross-section and wavelength <b>pre-shifted</b> by 0. 016 nm, as determined from our comprehensive investigation performed in this thesis, is used for the calculation of reference spectra and the Ring spectra. Improved cloud products and the new ozone and temperature profile climatologies are used. Quality of theretrieved TCO is assessed by correlative measurements from GOME and selected Brewer spectrophotometers. In general a good agreement is achieved apart from a scan angle dependent offset of about - 1 % to - 2 %. The reason for the offset is not understood but part of the offset might be related to thecalibration errors in the level 1 data. Nevertheless, combined data set from GOME and SCIAMACHY as retrieved from WFDOAS algorithm presented in this thesis will be valuable for long-term ozone studies...|$|R

Objective: To compare the diagnostic value of the Venables standardized respiratory questionnaire and <b>pre-shift</b> spirometry as screening tools for OA. Method: In a cross-sectional study, we investigated 450 workers of a steel industry by the Venables standardized questionnaire. We also performed a <b>pre-shift</b> spirometry as the screening spirometry and a post-shift spirometry. A person with 10 % drop in post-shift FEV 1 compared with the <b>pre-shift</b> value was considered as asthmatic (our gold-standard). The results of the questionnaire and the <b>pre-shift</b> spirometry were then examined against the gold-standard test results. For each test, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Results: The overall prevalence of OA among our studied workers was 3. 9 % (95 % CI: 1. 9 %– 5. 9 %). The highest rate was seen in those working in catering (25 %) and welding (10 %) units. <b>Pre-shift</b> spirometry and the questionnaire had low sensitivity (42. 9 % and 28. 6 %, respectively) and positive predictive values (16. 7 % and 3. 6 %, respectively); moderate specificity (92. 4 % and 71. 6 %, respectively) and high negative predictive values (97. 9 % and 96. 5 %, respectively).

ObjectivesTo assess heat stress, dehydration, biomarkers of renal function and their possible associations. A secondary aim was to evaluate the prevalence of <b>pre-shift</b> renal damage and possible causal factors. MethodsSugarcane cutters (N= 189, aged 18 – 49 years, 168 of them male) from three regions in El Salvador were examined before and after shift. Cross-shift changes in markers of dehydration and renal function were examined and associations with temperature, work time, region, and fluid intake were assessed. <b>Pre-shift</b> glomerular filtration rate was estimated (eGFR) from serum creatinine. ResultsThe mean work-time was 4 (1. 4 – 11) hours. Mean workday temperature was 34 – 36 °C before noon, and 39 – 42 °C at noon. The mean liquid intake during work was 0. 8 L per hour. There were statistically significant changes across shift. The mean urine specific gravity, urine osmolality and creatinine increased, and urinary pH decreased. Serum creatinine, uric acid and urea nitrogen increased, while chloride and potassium decreased. <b>Pre-shift</b> serum uric acid levels were remarkably high and <b>pre-shift</b> eGFR was reduced (< 60 mL/min) in 23 male workers (14 %).

This report reviews the different types of reliability and validity methods and testing and statistical analysis procedures to validate measures of emotional state.

Those from post-shift event help to estimate μ 1 and those from <b>pre-shift</b> event hinders this process. The hindering side can only be eliminated if there is a certainty about a level shift, i.e., when p(B|A′) =  1, which is in fact impossible realizing the nature of stochastic process inherited in a time series. However, as an extreme case assume that p(B|A′) =  1 then τ would have been defined only by the post-shift observations. For example, for a single observation which is out-of-control limit with certainty, i.e., when p(B|A′) =  1 then τ =  1 and whole weight of ρ =  1 is assigned to this new observation, i.e., Y(t)RSES = X(t). On the other extreme, for p(B|A′) =  0 that means no out-of-control limit observations is seen for long run so that τ = ∞ and the RSES method in this case would act as SES method. In general, the shift arising probability is updated on the first and subsequent occurrences of out-of-control data; hence helps to reduce the forecast errors. Now to find the weight coefficients of ρ, the following definitions are considered.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Rapid {{development}} of the chemical industry {{over the past two}} decades makes the study of the effects of chemical substances (such as benzene) on the human body essential, Benzene toxicity involves both bone marrow depression and Ieukemogenesis caused by damage to various classes of hematopoietic cells and a variety of hematopoietic cell functions. Studies of the relationship between the metabolism and toxicity of benzene indicate that several metabolites of benzene play significant roles in generating benzene toxicity. Benzene is metabolized, primarily in the liver, to a variety of hydroxylated and ringopened products that are transported to the bone marrow where subsequent secondary metabolisms occur. Maintenance of the genomic integrity is of crucial importance for all organisms. Damage to the DNA that makes up human genes is constantly inflicted by a large number of agents and can have severe effects if it persists. Modification of DNA can lead to mutations, which alter the coding sequence of DNA and can lead to cancer in mammals. Other DNA lesions interfere with normal cellular transactions such as DNA replication or transcription, and are deleterious to the cell. Thus it is obvious that the stability of the genome must be under continuous surveillance. This is accomplished by DNA repair mechanisms, which remove DNA lesions in an error-free, or in some cases, error-prone way. Defects in DNA repair give rise to hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents, accumulation of mutations in the genome, and finally to the {{development of}} cancer and various metabolic disorders. The alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) was applied to study the occurrence of DNA damage and repair in peripheral lymphocytes of 27 experimental human subjects with occupational exposure to benzene and 9 control human subjects with no occupational exposure to benzene. Two blood samples (<b>pre-shift</b> and after-shift respectively) were obtained from each of the control as well as the experimental subjects. After electrophoresis, scoring was done by using the CASP software program. Two of several variables were of primary interest, i. e., Tail DNA% and Tail Moment. Statistical analysis clearly indicated that significant differences exist between <b>pre-shift</b> and after-shift data for both variables. Results revealed that there are also different behaviour patterns for the experimental and control groups, <b>pre-shift</b> and after-shift, for both variables during all stages of the comet assay. It became evident for both Tail DNA%-data and Tail Momentdata that DNA damage was indeed present at the exposed (experimental) group of workers. For the experimental group, after-shift data exceeded <b>pre-shift</b> data in general. Different behaviour was noticed between the experimental and control-data during the repair process. Also, the initial <b>pre-shift</b> data-values of the experimental group, is much higher (about 9 %) than that of the control group, which may be an indication of a carried-over effect which may exist from the previous shift, due to the exposure to benzene. After-shift urine samples were also obtained from the experimental and control subjects and analysed for urinary trans-trans-muconic acid (ttMA), a metabolite of benzene, with the aid of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLCIUV) detector. The exposed workers showed a markedly higher (1, 8 times) ttMA mean value than the control persons, and the two-sample t-test confirmed this significant difference. Master...|$|E

The pictures of these two configurations were analysed digitally by two correlation procedures, i. e. auto-correlation and cross-correlation with shifted interrogation areas (SIA). In the latter method, auto-correlation was used to determine the integer displacement of particle images. This integer displacement field was used as window shift field for the cross-correlation procedure with a view to minimizing the loss of pairs effect by in-plane movement. Additionally, a multiple pass method was proposed and its performance tested.

Central {{in this study is}} the Sorption Enhanced Water-Gas Shift (SEWGS) technology for decarbonizing the Blast Furnace Gas product stream from the iron and steel making process. Detailed process simulation software (Aspen HYSYS) was used to model several combined power cycle layouts with SEWGS pre-combustion CO 2 capture. Moreover, a techno economic evaluation of different SEWGS layouts and applications in alternative steel making cycles has been investigated as well. Three different SEWGS layouts have been compared to two reference scenarios, a no-capture combined cycle and a post-combustion capture case using amines. Subsequently, SEWGS layouts where simulated using multiple target variables: Minimum energy consumption, minimum SEWGS train configuration, SEWGS column reduction and variable Blast Furnace Gas (BFG) compositions. Simulation results showed significant efficiency penalties for the three SEWGS layouts operating with minimum energy consumption, ranging from 18 to 22 %-pnt at a 95 % CO 2 capture rate. Main reason are steam extractions for SEWGS operation and <b>pre-shift</b> steam consumption to prevent catalyst dryout. Second, lower gas turbine work is experienced in all SEWGS cycles due to the composition and volumetric flow rate of the fuel, which is lower for diluted hydrogen than for BFG. An alternative modeling layout using split flow principle for the <b>pre-shift</b> section was proposed and found to improve energy efficiency by about 3. 7 %-pnt. On the other hand, significant cost improvement has been achieved by optimizing the sorbent productivity to bring down the number of SEWGS trains needed. Bringing down the number of trains to a 6 x 9 configuration reduced capital cost by about 30 % at the expense of higher steam requirement, which improved heat integration options to minimize efficiency losses. Subsequently, detailed cycle modeling showed the possibility to omit SEWGS cycle steps to bring down the number of columns per train. Several options where simulated after which the 6 x 6 configuration, using just two pressure equalizations steps, appeared to be most cost effective (55 /tonneCO 2).

Six workers in a carbon anode plant volunteered to take part in a personal air sampling and a biological monitoring programme lasting five consecutive 8 -h shifts to determine occupational exposure to airborne PAHs and urinary excretion of l-hydroxypyrene. Exposure to total PAH for all worksites varied from 3. 99 to 120. 6 μg PAH m− 3 and for benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) from 0. 17 to 4. 88 μg BaP m− 3. The concentration of 1 -hydroxypyrene in post- and <b>pre-shift</b> urine samples was in the range (0. 5 - 61. 8 μmol 1 -OHP per mol creatinine) and depended on the worksite. The Spearman rank correlation test showed a low but significant (P< 0. 05) correlation of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene in the post- and <b>pre-shift</b> samples with respiratory pyrene exposure. The quantitative aspects of biological monitoring for the evaluation of respiratory PAH exposure were tested with a pharmacokinetic model. On the basis of individual pyrene exposure, excretion of urinary 1 - hydroxypyrene during the working week was calculated for each worker. The results presented in this investigation indicate that biological monitoring of the pyrene metabolite 1 -hydroxypyrene is a useful indicator of a general PAll exposure, but cannot replace personal air sampling for assessing the lung cancer risk of individuals.

40|$|Background: Being {{exposed to}} cooking fumes, kitchen workers are occupationally {{at risk of}} {{multiple}} respiratory hazards. No conclusive evidence exists as to whether occupational exposure to these fumes is associated with acute and chronic pulmonary effects and symptoms of respiratory diseases. Objective: To quantify the exposure levels and evaluate possible chronic and acute pulmonary effects associated with exposure to cooking fumes. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 60 kitchen workers exposed to cooking fumes and 60 unexposed employees were investigated. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms among these groups was determined through completion of a standard questionnaire. Pulmonary function parameters were also measured before and after participants' work shift. Moreover, air samples were collected and analyzed to quantify their aldehyde, particle, and volatile organic contents. Results: The mean airborne concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein was 0. 45 (SD 0. 41), 0. 13 (0. 1), and 1. 56 (0. 41) mg/m 3, respectively. The mean atmospheric concentrations of PM 1, PM 2. 5, PM 7, PM 10, and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) was 3. 31 (2. 6), 12. 21 (5. 9), 44. 16 (16. 6), 57 (21. 55) μg/m 3, and 1. 31 (1. 11) mg/m 3, respectively. All respiratory symptoms were significantly (p< 0. 05) more prevalent in exposed group. No significant difference was noted between the <b>pre-shift</b> mean of spirometry parameters of exposed and unexposed group. However, exposed workers showed cross-shift decrease in most spirometry parameters, {{significantly lower than the}} <b>pre-shift</b> values and those of the comparison group. Conclusion: Exposure to cooking fumes is associated with {{a significant increase in the}} prevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as acute reversible decrease in lung functional capacity...|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} between low level time-weighted average (TWA) atmospheric xylene exposure (p. p. m.) and urinary methylhippuric acid (MHA) expressed per gram of creatinine was exam-ined. Subjects {{were recruited from}} workplaces that utilized xylene. Ambient monitoring of o-, m- and p-xylene isomers was carried out using passive diffusion vapour monitors. Adjusted (post-shift minus <b>pre-shift)</b> and post-shift urinary levels of xylene metabolites (2 -, 3 - and 4 -MHA) were determined by GC–MS. Twenty subjects were recruited into the study. Total xylene TWA exposures were 3. 36 ± 3. 63 p. p. m. (mean ± SD) {{with a range of}} 0. 03 – 14. 44 p. p. m. The r 2 values for the regression equations between xylene exposure and individual and total adjusted MHA isomers were 0. 390, 0. 709, 0. 677 and 0. 631 for o-, m-, p- and total xylenes, respectively, which was greater than the respective correlations between non-adjusted samples. In conclusion, biological monitoring of occupational xylene exposure at levels < 15 p. p. m. using urinary MHA showed a good correlation with atmospheric levels and is a valid complement to ambient monitoring. Even though occupational xylene exposure in the workplaces studied was generally low, MHA was found in the <b>pre-shift</b> urine of all workers and the use of adjusted values showed modest improvements in correlations. Recent exposure prior to sampling, either from occupational or non-occupational sources, should be considered when biological moni-toring of xylene is undertaken. Extrapolation of data from this study predicted a MHA concen-tration in post-shift urine of 1. 3 g/g creatinine after exposure to a TWA of 100 p. p. m. xylene...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a mean shift with an unknown shift {{point in a}} linear process and estimates the unknown shift point (change point) by the method of least squares. <b>Pre-shift</b> and post-shift means are estimated concurrently with the change point. The consistency {{and the rate of}} convergence for the estimated change point are established. The asymptotic distribution for the change point estimator is obtained when the magnitude of shift is small. It is shown that serial correlation affects the variance of the change point estimator via the sum of the coefficients (impulses) of the linear process. When the underlying process is an ARMA, a mean shift causes overestimation of its order. A simple procedure is suggested to mitigate the bias in order estimation. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTraffic-related {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) pollution has frequently been demonstrated {{to be a serious}} problem in the developing countries. Benzene and 1, 3 -butadiene (BD) have been classified as a human carcinogen based on evidence for an increased genotoxic and epigenotoxic effects in both occupational exposure assessment and in vivo/in vitro studies. We have undertaken a biomonitoring of 25 traffic policemen and 23 office policemen in Beirut, through personal air monitoring, assessed by diffusive samplers, as well as through the use of biomarkers of exposure to benzene and BD. Personal benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) exposure were quantified by GC-MS/MS, urinary trans, trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA) by HPLC/UV, S-phenyl mercapturic acid (S-PMA), monohydroxy-butenyl mercapturic acid (MHBMA) and dihydroxybutyl mercapturic acid (DHBMA) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI(-) -MS/MS) in MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring) mode. We found that individual exposure to benzene in the traffic policemen was higher than that measured in traffic policemen in Prague, in Bologna, in Ioannina and in Bangkok. t,t-MA levels could distinguish between office and traffic policemen. However, median MHBMA levels in traffic policemen were slightly elevated, though not significantly higher than in office policemen. Alternatively, DHBMA concentrations could significantly distinguish between office and traffic policemen and showed a better correlation with personal total BTEX exposure. DHMBA, measured in the post-shift urine samples, correlated with both <b>pre-shift</b> MHMBA and <b>pre-shift</b> DHMBA. Moreover, there was not a marked effect of smoking habits on DHBMA. Taken together, these findings suggested that DHBMA is more suitable than MHBMA as biomarker of exposure to BD in humans. Traffic policemen, who are exposed to benzene and BD at the roadside in central Beirut, are potentially at a higher risk for development of diseases such as cancer than office policemen...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{and urine}} {{perchloroethylene}} and urine trichloroacetic acid, as markers of exposure, and serum AST, ALT, GGT and creatinine, urine total solutes and proteins, angiotensin converting enzyme, N-acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidase and glutamine synthetase, as markers of effect, were measured in 40 dry-cleaning and 45 ironing-shop female workers. Average perchloroethylene air {{level in the}} dry-cleaning shops was 59. 7 mg/m 3, i. e. three fold lower than the current A. C. G. I. H. TLV-TWA (170 mg/m 3). No statistically {{significant difference in the}} mean values of any of the effect markers was observed between the two groups, except for AST which was significantly higher in dry-cleaners. In addition, a statistically significant correlation was observed in dry-cleaners between environmental perchloroethylene and total urinary solutes (r= 0. 308, p< 0. 05) or urine glutamine synthetase (r= 0. 469, p< 0. 01), between glutamine synthetase and blood perchloroethylene in post-shift (r= 0. 406, p< 0. 01) or urinary perchloroethylene in post- (r= 0. 571, p< 0. 001) or <b>pre-shift</b> (r= 0. 586, p< 0. 001), and between urinary perchloroethylene in <b>pre-shift</b> and GGT (r= 0. 407, p< 0. 05). Interestingly, some statistically significant correlations between exposure and effect indices were also found in ironing-shop workers alone and in all subjects. Finally, transaminases, GGT and total urinary proteins were influenced by age and alcohol consumption which were significantly higher in dry-cleaners, thus providing an explanation for some of the correlations observed. In conclusion, our results show a dose-related increase of glutamine synthetase activity, a marker of damage of the pars recta of the kidney proximal tubule, in the urine of female subjects exposed to perchloroethylene concentrations in the work environment lower than current A.

40|$|The {{excretion}} of thioethers in urine of applicators occupationally {{exposed to}} the soil fumigant 1, 3 -dichloropropene (DCP) {{was determined by the}} thioether assay. The mercapturic acid metabolite of E- 1, 3 -dichloropropene, N-acetyl-S-(E- 3 -chloropropenyl- 2 -) -L-cysteine (E-DCP-MA), was the reference compound in the thioether assay. The mean recovery of E-DCP-MA was 58. 5 % (coefficient of variation (CV) 9 %, n = 4). In non-exposed men mean background of urinary thioethers was 6. 05 mmol SH/mol creatinine (n = 56). In applicators exposed to soil fumigants containing DCP, urinary excretion of thioethers followed first order elimination kinetics. Urinary half lives of elimination of thioethers were 8. 0 (SD 2. 5) hours based on excretion rates and 9. 5 (SD 3. 1) hours based on creatinine excretion. The urinary half life of elimination of thioethers was almost twofold higher compared with half lives of elimination of the mercapturic acids of Z- and E- 1, 3 -dichloropropene. The post- minus <b>pre-shift</b> thioether concentrations in urine and the cumulative urinary thioether excretions correlated well with exposure to DCP. In urine samples the mean thioether concentration was 1. 38 higher than mean DCP mercapturic acid concentration. This suggests the presence of unidentified thioether metabolite(s) due to exposure to soil fumigants containing DCP. According to the present data, an eight hour time weighted average exposure to the Dutch occupational exposure limit of 5 mg/m(3) DCP results in a post- minus <b>pre-shift</b> thioether concentration of 9. 6 mmol SH/mol creatinine (95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) 7. 4 - 11. 8 mmol SH/mon creatinine) and in a cumulative thioether excretion of 139 micromol SH (95 % CI 120 - 157 micromol SH). It is concluded that the thioether assay can be used to assess comparatively high levels of exposure to DCP...|$|E
