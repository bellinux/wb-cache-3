5|$|On April 13, 1992, Reagan was {{assaulted}} by an anti-nuclear protester during a luncheon speech while accepting an {{award from the}} National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas. The protester, 41-year old Richard Paul Springer, smashed a 2-foot-high (60cm) 30-pound (13.5kg) crystal statue of an eagle that the broadcasters had given the former president. Flying shards of glass hit Reagan, {{but he was not}} injured. Using media credentials, Springer intended to announce government plans for an underground nuclear weapons test in the Nevada desert the following day. Springer was the founder of an anti-nuclear group called the 100th Monkey. Following his arrest on assault charges, a Secret Service spokesman could not explain how Springer got past the federal agents who guarded Reagan's life at all times. Later, Springer <b>pled</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>to</b> reduced charges and said he hadn't meant to hurt Reagan through his actions. He <b>pled</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>to</b> a misdemeanor federal charge of interfering with the Secret Service, but other felony charges of assault and resisting officers were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Prosecutors {{believed}} Nicole Bostic, 26 at the time, aided Lee Woods {{in hiding}} the guns {{found in the}} BMW that Timoshenko and Yan pulled over, dumping them in a nearby garage before police retrieved them; N.

She later accepted a plea bargain, pleading guilty to a misdemeanor count of hindering the prosecution in exchange for three years probation, thereby avoiding jail.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} {{launched an}} investigation {{to determine if}} he had acted out of hatred for Obama. Writings by Ortega-Hernandez and testimonies from {{those who knew him}} revealed that he believed that he was Jesus, and that President Obama was the Antichrist and the devil. Ortega-Hernandez was not found to be affiliated with any extremist groups. In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez <b>pled</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>to</b> two of the nineteen charges against him: one count of destruction of property and one count of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. As part of his plea bargain, the remaining charges were dropped, including the charge of attempting to assassinate the President, which carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. On March 31, 2014, Ortega-Hernandez was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer. His lawyers had asked for a 10-year sentence, stating Ortega-Hernandez was suffering from depression and stress. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum sentence of 27½ years.

Guzman, during his court appearance in the Eastern District of New York, <b>pled</b> not <b>guilty</b> <b>to</b> all of the charges and waived his right {{for all of them}} to be read aloud in court.

5|$|The CIA {{began to}} {{investigate}} the disappearances of its agents, initially suspecting that bad tradecraft, a Soviet breach of Moscow Station or the CIA's communications, or a mole {{was responsible for the}} disaster. Suspicions fell on spy dust (METKA), a KGB compromise of CIA cables, or new Soviet surveillance tactics, but these probes proved unsuccessful. Ames' conspicuous spending drew the attention of the molehunters in late 1989, but he passed a polygraph test. However, the molehunt regained momentum in 1991 as it received more officers to work on the case. Attention focused on Ames and other suspects, and his finances were investigated once more in 1992; in August, the investigators linked Ames' bank deposits with his meetings with the Soviets. In March 1993, the molehunter unit concluded that there was a KGB mole within the CIA who had followed Howard, and the FBI began close surveillance of Ames, monitoring his office and home, and tracking his car. A June 25 search of his office found about 144 classified documents unrelated to his work; an analysis of his finances found an unexplained $1,326,310; and subsequent searches of Ames' trash and residence found further documents on CIA operations and agents, as well as Ames' own espionage for the KGB. On February 21, 1994, Ames and his wife, Rosario, were arrested by FBI agents: The duo <b>pled</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>to</b> espionage, and the Senate Intelligence Committee requested that the CIA's Inspector General review the case.|$|E
