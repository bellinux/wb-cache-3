5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, <b>premature</b> <b>birth</b> and low birth weight. In addition, more women are waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a {{flashback}} to 1956, when 16-year-old Emily Locke (Holland Roden) is preparing for {{a date with a}} man twice her age. Her mother tries to stop her from going out, but Emily escapes and is struck by a car. The trauma triggers the <b>premature</b> <b>birth</b> of John (as an adult portrayed by Terry O'Quinn). John's life is monitored by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who at John's birth and throughout his childhood looks the same age as he does in present day, and Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick), each of whom attempts to influence his life. The existence of Mittelos Bioscience is revealed when John is invited to spend the summer there as a highly gifted high-school student.|$|E

5|$|In 1814, the seventeen-year-old Mary Shelley (Mary Godwin, at the time) ran {{off with}} Percy Bysshe Shelley to {{continental}} Europe, accompanied by Claire Clairmont, Mary's stepsister. After six weeks of travelling, they returned to England but continued to live together. Mary returned pregnant with Percy's child, but their infant daughter died soon after her <b>premature</b> <b>birth.</b> Percy was alienated from his family and received little financial support from them; he was therefore harassed by creditors. In 1816, Mary and Percy had a second child, William. The same year, Claire Clairmont began an affair with the poet Lord Byron, and in January 1817 she had a daughter by him, Allegra. The group spent the summer of 1817 with Byron at Lake Geneva, where Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. That fall, Percy's wife, Harriet, committed suicide, and in December Percy and Mary were married. In September 1817, Mary and Percy had another child, Clara.|$|E
5|$|Nancy later discovers she {{is again}} {{pregnant}} with Darren's child. Nancy later suffers a miscarriage. Nancy and Darren later discover she is again pregnant. Nancy goes into premature labour and {{gives birth to}} their son three months premature by emergency caesarean. Darren and Nancy are told that their son may suffer brain damage. During her pregnancy Nancy helped her friend Mitzeee Minniver (Rachel Shenton) after she escaped from prison, making Nancy stressed. Darren blames Nancy for their son's <b>premature</b> <b>birth</b> and tells her he will not forgive her if their son dies. Darren and Nancy name their son Oscar, who {{turns out to be}} deaf. This causes problems in Darren and Nancy's relationship, with Darren wanting their son to go through an operation for his hearing but Nancy not wanting to. The stress results in Nancy becoming addicted to painkillers. Darren eventually finds out about Nancy's painkiller addiction leaving him furious and Nancy moves away for a short time. Darren and Nancy become friends with Sienna Blake (Anna Passey), and let her move in with them as a full-time nanny.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in <b>premature</b> <b>birth</b> or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
40|$|At least 49 {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a statistically significant increase in <b>premature</b> <b>births</b> (PB) or low birth weight (LBW) risk in women with prior induced abortions (IAs). This paper {{will focus on the}} risk of early <b>premature</b> <b>births</b> (EPBs) (< 32 weeks gestation) and extremely early <b>premature</b> <b>births</b> (XPBs) (< 28 weeks gesta-tion). Large studies have reported a doubling of EPB risk from two prior IAs. Women who had four or more IAs experienced, on aver-age, nine times the risk of XPB, an increase of 800 percent. These results suggest that women contemplating IA should be informed of this potential risk to subsequent pregnancies, and that physicians {{should be aware of the}} potential liability and possible need for intensified prenatal care. Informed consent for an elective surgical procedure must gen-erally cover long-term consequences and not just immediate risk. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1994, 18-year-old Sharon {{arrives in}} Genoa City and begins {{attending}} a local high school. She meets Nick Newman (son of wealthy tycoon Victor Newman), who is dating Amy Wilson (Julianne Morris). Nick {{falls in love}} with Sharon, despite Sharon's ex-boyfriend Matt Clark's (Eddie Cibrian) attempts to win her back. Nick and Sharon briefly separate after Matt exposes Sharon's secret about her motherhood at 16, but they reunite shortly afterwards. An angry Matt later rapes Sharon in his car, traumatizing her. Nick and Sharon become engaged; she tells him about the rape, which leads him to avenge Matt. Matt is shot, and Nick is the chief suspect. He is convicted and acquitted several months later, when Amy confesses to the shooting. After Matt leaves town, Nick and Sharon marry; to hold on to Nick, Sharon stops using birth control and becomes pregnant. Nick complains that he is unready for fatherhood; Sharon nearly has an abortion, but he stops her. In 1997, she gives birth to Noah Newman, who nearly dies after his <b>premature</b> <b>birth.</b> While Noah was critically ill Sharon's best friend (Grace Turner) tracks down the child Sharon gave birth to as a teenager (Cassie) and brings her to Genoa City, believing Cassie was lessen the pain if Noah died. Noah survives, and Grace decides to raise Cassie as her own; however, her plans are foiled when Nick and Sharon win custody. Nick had cheated on Sharon with Grace (which nearly ended his and Sharon's marriage), but the custody battle for Cassie reunited them.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{examines}} whether state family planning expenditures and abortion funding for Medicaid-eligible women might {{reduce the number}} of low-birthweight babies, babies with late or no prenatal care, and <b>premature</b> <b>births,</b> as well as the rates of infant and neonatal mortality. METHODS. Using a pooled time-series analysis from 1982 to 1988 with the 50 states as units of analysis, this study assessed the impact of family planning expenditures and abortion funding on several public health outcomes while controlling for other important variables and statistical problems inherent in pooled time-series studies. RESULTS. States that funded abortions had a significantly higher rate of abortions and significantly lower rates of teen pregnancy, low-birthweight babies, <b>premature</b> <b>births,</b> and births with late or no prenatal care. States that had higher expenditures for family planning had significantly fewer abortions, low-birthweight babies, births with late or no prenatal care, infant deaths, and neonatal deaths. CONCLUSIONS. Funding abortions for Medicaid-eligible women and increasing the level of expenditures for family planning are associated with major differences in infant and maternal health in the United States...|$|R
