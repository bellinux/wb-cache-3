40|$|Abstract. Superallowed 0 + → 0 + nuclear {{beta decay}} {{provides}} a direct {{measure of the}} weak vector coupling constant, GV. We survey current world data on the nine accurately determined transitions of this type, which range from the decay of 10 C to that of 54 Co, and demonstrate that the results confirm conservation of the weak vector current (CVC) but differ at the 98 % confidence level from the unitarity condition for the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. We examine {{the reliability of the}} small calculated corrections that have been applied to the data, and conclude that there are no <b>evident</b> <b>defects</b> although the Coulomb correction, δC, depends sensitively on nuclear structure and thus needs to be constrained independently. The potential importance of a result in disagreement with unitarity, clearly indicates the need for further work to confirm or deny the discrepancy. We examine the options and recommend priorities for new experiments and improved calculations. Some of the required experiments depend upon the availability of intense radioactive beams.

In Variable Data Printing (VDP) human proofing could result prohibitive since a job could contain millions of different instances that may contain {{two types of}} artifacts: 1) <b>evident</b> <b>defects,</b> like a text overflow or overlapping 2) style-dependent artifacts, subtle defects that show as inconsistencies {{with regard to the}} original job design. We designed a Knowledge-Based Artifact Recognition tool for document segmentation, layout understanding, artifact detection, and document design quality assessment. Document evaluation is constrained by reference to one instance of the VDP job proofed by a human expert against the remaining instances. Fundamental rules of document design are used in the rule-based component for document segmentation and layout understanding. Ambiguities in the design principles not covered by the rule-based system are analyzed by case-based reasoning, using the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, where features from previous jobs are used to detect artifacts and inconsistencies within the document layout. We used a subset of XSL-FO and assembled a set of 44 document samples. The system detected all the job layout changes, while obtaining an overall average accuracy of 84. 56 %, with the highest accuracy of 92. 82 %, for overlapping and the lowest, 66. 7 %, for the lack-of-white-space. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{inner ear}} {{converts}} sound waves into hearing signals through the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process. Deflection of the stereocilia bundle of hair cells causes {{the opening of}} channels that allow the entry of endolymph K(+) and Ca(2 +). Ca(2 +) that enters {{is crucial to the}} hearing process and is exported to the endolymph by the plasma membrane Ca(2 +) pump (isoform PMCA 2 w/a) : disturbances of the balance between Ca(2 +) penetration and ejection, e. g. by pump mutations, generate deafness. Hearing loss caused by PMCA defects is frequently exacerbated by mutations in cadherin 23, a single pass stereociliar Ca(2 +) binding protein that forms the tip links which permit the deflection of the stereocilia bundle and thus the opening of the MET channels. The PMCA 2 w/a pump ejects Ca(2 +) to the endolymph {{even in the absence of}} the natural activator calmodulin. This satisfies the special Ca(2 +) homeostasis requirements of the stereocilia/endolymph system. Here we have analyzed a mice and a human previously described pump mutant. The human mutant only exacerbated the deafness produced by a cadherin 23 mutation. The murine mutant overexpressed in model cells displayed an <b>evident</b> <b>defect</b> both in the basal activity of the pump and in the long range ejection of Ca(2 +), the human mutant instead failed to impair the Ca(2 +) ejection by the pump...|$|R

40|$|The Nup 154 gene of Drosophila encodes {{a protein}} showing {{similarity}} with known nucleoporins: rat Nup 155 and yeast Nup 170 and Nup 157. Hypomorphic mutant alleles of Nup 154 affected {{female and male}} fertility, allowing investigation of the gene function in various steps of oogenesis and spermatogenesis. Nup 154 was required in testes for cyst formation, control of spermatocyte proliferation and meiotic progression. In ovaries, Nup 154 was essential for egg chamber development and oocyte growth. In both {{the male and female}} germ line, as well as in several other cell types, the Nup 154 protein was detected at the nuclear membrane, but was also present inside the nucleus. Intranuclear localization has not previously been described for rat Nup 155 or yeast Nup 170 and Nup 157. In mutant egg chambers the Nup 154 protein accumulated in the cytoplasm, while it was only barely detected at the nuclear envelopes. FG repeats containing nucleoporins detected with mAb 414 antibody were also mislocalized to a certain extent in Nup 154 mutant alleles. This suggests that Nup 154 could be required for localizing other nucleoporins within the nuclear pore complex, as previously demonstrated for the yeast Nup 170. On the other hand, no <b>evident</b> <b>defects</b> in lamin localization were observed, indicating that Nup 155 mutations did not affect the overall integrity of the nuclear envelope.

40|$|A deeper {{understanding}} of Hf-based high-K materials {{in terms of their}} structural and electrical defects is important for device implementation. We have studied the occurrence of such defects using wet-etch defect delineation, electron microscopy, depth-profiling and conventional electrical measurements. It is <b>evident</b> that <b>defects</b> are present in HfO 2 films that are related to the microstructure and stoichiometry of the film, which in turn depend on the deposition temperature, starting surface and post-deposition treatments. These results appear to be independent of the deposition technique. Two types of defects were observed, those that are physically visible and cause immediate failures especially on large-area structures, and those that cause high leakage but not immediate failures. The existence of defects affects not only leakage or performance but will also affect the reliability through trapping of charge at the defect sites. As films continue to be scaled thinner, the requirements on defect reduction to minimize electrical impact may become more stringent. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|When the {{electrochemical}} proton gradient is disrupted in the mitochondria, IF 1 (Inhibitor Factor- 1) inhibits the reverse hydrolytic {{activity of the}} F 1 Fo-ATP synthase, thereby allowing cells to conserve ATP {{at the expense of}} losing the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). The function of IF 1 has been studied mainly in different cell lines, but these studies have generated contrasting results, which have not been helpful to understand the real role of this protein in a whole organism. In this work, we studied IF 1 function in Caenorhabditis elegans to understand IF 1 ´s role in vivo. C. elegans has two inhibitor proteins of the F 1 Fo-ATPase, MAI- 1 and MAI- 2. To determine their protein localization in C. elegans, we generated translational reporters and found that MAI- 2 is expressed ubiquitously in the mitochondria; conversely, MAI- 1 was found in the cytoplasm and nuclei of certain tissues. By CRISPR/Cas 9 genome editing, we generated mai- 2 mutant alleles. Here, we showed that mai- 2 mutant animals have normal progeny, embryonic development and lifespan. Contrasting with the results previously obtained in cell lines, we found no <b>evident</b> <b>defects</b> in the mitochondrial network, dimer/monomer ATP synthase ratio, ATP concentration or respiration. Our results suggest that some of the roles previously attributed to IF 1 in cell lines could not reflect the function of this protein in a whole organism and could be attributed to specific cell lines or methods used to silence, knockout or overexpress this protein. However, we did observe that animals lacking IF 1 had an enhanced Δψm and lower physiological germ cell apoptosis. Importantly, we found that mai- 2 mutant animals must be under stress to observe the role of IF 1. Accordingly, we observed that mai- 2 mutant animals were more sensitive to heat shock, oxidative stress and electron transport chain blockade. Furthermore, we observed that IF 1 is important to induce germ cell apoptosis under certain types of stress. Here, we propose that MAI- 2 might play a role in apoptosis by regulating Δψm. Additionally, we suggest that IF 1 function is mainly observed under stress and that, under physiological conditions, this protein does not play an essential role...|$|R

Bowel-related complications are rare and predominantly ileus related. In addition, intestinal obstruction (IO) secondary to internal herniation is rarely documented. According to our review of the literature, only a few such cases have been reported worldwide. Here, we report a 72 -year-old man with painless macroscopic hematuria. He was diagnosed with left renal cell carcinoma, and he subsequently underwent laparoscopic transperitoneal left radical nephrectomy. Two days following surgery, he developed acute IO. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed dilated small bowel loops. Laparotomy revealed small bowel herniation via a sigmoid colon mesenteric defect. After reduction of the herniated bowel loops, the defect was closed using absorbable sutures. The patient was discharged 6 days later. Internal herniation is a rare cause of IO, accounting for < 3 % of cases. It occurs due to creation of a transmesocolic defect during mobilization of the left colon, facilitating small bowel migration into a potential space in the renal bed. Generally, a meticulous dissection technique is used in such cases to avoid any unnecessary mesenteric tears and repair the <b>evident</b> mesenteric <b>defects</b> observed during the intraoperative period...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Phosphoribosyl {{pyrophosphate}} (PRPP) is {{a central}} compound for cellular metabolism and may {{be considered as a}} link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. PRPP is directly involved in the de novo and salvage biosynthesis of GTP, which is the immediate precursor of riboflavin. The industrial production of this vitamin using the fungus Ashbya gossypii is an important biotechnological process that is strongly influenced by substrate availability. Results Here we describe the characterization and manipulation of two genes of A. gossypii encoding PRPP synthetase (AGR 371 C and AGL 080 C). We show that the AGR 371 C and AGL 080 C gene products participate in PRPP synthesis and exhibit inhibition by ADP. We also observed a major contribution of AGL 080 C to total PRPP synthetase activity, which was confirmed by an <b>evident</b> growth <b>defect</b> of the Δ agl 080 c strain. Moreover, we report the overexpression of wild-type and mutant deregulated isoforms of Agr 371 cp and Agl 080 cp that significantly enhanced the production of riboflavin in the engineered A. gossypii strains. Conclusion It is shown that alterations in PRPP synthetase activity have pleiotropic effects on the fungal growth pattern and that an increase in PRPP synthetase enzymatic activity can be used to enhance riboflavin production in A. gossypii. </p...|$|R

Fission yeast is a useful model for studying the fundamental mechanisms such as chromosome maintenance and cell cycle. However, previously published strategies for protein-depletion are successful only for some proteins in some specific conditions and still do not achieve efficient depletion to cause acute phenotypes such as immediate cell cycle arrest. The aim of this work was to construct a useful and powerful protein-depletion system in Shizosaccaromyces pombe. Results: We constructed an auxin-inducible degron (AID) system, which utilizes auxin-dependent polyubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins by SCF TIR 1 in plants, in fission yeast. Although expression of a plant F-box protein, TIR 1, decreased Mcm 4 -aid, {{a component of the}} MCM complex essential for DNA replication tagged with Aux/IAA peptide, depletion did not result in an <b>evident</b> growth <b>defect.</b> We successfully improved degradation efficiency of Mcm 4 -aid by fusion of TIR 1 with fission yeast Skp 1, a conserved F-box-interacting component of SCF (improved-AID system; i-AID), and the cells showed severe defect in growth. The i-AID system induced degradation of Mcm 4 -aid in the chromatin-bound MCM complex as well as those in soluble fractions. The i-AID system in conjunction with transcription repression (off-AID system), we achieved more efficient depletion of other protein...|$|R
40|$|AbstractClass III {{malocclusion}} is {{a growth}} alteration of the maxilla and mandible. According to some studies {{it can be}} present in 4 % (of us citizens) to 50 % in Japanese and Korean populations. Its main feature is the anteroposterior growth of the mandible, accompanied by its dental organs, giving a clear Angle’s class III occlusion with a negative overjet. This anomaly shows an <b>evident</b> cosmetic <b>defect</b> due to fact that a prominent jaw gives a sunk and blurred appearance of the facial middle third, giving anadust expression to the face, sometimes accompanied by depression. This article reports {{the results of an}} orthognathic surgery (oblique ramus osteotomy) on a 21 -year-old female patient that presented a class III malocclusion caused by an increase in mandibular growth, who came to the Orthodontics Specialty Clinic at UNAM FES Iztacala and presented a concave profile, skeletal class III, skeletal maxillary biprotrusion, prognathism, Angle’s class III malocclusion and anterior and posterior crossbite. The purposes of the reduction of prognathism by a ramus oblique osteotomy (subsigmoid) with an extra oral approach were: to improve her profile and skeletal and dental alignment; to obtain an adequate overbite; to maintain the dental midline; to achieve left and right molar class I; and obtain left and right canine class I. After nearly two years of treatment, the results were very satisfying, {{as can be seen in}} this report...|$|R
