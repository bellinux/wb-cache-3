This research was conducted at the Balai Pengkajian Teknologi Pertanian (BPTP) Banda Aceh at May until August 2013. This research used Randomized Completely Block Design 3 x 5 with 2 factors and 3 replications. First factor is kind of growing media with 3 levels; soil, soil + husk, and soil + compost.

In an inspection campaign of three control rods (CR 99) operated in theKKL reactor in Leibstadt, Switzerland, during 6 respectively 7 consecutive cycles,defects were detected in the top part of the control rods due to swelling caused bydepletion of the neutron-absorbing 10 B isotope (Boron- 10). In order to correlatethese defects to control rod depletion, the 10 B depletion has in this study beencalculated in detail for the absorber pins in the top node of the control rods. Today the core simulator PLOCA 7 is used for predicting the behavior of the reactorcore, where the retrievable information from the standard control rod follow-up isthe average 10 B depletion for clusters of 19 absorber holes i. e. one axial node. However, the local 10 B depletion in an absorber pin may be significantly differentfrom the node average depletion that is re-ceived from POLCA 7. To learn more, the  10 B depletion has been simulated for each absorber hole in the uppermost node usingthe stochastic Monte Carlo 3 D simulation code MCNP as well as an MCNP- based 2 D-depletion code (McScram). It was found that the 10 B depletion is significantly higher for the uppermost absorberpins than the node average. Furthermore, the radial depletion in individual absorberpins was found to be much higher than expected. The results are consistent with theexperimental data on control rod defects...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{nuclear power}} <b>plants</b> (PWR), the <b>rod</b> cluster control {{assemblies}} (RCCAs) can be damaged by impact-sliding wear due to flow-induced vibrations which generate contacts with their guidance devices (RCC guide tube) inside the reactor pressure vessel. Two localized impact/sliding wear tests {{have been performed}} at conditions close to the PWR primary system on stainless steel claddings (316 L) using wear autoclave simulators operating without water flow. The influence of the excitation frequency and type of motion signal on the wear process and damage has been studied (other experimental conditions have been fixed for the tests). Some extensive non-destructive examinations have been performed on the worn specimens (rod and guide card), using weighing, scanning electron microscopy, EDX and 2 D profilometry. The analyses of the wear scars show that a small frequency associated with a latency time between two-rod movements lead to a wear damage more severe than those generated at higher frequency even if the cumulative sliding distance is 300 times lower. Moreover, the linear weight loss (per slid kilometer) of the slow test specimen (? 5500 ?g/km) {{is much higher than}} the fast test one (? 2 ?g/km). So our observations brought us {{to the conclusion that the}} wear mechanism related to the small frequency damage is a chemical dissolution (corrosion) of the austenitic steel associated with a mechanical depassivation of the oxidized surface layers. This first stage is followed by an oxides compaction or detachment stage due to the impact at the end on each motion. The guide cards are less damaged than the rods but both exhibit a typical cup-shaped pattern with many ellipsoidal-like marks (also called dimples or scallop/hammering marks) aligned in the direction of the tube motion. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Fuel {{performance}} and reliability, especially fuel integrity, {{is one of}} the important aspects of the safe operation of nuclear power <b>plants.</b> The fuel <b>rod</b> cladding surrounding the fuel pellets represents the first barrier to the release of radioactive fission products. Fuel integrity must be maintained during normal operation and expected transients, and fuel damage must be limited during postulated accidents. Over the years, a very significant effort has been put into analysing and understanding the causes of fuel failures, and important strategies in design, engineering, manufacture, inspection, operation and management have been developed to try to avoid them. The results of this effort are reflected in improvements regarding the use of new materials, a more robust design, new fabrication methods, more efficient inspections of newly built fuel assemblies, quality assurance and better operational strategies. More demanding operational conditions for the fuel, or singular interventions like system decontamination or fuel cleaning, have raised concerns about fuel performance. The result of these counteracting trends is that fuel performance has improved significantly over the years, but there are still some issues which need to be addressed, such as fretting, corrosion, fuel handling, and in storage events. Based on the fuel failure events reported to the IRS database operated by the NEA/IAEA, and on the work performed under the EU Clearinghouse on Nuclear Power Plant Operational Experience Feedback, this summary report lists the main causes of actual and potential nuclear fuel failures in three situations: in-core, during handling, and during storage. The report also includes the main recommendations to fuel designers and manufacturers, nuclear power plant operators and regulatory authorities to reduce the incidence of fuel related events, and a list of actions now widely and systematically applied in nuclear power plants that were originated by operational experience exchanges and now constitute a set of good actions that help reduce the number of reported fuel related events.
