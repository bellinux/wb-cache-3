5|$|At 4:00am another alarm sounded: the <b>planing</b> {{mills and}} lumber yard of J. Turner & Cate, near the Philadelphia Wilmington & Baltimore rail depot, {{had been set}} on fire. The entire property, {{extending}} over a full city block, was destroyed. Realizing {{the severity of the}} situation, the firefighters concentrated their efforts on trying to save the surrounding structures.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, another lumber merchant, William Hoge, {{acquired}} {{ownership of}} the mansion. Under similar circumstances to those of nearby Abingdon, properties surrounding Colross underwent industrialization {{with the construction of}} a warehouse complex and ancillary industrial buildings associated with Alexandria Hay & Grain. The mansion at Colross became a storage facility within a lumber yard operated by another <b>planing</b> mill owner. In 1927, the mansion and the adjacent warehouses were substantially damaged by a tornado, making the mansion uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|Between 1860 and 1865 {{southern}} cotton became unavailable {{during the}} Civil War, Harrisburg {{was one of}} the few cities in the Upland South during this time to have woolen mills, making the town an industrial asset early on to Southern Illinois. Several <b>planing</b> mills and flour mills also dotted the city. The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad was completed in 1872 by Ambrose Burnside, and American Civil War, Union Army, brigadier general Green Berry Raum, who was living in Harrisburg at that time.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 1907, Kafka {{was hired}} at the , an {{insurance}} company, {{where he worked}} for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00—making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing {{when he joined the}} Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor work safety policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with machine lathes, drills, <b>planing</b> machines and rotary saws which were rarely fitted with safety guards.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} set in the American South in the 1930s, during the time of Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial {{segregation}} in the South. It begins with the journey of Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Doane's Mill, Alabama, who is trying to find Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. He has been fired from his job at Doane's Mill and moved to Mississippi, promising to send word to her when he has a new job. Not hearing from Burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy, Lena walks and hitchhikes to Jefferson, Mississippi, a town in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County. There she expects to find Lucas working at another <b>planing</b> mill, ready to marry her. Those who help her along her four-week trek are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found, or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him. When she arrives in Jefferson, Lucas is there, but he has changed his name to Joe Brown. Looking for Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown. Thoughtful and quietly religious, Byron is superior to Brown in every way but his shyness prevents him from revealing his feelings to Lena.|$|E
25|$|The <b>planing</b> {{hull form}} is {{configured}} to develop positive dynamic pressure {{so that its}} draft decreases with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the drag. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is {{to have at least}} one chine, which makes for more efficient <b>planing</b> and can throw spray down. <b>Planing</b> hulls are more efficient at higher speeds, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective <b>planing</b> hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping. Sail boats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.|$|E

Some designers have taken element of the dory and incorporated these in V bottom boats.The <b>planing</b> shoe is a narrow flat section on the bottom of some V bottom boats that promotes <b>planing</b> at lower speed.

25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} and most basic method of holding the work is a <b>planing</b> stop or dog ear, which is simply a peg or small piece of wood or metal that stands just above the surface {{at the end of the}} bench top. The work is placed on the bench with the end pushed against the stop. The force of the <b>planing</b> keeps the board in place, so long as the force is always toward the stop. <b>Planing</b> against a stop gives the woodworker good {{feedback}} - he can tell a lot about what is going on just by the pressure, force and balance required. A stop can take the form of a batten attached to the end of the bench, or it can be adjustable, able to be moved up and down according to the size of the work - or pushed down below the surface when not needed. A simple bench dog can serve as a <b>planing</b> stop.|$|E
