40|$|Adenovirus (Ad) DNA {{polymerase}} (pol) {{belongs to}} the distinct subclass of the polα family of DNA pols that employs the precursor terminal protein (pTP) as primer. Ad pol forms a stable heterodimer with this primer, and together, they bind specifically to the core origin in order to start replication. After initiation of Ad replication, the resulting pTP-trinucleotide intermediate jumps back and pTP starts to dissociate. Compared to free Ad pol, the pTP-pol complex shows reduced polymerase and exonuclease activities, but {{the reason for this}} is not understood. Furthermore, the interaction domains between these proteins have not been defined and the contribution of each protein to origin binding is unclear. To address these questions, we used oligonucleotides with a translocation block and show here that pTP binds at the entrance of the <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> of Ad pol, thereby explaining the decreased synthetic activities of the pTP-pol complex and providing insight into how pTP primes Ad replication. Employing an exonuclease-deficient mutant polymerase, we further show that the polymerase and exonuclease active sites of Ad pol are spatially distinct and that the exonuclease activity of Ad pol is located at the N-terminal part of the protein. In addition, by probing the distances between both active sites and the surface of Ad pol, we show that Ad pol binds a DNA region of 14 to 15 nucleotides. Based on these results, a model for binding of the pTP-pol complex at the origin of replication is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The postsynaptic density protein- 95 /discs large/zonula occludens- 1 (PDZ) domain is a protein-protein {{interaction}} module with {{a shallow}} <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> where protein ligands bind. However, interactions {{that are not}} part of this canonical <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> are likely to modulate peptide binding. We have investigated such interactions beyond the <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> for PDZ 3 from PSD- 95 and a peptide derived from the C-terminus of the natural ligand CRIPT. We found via nuclear magnetic resonance experiments that up to eight residues of the peptide ligand interact with the PDZ domain, showing that the interaction surface extends far outside of the <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> as defined by the crystal structure. PDZ 3 contains an extra structural element, a C-terminal helix (alpha 3), which is known to affect affinity. Deletion of this helix resulted in the loss of several intermolecular nuclear Overhauser enhancements from peptide residues outside of the binding pocket, suggesting that alpha 3 forms part of the extra binding surface in wild-type PDZ 3. Site-directed mutagenesis, isothermal titration calorimetry, and fluorescence intensity experiments confirmed the importance of both alpha 3 and the N-terminal part of the peptide for the affinity. Our data suggest a general mechanism in which different binding surfaces outside of the PDZ <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> could provide sites for specific interactions...|$|R

40|$|The yeast Ty 1 LTR {{retrotransposon}} replicates by {{reverse transcription}} and integration; the process shows many similarities to the retroviral life cycle. However, {{we show that}} plus strand strong-stop DNA transfer in yeast Ty 1 elements differs from the analogous retroviral process. By analysis of the native structure of the Ty 1 <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site and {{by a series of}} manipulations of this region and assessment of the effects on retrotransposition, we show that <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site inheritance is not from the tRNA primer, which is inconsistent with classical retroviral models. This unusual inheritance pattern holds even when the Ty 1 <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site is lengthened in order to be more retrovirus-like. Finally, the distantly related Ty 3 element has an inheritance pattern like Ty 1, indicating evolutionary conservation of the alternative pathway used by Ty 1. Based on these results we arrive at a plus strand primer recycling model that explains Ty 1 plus strand strong-stop DNA transfer and inheritance patterns in the <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site...|$|R

We investigated the physiological {{importance of the}} BH 3 <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> of an antiapoptotic Bcl- 2 protein in mammals in vivo by analyzing a viral Bcl- 2 family protein. We show that the c-herpesvirus 68 (cHV 68) Bcl- 2 family protein (cHV 68 v-Bcl- 2), which is known to inhibit apoptosis in cultured cells, inhibits both apoptosis in primary lymphocytes and Bax toxicity in yeast. Nuclear magnetic resonance determination of the cHV 68 v-Bcl- 2 structure revealed a BH 3 <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> that binds BH 3 domain peptides from proapoptotic Bcl- 2 family members Bax and Bak via a molecular mechanism shared with host Bcl- 2 family proteins, involving a conserved arginine in the BH 3 peptide <b>binding</b> <b>groove.</b> Mutations of this conserved arginine and two adjacent amino acids to alanine (SGR to AAA) within the BH 3 <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> resulted in a properly folded protein that lacked {{the capacity of the}} wild-type cHV 68 v-Bcl- 2 to bind Bax BH 3 peptide and to block Bax toxicity in yeast.

40|$|High {{affinity}} target-binding aptamers {{are identified}} from random oligonucleotide libraries by an in vitro selection process called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX). Since the SELEX process includes a PCR amplification step the randomized {{region of the}} oligonucleotide libraries need to be flanked by two fixed <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> sequences. These <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> sites are often difficult to truncate because they {{may be necessary to}} maintain the structure of the aptamer or may even be part of the target binding motif. We designed a novel type of RNA library that carries fixed sequences which constrain the oligonucleotides into a partly double-stranded structure, thereby minimizing the risk that the <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> sequences become part of the target-binding motif. Moreover, the specific design of the library including the use of tandem RNA Polymerase promoters allows the selection of oligonucleotides without any <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> sequences. The library was used to select aptamers to the mirror-image peptide of ghrelin. Ghrelin is a potent stimulator of growth-hormone release and food intake.

40|$|The {{human genome}} encodes five nonpolymorphic major {{histocompatibility}} complex class I-like glycoproteins, CD 1 a to CD 1 e, that present lipid antigens for specific recognition by T lymphocytes. Using single alkyl chain detergents, we developed a protocol to generate recombinant human CD 1 b-lipid complexes. We present here the crystal structures of CD 1 b in complex with either phosphatidylinositol or ganglioside GM 2 at 2. 3 Å and 2. 8 Å resolutions, respectively. The antigen-binding groove houses four interlinked hydrophobic channels that are occupied by the alkyl chains of the glycolipid plus two detergent molecules. A distinct exit beneath the ? 2 helix further contributes to the plasticity of the <b>binding</b> <b>groove.</b> These structures reveal the mechanism by which two alkyl chain lipids bind to CD 1 b, and how CD 1 b can adapt to ligands of different alkyl chain length.

40|$|Amino acid {{residues}} {{involved in}} the peptide <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> of HLA-DRB 1 alleles were examined in three Nigerian ethnic groups with leprosy (n = 287) and 170 controls to determine the role of DRB 1 alleles in disease outcome with Mycobacterium leprae. Nine positively charged motifs and two others with neutral charge to the <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> were detected. These motifs occurred more frequently in leprosy (leprogenic) than was expected by chance (P < 0. 0001). In contrast, five motifs with net negative or ‘modified’ neutral charges to the pocket were negatively associated with leprosy. We conclude that clinical outcome of infection with M. leprae is largely determined by a shared epitope in DRB 1 alleles marked by several motifs. These motifs occur in otherwise normal DRB 1 alleles, characterized by net positive or neutral charges in the <b>binding</b> <b>groove.</b> We hypothesize that these polarities cause poor binding of DRB 1 to M. leprae. On presentation, the signal via the T cell receptor results in muted cell-mediated immunity. The resulting response translates to various forms of leprosy depending on degree of charge consonance between M. leprae and host DRB 1 allele. Other factors within or without the HLA complex, such as the T cell receptor repertoire, may also influence the resulting disease...|$|R
40|$|Genes of {{the human}} {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) system encode cell-surface proteins involved in regulation of immune responses, and the way drugs interact with the HLA peptide <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> {{is important in the}} immunopathogenesis of T-cell mediated drug hypersensitivity syndromes. Nevirapine (NVP), is an HIV- 1 antiretroviral with treatment-limiting hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) associated with multiple class I and II HLA alleles. Here we utilize a novel analytical approach to explore these multi-allelic associations by systematically examining HLA molecules for similarities in peptide binding specificities and binding pocket structure. We demonstrate that primary predisposition to cutaneous NVP HSR, seen across ancestral groups, can be attributed to a cluster of HLA-C alleles sharing a common <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> F pocket with HLA-C* 04 : 01. An independent association with a group of class II alleles which share the HLA-DRB 1 -P 4 pocket is also observed. In contrast, NVP HSR protection is afforded by a cluster of HLA-B alleles defined by a characteristic peptide <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> B pocket. The results suggest drug-specific interactions within the antigen binding cleft can be shared across HLA molecules with similar binding pockets.

We developed an in vivo organelle tethering assaying in which GRASP 65 was targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane {{either directly or}} via binding to GM 130. Mitochondria bearing GRASP 65 became tethered to one another, and this depended on a GRASP 65 PDZ domain that was also required for GRASP 65 self-interaction. Point mutation within the predicted <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> of the GRASP 65 PDZ domain blocked both tethering and, in a gene replacement assay, Golgi ribbon formation.

40|$|Human {{telomerase}} is a ribonucleoprotein {{which uses}} its internal RNA moiety as {{a template for}} telomeric DNA synthesis. This enzyme is up-regulated in most malignant tumors and is therefore considered as a possible cancer target. Here we {{examined the effects of}} differently modified oligomers on telomerase activity from HL- 60 cell extracts (TRAP-eze assay). Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides (PS-ODNs) inhibited telomerase activity at subnanomolar concen-trations and proved to be more efficient than peptide nucleic acids. In contrast to all the investigated oligomers, PS-ODNs were found to bind to the protein motif of telomerase called the <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site but poorly to its RNA. This is suggested by kinetic investigations demonstrating a competitive interaction of PS-ODNs and TS primer at the <b>primer</b> <b>binding</b> site. The Km value of the TS primer was 10. 8 nM, the Ki value of a 20 mer PS-ODN was 1. 6 nM. When the TS primer was PS-modified a striking increase in the telomerase activity was found which correlates with the number of phosphodiesters replaced. The Km value of a completely PS-modified TS primer was 0. 56 nM.

Additionally, the side chains of residues Lys-101, Ser-102, Glu-199, and Arg-243 orient the nucleotide in the <b>binding</b> <b>groove.</b> The pantothenate is bound and oriented by forming hydrogen bond interactions with residues Asp-127, Tyr-240, Asn-282, Tyr-175, and His-177. When both ATP and pantothenate are bound, Asp-127 deprotonates the C1 hydroxyl group of pantothenate. The oxygen from the pantothenate then attacks the γ-phosphate of the bound ATP. Here, charge stabilization of β- and γ-phosphate groups is achieved by Arg-243, Lys-101, and a coordinated Mg2+ ion. In this concerted mechanism, the planar phosphorane of the γ-phosphate is transferred in-line to the attacking oxygen of pantothenate. Finally, 4'-phosphopantothenate dissociates from PanK, followed by ADP.|$|R

The present study provides {{new insights into the}} distinct interaction of Hsp 70 with HLA-DR molecules. Using a quantitative binding assay, it could be demonstrated that a point mutation of amino acids alanine 406 and valine 438 in the substrate binding pocket led to reduced peptide binding compared with the wild-type Hsp 70 whereas HLA-DR binding remains unaffected. The removal of the C-terminal lid neither altered the substrate binding capacity nor the Hsp 70 binding characteristics to HLA-DR. A truncated variant lacking the nucleotide binding domain showed no binding interactions with HLA-DR. Furthermore, the truncated ATPase subunit of constitutively expressed Hsc 70 revealed similar binding affinities to HLA-DR compared with the complete Hsc 70. Hence, it can be assumed that the Hsp 70 –HLA-DR interaction takes place outside the peptide <b>binding</b> <b>groove</b> and is attributed to the ATPase domain of HSP 70 molecules.
