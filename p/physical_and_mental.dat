5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Certain <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> {{illnesses}} and the pharmaceutical substances {{used to treat}} them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high.

The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques. Because {{a substantial portion of}} any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how to safely fall or roll. The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundChronic {{conditions}} burden {{patients with}} illness and treatments. We {{know little about}} the disruption of life {{by the work of}} dialysis in relation to the resources patients can mobilize, that is, their capacity, to deal with such demands. We sought to determine the disruption of life by dialysis and its relation to patient capacity to cope. MethodsWe administered a survey to 137 patients on dialysis at an academic medical center. We captured disruption from illness <b>and</b> treatment, <b>and</b> <b>physical,</b> <b>mental,</b> personal, social, financial, and environmental aspects of patient capacity using validated scales. Covariates included number of prescriptions, hours spent on health care, existence of dependents, age, sex, and income level. ResultsOn average, patients reported levels of capacity and disruption comparable to published levels. In multivariate regression models, limited <b>physical,</b> financial, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> capacity were significantly associated with greater disruption. Patients in the top quartile of disruption had lower-than-expected <b>physical,</b> financial, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> capacity. ConclusionsOur sample generally had capacity comparable to other populations and may be able to meet the demands imposed by treatment. Those with reduced <b>physical,</b> financial, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> capacity reported higher disruption and represent a vulnerable group that may benefit from innovations in minimally disruptive medicine...|$|R

5|$|Keeping {{elephants}} in zoos {{has met with}} some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers {{easy access to the}} animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine changes in function over time after injury and to identify factors associated with long-term recovery that may be amenable to change through intervention. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Intensive care in a tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia. Patients: Adult (n = 123) admitted to intensive care for treatment of injury. Interventions: Data were collected prior to hospital discharge and 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post injury. Data included demographics, preinjury health, injury characteristics, acute care factors, psychosocial measures, and health status. Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify factors associated with <b>physical</b> function <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> health over time. Measurements <b>and</b> Main Results: <b>Physical</b> function <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> health improved over time; however, the averages remained below Australian norms at 24 months. Optimistic perception of illness and greater self-efficacy were potentially modifiable factors associated with improved <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> function over time. Greater perceived social support, also potentially modifiable, was associated with improved mental health. Injury insurance and income were significant nonmodifiable factors for mental health, with mental health gains associated with higher income. Hospital length of stay and injury insurance were nonmodifiable factors linked with physical function. Conclusions: Improvements in <b>physical</b> function <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> health are evident in the 24 months following injury, but most patients remain below Australian population norms. Factors that were associated with <b>physical</b> function <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> health outcomes over time that are potentially amenable to change include illness perception, self-efficacy, and perceived social support...|$|R
