The party broke through in the early 1990s in both Zürich and Switzerland as a whole, and {{experienced}} dramatically increasing results in elections. From being the smallest of the four governing parties {{at the start of the}} 1990s, the party by the end of the decade emerged as the strongest party in Switzerland. At the same time, the party expanded its electoral base towards new voter demographics. The SVP in general won its best results in cantons where the cantonal branches adopted the agenda of the Zürich wing. In the 1999 federal election, the SVP for the first time became the strongest party in Switzerland with 22.5% of the vote, a 12.6% share increase. This was the biggest increase of votes for any party in the entire history of the Swiss <b>proportional</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>system,</b> which was introduced in 1919.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{elections}} and government ideology on public funding to the agricultural sector using a panel model for more than 70 democratic countries from 1975 - 2009. We find that support for agriculture increases prior to elections, and that right-wing governments redistribute more income to the agricultural sector than left-wing governments. Political cycles are conditional on certain factors; for example, elections have a stronger effect on support under right-wing cabinets. Further, in industrialized countries, the election (partisan) effect is strongest under majoritarian (<b>proportional)</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems.</b> In developing countries, the election (partisan) effect is strongest under <b>proportional</b> (majoritarian) <b>electoral</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Using {{survey data}} {{collected}} between 1997 and 2001 in ten post-communist countries, I test {{a set of}} hypotheses that explain satisfaction with democracy {{among members of the}} main ethnic minority groups within each country. First, I test whether political representation, per se, has any effect at all. Second, I examine the relationship between the type of political system and the capacity of an ethnic minority to participate in the decision-making process. In particular, I show that those minorities which have a voice in parliamentary democracies are more satisfied than other minorities which act in political systems with a more powerful president. Finally, I focus on the proportionality of an <b>electoral</b> <b>system.</b> In this sense, I show how more <b>proportional</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> increase satisfaction with democracy for those minorities that either do not have any political representation at all or whose political ethnic party is small. When the ethnic political party is large, then less <b>proportional</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> boost satisfaction with democracy...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{interest}} {{has grown in}} central bank independence as {{research has shown that}} it may affect many important financial issues such as unemployment, inflation, and inflation variability, among others. However, empirical evidence regarding its effect has been inconclusive and there is low correlation among various legal central bank independence measures. In this thesis, I attempt to resolve these problems by generating a new measure of legal central bank independence that takes into account divergence between laws and practices. I then measure the impact that democracy and <b>proportional</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> have on reducing this divergence and find that democracy appears to have no impact on divergence, or actually increases it. While the results are mixed for <b>proportional</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems,</b> it appears that there will be less divergence between de jure and de facto central bank independence in countries using <b>proportional</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> than countries utilizing majoritarian <b>electoral</b> <b>systems.</b> ^ Using this information, I then test the impact that the new measure of legal central bank independence has on two key economic variables: inflation and inflation variability. I find that while it is a significant factor for explaining inflation in both developed and developing countries, it has less value in explaining inflation variability. I conclude, therefore, that while this new measure of legal independence provides a better indicator of a central bank’s ability to pursue orthodox monetary policies over the long term, it is not foolproof. Consequently, in the future, model adjustments need to be made to better analyze the impact that the new model of legal central bank independence has on price stability. This will provide long-term stability regarding a country’s economic policies for investors and individuals alike. ...|$|R
