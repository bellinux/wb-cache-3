Presently <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> {{continue to serve}} in the military of the United States. The following is brief history of the military events in which <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> have participated.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-one {{thousand}} <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> {{served in}} the Korean War, including 18,000 <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> who enlisted in the continental United States. <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> distinguished themselves {{as part of the}} 65th Infantry Regiment receiving many awards and recognitions; however, they were also involved in the largest court martial of the Korean War.|$|E

50|$|Important <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> {{institutions}} {{have emerged from}} this long history. ASPIRA was established in New York City in 1961 and {{is now one of}} the largest national Latino nonprofit organizations in the United States. There is also the National <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Coalition in Washington, DC, the National <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Forum, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Family Institute, Boricua College, the Center for <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Studies of the City University of New York at Hunter College, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Conference of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Women, and the New York League of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Women, Inc., among others.|$|R
50|$|Puerto Rico has 349 bird species, 83 mammals, 25 amphibians, 61 {{reptiles}} and 677 {{species of}} fish. Birds found nowhere else on earth include for instance the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> screech owl, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> woodpecker, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> tody, the green mango, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> emerald, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> lizard cuckoo, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> nightjar and many more. All current endemic 13 land mammals are bats, which includes for instance the greater bulldog bat, the Antillean ghost-faced bat and the Parnell's mustached bat. Extinct native mammals include the plate-toothed giant hutia and the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> cave rat. Reptiles unique to Puerto Rico include the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> boa, the guanica blindsnake, the Mona Island iguana, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> worm lizard, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> galliwasp and the Nichols’ dwarf gecko.

5|$|The Porto Rico Regiment {{returned}} to Puerto Rico in March 1919 and was renamed the 65th Infantry Regiment under the Reorganization Act of June 4, 1920. It {{is estimated that}} 18,000 <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> from the Porto Rico Regiment served in the war and that 335 were wounded by the chemical gas experimentation which the United States conducted {{as part of its}} active chemical weapons program in Panama, however neither the military nor the War Department of the United States kept statistics in regard to the total number of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> who served in the regular units of the Armed Forces (United States mainland forces), therefore, even though it is known that four <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> died in combat, it is impossible to determine the exact number of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> who served and perished in World War I.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the U.S. Congress approved the Jones–Shafroth Act, which extended United States citizenship (the Puerto Rican House of Delegates rejected US citizenship) with limitations upon <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> and made them eligible for the military draft. As citizens of the United States, <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> have participated in every major United States military engagement from World War I onward.|$|E
5|$|Others fled {{and went}} into hiding. Mathias Brugman was hiding in a local farm where he was betrayed by a farmer named Francisco Quiñones; he was {{captured}} and executed on the spot. In 1869, fearing another revolt, the Spanish Crown disbanded the Puerto Rican Militia, which had been composed almost entirely of native-born <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans,</b> and also the Compañia de Artilleros Morenos de Cangrejos, a separate company of black <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans.</b> They then organized the Volunteer Institute, composed entirely of Spaniards and their sons.|$|E

5|$|Puerto Rico {{was part}} of the Spanish Empire for four centuries, during which the people of Puerto Rico defended {{themselves}} against invasions from the British, French, and Dutch. <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> fought alongside General Bernardo de Gálvez during the American Revolutionary War in the battles of Baton Rouge, Mobile, Pensacola and St. Louis. During the mid-19th century, <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> residing in the United States fought in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> and French historians {{in three}} {{different}} fields (medicine, literature and politics), Betances left a legacy that has been considerably understated, and is only being assessed properly in recent times.|$|E

5|$|Puerto Rico {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} Great Depression of the 1930s, and many <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> {{moved to the}} East Coast of the United States looking for jobs and {{a better way of}} life. On the island, the unemployment rate continued to rise and many <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> who were unable to find a job looked to the Armed Forces of the United States as a source of employment. Not only were they paid better than at the few other available jobs, but they were also guaranteed three meals a day, clothing, and shelter.|$|E

5|$|During the Korean War, two <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> {{who were}} members of the United States Marine Corps were awarded the Navy Cross, the second highest medal after the Medal of Honor that can be awarded by the Department of the Navy. One of the {{recipients}} was Ramón Núñez-Juárez, who was listed as MIA and was posthumously awarded the medal. Núñez-Juárez's remains have never been recovered and a symbolic burial with full military honors was held on October 25, 1970. There is a headstone with his name inscribed above an empty grave in the Puerto Rico National Cemetery, located in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. His name is inscribed in El Monumento de la Recordación, a monument dedicated to the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> who have fallen in combat, located in San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Hispanic Americans {{who lived}} in the {{mainland}} benefited from the sudden economic boom {{as a result of the}} war, and the doors opened for many of the migrants who were searching for jobs. After the war, many <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> migrated to the United States to find work.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, a {{group of}} <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> met with the {{appointed}} Governor Winthrop, and suggested the organization of a Puerto Rican National Guard.

5|$|During the 1970s, {{a number}} of diverse styles emerged in stark {{contrast}} to mainstream American popular music. Though these genres were not largely popular in the sense of selling many records to mainstream audiences, they were examples of popular music, as opposed to folk or classical music. In the early 1970s, African Americans and <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> in New York City developed hip hop culture, which produced a style of music also called hip hop. At roughly the same time, Latinos, especially Cubans and <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans,</b> in New York also innovated salsa music, which combined many forms of Latin music with R and rock. The genres of punk rock and heavy metal were most closely associated with the United Kingdom in the 1970s, while various American derivatives evolved later in the decade and into the 1980s. Meanwhile, Detroit slowly evolved a series of electronic music genres like house and techno that later became a major part of popular music worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Betances {{attempted}} {{to use his}} diplomatic contacts to impede a Puerto Rico annexation by the United States, which was deemed imminent by the events following {{the sinking of the}} USS Maine.
