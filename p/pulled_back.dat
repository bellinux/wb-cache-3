5|$|On 21March, at 2200, Jourdan {{ordered the}} wounded {{to be transported}} to Schaffhausen in Switzerland, via Stockach. The main army then began its own retreat {{in the early morning}} of the 22nd. The reserve {{division}} of d'Hautpoul left first, and <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> via Stockach to Emmengen ob Eck. The first division <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to Bodman, on the northern tip of the Überlingen-finger of Lake Constance; in the retreat, a portion of the force was encircled and cut off by the 2nd Lancers of Karl Philipp, Prince Schwarzenberg's brigade, and more than 500were taken prisoner.|$|E

40|$|To solve {{real-world}} {{problems by}} Genetic Algorithms (GAs), GAs {{that have a}} strong searching capability are needed. In this paper, Distributed Probabilistic Model-Building Genetic Algorithm (DPMBGA) is applied to solve the problems. The DPMBGA is an extended algorithm of Probabilistic Model-Building GA (PMBGA) and {{it also has a}} strong searching capability. In realworld problems, constraints often exist. As such, mechanisms that can treat the constraints should be added to the GAs. Two mechanisms for treating constraints are the penalty method and <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method. The DPMBGA with the penalty method and <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method is applied to truss structural optimization problems. Through a simulation, the searching capability and efficiency of the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method and penalty method are discussed. From the discussion, it is concluded that the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method can derive the solutions even if the problem is difficult. Compared to the penalty method, the number of the individuals that violate the constraints is smaller in the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method. ...|$|R

5|$|Azmy {{lost contact}} with the 89th Battalion during the night, due to the {{intensity}} of Israeli bombardment on Touscan. At morning on October 21 the Israelis attacked again, and the paratroopers managed to repulse the attack again, before falling back. By dusk the battalion had abandoned the Touscan strong point and managed to retreat northward. Azmy had the 81st and 89th Battalions <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to the Ismailia Stadium, where {{they were to be}} reconstituted. The Israelis also attacked Heneidac at dawn that day using armor and infantry with air and artillery support, and captured the position before noon. The paratrooper company there <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> north and joined the rest of the 85th Battalion at Jebel Mariam, now the only defensive position occupied by the 182nd Paratrooper Brigade, and the last position on the Suez Canal before Ismailia.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{communication}} can {{be transmitted}} through sound, sight, and smell (olfaction). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures are probably more noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> lips for submission, and <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face {{as well as a}} submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.|$|E

40|$|In {{these notes}} we survey the {{tropical}} intersection theory on R^n by deriving the properties for tropical cycles from the corresponding properties in Chow cohomology.

Furthermore we define a <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> for tropical cycles {{based on the}} <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> of Minkowski weights. This <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> commutes with the tropical intersection product and satisfies the projection formula.

5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action view is a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar to {{looking over the}} player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> slightly in the menus.|$|E
5|$|Early {{in the wet}} stage, a {{group of}} nine riders broke away, only to be <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> the peloton, with a second group of {{nineteen}} also failing. An unsuccessful move from Tony Martin was followed by an attack by Vincenzo Nibali over the Col de Grimone {{and the formation of}} an elite five-strong group on descent with Rui Costa, Alejandro Valverde, and Tony Gallopin. This attack reduced the main group of chasers and caused the abandonment of several riders. The advantage of the break was over three minutes as they climbed the Col de Rousset, with Nibali briefly escaping on the subsequent descent.|$|E

5|$|In February 1917, the German Army began a {{withdrawal}} from its {{positions in the}} Somme sector to the Hindenburg Line. Gellibrand was in temporary command of the 2ndDivision, which at this time was opposite the village of Warlencourt. Patrols from the 6thInfantry Brigade found Warlencourt empty and occupied it unopposed. The 24thInfantry Battalion kept {{in contact with the}} Germans as they <b>pulled</b> <b>back.</b> On 13 March, the 24thInfantry battalion—now responsible for the entire brigade front—found Grévillers empty and occupied it.

5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} {{immediately}} following the 1930 renumbering, NY14 was routed on Pennsylvania Avenue and South Main Street through southern Elmira. By 1935, NY14 was rerouted to follow Pennsylvania Avenue into downtown. As a result, all of NY17D north of the junction of Pennsylvania and Maple avenues became concurrent with NY14. The overlap was eliminated in the early 1940s when NY17D was <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to the intersection of Pennsylvania and Maple avenues and renumbered as NY427.|$|E
5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E
5|$|The British 3rd Division {{brushed aside}} 16th Luftwaffe and {{approached}} the outskirts of Caen from the north-east.

In the early evening, the 12th SS fought a rearguard action against elements of the 59th and 3rd Canadian divisions, as it <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> from positions no longer considered tenable. Reports of this withdrawal came into the Anglo-Canadian command but patrols probing German positions, created a false perception that no withdrawal was taking place.|$|E
