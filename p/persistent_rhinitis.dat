Patients and methodA multicentre, observational, cross-sectional study was carried out in 556 consecutively enrolled mite allergic patients with rhinitis and asthma comorbidity attending a specialist unit. Severity assessment of rhinitis and asthma was evaluated in accordance with ARIA and GINA guidelines. ResultsReliable data were available for 518 patients. The distribution of rhinitis severity was: 15. 6 % mild intermittent rhinitis, 4. 4 % moderate-severe intermittent rhinitis, 30. 3 % mild <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis</b> and 49. 6 % moderate <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> The distribution of asthma severity was: 41. 3 % mild intermittent asthma, 14. 3 % mild persistent asthma, 19. 1 % moderate persistent asthma and 25. 3 % severe persistent asthma. In patients with moderate-severe <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis</b> (49. 5 %) a significant trend (p =  0. 005) was found pointing to an increased link with asthma severity.

It may significantly impair the individual quality of life (QoL) and also represents a social burden for its economic costs. Levocetirizine (XYZAL; UCB Pharma) as a second generation, nonsedating H 1 -antihistamine, {{has been shown to be}} clinically effective in patients with AR in different randomized controlled trials. The XPERT (XYZAL in <b>Persistent</b> <b>Rhinitis</b> Trial) is the first large, long-term clinical study involving patients with <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis</b> as defined by ARIA (Allergic Rhi-nitis and its Impact on Asthma). The XPERT was a 6 -month double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational trial in 551 subjects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with {{rhinitis}} often self-medicate with over-the-counter drugs, however this self-treating {{population has}} remained largely unstudied. OBJECTIVE: To characterize individuals self-medicating <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis</b> {{and to determine}} the prevalence of and risk factors for intranasal decongestant overuse within this population. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study of individuals self-medicating <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis</b> (defined according to the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma guidelines). Participants (n = 895) completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess current symptoms, rhinitis medication, and previous physician diagnosis. Intranasal decongestant overuse was defined as daily use for at least 1 year. RESULTS: The vast majority of subjects (95 %) had moderate-to-severe rhinitis. Nasal congestion was the predominant symptom (median visual analog scale, 6. 6 cm; interquartile range, 3. 4 cm). Sixty-five percent had had their current nasal problems for more than 5 years. Approximately 80 % had a physician diagnosis (mainly allergic rhinitis or rhinosinusitis). The prevalence of intranasal decongestant overuse was high (49 %), {{despite the fact that}} most of the patients (80 %) were educated about the limit on duration of use. Use of intranasal glucocorticosteroids was inversely related to being an overuser (odds ratio 0. 24 [95 % CI, 0. 17 - 0. 35]). The risk of intranasal decongestant overuse also was reduced by use of other medications (oral H 1 antihistamines and decongestants), use of nasal saline solution, and more symptoms of itchy and/or runny eyes or colored mucus. Risk was increased by a more severely blocked nose, longer duration of symptoms, the presence of sleep disturbance, higher body mass index, and previous advice to limit the duration of intranasal decongestant use. CONCLUSION: Half of the individuals self-medicating <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis</b> overused intranasal decongestants, despite the fact that they were educated about the limit on duration of use.

40|$|Background: The {{impact of}} {{treatment}} on {{specific aspects of}} health-related quality of life (HRQOL), including limitations in particular activities and quality of sleep, has not been clarified in <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> Our objective {{was to determine the}} effect of long-term treatment with levocetirizine on the five most affected daily activities and all sleep parameters of the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) in <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> patients. Methods/Data base: This was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study comparing the effect of treatment with levocetirizine 5 mg versus placebo once daily for 6 months on HRQOL and symptoms in 551 adults with <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> HRQOL was assessed using the RQLQ. Repeated measures analyses were performed on RQLQ scores for the five most affected daily activities and three sleep items. Results: Levocetirizine provided significant and clinically relevant improvements in baseline RQLQ scores for the five activities most important to patients (doing housework, playing sport, driving, outdoor activities, activities at work) and three sleep items (difficulty getting to sleep, wake up during the night, lack of a good night's sleep), compared to placebo, over the 6 -month treatment period. All improvements were pronounced and significantly greater for levocetirizine at each time point over 6 months. Conclusions: Levocetirizine provides clinically relevant improvements in the most affected daily activities and sleep parameters in patients with <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> The improvements are sustained over long periods and should therefore substantially improve the overall quality of life of these patients year round...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Persistent</b> {{allergic}} <b>rhinitis</b> (AR) {{can lead}} to various complications. One of the complications is tubal dysfunction, leading to abnormal tympanometric patterns. However, not all patients with <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> have abnormal tympanogram, so {{it is possible that}} there are other risk factors that together with allergic rhinitis may cause tubal dysfunction. Objective: Proving that the degree of AR, AR duration, presence of chronic tonsillitis and the use of air conditioning are risk factors for tubal dysfunction in patients with <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> Method: This cross-sectional research involves patients with persistent AR patients aged 11 - 54 years, who underwent tympanometric examination. Results: Sixty-eight subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The largest age group was 23 - 34 years with mean age of 27. 8 years. Twenty-six patients (26 %) with persistent AR had tubal dysfunction and 42 patients (61. 8 %) didn’t have tubal dysfunction. Chi square test for the degree of persistent AR indicated that X 2 = 0. 57, df = 1, p = 0. 44, RP = 1. 56 (95 % CI = 0. 45 to 4. 99), duration of AR disease X 2 = 1. 22, df = 1, p = 0. 26, RP = 1. 88 (95 % CI = 0. 60 to 5. 87), presence of chronic tonsillitis X 2 = 0. 01, df = 1, p = 0. 91, RP = 1. 05 (95 % CI = 0. 37 to 2. 97) had no significant relationship with tubal dysfunction.

Objective: To examine between- and within-country associations of climate measures and the normalizeddifference vegetation index with intermittent and <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis</b> symptoms in a global context. Methods: Questionnaire data from 6 - to 7 -year-olds and 13 - to 14 -year-olds were collected in phase 3 of theInternational Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. Associations of intermittent (> 1 symptom reportbut not for 2 consecutive months) and persistent (symptoms for - 2 consecutive months) rhinitis symptomprevalences with temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure, and the normalized difference vegetation indexwere assessed in linear mixed-effects regression models adjusted for gross national income and populationdensity. The mean difference in prevalence per 100 children (with 95 % confidence intervals [CIs]) perinterquartile range increase of exposure is reported. Results: The country-level intermittent symptom prevalence was associated with several country-levelclimatic measures, including the country-level mean monthly temperature (6. 09 -C; 95 % CI, 2. 06 e 10. 11 -C per 10. 4 -C), precipitation (3. 10 mm; 95 % CI, 0. 46 e 5. 73 mm; per 67. 0 mm), and vapor pressure(6. 21 hPa; 95 % CI, 2. 17 e 10. 24 hPa; per 10. 4 hPa) among 13 - to 14 -year-olds (222 center in 94 countries).

40|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} (AR) is an allergen-induced, upper-airway inflammatory disease. The characteristic {{symptoms of}} allergic rhinitis are a runny nose, sneezing, congestion, redness of the eyes, watering eyes, and itching of the eyes, nose and throat.

Objective: We assessed {{the extent to}} which treating <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> with montelukast, desloratadine, and levocetirizine alone or in combination improved quality of life. Methods: A 32 -week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed in 2 arms: 20 patients received montelukast 10 mg/d and/or desloratadine 5 mg/d or placebo; 20 patients received montelukast 10 mg/d and/or levocetirizine 5 mg/d or placebo. The treatment periods were separated by 2 -week washout periods. Quality of life was assessed on the day before starting treatment and {{on the last day of}} each treatment period using the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire.

Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of DL in patients with <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> based on the ARIA classification. Methods: Patients 12 years of age and older with <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> were assessed over 85 days of treatment with DL 5 mg once daily (n = 360) or placebo (n = 356). The primary endpoint was the AM/PM reflective total 5 -symptom score (T 5 SS) averaged over days 1 - 29. Secondary endpoints included AM/PM instantaneous T 5 SS and individual symptoms, therapeutic response, symptom severity assessed by a visual analogue scale and quality of life. Results: The mean reduction in AM/PM reflective T 5 SS was significantly greater with DL than placebo over days 1 - 29 (- 3. 76 vs. - 2. 87, p < 0. 001) and on each individual day (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Acupuncture {{has been}} used for millennia to treat {{allergic}} diseases including both intermittent rhinitis and <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> Besides the research on the efficacy and safety of acupuncture treatment for allergic rhinitis, research has also investigated how acupuncture might modulate immune function to exert anti-inflammatory effects. A proposed model has previously hypothesized that acupuncture might downregulate proinflammatory neuropeptides, proinflammatory cytokines, and neurotrophins, modulating transient receptor potential vallinoid (TRPV 1), a G-protein coupled receptor which plays a central role in allergic rhinitis. Recent research has been largely supportive of this model. New advances in research include the discovery of a novel cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway activated by acupuncture. A chemokine-mediated proliferation of opioid-containing macrophages in inflamed tissues, in response to acupuncture, has also been demonstrated for the first time.

It {{has been reported that}} grass pollen subcutaneous immunotherapy is effective in drug-resistant patients. In a real-life study, we evaluated the efficacy of 5 -grass pollen tablets in patients with grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis not responsive to drug therapy. Methods: We carried out this multicenter observational study in adults and adolescents with grass-induced allergic rhinitis not responsive to drug therapy who were treated for a year with 5 -grass pollen tablets. Clinical data collected before and after sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) included Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) classification of allergic rhinitis, response to therapy, and patient satisfaction. Results: Forty-seven patients entered the study. By ARIA classification, three patients had moderate to severe intermittent allergic rhinitis, ten had mild <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis,</b> and 34 had moderate to severe <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> There were no cases of mild intermittent allergic rhinitis before SLIT. After SLIT, 33 patients had mild intermittent allergic rhinitis, none had moderate to severe intermittent allergic rhinitis, seven had mild <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis,</b> and seven had moderate to severe <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> The mean medication score decreased from 4. 2 ± 1. 3 before to 2. 4 ± 2. 0 after SLIT (P< 0. 01), representing a reduction of 42 %. The response to treatment before SLIT was judged as poor by 70 % of patients and very poor by 30 %. Patient satisfaction was significantly increased after SLIT (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: In real life, most patients with grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis not responsive to drug treatment can achieve control of the condition with one season of treatment using 5 -grass pollen tablets.

Acupuncture {{has been used}} for millennia to treat allergic diseases including both intermittent rhinitis and <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> Besides the research on the efficacy and safety of acupuncture treatment for allergic rhinitis, research has also investigated how acupuncture might modulate immune function to exert anti-inflammatory effects. A proposed model has previously hypothesized that acupuncture might downregulate proinflammatory neuropeptides, proinflammatory cytokines, and neurotrophins, modu-lating transient receptor potential vallinoid (TRPV 1), a G-protein coupled receptor which plays a central role in allergic rhinitis. Recent research has been largely supportive of this model. New advances in research include the discovery of a novel cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway activated by acupuncture. A chemokine-mediated proliferation of opioid-containing macrophages in inflamed tissues, in response to acupuncture, has also been demonstrated for the first time. Further research on the complex cross talk between receptors during inflammation is also helping to elucidate the mediators and signalling pathways activated by acupuncture. 1...|$|E
40|$|Symptoms {{of chronic}} rhinosinusitis (CRS) are nasal blockage, nasal discharge, postnasal drip, facial pain, headache, and {{reduction}} {{or loss of}} smell, but they are often subtle and {{make it difficult to}} obtain a firm diagnosis based only on clinical data, and especially to distinguish CRS from <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> A. diagnosis of certainty of CRS relies upon either direct observation by nasal fibroendoscopy of nasal turbinates, middle meatus, and rhinopharynx, detecting mucopurulent discharge from the middle meatus, and/or oedema or mucosal obstruction, or by imaging of the rhinosinusal cavities. Imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance (MR) are currently recommended in consensus documents, while plain radiography is considered of poor diagnostic value. However, recent studies indicated that radiography by the Waters projection had a sensitivity of 84. 2 % and a specificity of 76. 6 %, which suggests to use it routinely in suspected CRS, limiting the number of more expensive imaging investigations. This seems important in the current economic landscape that requires a cost-effectiveness evaluation in each diagnostic procedure...|$|E
40|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} is {{the most}} common cause of allergic diseases. The recent guidelines of Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) group, classified it to intermittent (less than 4 days per week and for less than 4 weeks) and persistent (more than 4 days per week or lasting more than 4 weeks regardless of the number of days per week). The present study evaluates the patients with ARIA classification. The patients referred to Motahhari Clinic (Shiraz, Iran) were evaluated. Age, sex, seasonal or perennial, intermittent or persistent type, duration, sneezer or blocker, diurnal change and presence of allergic conjunctivitis were recorded. The patients who had one or more symptoms of; impairment of sleep, daily activity or work in school or troublesome symptoms had moderate to severe disease and those who did not have these problems have mild disease. The information of 96 patients (46 male and 50 female) were analysed (mean ageSD: 24. 45  10. 37 years). The mean duration of disease was 4. 26  4. 12 years, was more in female (P< 0. 05). Seasonal allergic rhinitis was present in 49 (52 %) patients; 30 male, 19 female (P= 0. 007), perennial in 15 (16 %), 1 male, 14 female and mixed type in 29 (30 %); 11 male, 18 female. Mild intermittent rhinitis was diagnosed in only 2 (2 %) patients, 1 male and 1 female, mild <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis</b> in 23 (24 %); male 11, female 12; moderate/severe intermittent rhinitis in 4 (4 %); 3 male, 1 female; and moderate/severe <b>persistent</b> <b>rhinitis</b> in 56 (58 %); 22 male, 34 female (P< 0. 05). Fifty-seven percent were more sneezer and 36 % were more blocker type, sneezers suffered more in days and others more at nights. Others were both sneezer and blocker. Sixty percent had allergic conjunctivitis too, 76 % of them were moderate/severe persistent, and 85 % were in seasonal or mixed groups. Eleven patients (12 %), in persistent group, had history of asthma. Family history of allergic rhinitis and asthma was found in 53 % and 25 % of patients, respectively. According to new guidelines for classification of allergic rhinitis, most of the patients are moderate to severe types. The classification of allergic rhinitis to seasonal and perennial disease is not proportional to intermittent and persistent types of classification...|$|E
40|$|Nasal {{carriage}} of {{staphylococcus aureus}} (S. aureus) exerts immunomodulatory effect {{in patients with}} atopic dermatitis and it may contribute to airway inflammation and allergic response in patients with allergic rhinitis. We Aim to investigate the frequency of nasal S. aureus carriage in patients with <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> and its possible influence on their symptoms and immune markers. We chosed 20 non smoker patients with house dust mite (HDM) allergy causing allergic rhinitis and 20 non smoker healthy subjects matched for age and sex. For all subjects rhinoscopy was done, skin prick test, nasal culture for S. aureus, nasal interleukin 4,nasal total IgE, serum total IgE and serum specific IgE(SSIgE) for HDM. Nasal S. aureus was detected in 16 / 20 patients (80 %) and 5 / 20 (25 %) in healthy subjects with highly significant statistical difference p< 0. 01. Correlation of nasal staph. aureus count and different systemic and local immune markers revealed highly significant positive correlation between nasal S. aureus count and serum total IgE (r = 0. 78, p< 0. 01) and significant positive correlation with SSIgE (HDM) (r = 0. 53, p< 0. 05), nasal total IgE (r = 0. 39, p< 0. 05) and nasal IL- 4 (r = 0. 55, p< 0. 05). Nasal staph. aureus actively modulated the immune reaction in <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> patients by promoting local IgE production, so we recommend early detection and treatment of S. aureus carriage in patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Forty four {{patients}} with <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> and sensitization {{to the house}} dust mites were observed. All the patients have been examined in conformity with international diagnostic standards. The first group of observation included fifteen patients who received intranasal therapy by flutikasone propionate nasal spray at a dose of 200 mkg once a day for two weeks. The second group of observation included fourteen patients who received 10 inhalations of Affinoleukin® (a lyophilized complex of low molecular weight proteins from human leukocyte membranes with glycine), as aerosol, at a single dose of 2 units. Fifteen non-treated patients comprised a group of comparison. Eosinophil counts and concentrations of free hemoglobin (by immunometrical method in co-agglutination reaction) were made in nasal secretions twice (before treatment and two weeks later). It {{was found that the}} increase of free hemoglobin levels, as well as increase in eosinophil count in nasal secretions represents a symptom typical of exacerbation in <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> and reflects severity of disease. The therapy led to significant clinical improvement, decrease in free hemoglobin levels and eosinophil counts in nasal secretions, corresponding to clinical effect of both therapeutic modes of topical pharmacotherapy, resp., in 73 % and 79 % of the {{patients with}} persisting allergic rhinitis. Decrease in free hemoglobin level has allowed {{for the first time to}} reveal the immunotherapeutic efficiency of treatment with Affinoleukin® aerosol during exacerbations of persisting allergic rhinitis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Recent {{guidelines}} {{reveal that}} allergic rhinitis impairs quality of life. Neuropeptides {{play a central}} role in allergy-related nasal infl ammation. The objective of this study was to analyze the release of neuropeptides (substance P, neurokinin A, and vasoactive intestinal peptide) in nasal lavage and their modifi cation by intranasal fl uticasone propionate as an established therapy in patients with allergic rhinitis. Methods: Eleven patients with proven allergic rhinitis induced by house dust mite were challenged before and after administration of fl uticasone propionate nasal spray. Nasal lavage samples were collected after allergen challenge, and neuropeptides were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Values for histamine, protein, and human serum albumin were also recorded. Eight healthy individuals were included as nonatopic controls. Results: The neuropeptides investigated were detectable in nasal lavage fl uid in both patients and controls. Treatment with fl uticasone propionate signifi cantly decreased clinical response to allergen challenge (P<. 01) compared with the controls and led to a decrease in values for substance P, neurokinin A, vasoactive intestinal peptide, histamine release, human serum albumin, and total protein after allergen challenge (P<. 01). Conclusions: The demonstration of proinfl ammatory neuropeptides in NAL and suppression of their release after allergen challenge caused by a topical corticosteroid suggest a role for neuropeptides in allergic infl ammation. Diminished release of neuropeptides induced by fl uticasone propionate was accompanied by an improvement in the clinical symptoms of patients with <b>persistent</b> allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> Key words: Substance P.
