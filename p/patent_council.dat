40|$|This is {{the final}} report for NASA {{cooperative}} agreement and covers the period from 01 October, 1997 to 11 April, 2000. The research during this period was performed in three primary, but related, areas. 1. Evaluation of integrated information adaptive imaging. 2. Improvements in memory utilization and performance of the multiscale retinex with color restoration (MSRCR). 3. Commencement of a theoretical study to evaluate the non-linear retinex image enhancement technique. The research resulted in several publications, and an intellectual property disclosure to the NASA <b>patent</b> <b>council</b> in May, 1999...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse {{critical}} resource dimensions for development of patents for these new technology-based firms. The empirical base is 131 new technology-based firms in five high-tech industries: Software/information technology, technology consultants, electronics/electrical, pharmacology and pharmaceutical preparation and mechanics, localised on 16 incubators in Sweden. The incubators in this study are all affiliated to a university. The 131 localised new technology-based firms that answered the questionnaire were rather young (mean 2. 76 years) and small (mean 2. 07 employees). Five hypotheses were developed from the literature and statistical methods such as factor analysis, correlation and regression analysis were used. The study presents a significant model in several resource dimensions. The study shows that the most important resource dimensions (latent variables) are R&D network, lawyers and <b>patent</b> <b>councils,</b> business competition and university/incubator that will affect development of patents in a positive way...|$|R
50|$|He was a {{merchant}} and ship owner who served {{the public as}} an alderman in the Albany assembly and on the Commission of Indian Affairs. In 1698 he bought from the Schaghticoke tribe a tract of six square miles on Hoosac River, for which he procured a patent. This purchase interfered greatly {{with the city of}} Albany. With van Rensselaer declining to sell his <b>patent</b> to the <b>council,</b> the controversy became a state affair. In 1699 the dispute was amicably settled, and he passed his patent over to the city.|$|R
50|$|In {{return for}} the Liberals support of the Ausgleich, {{concessions}} were made to parliamentary prerogatives in the new constitutional law. The law of 21 December 1867, although frequently amended, was the foundation of Austrian governance for the remaining 50 years of the empire, and was largely based on the February <b>Patent,</b> the Imperial <b>Council</b> and included a bill of rights. Ultimately the political balance of the dual monarchy represented a compromise between authoritarianism (Obrigkeitsstaat) and parliamentarianism (Rechtsstaat) (Hacohen 2002). Like most compromises it was rejected by extremists on both sides, including Kossuth.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{returning}} to England, Mason consulted with Sir William Alexander about possibly colonizing Nova Scotia. In 1622, Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges received a <b>patent</b> from the <b>Council</b> for New England {{for all the}} territory lying between the Merrimack and Kennebec rivers. In 1629 they divided the grant along the Piscataqua River, with Mason receiving the southern portion. The colony was recharted as the Province of New Hampshire. It included most of the southeastern part of {{the current state of}} New Hampshire, as well as portions of present-day Massachusetts north of the Merrimack.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 April 1998, the {{existing}} local government districts of Rochester-upon-Medway and Gillingham were abolished {{and became the}} new unitary authority of Medway. The Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions informed the city council that since it was the local government district that officially held City status under the 1982 Letters <b>Patent,</b> the <b>council</b> would need to appoint charter trustees to preserve its city status, but the outgoing Labour-run council decided not to appoint [...] "Charter Trustees", so the city status was lost when Rochester-upon-Medway was abolished as a local government district. The other local government districts with City status that were abolished around this time, Bath and Hereford, decided to appoint Charter Trustees to maintain the existence of their own cities and the mayoralties. The incoming Medway Council apparently only became aware of this when, in 2002, it was advised that Rochester {{was not on the}} Lord Chancellor's Office's list of cities.|$|R
50|$|The 1833 Colebrooke-Cameron Commission {{recommended}} {{the creation of}} the Legislative Council and the Executive Council, the first step in representative government in British Ceylon. Accordingly, both were established on 19 March 1833 by letters <b>patent.</b> The Executive <b>Council</b> initially consisted of the British Governor (the president of the council) and five other senior British officials: the General Officer Commanding, the Colonial Secretary (Principal Secretary), the Kings's Advocate, the Treasurer and the Government Agent for the Central Province. The governor had to consult the Executive Council in the discharge of his duties but he could over rule the council's advice.|$|R
5000|$|However, de Valera {{was later}} advised by the Attorney-General and senior advisors that the {{amendment}} {{was not sufficient}} to abolish the office entirely, which still continued by virtue of Letters <b>Patent,</b> Orders in <b>Council,</b> and statute law. Though officially insisting that the office had been abolished (de Valera instructed [...] to act {{as though he had}} left office and to leave his official residence), de Valera introduced a second law, the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937, to retrospectively eliminate the post from Irish law. Under its own terms, the act applied retroactively, so that the office would be deemed to have been fully abolished on 11 December 1936.|$|R

5000|$|In September 1949, French Senator Henri Longchambon {{proposed}} to the Council of Europe {{the creation of}} a European Patent Office. His proposal, known as the [...] "Longchambon plan", {{marked the beginning of the}} work on a European patent law aimed at a [...] "European patent". His plan was however not found to be practicable by the Councils Committee of Experts in patent matters. The meetings of the Committee nevertheless led to two Conventions, one on the formalities required for patent applications (1953) and one on the international classification of <b>patent</b> (1954). The <b>Councils</b> Committee then carried on its work on substantive patent law, resulting in the signature of the Strasbourg Patent Convention in 1963.|$|R
40|$|The library consortia {{have played}} a key role in giving cost {{effective}} access to e-scholarship. Indian academic and research institutions took lead in setting up of Consortia for giving access to e-journals, ebooks, databases, <b>patents,</b> standards, etc. <b>Council</b> of Scientific and Industrial Research is the first organization in the country to set up a large scale e-journals consortia, now known as National Knowledge Resource Consortia, after DST joined hands for this venture. The other major Indian consortia are INDEST-AICTE Consortium, UGCINFONET Digital Library Consortium, DRDO E-journals Consortium, Electronic Resources in Medicine (ERMED) Consortium, HELINET Consortium of RGUHS, DBT E-Library Consortium (DeLCON), MCIT Library Consortium, DAE Libraries Consortium, Consortium for e-Resources in Agriculture (CeRA) and FORSA. The author discusses in this article the findings of his doctoral research entitled "E-journals Access and Management: Consortia Models". A descriptive survey among Consortia managers/librarians and Consortia users was carried out after an extensive literature search...|$|R
40|$|This {{authoritative}} {{new work}} analyses European plant intellectual property rights. Whilst {{the focus of}} the work is on Europe, and in particular the European <b>Patent</b> Convention, the <b>Council</b> Regulation on Community Plant Variety Rights and the EU Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions, these provisions are discussed within the context of international legislation, including the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) and the Convention on Biological Diversity. It is the first book to look at the impact of plant intellectual property rights on the European plant breeding industry and assess whether recent developments, such as the Novartis decision, will assist plant breeders, from all sectors of plant breeding activities, in the production of new plant products. In addition to a thorough discussion of the legislation, the book includes unique empirical research results obtained by the authors as part of a two-year research project funded by the European Union, which surveyed attitudes towards, and use of, plant intellectual property rights within the European plant breeding community...|$|R
2500|$|The {{value of}} the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen was not. The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta, was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and {{transportation}} costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s Dr. Karl A. Clark of the Alberta Research <b>Council</b> <b>patented</b> a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to [...] per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust- and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons {{ran out of money}} and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a Provincial Historic Site.|$|R
40|$|Patent {{information}} {{is useful to}} {{a wide spectrum of}} users. Chemical patent {{information is}} particularly useful to those concerned with innovations in this area, as the chemical patent literature is almost of {{the same size as the}} chemical journal literature. National and International patent laws and treaties greatly influence the size of patent literature, its dissemination and exploitation for economic development. Paris Convention, WIPO and PCT programmes have all played an important role in the field of patent information. In India, patent information has a very significant role to play because the country's present law offers wide-ranging opportunities from adaptive development on a foreign patent to its commercialization. Patent information services in India are provided by several organisations which include the Patent Office Headquarters at Calcutta and its branches at New Delhi, Bombay and Madras; Patent Information System, Nagpur; National Informatics Centre, New Delhi; <b>Patent</b> Unit, <b>Council</b> of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi; Technical Information Cell, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Hyderabad; National Chemical Laboratory, Pune and National Information Centre for Drugs and Pharmaceuticals, Lucknow. Many of these organisations cover all areas of technology whereas others are restricted to particular disciplines. National Information Centre for Drugs and Pharmaceuticals is one such specialised centre restricted to only drugs and pharmaceutical. Its services such as patent bulletin and patent searches on selected drugs have been well accepted by the users. The Centre's holdings of foreign patent literature are meagre and need to be strengthened by acquiring them mainly from the U. S. A., France, F. R. G., Japan, Italy and Switzerland which are the top six nations responsible for introducing new drug substances. With a computer now installed at the Centre, the Centre should acquire INPADOC database and collaborate with existing Patent Information System, Nagpur and National Informatics Centre, New Delhi for better services. A survey of the patent information services in the countries of Asia and the Pacific carried out by the International Bureau of WIPO has put India in the first category because here information services are rendered by both the Industrial property organisation and other outside agencies. ...|$|R
5000|$|A coastal {{city with}} a major {{maritime}} industry, Dundee's harbour has long been of importance. As early as 1447 King James II of Scotland granted letters <b>patent</b> to Dundee's <b>Council</b> granting {{them the right to}} collect dues on goods coming in via the port. In 1770 the harbour was remodelled by John Smeaton, who introduced water tunnels to tackle the perennial problems caused by the vast quantities of silt washed down the Tay which formed sandbanks in the harbour, thus blocking it. In 1815 a Harbour Act was passed which moved control of the harbour from the Town Council to a Board of Harbour Commissioners. Under their guidance the harbour was greatly expanded from the 1820s with the addition of King William IV Dock, Earl Grey Dock, Victoria Dock and Camperdown Dock. In 1844 a triumphal arch made of timber was erected at the entrance of the harbour to mark the arrival, by sea, of Queen Victoria on her way to her first holiday in Aberdeenshire. In 1849 a competition was held to design a replacement permanent structure. The competition was won by a design submitted by James Thomas Rochead. The resulting Royal Arch quickly became one of Dundee's most iconic symbols. [...] King William IV Dock and the Early Grey Dock were filled in in the 1960s during the construction of the Tay Road Bridge and its approach roads and the Royal Arch was demolished at the same time. The Arch {{is the subject of a}} famous photograph by the photojournalist Michael Peto.|$|R
