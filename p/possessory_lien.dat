2500|$|Movers are {{typically}} {{entitled to a}} mover's lien under UCC § 7-307/308, to withhold a customer's goods to secure payment. [...] This is a <b>possessory</b> <b>lien,</b> and is the non-consensual type of lien (because it exists automatically under a statute instead of being affirmatively agreed upon). [...] However, {{the concept of a}} mover's lien is often abused in a moving scam known as a hostage load, whereby the moving company will fraudulently extort money not owed by the customer by refusing to deliver the goods unless the customer pays money inflated beyond the contractual estimate.

40|$|This text examines, {{analyzes}} {{and comments}} upon the important subjects within maritime law, with {{particular emphasis on}} relevant case law. It incorporates statutory developments and international conventions, including salvage (LOF 2000 and SCOPIC). It also covers the subject of oil pollution and comments on the Bunker Pollution Convention. Other areas covered include salvage and towage and when one becomes the other; claims including <b>liens,</b> statutory <b>liens,</b> <b>possessory</b> <b>liens</b> and their ranking in order of priority; ship mortgages; ownership and registration; shipbuilding contracts; ship sale; collision and limitation of liability...|$|R
2500|$|... hotelkeeper's lien—a <b>possessory</b> or {{statutory}} <b>lien</b> allowing an innkeeper to hold, {{as security}} for payment, personal property that a guest has {{brought into the}} hotel (also referred to as an innkeeper's lien).|$|R
2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, negotiable instruments, uncalled shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a <b>possessory</b> <b>lien,</b> where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>possessory</b> <b>lien,</b> a lien which {{continues}} {{only during the}} possession of the lienor.|$|E
50|$|A legal lien, in many {{common law}} systems, {{includes}} {{a right to}} retain physical possession of tangible assets as security for the underlying obligations. In some jurisdictions it {{is a form of}} possessory security, and possession of the assets must be transferred to (and maintained by) the secured party. In the case of a <b>possessory</b> <b>lien,</b> the right is purely passive. In the case of a <b>possessory</b> <b>lien,</b> the secured party (the lienor) has no right to sell the assets - merely a right to refuse to return them until paid. In the United States, a lien can be a non-possessory security interest.|$|E

5000|$|... general lien—a <b>possessory</b> <b>lien</b> {{by which}} the lien holder may retain any of the debtor's goods in the lien holder's {{possession}} until any debt due from the debtor, whether {{in connection with the}} retained goods or otherwise, has been paid. Factors, insurance brokers, packers, stockbrokers and banker's liens are all usually general liens.|$|E
50|$|More specifically, a Quebec priorité is a non-possessory, indivisible, unregistrable (i.e. un-perfectable) real {{security}} arising by {{operation of}} law alone merely providing a priority right over the security subject. When attaching to movable property, this security interest most closely matches the hypothec as defined {{at the head of}} this article. The primary priorités correspond to the American vendor's lien, lien for court costs, municipal lien, and <b>possessory</b> <b>lien</b> (over movables).|$|E
50|$|In the UK, most factors {{fall within}} the {{definition}} of a mercantile agent under the Factors Act 1889 and therefore have the powers of such. A factor has a <b>possessory</b> <b>lien</b> over the consigned goods that covers any claims against the principal arising out of the factor's activity. A debt factor, whether a person or firm (factoring company), accepts as assignee book debts (accounts receivable) as security for short-term loans; this is known as factoring.|$|E
50|$|Under the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s.41, {{the seller}} is {{entitled}} to exercise a <b>possessory</b> <b>lien</b> over the vessel until payment by the buyer. Also, the seller {{is entitled to}} resell the vessel to another buyer if the buyer fails to settle the payment in time. An unpaid seller may bring an action to recover the sale cost where the buyer has acquired the property in the ship but refuses or fails to pay the price.|$|E
50|$|A Shipowner’s Lien is a <b>possessory</b> <b>lien</b> {{which is}} the major {{difference}} between it and other maritime liens. The right to this lien can be applied only on the goods which are delivering by the shipowner when the shipper is the contractual party. It may entitle the shipowner to retain the cargoes as security for the payment of a debt. The contractual shipowner’s lien is currently found in all contracts for carriage of goods by sea nowadays, and may be claimed if the shippers fail to pay the due on time. However, some authorities state {{that there is no}} difference between shipowner’s lien and maritime lien.|$|E
50|$|Most {{states require}} a {{rigorous}} process {{to determine the}} owner of the vehicle and the disposition of the title before allowing a vehicle to be auctioned. This includes a title search, publication of an impending sale and certified letters in an attempt to give the vehicle's owner an opportunity to pay towing and storage costs and recover the vehicle. In the case of serviceable vehicles, the towing company may offer this documentation in a packet known as the <b>possessory</b> <b>lien</b> papers, which can be used to obtain a new title. Given the expense of the process, many lots will charge a significant fee for the papers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{property}} taken must be [...] "of another". Thus {{wild animals}} cannot be stolen. Nor can co-owners {{be guilty of}} larceny. Larceny is a crime against possession. Therefore, {{it is possible for}} the person who has title to the property to steal the property from a person who had lawful possession. For example, states provide that a person who repairs a car had a lien on the car to secure payment for the work. The lien is a <b>possessory</b> <b>lien</b> meaning the repair person has the lien as long as he maintains possession of the car. If the title owner were to take the car from the lienholder this action could be prosecuted as larceny in some jurisdictions.|$|E
50|$|Movers are {{typically}} {{entitled to a}} mover's lien under UCC § 7-307/308, to withhold a customer's goods to secure payment.

However, {{the concept of a}} mover's lien is often abused in a moving scam known as a hostage load, whereby the moving company will fraudulently extort money not owed by the customer by refusing to deliver the goods unless the customer pays money inflated beyond the contractual estimate.

The FMCSA regulates the moving industry and sometimes takes enforcement action by fining and/or delicensure of offending moving companies. Moving companies that deliberately engage in hostage-loading may also be considered to be engaging in racketeering in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.|$|E
