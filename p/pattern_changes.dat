5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear <b>pattern,</b> <b>changes</b> in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
25|$|A neural {{representation}} {{within an}} {{artificial neural network}} is a temporarily activated (neural) state within a specific neural map.

40|$|Abstract We {{elaborate}} {{on the subject of}} <b>pattern</b> <b>change</b> as the result of population evolution. We give an overview of literature threads relevant to this subject, whereupon the major focus of related work is on pattern adaptation rather than on modeling and understanding change. We then describe our temporal model for patterns as evolving objects and propose criteria to capture the interestingness of <b>pattern</b> <b>change</b> and heuristics that trace interesting changes. ...|$|R
25|$|In mathematics, more {{specifically}} in fractal geometry, a fractal dimension is a ratio providing a statistical index of complexity comparing how detail {{in a pattern}} (strictly speaking, a fractal <b>pattern)</b> <b>changes</b> with the scale at which it is measured. It has also been characterized {{as a measure of}} the space-filling capacity of a pattern that tells how a fractal scales differently from the space it is embedded in; a fractal dimension {{does not have to be}} an integer.|$|E
25|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} is {{the capacity}} of a single genotype to exhibit a range of phenotypes in response to variation in the environment. For example, in Nemoria arizonaria caterpillars, the cryptic <b>pattern</b> <b>changes</b> according to season and is triggered by dietary cues. In the spring, the first brood of caterpillars resembles oak catkins, or flowers. By the summer when the catkins have fallen, the caterpillars discreetly mimic oak twigs. No intermediate forms are present in this species, although {{other members of the}} Nemoria genus, such as N. darwiniata, do exhibit transitional forms.|$|E
25|$|Light {{scattered}} {{in a blue}} sky forms a characteristic pattern of partially polarized light which {{is dependent on the}} position of the sun and invisible to human eyes. With a UV receptor in each of the lens units of a compound eye, and a UV filter oriented differently in each of these units, a bee is able to detect this polarization pattern. A small piece of blue sky is enough for a bee to recognize the <b>pattern</b> <b>changes</b> occurring {{over the course of a}} day. This provides not only directional but also temporal information.|$|E

500|$|The leopard {{catshark}} (Poroderma pantherinum) is {{a species}} of catshark, {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, endemic to the coastal waters of South Africa. Abundant in inshore waters under [...] deep, this bottom-dweller favors rocky reefs, kelp beds, and sandy flats. Growing to a length of , the leopard catshark has a stout body with two dorsal fins placed well back, and a short head and tail. It is extremely variable in color and pattern, with individuals ranging from almost white to black and covered by diverse patterns of black spots, blotches, rosettes, and/or lines. The color <b>pattern</b> <b>changes</b> with age and some forms seem to be location-specific, suggesting the presence of multiple distinct, local populations. In the past, some of the more distinct color forms have been described as different species.|$|E
500|$|The two {{panels of}} {{interlace}} {{use the same}} design, of what David H. Wright describes as the [...] "alternating pair thin-line type" [...] which he calls [...] "perhaps the most sophisticated of Insular interlace types". [...] The panels are symmetrical about a vertical axis, except for the left end of the upper panel, which is different. Whereas the other ends of the pattern finish in a flat line parallel with the vertical framing line, part of a shape like an incomplete D, the top left finishes in two ellipses pointing into the corners. [...] The lines forming the interlace patterns are coloured in the dark blue/black and the bright yellow, but differently. [...] In the lower panel the yellow colours the left half of the design, but the upper panel begins at the (deviant) left in the dark colour, then switches to yellow once the <b>pattern</b> <b>changes</b> to that used {{for the rest of}} the panels. [...] It continues in yellow until the central point, then changes to the dark colour for the right hand side of the design.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cause for}} this [...] is the {{separation}} of the flow from the blade surfaces. This effect {{can be explained by the}} flow over an air foil. When the angle of incidence increases (during the low velocity flow) at the [...] entrance of the air foil, flow <b>pattern</b> <b>changes</b> and separation occurs. This is the first stage of stalling and through this separation point the flow separates leading to the formation of vortices, back flow in the separated region. For a further the explanation of stall and rotating stall, refer to compressor surge. The stall zone for the single axial fan and axial fans operated in parallel are shown in the figure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} of communication {{is evident from}} the highly elaborate morphology, behaviour and physiology that some animals have evolved to facilitate this. These include some of the most striking structures in the animal kingdom, such as the peacock's tail, the antlers of a stag and the frill of the frill-necked lizard, but also include even the modest red spot on a European herring gull's bill. [...] Highly elaborate behaviours have evolved for communication such as the dancing of cranes, the <b>pattern</b> <b>changes</b> of cuttlefish, and the gathering and arranging of materials by bowerbirds. [...] Other evidence for the {{importance of}} communication in animals is the prioritisation of physiological features to this function, for example, birdsong appears to have brain structures entirely devoted to its production. All these adaptations require evolutionary explanation.|$|E

The first two stories have paired windows topped by a small quatrefoil under a pointed dripstone. At the third story this <b>pattern</b> <b>changes</b> to double windows under cusped arches topped by a crocketed ogee arch, above which is a line of plain corbels. The fourth story windows, surrounding the , consist of three narrow louvered arches with a cusped dripstone and gable.

6000|$|Mr. Taylor has, however, called {{attention}} to an important principle which underlies the various patterns or ornamental markings of animals--namely, that diversified coloration follows the chief lines of structure, and changes at points, such as the joints, where function changes. He says, [...] "If we take highly decorated species--that is, animals marked by alternate dark or light bands or spots, such as the zebra, some deer, or the carnivora, we find, first, that {{the region of the}} spinal column is marked by a dark stripe; secondly, that the regions of the appendages, or limbs, are differently marked; thirdly, that the flanks are striped or spotted, along or between the regions of the lines of the ribs; fourthly, that the shoulder and hip regions are marked by curved lines; fifthly, that the <b>pattern</b> <b>changes,</b> and the direction of the lines, or spots, at the head, neck, and every joint of the limbs; and lastly, that the tips of the ears, nose, tail, and feet, and the eye are emphasised in colour. In spotted animals the greatest length of the spot is generally {{in the direction of the}} largest development of the skeleton." ...|$|E
