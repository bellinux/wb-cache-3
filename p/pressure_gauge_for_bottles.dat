5000|$|Pressure is a {{force that}} can be {{measured}} absolutely, because the natural minimum of pressure is total vacuum. Pressure is frequently measured with reference to atmospheric pressure rather than on any absolute scale, relative to complete and perfect vacuum; it is technologically simpler and cheaper. It may also be more convenient to use relative scales, because, with things like pneumatics and hydraulics, {{the amount of energy}} transferred is reduced by the relative [...] "backpressure" [...] of the atmosphere. (e.g.: 15 psi of air in a tank at sea level will become 30 psi in the vacuum of space.) Therefore, with measurements of things like blood pressure or tire pressure, a measurement relative to air pressure is a better indication of [...] "burst pressure" [...] (damage threshold) than an absolute scale. Absolute scales are typically used in science, deep vacuum measurements (where the fluctuating pressure of the atmosphere becomes a nuisance), aeronautics (where precise measurements of the atmosphere are needed to determine altitude), or lighting construction (where the relative pressure of the atmosphere is inconsequential), and are measured in units of [...] "atmospheres" [...] or torr. Barometers do measure absolute pressure by holding a vacuum {{at the top of the}} mercury column or one side of a diaphragm, but that vacuum is awkward to achieve and maintain. Thus, while the general public may be familiar with measurements of absolute pressure from weather forecasts, most pressures such as tire pressures and water pressures are measured relative to atmospheric pressure using cheaper and simpler <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges.</b> <b>For</b> this reason, the pressure relative to atmospheric <b>pressure</b> is called <b>gauge</b> <b>pressure</b> and measurements given in units like pounds per square inch (abbreviated lbf/in2 or psi) are often shown as psig (the [...] "g" [...] standing <b>for</b> <b>gauge)</b> or psia ("a" [...] for absolute).|$|R

We subtract noise from three adjacent seafloor broadband seismometer stations at the OSN- 1 deep-ocean test site: one sitting on the seafloor, another buried 1 m deep in sediments, and the third clamped in a borehole 248 m beneath the seafloor. Seafloor currents generate the seafloor sensor tilt noise, whereas tidally driven fluid pumping generates the borehole sensor tilt noise. Subtracting the tilt noise reduces the vertical channel noise levels by 35 – 40 dB between 1 and 60 mHz on the seafloor sensor and by 15 – 20 dB between 1 and 10 mHz on the borehole sensor. Subtracting the ocean-wave noise further reduces the noise level on all instruments by 5 – 15 dB between 4 and 20 mHz. After subtracting tilt and ocean-wave noise, the seafloor vertical channel is 5 – 10 dB quieter than the buried sensor vertical channel at frequencies below 30 mHz.
