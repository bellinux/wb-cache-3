The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no <b>provision</b> to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}.

40|$|We {{analyze and}} group antitakeover <b>provisions</b> {{as they relate}} to CEO’s {{monetary}} benefits. We specifically focus on the determinants of the six E-index <b>provisions</b> that were proposed by Bebchuk et al. (2009) to conversely affect firm value. The six <b>provisions</b> are split into two indices: those that provide managers with a monetary benefit if a takeover was successful (MB <b>provisions)</b> and those that do not (TP <b>provisions).</b> Results indicate that CEOs with a role duality use their power to influence the adoption of MB <b>provisions</b> and resist the adoption of TP <b>provisions.</b> Moreover, in the presence of CEO duality, the relationship between MB <b>provisions</b> and firm value worsens. On the other hand, the relationship between TP <b>provisions</b> and firm value is unaffected by the presence of CEO duality. This suggests that CEOs having a role duality do not feel the need to work in the shareholders’ best interest when entrenched with MB <b>provisions.</b> Our findings suggest that studying all the <b>provisions</b> of the E-index as a whole can be misleading in some cases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a partial equilibrium {{model of a}} banking firm to analyze how <b>provisioning</b> rules influence loan market fluctuations.

Our findings support the call {{for the implementation of}} a dynamic <b>provisioning</b> system...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} roles of {{information}} sharing and borrower’s legal rights in affecting the procyclical effect of bank loan loss <b>provisions.</b> Based on a sample of Asian banks, our empirical results highlight that higher non-discretionary <b>provisions</b> reduce loan growth and, hence, non-discretionary <b>provisions</b> are procyclical. A closer investigation suggests that better information sharing through public credit registries managed by central banks, not private credit bureaus managed by the private sector, might substitute {{for the role of}} dynamic <b>provisioning</b> systems in mitigating the procyclicality of non-discretionary <b>provisions.</b> We also document that higher discretionary <b>provisions</b> in countries with stronger legal rights for borrowers temper the procyclical effect of non-discretionary <b>provisions.</b> However, these findings hold only for small banks. This suggests that the implementation of dynamic <b>provisioning</b> systems to mitigate the procyclicality of non-discretionary <b>provisions</b> is more crucial for large banks...|$|R

40|$|We study {{whether and}} how capital {{regulation}} affects banks’ loan loss <b>provisions.</b> Using handpicked data on 46 Nordic banks, we find that banks use discretion to reduce loan loss <b>provisions</b> for regulatory capital management purposes. Exercising discretion to reduce <b>provisions</b> shifts capital from the expected loss buffer to the unexpected loss buffer {{at the expense of}} banks’ overall ability to absorb loan losses. Controlling for non-discretionary determinants of loan loss <b>provisions,</b> we find that banks reduce <b>provisions</b> when an increase in capital requirements puts pressure on eligible capital for regulatory purposes. Additionally, we find that banks’ regulatory capital position influences <b>provisioning</b> behavior. We show that a stronger regulatory capital position coming into the year yields higher levels of loan loss <b>provisions,</b> while an improvement in regulatory capital position during the year constitutes a reduction in loan loss <b>provisions.</b> When studying SIFI-banks and IRB-banks, we find no evidence indicating that newly enacted regulations are effective in limiting discretionary <b>provisions</b> for regulatory purposes. Our analyses indicate that banks exercise discretionary <b>provisioning</b> behavior when circumventing regulatory capital requirements...|$|R
