40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from anxiety disorders show increased fear when encounter a novel environment. Rodents, placed in new environmental context may respond either with increased novelty seeking (active), or enhanced anxiety (passive coping style), which {{may depend on}} the trait anxiety of the animal. Here, {{the connection between the}} initial level of anxiety and the behavioral responses in a novel environment was investigated. Two inbred mouse strains having either high- or low-anxiety related behavior (AX and nAX) were exposed to elevated plus maze (EPM), a standard test for assessing anxiety level, for 8 consecutive days. The initial anxiety level was modulated by chronic treatment with buspirone (bus) treatment, a clinically effective anxiolytic, using 2. 5. mg/kg and 5. 0. mg/kg doses. Both strains showed a gradual decrease of open-arm exploration, which was not prevented by bus treatment. Another cohort of animals was exposed to EPM for 2 days, and then we changed to blue light illumination and used a different cleaning substance with citrus odor (context change, CC). It was found that upon CC AX mice exhibited increased, while nAX mice showed decreased anxiety. Bus in 2. 5. mg/kg changed the coping strategy from passive to active exploration after CC in the AX mice; however, the same treatment rendered nAX mice <b>passive</b> upon CC. <b>Bus</b> in 5. 0. mg/kg failed to alter the overall coping style in the novel environment of both strains. These results suggest that these mouse lines use different coping strategy in novel context, which can be changed with bus treatment. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|The first {{demonstration}} of a directly modulated microring laser array is presented for ON-OFF keyed, wavelength- division-multiplexed fiber-optic data transmission. GaInAsP–InP microring resonators oscillating at separate wavelengths in the 1. 5 -m band are vertically coupled {{to a common}} passive wave-guide bus, which is fabricated on the reverse side of the InP membrane. Two microrings defined with radii for a wavelength channel separation of 6 nm have been assessed for both individual and simultaneous operation. Negligible power penalty (0. 2 dB) is observed for wavelength-division-multiplexed operation with and without transmission over a 25 -km fiber span in a manner which indicates low crosstalk between the integrated sources.

40|$|Since {{the amount}} of elderly people and people being {{overweight}} are increasing, there should be means to prevent people from getting weight and to ensure longer independency and ability in everyday living among elderly people to decrease the costs that are caused by these trends. Purpose {{of the study was}} to compare muscle activity and oxygen consumption in an active and passive commute to demonstrate the effectiveness of active way of living. Thigh muscle EMG activity and oxygen consumption (VO 2) during different daily activities such as walking and stair negotiation in unloaded and loaded conditions were measured from 16 elderly individuals, but due to incomplete data nine subjects were included to the analyses. Measurements consisted of two laboratory measurement days during which body composition, muscle strength and maximal VO 2 test were measured in addition to the daily activities. VO 2 and EMG activities were compared in two conditions 1) commute by bus vs. walking 1 km and 2) ascending and descending floors using stairs vs. lift. Results showed that in an active way of commute (i. e. walking) an elderly person can use over 3 times {{the amount of}} oxygen and muscle activity that is present in <b>passive</b> commute (using <b>bus).</b> Using stairs requires over 11 times the amount of oxygen and muscle activity than when using lift. During stair ascend the mean peak EMG activity exceeded 120 %MVC while mean peak VO 2 was about 70 % VO 2 max. Further, those who were able to ascend all the five flights did not reach 100 % MVC muscle activity level but the others did. It seems that active way of commute provides one effective way of preventing individuals from weight gain...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Providing priority to buses at traffic signals is widely used in Cities all over the world, but not in South Africa. The Department of Transport is rolling out Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in all the major cities in South Africa, and providing priority to buses at signalized intersections, should form {{part of the overall}} design. A need exist to develop local experience and methodologies for the design of bus priority systems. The paper explains basic concepts such as <b>passive</b> and active <b>bus</b> priority as well as the technology required to implement active bus priority. Illustrations are provided of the basic active priority, namely extension of a stage, advancing a stage and skipping a stage. The potential benefit of bus priority, using these 3 methods are shown for 80 second cycle lengths and 120 second cycle lengths and the negative impacts, such as long cross road delay, is highlighted. The challenges of providing bus priority on routes where the block lengths are short and traffic signals are spaced less than 200 m to 300 m apart, are also highlighted. A logic for making the decisions related to bus priority is provided that aim to provide planners with a structured way to design bus priority, and also to act as a way of communication between bus schedulers, providers of controllers and other systems and traffic engineers.

40|$|Microring {{resonators}} {{will be one}} of {{the most}} important components of the next generation of optical communications. In this work, we have analyzed from theoretical perspective a new proposed microring resonator structure based on the wafer-bonding technique which implies the vertical coupling between the <b>passive</b> <b>bus</b> waveguide and the active ring resonator. We have investigated the possibility to obtain the monomode operation of the active ring waveguide for certain ring radius values by the selective attenuations of the higher order modes and the obtaining of the desired coupling efficiency by varying the technological parameters like the layers thickness, etching depth, bus waveguide width and the offset (misalignment between the ring and the bus waveguide). Depending on the fabrication method, the misalignment between the ring resonator and the bus waveguide may vary within a significant range. Therefore, we considered a much wider bus waveguide in the coupling region in order to minimise the effects of misalignment...|$|E
40|$|Classes of {{performance}} measures {{expressed in terms}} of H_ 2 -norms have been recently introduced to quantify the response of coupled dynamical systems to external perturbations. For the specific case of electric power networks, these measures quantify for instance the primary effort control to restore synchrony, the amount of additional power that is ohmically dissipated during the transient following the perturbation or, more conceptually, the coherence of the synchronous state. So far, investigations of these performance measures have been restricted to nodal perturbations. Here, we go beyond earlier works and consider the equally important, but so far neglected case of line perturbations. We consider a network-reduced power system, where a Kron reduction has eliminated passive buses. Identifying the effect that a line fault in the physical network has on the Kron-reduced network, we find that performance metrics depend on whether the faulted line connects two passive, two active buses or one active to one <b>passive</b> <b>bus.</b> In all cases, performance metrics depend quadratically on the original load on the faulted line times a topology dependent factor. Our theoretical formalism being restricted to Dirac-δ perturbations, we investigate numerically the validity of our results for finite-time line faults. We find good agreement with theoretical predictions for longer fault durations in systems with more inertia. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
