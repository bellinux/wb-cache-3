5|$|Advanced Gemini is {{a number}} of <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> would have {{extended}} the Gemini program {{by the addition of}} various missions, including manned low Earth orbit, circumlunar and lunar landing missions. Gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated by NASA, and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as Agena Target Vehicles, and allowing the crew to perform tethered extra-vehicular activities.|$|E
5|$|Several Congressmen, {{including}} Hamilton, Robert Morris and Gouverneur Morris, {{attempted to}} use this Newburgh conspiracy as leverage to secure support from the states and in Congress for funding of the national government. They encouraged MacDougall to continue his aggressive approach, threatening unknown consequences if their demands were not met, and defeated <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> would have resolved the crisis without establishing general federal taxation: that the states assume the debt to the army, or that an impost be established dedicated to {{the sole purpose of}} paying that debt.|$|E
5|$|The clutch was {{described}} as consisting of a single egg; given the bird's large size, this led to <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> the solitaire was K-selected, which means it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required extensive parental care until maturity. The gathering of unrelated juveniles suggests that they formed crèches, that may have followed foraging adults {{as part of the}} learning process. A study of subfossil remains found that the carpal knob only developed after the bird reached skeletal maturity.|$|E

5|$|Aldwych is {{a closed}} {{station on the}} London Underground, located in the City of Westminster in Central London. It was opened in 1907 with the name Strand, after the street on which it is located, and was the {{terminus}} of the short Piccadilly line branch from Holborn that was {{a relic of the}} merger of two railway schemes. The station building is close to the Strand's junction with Surrey Street, near Aldwych. During its lifetime, the branch {{was the subject of a}} number of unrealised extension <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> would have seen the tunnels through the station extended southwards, usually to Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{role in the}} Pacific War {{declined}} from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government {{to reduce the size}} of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued until the end of the war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan's defeat and remain controversial.|$|E

5|$|Following the Local Government Act 1992 legislation; the LGBCE {{was once}} again charged with {{examining}} all English non-metropolitan counties, but was given authority to recommend <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> would significantly alter or abolish administrative areas. Accompanying legislation known as the Local Government Changes for England Regulations 1994 also established a new single-tier form of administrative unit known as a 'Unitary authority'. These new councils {{would be responsible for}} all services carried out by non-metropolitan district and county authorities within their area, thus resembling county boroughs. The county of Hereford & Worcester was to be reviewed again, despite an earlier structural review which recommended no change to the county.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{refused to}} turn professional, and {{continued}} running as amateur in Finland. In 1933, {{he ran his}} first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926. At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> lost. The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds {{in violation of the}} IAAF amateur code. With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite. Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934. Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career. In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November 1845 the Derby and Crewe Railway {{was absorbed}} into the NSR Scheme. This was a line that was being {{supported}} by the Grand Junction Railway (GJR) running between Derby and Crewe via Uttoxeter and Stoke. It was to eliminate the opposition of the Grand Junction company to the other NSR <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> the NSR agreed to absorb the Derby and Crewe. However {{part of the deal}} was that the proposed line from Harecastle to Liverpool was abandoned. Despite having arranged to purchase the T canal for a considerable sum, to obtain support for the Liverpool extension the NSR agreed to the GJR demand. All that survived of the NSR Liverpool plan was the short branch to Sandbach from Harecastle.|$|E

Proposed reforms include a plan to replace the College of Cardinals as the electoral body with the Synod of Bishops, which includes many more members.

Universi Dominici gregis explicitly provides that even if a synod or an ecumenical council is in session {{at the time of}} a pope's death, it may not perform the election. Upon the pope's death, either body's proceedings are suspended, to be resumed only upon the order of the new pope.|$|E
5|$|The Quebec Agreement allowed Simon and Peierls to {{meet with}} representatives of Kellex, who were {{designing}} and building the American gaseous diffusion plant, Union Carbide and Carbon, who would operate it, and Harold Urey's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, the Manhattan Project's centre tasked with {{research and development of}} the process. The year's loss of cooperation cost the Manhattan Project dearly. The corporations were committed to tight schedules, and the engineers were unable to incorporate British <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> would involve major changes. Nor would it be possible to build a second plant. Nonetheless, the Americans were still eager for British assistance, and Groves asked for a British mission to be sent to assist the gaseous diffusion project. In the meantime, Simon and Peierls were attached to Kellex.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{occasional}} <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> Norway should build a permanent bobsleigh track, where Korketrekkeren {{was the leading}} location. The debate died out in the 1990s with the selection of Lillehammer as {{the host of the}} 1994 Winter Olympics and the subsequent construction of Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track. Also the Oslo bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics proposed using the Lillehammer track. In 2007, there were two serious accidents in the hill and it was subsequently closed by the police. The municipality then renovated the hill, removing poles and polstering dangerous edges.|$|E

40|$|Wepropose a {{typology}} formeasuring agenda-setting {{success and}} failure in a legislative context. Our typology goes beyond {{the most commonly used}} measure (“rolls”) and includes the full range of agenda-setting outcomes—rolls (opposing a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> subsequently passes), as well as “blocks ” (opposing a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> is subsequently defeated), “successes ” (supporting a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> subsequently passes), and “disappointments ” (supporting a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> is subsequently defeated) —and thus takes into account instances of both positive and negative agenda power. We discuss these measures, and the theoretical questions surrounding them, with the hope of providing some guidance to scholars of the U. S. House, as well as those analyzing agenda power in other legislatures. As a first step in this direction, we explore variation in agenda-setting measures in 85 American state legislative chambers, the Mexican Chamber of Deputies, and the Canadian House of Commons. As studies of legislative agenda setting originatedwith the U. S. House in mind and focused pri-marily on the majority party’s ability to exercise negative agenda control (i. e., to prevent consideration of proposals), the literature has tended to focus on “rolls” (when an agenda setter opposes a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> nonethe-less passes) as the appropriate measure of agenda power. 1 But rolls are not the whole story when it comes to as...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting the delegates was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all of the delegates from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E
5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} {{for more than}} a century to understand who is portrayed in this painting. Earlier <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> the subject was John III Sobieski (who would have been eight years old in 1637) or Stephen Bathory (who died in 1586) have been discredited. According to Otakar Odložilík, while the man in the painting is clearly wearing Polish garb, it is neither certain who he is, nor whether he is a Pole. Odložilík's research on this issue suggested that the painting may be that of Andrzej Rej, a Polish noble and diplomat of that era who passed through Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where Rembrandt was working, at the time the painting was created. Nonetheless, without any documents from that era clearly acknowledging that fact, as Odložilík noted, it may never be known for certain who the subject really is.|$|E

5|$|Small Heath {{were elected}} to the newly formed Second Division in 1892, {{and went on to}} win the divisional championship. However, {{promotion}} to the First Division depended on the test match system, in which each of the lowest-ranked three teams from the First Division played off against one of the highest-ranked three from the Second Division. Small Heath lost to Newton Heath after a replay, so were not promoted. The League's Annual General Meeting heard <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> the First Division be expanded to either 20 or 18 teams. Both motions were, unsurprisingly, seconded by Small Heath, but both were defeated, thus confirming that the team would play in the Second Division for the 1893–94 season. The Second Division championship shield was presented to the club at a meeting of the Football League held at the Colonnade Hotel in New Street, Birmingham, in August.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House. To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes {{would be necessary to}} pass the Senate. At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, while Arlen Specter was still a Republican (he became a Democrat in April, 2009).|$|E
5|$|Walker {{resisted}} Kenney's <b>proposals</b> <b>that</b> {{the bombers}} conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker {{to try the}} fuses {{for a couple of}} months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck, but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|E
