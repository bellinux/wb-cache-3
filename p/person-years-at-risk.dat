40|$|Low- {{and middle-income}} {{countries}} {{have a higher}} burden of fatal and non-fatal injuries. The lack of evidence-based information hampers efforts for injury prevention. The {{aim of this study}} was to calculate non-fatal injury incidence rates and to investigate causes and risk factors for non-fatal injuries in Khartoum state. Information was gathered in a community-based survey using a stratified two-stage cluster sampling technique. Methods of data collection were face-to-face interviews during October and November 2010. The total number of individuals included was 5661, residing in 973 households. The overall injury incidence rate was 82. 0 / 1000 <b>person-years-at-risk.</b> The three leading causes were falls, mechanical forces and road traffic crashes. Low socio-economic status was a risk factor for injuries in urban areas. Males had a significantly higher risk of being injured in both urban and rural areas. Our findings can contribute to the planning of prevention programmes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) is a humoral {{immunological}} {{response in}} leprosy {{that leads to}} inflammatory skin nodules which may result in nerve and organ damage, and may occur years after antibiotic treatment. Multiple episodes are frequent and suppression requires high doses of immunosuppressive drugs. Global occurrence is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Systematic review of evidence on ENL incidence resulted in 65 papers, predominantly from India (24) and Brazil (9), and inclusive of four reviews. Average incidences are based on cumulative incidence and size of study populations (n. 100). In field-based studies 653 / 54, 737 (1. 2 %) of all leprosy cases, 194 / 4, 279 (4. 5 %) of MB cases, and 86 / 560 (15. 4 %) of LL cases develop ENL. Some studies found a range of 1 – 8 per 100 <b>person-years-at-risk</b> (PYAR) amongst MB cases. Hospital samples indicate that 2, 393 / 17, 513 (13. 7 %) of MB cases develop ENL. Regional differences could not be confirmed. Multiple ENL episodes occurred in 39 to 77 % of ENL patients, {{with an average of}} 2. 6. Some studies find a peak in ENL incidence {{in the first year of}} treatment, others during the second and third year after starting MDT. The main risk factor for ENL is a high bacteriological index. Conclusions/Significance: Few studies reported on ENL as a primary outcome, and definitions of ENL differed between studies. Although, in this review averages are presented, accurate data on global and regional ENL incidence is lacking...|$|E
40|$|Background The Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) is {{the largest}} {{population}} under continuous mortality surveillance in tropical Africa. Admissions to Kilifi County Hospital, the only inpatient facility in KHDSS, {{are linked to the}} KHDSS population register creating passive morbidity surveillance. We analysed the cause-specific incidence of hospital admissions and prevalence to interpret mortality trends in the KHDSS. Methods We studied all deaths in children and adults and all childhood (under 5 years) admissions among residents of KHDSS from January 2004 to December 2013. We estimated mortality rates as the number of deaths divided by the <b>person-years-at-risk</b> (PYAR) of KHDSS residents during each study period. We used ecological regression analyses of observations from 15 locations in each of 10 years to estimate the association between admission rates and prevalence for major infectious diseases and child mortality rates. Results Among 2, 449, 153 PYAR in all ages, 13, 615 deaths were observed; among 450, 632 PYAR in children aged under 5 years, 3592 deaths occurred (rate 8. 2 / 1000 /y). Mortality rates in children, infants and neonates declined by approximately 53 % between 2004 and 2008 but remained stable subsequently. Mortality rates also declined for older children and young adults but not for individuals over 50 years of age. The admission rates of neonatal syndromes remained stable throughout the study period. Admission rates for severe malaria among infants (1 - 12 m) and children (1 - 4 years) declined by 93 % and 72 %, respectively, between 2004 and 2008 but remained stable subsequently. By contrast, admission rates for severe pneumonia, invasive bacterial disease (IBD) and acute diarrhoeal diseases declined steadily throughout the whole period. Examining historical data from 1994 - 6, mortality in children aged 1 - 4 years fell by 89 % over 20 years whilst malaria prevalence declined by 97 %. In ecological analyses from 2004 - 2013, childhood mortality was significantly associated with both prevalence of malaria and incidence of hospitalised malaria; under- 5 year mortality increased by 11 · 5 / 1000 PYAR for each 10 percentage points increase in the background prevalence of malaria. Conclusions Mortality rates declined precipitously in children and young adults but not in those aged over 50 years. Although admission rates for most infectious diseases in children have declined steadily throughout this period, those for malaria most closely reflect the biphasic pattern of mortality reductions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Injuries {{contribute}} significantly to the global burden of disease accounting for 5. 1 million deaths annually. Fatal injuries are {{the tip of the}} iceberg and many more who survive an injury suffer the consequences with varying durations of disability. Fatal and non-fatal injuries are of increasing public health concern globally, particularly in low and middle income countries where they contribute to 90 % of the global burden of injuries. Injuries mostly affect the productive age group, which results in huge socioeconomic impacts for poor populations which are caught in a poverty trap. As for Sudan the present data sources are Sudan Household Health Survey Round 2, hospital-based data, mortuary data, and police data. The scope of these data sources on injuries is limited; a household survey is needed to address the gaps. This thesis draws information from a household survey on the magnitude of injuries, consequences and healthcare use. Methods: The studies presented in this thesis are from a retrospective community-based survey which was conducted in 50 clusters in Khartoum State during October and November 2010. The community-based survey was conducted using a household sample size of 1000. A two stage cluster design with probability of inclusion proportional to size was used to select clusters. The latest sampling frame from CBS considered the state to be 80 % urban and 20 % rural. In the first stage of sampling, the state was stratified according to urban and rural strata. In the second stage a probability proportionate to size method was applied. Households were selected in each cluster using systematic random sampling. Trained data collectors collected data using structured questionnaires for face to face interviews. Details about non-fatal injuries which occurred 12 months preceding the interview were recorded. Information on fatal injuries which occurred 5 years preceding the interview was taken. Data was cleaned and analysed using SPSS 18 and STATA 13. The incidence per 1000 person years at risk was calculated for non-fatal injuries. Poisson regression analysis was used to model injury determinants in urban and rural areas separately. Multivariate negative binomial regression using generalized linear model was applied for hospitalization and disability days. Logistic regression analysis was performed with the dependent variable being use of formal healthcare among injured individuals and with potential confounding variables included in the model. Results: The total number of individuals included in the analysis was 5, 661 residing in 973 households. The household response rate in both the urban and rural clusters was 97 %. The overall injury incidence rate was 82. 0 / 1000 <b>person-years-at-risk</b> (95 % CI: 74. 5, 90. 0). Stratifying the incidence by sex showed a significant difference between males and females. The total incidence for males was 110. 6 / 1000 person years at risk (95 % CI: 98. 4, 124. 0), while the total incidence for females was 69. 2 / 1000 person years at risk (95 % CI: 59. 6, 79. 9). The leading causes of non-fatal injuries were falls followed by mechanical forces (such as cuts, stabs, struck by object, etc.) and road traffic crashes. Low socioeconomic status was a risk factor for injuries in urban areas. Males had a significantly higher risk of being injured in both urban and rural areas. There were 28 deaths due to injuries out of a total of 129 reported deaths over 5 years. The number of disability days differed significantly between mechanisms of injury. Road traffic crashes and falls caused the longest duration of disability. Males had a higher probability than females of losing a job due to an injury. A total of 26 individuals' accessed formal healthcare and about a quarter of the injured persons were admitted to hospital. Injured persons from road traffic crashes and males were most likely to utilize formal health services. The lowest socioeconomic strata were less likely to utilize formal healthcare. Conclusion: The studies from this thesis give ample evidence on injury specific events, the consequences for individuals and families, and on patterns of health care use in Khartoum State. They have explored who is at risk of an injury, and which population groups and causes of injury are more likely to be associated with a longer duration of hospitalization or disability. This study has investigated injured persons' use of formal healthcare. Injuries occurred mainly in the home and street environments. Most injured people reported being injured during work activity. The most vulnerable population groups for injuries were found to be low socioeconomic categories and males, bearing the largest burden and most serious consequences. There is an urgent need to consider injuries in Khartoum as a public health concern, with special emphasis put on primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. </p...|$|E
