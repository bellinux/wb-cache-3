5|$|After {{being kept}} in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning, on 3 March 1661 the emperor's corpse was transported in a lavish {{procession}} to Jingshan 景山 (a hillock {{just north of the}} Forbidden City), after which a large amount of precious goods were burned as funeral offerings. Only two years later, in 1653, was the body transported to its final resting place. Contrary to Manchu customs at the time, which usually dictated that a deceased <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> cremated, the Shunzhi Emperor was buried. He was interred in what later {{came to be known as}} the Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Beijing, one of two Qing imperial cemeteries. His tomb is part of the Xiaoling (孝陵) mausoleum complex (known in Manchu as the Hiyoošungga Munggan), which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site.|$|E
5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love for the <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> greater than their own happiness.|$|E
25|$|He {{moved on}} from Leninism after leaving {{university}} with his doctorate, {{and became a}} researcher for Scottish Labour party. Reid believes that any socialist, or indeed any rational <b>person,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a revisionist on principle.|$|E

25|$|Universality: No <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to {{more easily}} obtain the {{information}} {{of a test}} than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.|$|E
25|$|All sexual {{behaviors}} that involve {{contact with the}} bodily fluids of another <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered to contain some risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Most attention has focused on controlling HIV, which causes AIDS, but each STI presents a different situation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{conscious}} and {{aware of the}} particular salah that is being offered, whether it is obligatory, {{if it is a}} missed (qadha) worship, performed individually or among the congregation, a shortened traveller's worship etc. The explicit verbalization of this intention is not required. The person should think his worship to be the Last Worship so that he may perform the best he can.|$|E

25|$|The term 'icon' {{comes from}} the Greek word eikon, which simply means image. The Orthodox believe that the first icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary were painted by Luke the Evangelist. Icons are filled with {{symbolism}} designed to convey information about the person or event depicted. For this reason, icons tend to be formulaic, following a prescribed methodology for how a particular <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> depicted, including hair style, body position, clothing, and background details.|$|E
25|$|The {{infected}} <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in barrier-isolation {{from other}} people. All equipment, medical waste, patient waste and surfaces {{that may have}} {{come into contact with}} body fluids need to be disinfected. During the 2014 outbreak, kits were put together to help families treat Ebola disease in their homes, which include protective clothing as well as chlorine powder and other cleaning supplies. Education of those who provide care in these techniques, and the provision of such barrier-separation supplies has been a priority of Doctors Without Borders.|$|E
25|$|The main {{institutions}} {{of law in}} industrialised countries are independent courts, representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, bureaucratic organisation, the legal profession and civil society itself. John Locke, in his Two Treatises of Government, and Baron de Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws, advocated for a separation of powers between the political, legislature and executive bodies. Their principle was that no <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to usurp all powers of the state, {{in contrast to the}} absolutist theory of Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan.|$|E

25|$|Community life, {{whereby the}} human being finds {{fulfilment}} in communion with others. In community life {{the people who live}} the Sodalit spirituality are meant to have faith which they share and celebrate, living like a family {{in the same way as}} the disciples of Jesus gathered around Mary. Members of the Sodalitium and its spiritual family come together as friends with the same belief, to share the life of faith, where each <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> for the others a motivation of fervor, humility, prayer, reverence, joy, work, ministry and solidarity.|$|E
25|$|Many {{antibiotics}} {{that were}} once effective including penicillin, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended because of high rates of resistance. Resistance to cefixime has reached a level such {{that it is no}} longer recommended as a first-line agent in the United States, and if it is used a <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> tested again after a week to determine whether the infection still persists. Cases of resistance to ceftriaxone have been reported but are still rare, though public health officials are concerned that an emerging pattern of resistance may predict a global epidemic. The UK's Health Protection Agency reported that 2011 saw a slight drop in gonorrhea antibiotic resistance, the first in 5 years.|$|E
25|$|Rescue, {{and where}} necessary, resuscitation, should be started {{as early as}} {{possible}} for best results. If conscious, the <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taken out of the water as soon as possible. In-water resuscitation may increase the chances of a favourable result by a factor of about three, if there will be any delay in getting the person out of the water, but the necessary skills require training. Only rescue ventilation is practicable in the water, chest compressions require a suitable platform, so in-water assessment of circulation is pointless. If the person does not respond after a few breaths, cardiac arrest may be assumed, and getting them out of the water becomes the priority.|$|E

25|$|Another {{dominant}} {{message that}} was found in Protestant propaganda {{was the idea that}} every <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> granted access to the Bible to interpret it for themselves; this was the primary reason why Luther translated and published numerous copies of the New Testament during the Reformation years. Protestants questioned the belief that the Pope had the sole authority to interpret scripture. This can be seen in Luther’s publication titled To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, which criticized the Catholic belief that the Pope was supreme and could interpret scripture however he saw fit. To combat this, Luther put forth arguments from the Bible that indicated that everyone had the ability to interpret scripture and not just the Pope.|$|E
25|$|This poem {{is a clear}} {{description}} of Martí’s societal hopes for his homeland. Within the poem, he talks about how regardless of the person, whether kind or cruel he cultivates a white rose, meaning that he remains peaceful. This coincides with his ideology about establishing unity amongst the people, more so those of Cuba, through a common identity, with no regards to ethnic and racial differences. This doctrine could be accomplished if one treated his enemy with peace as he would treat a friend. The kindness of one <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> shared with all people, regardless of personal conflict. By following the moral that lies within “Cultivo Rosa Blanca”, Martí’s vision of Cuban solidarity could be possible, creating a more peaceful society that would emanate through future generations.|$|E
25|$|When {{the lens}} first {{contacts}} the eye, {{it should be}} comfortable. A brief period of irritation may occur, caused by a difference in pH and/or salinity between that of the lens solution and the tear. This discomfort fades quickly as the solution drains away and is replaced by the natural tears. However, if irritation persists, the cause could be a dirty, damaged, or inside-out lens. Removing and inspecting it for damage and proper orientation, and re-cleaning if necessary, should correct the problem. If discomfort continues, the lens should not be worn. In some cases, {{taking a break from}} lens wear for a day may correct the problem. In case of severe discomfort, or if it does not resolve by the next day, the <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> seen as soon as possible by an eye doctor to rule out potentially serious complications.|$|E

50|$|A {{voluntary}} assignment policy would hinder combat readiness and effectiveness. A gender-neutral assignment policy for qualified <b>persons</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used. The term “qualified” is determined solely by law and policy.|$|R
25|$|When {{treasure}} has {{vested in}} the Crown and {{is to be}} transferred to a museum, the Secretary of State is required to determine whether a reward should be paid by the museum before the transfer to the finder or any other person involved in the finding of the treasure, the occupier of the land {{at the time of the}} find, or any person who had an interest in the land at the time of the find or has had such an interest at any time since then. If the Secretary of State determines that a reward should be paid, he or she must also determine the market value of the treasure (assisted by the Treasure Valuation Committee), the amount of the reward (which cannot exceed the market value), to whom the reward should be paid and, if more than one <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> paid, how much each person should receive.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, the Treaty of Taipei {{was signed}} {{separately}} between the ROC and Japan that basically {{followed the same}} guideline of the Treaty of San Francisco, not specifying which country has sovereignty over Taiwan. However, Article 10 of the treaty states that the Taiwanese people and the juridical <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{the people and the}} juridical person of the ROC. Both the PRC and ROC governments base their claims to Taiwan on the Japanese Instrument of Surrender which specifically accepted the Potsdam Declaration which refers to the Cairo Declaration. Disputes over the precise de jure sovereign of Taiwan persist to the present. On a de facto basis, sovereignty over Taiwan has been and continues to be exercised by the ROC. Japan's position has been to avoid commenting on Taiwan's status, maintaining that Japan renounced all claims to sovereignty over its former colonial possessions after World War II, including Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{a passing}} mention by another (minor) author, the Annales by the Roman {{historian}} Tacitus (written ca. 98 AD) {{is the sole}} surviving ancient source on the Tacfarinas War. Tacitus gives a relatively detailed account, but its exclusivity {{makes it difficult to}} assess its accuracy and the war's significance. Tacitus was fascinated by the psychology of the emperor Tiberius, whom he regarded as the quintessential flawed tyrant, and the way that the long-drawn out insurgency in Africa with its many crises exposed his weaknesses. For example, the emperor's explosion of fury when he received envoys from Tacfarinas demanding concessions in return for peace. This was not only due to Tiberius' exasperation with the insurgency. Adding insult to injury, Tacfarinas was apparently a commoner by birth, an affront to the status-conscious Romans. To Tiberius, a scion of the illustrious Claudii patrician clan and ruler of a vast empire, it seemed intolerable that such a <b>person</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> seeking to deal with him on an equal basis, like a foreign king. Tacitus relates with relish Tiberius' feelings of personal humiliation.|$|E
