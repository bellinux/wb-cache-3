40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{integration}} of blind people into society, suitable conditions should be provided for them. The expansion of Braille (BR) use could serve the purpose. Depending on the materials used for Braille, it can be formed or printed in different ways: embossing, screen printing, thermoforming, digital printing. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine the effect of thermal properties of screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> and inks with thermo-powder on the qualitative parameters of Braille. Screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> and inks with thermo-powder were chosen for the research. Carrying out the qualitative analysis of printouts with Braille, the thermal stability was evaluated by analyzing the thermograms obtained with derivatograph Q- 1500. This paper presents the findings of the thermogravimetric (TG), differential thermogravimetric (DTG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) of printouts printed on paperboard Plike and using traditional screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> and screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> with thermo-powder. Based on the testing findings it is determined that thermal stability of printouts <b>printed</b> with thermo-powder <b>ink</b> is higher than printed with screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks.</b> It is determined that the appropriate temperature range of screen <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> with thermo-powder drying is 98 ºC – 198 ºC because in this case better relief of Braille dots is obtained.

40|$|Abstract. The {{aging and}} shear {{rejuvenation}} {{behavior of a}} commercial <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> have been studied experimentally using creep and oscillation modes. We observed that the <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> has typical rheological characteristics: time-dependent, reversible and shear-thinning viscosity. Meanwhile, these properties are very strongly influenced by shear history, thus employing pre-shearing to obtain a standard test state is of vital importance. After pre-shearing, the quiescent ink undergoes structural evolution, i. e., aging, including a sol-gel (liquid-solid) transition on the early stage at room temperatures,the higher the temperature, the earlier the sol-gel transition occurs. The degree of aging and shear rejuvenation can be characterized by the waiting time after pre-shearing and the stress dependence of the power-law index. Finally, we use a time-stress superposition to obtain a universal master curve which is able to describe the aging behaviors of the <b>printing</b> <b>ink.</b> This study shows that the aging processes of <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> for different waiting times are self similar, variation of waiting time just change the time scale and elastic modulus...|$|R

As a drying oil similar to tung oil or linseed oil, perilla oil has been used for paints, varnishes, linoleum, <b>printing</b> <b>ink,</b> lacquers, and for protective waterproof coatings on cloth. Perilla oil can also be used for fuel. It is used along with synthetic resins in the production of varnishes. It dries faster than linseed oil and on drying forms a film that is harder and yellows more than that formed by linseed oil. The paint and varnish industry accounts for the largest usage. Perilla oil is also important in the manufacture of <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> and linoleum, and in more ancient times was a critical component in creating durable earthen floors.|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{interactions}} between different solvents (benzene, acetone, cyclohexanone, various alcohols and water) and thermochromic <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> were investigated. Thermochromic <b>printing</b> <b>ink</b> was <b>printed</b> on metal surface. Components of thermochromic <b>printing</b> <b>inks</b> are polymeric microcapsules and classic yellow offset <b>printing</b> <b>ink.</b> Below its activation temperature, dye and developer within the microcapsules form a blue coloured complex. Therefore, thermochromic print is green. By heating above the activation temperature, blue colour of the complex turns into the leuco dye colourless state and the green colour of the prints turns into the yellow colour of the classic offset pigment. The results of the interaction with various solvents show that the thermochromic print is stable in all tested solvents except in ethanol, acetone and cyclohexanone. In ethanol, the green colour of the print becomes yellow. SEM analysis shows that microcapsules are dissolved. In acetone and cyclohexanone, the green colour of the print turns into blue, and the microcapsules become significantly more visible. Thus, the yellow pigment interacts with examined ketones. Based on the obtained interactions {{it can be concluded}} that the microcapsules have more polar nature than the classical pigment particles.
