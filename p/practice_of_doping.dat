50|$|In 1991 Brigitte Berendonk and Werner Franke, two {{opponents of}} the doping, {{published}} several theses which had been drafted former researchers in the GDR doping products which were at the Military Medical Academy Bad Saarow. Based on this work, in their book (translated from German as 'Doping Documents") {{they were able to}} reconstruct the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>doping</b> as it was organized by the State on many great athletes from the GDR, including Marita Koch and Heike Drechsler, who have denied the allegations. Brigitte Berendonk survived a 1993 lawsuit where Drechsler accused her of lying. The lawsuit essentially validates the book.|$|E
5000|$|The German Democratic Republic {{ceased to}} exist in 1990, joining the Federal Republic of Germany {{in the process of}} German reunification. Accordingly, the [...] "NOC of the GDR" [...] joined the [...] "NOC of Germany" [...] on 17 November 1990. German athletes competed at the Olympic Games as a single team again from 1992 onwards. Athletes from the Eastern part of Germany contributed disproportionately to the medals won by Germany, {{particularly}} in the first decade after reunification. This is thought to indicate that doping was not the only reason East Germany was so successful (and more successful than West Germany in particular) in the Olympics, with professional training conditions also being significant. The <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>doping</b> was implemented by a separate state, a former rival who was far less successful. The medal tally of reunited Germany after 1990 was more comparable to that of East Germany before 1990 than of West Germany before 1990. For example, of the twenty nine medals Germany won in the 2006 Winter Olympics East German born (containing one-fifth of the population of Germany) athletes won fourteen (six gold). West German athletes won only nine medals (three gold), with six medals won in mixed teams. In recent years, some centres of German top-class sport have relocated to the West, for example winter sports to Bavaria. However, the East is still performing better than the West. Trainers from East Germany (e.g. Uwe Müßiggang) were important in producing sporting success for United Germany. Also, many top-class German athletes who today live {{in the western part of}} Germany started their professional sport careers in the East, and can be seen as part of the large-scale exodus of young people from the East to the West since reunification.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} doubly peaked {{electric}} fields {{are necessary to}} describe grazing-angle charge collection measurements of irradiated silicon pixel sensors. A model of irradiated silicon based upon two defect levels with opposite charge states and the trapping of charge carriers can be tuned to produce a good description of the measured charge collection profiles in the fluence range from 0. 5 × 10 14 neq/cm 2 to 5. 9 × 10 14 neq/cm 2. The model correctly predicts the variation in the profiles as the temperature is changed from − 10 ◦ C to − 25 ◦ C.

40|$|In this paper, {{drawing from}} the {{theoretical}} approach of Norbert Elias, I argue {{that over the}} course of the last 70 years professional cyclists have undergone civilising processes in relation to doping within the sport. It is not my contention that doping has declined amongst professional cyclists over that time period; that would be very difficult to empirically ascertain. However, I contend that the feelings, attitudes and behaviour of professional cyclists in relation to doping did change significantly. The largely unguarded behaviour and candid admissions concerning the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>doping</b> gradually diminished. Doping was increasingly pushed behind the scenes, and cyclists became more ambivalent in how they discussed the subject. Embarrassment, shame and remorse became a more amplified feature of their accounts. However, this was a gradual, contradictory and fragile process...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} the economic analysis of doping in sport is that athletes are typically involved in a Prisoner’s Dilemma-type interaction (Breivik 1987, Bird and Wagner 1997, Eber and Thépot 1999, Haugen 2004). 1 The idea is straightforward: doping being a dominant strategy (i. e., yielding a preferred outcome regardless of the strategy used by the competitor), each athlete finds it optimal to take drugs; {{this results in a}} situation of generalized doping although each athlete would be better off in a dope-free world. However, athletes generally share some level of fair play norms that tend to inhibit them from doping. 2 The importance of such ethics has been fully recognized by Bird and Wagner (1997, p. 755) : “Doping is an unfair practice that is hard to define and observe; the only real hope for ending the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>doping</b> lies in the norms of fair competition among the athletes. ”Eber (2008) recently showed that the incorporation of fair play norms into the analysis of the basic performance-enhancing drug game may lead to a substantial modification in {{the very nature of the}} game, switching it from a Prisoner’s Dilemma to a coordination (“stag-hunt”) game characterized by two (pure-strategy) equilibria: a “bad” – doping – equilibrium but also a “good” – no-doping – one. “Fair play” athletes then appear as “conditional cooperators:”guided by fair play values, they do not take drugs if they expect that their competitors also do not, but take drugs when they expect that others do the same. Hence, the main problem for athletes becomes to coordinate their intentions. doping; economics of sport; illegal activities...|$|E
40|$|Aim: In {{the last}} few years there has been a {{significant}} increase in the number social science research studies on anti-doping. Few studies have directly examined how athletes (and others) perceive anti-doping rules and processes, nor knowledge of doping practices. The aims of the present research are to assess current levels of doping knowledge amongst elite athletes and their support personnel (defined here as coaches and other support staff at the athlete's club or organisation), and to investigate knowledge of the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>doping</b> in Australian sport. Here the 'practice' of doping is defined as the commission of anti-doping rule violations. Design: A mixed method approach, with an initial on-line survey, followed by in-depth interviews. Method: A total sample of 433 athletes, coaches and support staff completed an online survey, with 98 of those participants also completing a face-to face interview. Results: Attitudes toward doping were overwhelmingly negative, with both athletes and support personnel advocating strong sanctions for deliberate doping, with slightly greater leniency for cases of accidental doping. A wide range of strategies for avoiding the detection of doping were described, including evasion, test tampering and the use of making agents. There were major gaps in knowledge about doping amongst both athletes and support personnel, such as a poorunderstanding of the potential benefits of doping and a widespread perception that doping was a problem for 'other' sports, even though many expressed views that athletes or teams that they were directly competing against were currently doping. Conclusion: Athletes and support staff share a number of potentially damaging expectancies about doping: specifically: doping is common (almost normalised in some sports), banned substances are relatively easy to obtain, and doping is unlikely to be detected. These expectancies, combined with a set of largely unrealistic expectations about the efficacy of both legal nutritional supplements and banned substances, suggest that current anti-doping campaigns are failing to deter doping. Instead, it is to be expected that doping will continue to proliferate amongst elite athletes, and also to become increasingly common amongst community level athletes and even non-athletes...|$|E

Design: A cross-sectional study examines the effects of age (range 12 - 17 years), gender and involvement in sport (elite athletes and non-athletes) on {{the perceived}} incidence <b>of</b> <b>doping.</b> A measure <b>of</b> moral functioning was included as a covariate. Method: 312 participants were asked to estimate the incidence <b>of</b> <b>doping</b> in elite sport, to name a sport they believed in which doping was most prevalent, and to complete a short survey assessing level of moral functioning and demographic characteristics. Results: The overall estimated incidence <b>of</b> <b>doping</b> was 28. 8 %, with athletics, weightlifting and cycling named as the sports in which doping was perceived to be most prevalent.
