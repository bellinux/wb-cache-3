5|$|The Welsh Assembly has the {{authority}} to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass <b>primary</b> <b>legislation</b> known as Acts of the Assembly in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this <b>primary</b> <b>legislation,</b> the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific secondary legislation.|$|E
5|$|Mullen {{suggests}} that {{the failure of the}} Attorney General to challenge either standing or justiciability in the case could have wider implications by lowering the barriers to litigation and also by providing a precedent that people acting in their personal capacities can challenge the validity of <b>primary</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{passed through}} the Parliament Act, {{without the consent of}} the Lords, is still {{considered}} <b>primary</b> <b>legislation.</b> The importance of this was highlighted in Jackson v Attorney General, in which the lawfulness of the Parliament Act 1949 was questioned. The challenge asserted that the 1949 Parliament Act was delegated rather than <b>primary</b> <b>legislation,</b> and that the 1911 Parliament Act had delegated power to the Commons. If this were the case, then the House of Commons could not empower itself through the 1949 Parliament Act without direct permission from the House of Lords. Since it was passed under the 1911 Act, the 1949 Act had never received the required consent of the Lords. However, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords found that the 1949 Act had been lawfully enacted. The 1911 Act, it concluded, was not primarily about empowering the Commons, but rather had the purpose of restricting the ability of the Lords to reject legislation. This ruling also appears to mean that efforts to abolish the House of Lords (a major constitutional change) by using the Act could be successful, although the issue was not directly addressed in the ruling.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the Assembly did {{not have}} primary {{legislative}} or fiscal powers, as these powers were reserved by Westminster. The Assembly did have powers to pass secondary legislation in devolved areas. Sometimes secondary legislation {{could be used to}} amend <b>primary</b> <b>legislation,</b> but the scope of this was very limited. For example, the first Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly power to amend <b>primary</b> <b>legislation</b> relating to the merger of certain public bodies. However, most secondary powers were conferred on the executive by <b>primary</b> <b>legislation</b> to give the executive (i.e. Ministers) more powers, and the Assembly has had wider legislative powers than appearances might suggest. For example, the Assembly delayed local elections due to be held in 2003 for a year by use of secondary powers, so that they would not clash with Assembly elections. In 2001 the UK parliament used <b>primary</b> <b>legislation</b> to delay for one month local elections in England during the Foot and Mouth Disease epidemic.|$|E

25|$|The Assembly {{was created}} by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which {{followed}} a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate <b>primary</b> <b>legislation</b> until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006.

25|$|The 1910 {{election}} saw 42 Labour MPs {{elected to}} the House of Commons, a significant victory since, {{a year before the}} election, the House of Lords had passed the Osborne judgment ruling that Trades Unions in the United Kingdom could no longer donate money to fund the election campaigns and wages of Labour MPs. The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with <b>primary</b> <b>legislation.</b> The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the Trade Unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest Trades Unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow Trade Unions to fund Labour MPs once more.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Parliament passed its first {{comprehensive}} incursion into {{the doctrine of}} contractual freedom in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. The topic of unfair terms is vast, and could equally include specific contracts falling under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the Employment Rights Act 1996 or the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. Legislation, particularly regarding consumer protection, is also frequently being updated by the European Union, in laws like the Flight Delay Compensation Regulation, or the Electronic Commerce Directive, which are subsequently translated into domestic law through a statutory instrument authorised through the European Communities Act 1972 section 2(2), as for example with the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000. The <b>primary</b> <b>legislation</b> on unfair consumer contract terms deriving from the EU {{is found in the}} Consumer Rights Act 2015. The Law Commission had drafted a unified Unfair Contract Terms Bill, but Parliament chose to maintain two extensive documents.|$|E
25|$|Over time ECJ {{developed}} two essential {{rules on}} which the legal order rests: direct effect and primacy. The court first ruled on the direct effect of <b>primary</b> <b>legislation</b> in a case that, though technical and tedious, raised a fundamental principle of Union law. In Van Gend en Loos (1963), a Dutch transport firm brought a complaint against Dutch customs for increasing the duty on a product imported from Germany. The {{court ruled that the}} Community constitutes a new legal order, the subjects of which consist of not only the Member States but also their nationals. The principle of direct effect would have had little impact if Union law did not supersede national law. Without supremacy the Member States could simply ignore EU rules. In Costa v ENEL (1964), the court ruled that member states had definitively transferred sovereign rights to the Community and Union law could not be overridden by domestic law.|$|E

25|$|If {{references}} are made, the Court of Justice {{will give a}} preliminary ruling, {{in order for the}} member state court to conclude the case and award a remedy. The right to an effective remedy is a general principle of EU law, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights article 47. Most of the time Regulations and Directives will set out the relevant remedies to be awarded, or they will be construed from the legislation according to the practices of the member state. It could also be that the government is responsible for failure to properly implement a Directive or Regulation, and must therefore pay damages. In Francovich v Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss. The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals, and there is a causal link between a member state's violation of EU and a claimant's loss, damages must be paid. The fact that the incompatible law is an Act of Parliament is no defence. So, in Factortame it was irrelevant that Parliament had legislated to require a quota of British ownership of fishing vessels in <b>primary</b> <b>legislation.</b> Similarly, in was Brasserie du Pêcheur v Germany the German government was liable to a French beer company for damages from prohibiting its imports, which did not comply with the fabled beer purity law. It was not decisive that the German Parliament had not acted willfully or negligently. It was merely necessary that there was (1) a rule intended to confer rights, (2) that a breach was sufficiently serious, and (3) there was a causal link between the breach and damage. The Court of Justice advised a breach is to be regarded as 'sufficiently serious' by weighing a range of factors, such as whether it was voluntary, or persistent. In Köbler v Republik Österreich the Court of Justice added that member state liability could also flow from judges failing to adequately implement the law. On the other hand, {{it is also clear that}} EU institutions, such as the Commission, may be liable according to the same principles for failure to follow the law. The only institution whose decisions appear incapable of generating a damages claim is the Court of Justice itself.|$|E
500|$|Section 3(2)(a) {{extends the}} scope of section 3 to past and future Acts of Parliament in {{addition}} to present legislation. It therefore contradicts the usual policy of implied repeal [...] whereby any inconsistency between statutes are resolved in favour of the later statute. The Human Rights Act must therefore be explicitly (or [...] "expressly") repealed by an Act of Parliament deliberately doing so, not merely be introducing contradictory legislation. The act therefore carries an additional normative force and has been considered constitutional in character as a result. It is widely recognised that parliament may never directly contradict convention rights, or at least do so very rarely. Sections 3(2)(b) and 3(2)(c) confirm the validity of all legislation, {{whether or not it}} has been interpreted under Section 3. Section 3 can therefore be said to protect <b>primary</b> <b>legislation</b> which is incompatible, and any secondary legislation made under such <b>primary</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E
500|$|The appellants' primary {{argument}} was that legislation passed using the Parliament Act 1911 is delegated and therefore {{could not be}} used to amend the procedure of enactment. However, their Lordships disagreed with this claim {{on the basis of the}} clear language in the Act. Lord Bingham found that the phrase [...] "become an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified" [...] denoted <b>primary</b> <b>legislation.</b> [...] "The meaning of the expression 'Act of Parliament' is not doubtful, ambiguous or obscure ... It is used, and used only, to denote <b>primary</b> <b>legislation</b> ... The 1911 Act did, of course, effect an important constitutional change, but the change lay not in authorising a new form of sub-primary parliamentary legislation but in creating a new way of enacting primary legislation." [...] Lord Nicholls agreed that the 1911 Act provided [...] "a second, parallel route" [...] of making Acts of Parliament and that [...] "it would be inconsistent with [...] intention to interpret [...] as subject to an inherent, overarching limitation comparable to that applicable to delegated legislation." [...] Lord Steyn, Lord Hope and Lord Brown concurred in similar terms.|$|E
