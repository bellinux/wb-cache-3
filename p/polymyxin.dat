25|$|Fluid {{support is}} {{essential}} to maintain blood pressure, often {{with the help of}} colloids or hypertonic saline. NSAIDs are commonly given to reduce systemic inflammation. However, they decrease the levels of certain prostaglandins that normally promote healing of the intestinal mucosa, which subsequently increases the amount of endotoxin absorbed. To counteract this, NSAIDs are sometimes administered with a lidocaine drip, which appears to reduce this particular negative effect. Flunixin may be used for this purpose at a dose lower than that used for analgesia, so can be safely given to a colicky horse without risking masking signs that the horse requires surgery. Other drugs that bind endotoxin, such as <b>polymyxin</b> B and Bio-Sponge, are also often used. Polymixin B prevents endotoxin from binding to inflammatory cells, but is potentially nephrotoxic, so should be used with caution in horses with azotemia, especially neonatal foals. Plasma may also be given with the intent of neutralizing endotoxin.|$|E
2500|$|Effective {{medications}} include ear drops containing antibiotics {{to fight}} infection, and corticosteroids to reduce itching and inflammation. In painful cases a topical solution of antibiotics such as aminoglycoside, <b>polymyxin</b> or fluoroquinolone is usually prescribed.

2500|$|Laboratory {{identification}} of B. pseudomallei can be difficult, especially in Western countries {{where it is}} rarely seen. [...] The large, wrinkled colonies look like environmental contaminants, so are often discarded as being of no clinical significance. [...] Colony morphology is very variable and a single strain may display [...] multiple colony types, so inexperienced laboratory staff may mistakenly believe the growth is not pure. The organism grows more slowly than other bacteria that may be present in clinical specimens, and in specimens from nonsterile sites, is easily overgrown. [...] Nonsterile specimens should, therefore, be cultured in selective media (e.g., Ashdown's or B. cepacia medium). For heavily contaminated samples, such as faeces, {{a modified version of}} Ashdown's that includes norfloxacin, amoxicillin, and <b>polymyxin</b> B has been proposed.

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} achievements of modern medicine {{is the development of}} antibiotics against life-threatening infections, but the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram negative bacteria has drastically narrowed down the therapeutic options against them. This limitation has led clinicians to reappraise the clinical application of <b>polymyxins,</b> an old class of cationic, cyclic polypeptide antibiotics. <b>Polymyxins</b> are active against selected gram-negative bacteria, including the Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, and Enterobacter species.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{increasing}} {{problem of}} infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria {{has led to}} re-use of <b>polymyxins</b> in several countries. However, there are already clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to all available antibiotics, including <b>polymyxins.</b> Methods We present a case series of patients with infections due to pathogens resistant to all antimicrobial agents tested, including <b>polymyxins.</b> An isolate was defined as pandrug-resistant (PDR) if it exhibited resistance to all 7 anti-pseudomonal antimicrobial agents, i. e. antipseudomonal penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and <b>polymyxins.</b> Results Clinical cure of the infection due to pandrug-resistant (PDR) Gram-negative bacteria, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Klebsiella pneumoniae was observed in 4 out of 6 patients with combination of colistin and beta lactam antibiotics. Conclusion Colistin, in combination with beta lactam antibiotics, may be a useful agent {{for the management of}} pandrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. The re-use of <b>polymyxins,</b> an old class of antibiotics, should be done with caution in an attempt to delay the rate of development of pandrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Multi-drug {{resistance}} among Acinetobacter baumannii {{increases the}} need for <b>polymyxins.</b> We conducted a meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of <b>polymyxins</b> {{for the treatment of}} Acinetobacter baumannii infection. METHODS: We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CNKI, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database up to November 1, 2013, to identify published studies, and we searched clinical trial registries to identify completed unpublished studies. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were considered for inclusion. Data were extracted on clinical response, microbiological response, mortality, length of stay and adverse events. RESULTS: 12 controlled studies, comparing 677 patients, were included. Although clinical (odds ratio 1. 421, 95 % confidence interval 0. 722 - 2. 797) and microbiological (OR 1. 416, 95 % CI 0. 369 - 5. 425) response rates favored the <b>polymyxins</b> group, these differences were not significant. Treatment with <b>polymyxins</b> vs. controls did not affect hospital mortality (OR 0. 506, 95 % CI 0. 101 - 2. 536), lengths of hospital stay (standard mean difference - 0. 221, 95 % CI 0. 899 - 0. 458) or nephrotoxicity (OR 1. 192, 95 % CI 0. 436 - 3. 261). The combination of <b>polymyxins</b> with other antibiotics achieved similar clinical response rates to its monotherapy regimen (OR 0. 601, 95 % CI 0. 320 - 1. 130). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that <b>polymyxins</b> may be as safe and as efficacious as standard antibiotics for the treatment of A. baumannii infection. There is no strong evidence that combination regimen of <b>polymyxins</b> is superior to monotherapy regimen...|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in worldwide infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter. This poses a therapeutic challenge as few treatment options are available. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy and safety of <b>polymyxins</b> and ampicillin/sulbactam for treating infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and to evaluate prognostic factors. Methods: This was a retrospective review of patients from two teaching hospitals who had nosocomial infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. from 1996 to 2004. Diagnosis of infection was based on CDC criteria plus the isolation of Acinetobacter from a usually sterile site or from bronchoalveolar lavage. Urinary tract infections were not included. Data on demographic and clinical features and treatment were collected from medical records. Prognostic factors associated with two outcomes (mortality during treatment and in-hospital mortality) were evaluated. Results: Eighty-two patients received <b>polymyxins</b> and 85 were treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that independent predictors of mortality during treatment were treatment with <b>polymyxins,</b> higher Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, septic shock, delay in starting treatment and renal failure. On multivariate analysis, prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality were older age, septic shock and higher APACHE II score. Conclusions: This is the first study comparing current therapeutic options for infections due to carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter. The most important finding of the present study is that ampicillin/sulbactam appears to be more efficacious than <b>polymyxins,</b> which was an independent factor associated with mortality during treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{emergence}} of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains {{has made it}} difficult to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In order to develop new alternative therapies for the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa infections, the antimicrobial activities of different antibiotic combinations have been studied in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of six different combinations of <b>polymyxins</b> and β-lactams against 34 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were evaluated. For the combinations tested by the checkerboard method, an indifferent effect was observed for all strains. However, 27 strains (19 MDR) showed reductions in their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for {{at least one of the}} antibiotics in the combinations evaluated. Combination with <b>polymyxins</b> resulted in reductions of the β-lactam MICs, with a change in the resistance category to susceptible in eight MDR strains. These results from the in vitro evaluation suggest that combinations of <b>polymyxins</b> and β-lactams may significantly reduce the MICs of the antibiotics tested. These combinations require further evaluation for use in medical practice...|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{colonization}} of indwelling devices remains {{a major concern}} in modern healthcare. Developing approaches to prevent biomaterial-associated infections (BAI) is, therefore, in great demand. This study aimed to immobilize two antimicrobial peptides (<b>polymyxins</b> B and E) onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using two polydopamine (pDA) -based approaches: the conventional two-step method involving the deposition of a pDA layer to which biomolecules are immobilized, and a one-step method where peptides are dissolved together with dopamine before its polymerization. Surface characterization confirms the immobilization of <b>polymyxins</b> onto PDMS at a non-toxic concentration. Immobilization of <b>polymyxins</b> using a one-step pDA-based approach is able to prevent Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion and kill a significant fraction of the adherent ones. Living cells adhered to these modified surfaces exhibit the same susceptibility pattern as cells adhered to unmodified surfaces, highlighting no resistance development. Results suggest that <b>polymyxins</b> immobilization holds a great potential as an additional antimicrobial functionality {{in the design of}} biomaterials.

40|$|<b>Polymyxins</b> are {{the last}} line of defense against lethal infections caused by multidrug {{resistant}} Gram-negative pathogens. Very recently, the use of <b>polymyxins</b> has been greatly challenged by the emergence of the plasmid-borne mobile colistin resistance gene (mcr- 1). However, the mechanistic aspects of the MCR- 1 colistin resistance are still poorly understood. Here we report the comparative genomics of two new mcr- 1 -harbouring plasmids isolated from the human gut microbiota, highlighting the diversity in plasmid transfer of the mcr- 1 gene. Further genetic dissection delineated that both the trans-membrane region and a substrate-binding motif are required for the MCR- 1 -mediated colistin resistance. The soluble form of the membrane protein MCR- 1 was successfully prepared and verified. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that MCR- 1 is highly homologous to its counterpart PEA lipid A transferase in Paenibacili, a known producer of <b>polymyxins.</b> The fact that the plasmid-borne MCR- 1 is placed in a subclade neighboring the chromosome-encoded colistin-resistant Neisseria LptA (EptA) potentially implies parallel evolutionary paths for the two genes.
