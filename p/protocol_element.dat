50|$|The LF_EUIMID {{first became}} {{externally}} accessible in 2008 with OTASP specification C.S0066-0 v2.0. In 2009, the CDMA air interface was also upgraded {{to the so-called}} 'Release E' which allows the transmission of all available identifiers in the StatusRequest message. If an R-UIM or CSIM with Expanded UIMID is inserted in a phone the identifier that is usually transmitted as the ESN <b>protocol</b> <b>element</b> over the radio interface is the 32-bit pseudo-UIMID.|$|E
50|$|The SF_EUIMID has {{the unique}} ability to {{override}} the phone’s own MEID in signaling. This is controlled by a flag inside the R-UIM stored in bit 2 of the UsgInd (Usage Indicator) elementary file (EF). This may {{make it easier to}} provision a R-UIM that is manufactured without other unique identifiers (such as MIN or IMSI). The tradeoff is that the phone hardware cannot be easily identified. This tradeoff was removed in 2008 by the ability to specify MEID or EUIMID in OTASP signaling and in 2009 by the addition of these options to the CDMA air interface StatusRequest message. The term MEID_ME is used to distinguish the hardware identity of the phone from the MEID <b>protocol</b> <b>element</b> that may be the EUIMID.|$|E
40|$|The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) was {{designed}} as a protocol to establish multimedia over IP sessions between endpoints.

40|$|Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) {{are leaving}} the {{confines}} of research laboratories, to find place in real-world deployments. Outside specialized domains (military, vehicular, etc.), city-wide communitynetworks are emerging, connecting regular Internet users with each other, and with the Internet, via MANETs. Growing to encompass {{more than a handful}} of "trusted participants", the question of preserving the MANET network connectivity, even when faced with careless or malicious participants, arises, and must be addressed. A first step towards protecting a MANET is to analyze the vulnerabilities of the routing protocol, managing the connectivity. By understanding how the algorithms of the routing protocol operate, and how these can be exploited by those with ill intent, countermeasures can be developed, readying MANETs for wider deployment and use.

40|$|Background: Enhanced {{recovery}} following surgery can {{be achieved}} through the introduction of evidence-based perioperative maneuvers. This review aims to present a consensus for optimal perioperative management of patients undergoing breast reconstructive surgery and to provide evidence-based recommendations for an enhanced perioperative protocol. Methods: A systematic review of meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and large prospective cohorts was conducted for each <b>protocol</b> <b>element.</b> Smaller prospective cohorts and retrospective cohorts were considered only when higher level evidence was unavailable. The available literature was graded by an international panel of experts in breast reconstructive surgery and used to form consensus recommendations for each topic. Each recommendation was graded following a consensus discussion among the expert panel. Development of these recommendations was endorsed by the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Society. Results: High-quality randomized controlled trial data in patients undergoing breast reconstruction informed some of the recommendations; however, for most items, data from lower level studies in the population of interest were considered along with extrapolated data from high-quality studies in non-breast reconstruction populations. Recommendations were developed {{for a total of}} 18 unique enhanced recovery after surgery items and are discussed in the article. Key recommendations support use of opioid-sparing perioperative medications, minimal preoperative fasting and early feeding, use of anesthetic techniques that decrease postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain, use of measures to prevent intraoperative hypothermia, and support of early mobilization after surgery. Conclusion: Based on the best available evidence for each topic, a consensus review of optimal perioperative care for patients undergoing breast reconstruction is presented...|$|E

40|$|The Department of Medicine at Loyola University Medical Center Chicago (LUMC) has {{developed}} and is utilizing a Patient Information Protocol System (PIPS) to address clinical and research informational needs. PIPS, an integrated module of the department's Patient Information Management System (PIMS), enables end-users to access pre-defined informational templates or "protocols". Protocols detail pre-defined data requirements for patient management or clinical research needs. Each protocol {{consists of a}} defined collection of <b>protocol</b> <b>elements.</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>elements</b> belong to an object group which has several defined attributes (e. g. description, acceptable ranges or inputs, units, and grouping keywords). Approximately 3, 500 <b>protocol</b> <b>elements</b> have been identified to define treatments/drugs, symptoms/toxicity, clinical labs, x-rays/scans, physical findings, and lesion groups. Utilizing protocols, PIPS permits end-users to selectively review or capture clinical information. Patients may have several active protocols. PIPS interacts with a specialized database gateway to permit automatic capture of clinical laboratories information, and with reporting systems to produce one of several "chart-ready", time-oriented protocol summary reports. Data extraction programs operate in conjunction with PIPS to facilitate exporting of data for statistical analysis.

40|$|Packet loss, {{delay and}} jitter degrade {{the quality of}} {{services}} like VoIP (Voice over IP) or Video Streaming over IP networks. In real networks, an experimental measure of these parameters is fundamental in the planning process of new services over novel network infrastructures. Furthermore, currently networks are complex heterogeneous systems (in terms of access network technologies, end-users' devices, Operating Systems and finally end-users' application). This heterogeneity exacerbates even more the need of a real assessment of the Quality of Service metrics. Stepping fro this consideration, in this Chapter we provide an empirical performance study of real heterogeneous wireless network with respect to delay, jitter, throughput and packet loss, in UDP and TCP environments, by using the innovative tool D-ITG (Distributed Internet Traffic Generator). We also use the concept of "Service Condition" as a mechanism to cope with issues related to dynamically changing network service scenario and to formally define a parametric and systemic approach to the performance evaluation. Results presented in this Report {{can be used as}} performance references for development of wireless communication applications over multi-service heterogeneous networks. Indeed, we perform a large set of measurements with a wide set of hardware. Then we take the results of our measurements and by analyzing the similarities and the differences we understand what we can generalize and what not. We investigate the impact of mechanisms and protocols on the performance metrics and we try to prove which <b>protocol</b> <b>element</b> is a limiting factor or which devices characteristics affect the measured metrics. In addition, thanks to the wide range of provided results (as well as the public traffic traces, available on request [...] ...|$|E
