25|$|A <b>plasmonic</b> {{solar cell}} {{is a type}} of thin film solar cell that {{converts}} light into electricity with the assistance of plasmons. <b>Plasmonic</b> cells improve absorption by scattering light using metal nano-particles excited at their surface plasmon resonance. Incoming light at the plasmon resonance frequency induces electron oscillations at the surface of the nanoparticles. The oscillation electrons can then be captured by a conductive layer producing an electrical current. The voltage produced is dependent on the bandgap of the conductive layer and the potential of the electrolyte in contact with the nanoparticles. There is still considerable research necessary to enable the technology to reach its full potential and commercialization of <b>plasmonic</b> enhanced solar cells.|$|E
25|$|Recently, the <b>plasmonic</b> {{asymmetric}} {{modes of}} nano particles have found {{to favor the}} broadband optical absorption and promote the electrical properties of solar cells.

25|$|<b>Plasmonic</b> {{nanostructures}} with conductive polymers {{have also}} been suggested as one kind of electronic paper. The material has two parts. The first part is a highly reflective metasurface made by metal-insulator-metal films tens of nanometers in thickness including nanoscale holes. The metasurfaces can reflect different colors depending on {{the thickness of the}} insulator. The three primary colors red, green and blue can be used as pixels for full color displays. The second part is a polymer with optical absorption controllable by an electrochemical potential. After growing the polymer on the <b>plasmonic</b> metasurfaces, the reflection of the metasurfaces can be modulated by the applied voltage. This technology presents broad range colors, high polarization-independent reflection (>50 %), strong contrast (>30 %), fast response time (hundreds of ms), and long-term stability. In addition, it has ultralow power consumption (< 0.5nbsp&mW/cm2) and potential for high resolution (>10000 dpi). Since the ultrathin metasurfaces are flexible and the polymer is soft, the whole system can be bent.Desired future improvements for this technology include bistability, cheaper materials and implementation with TFT arrays.|$|E

25|$|Reducing {{the silicon}} wafer {{thickness}} at a minimized efficiency loss represents a mainstream trend in increasing the cost-effectiveness of wafer-based solar cells. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated that, using the advanced light trapping strategy with a properly designed nano-particle architecture, the wafer thickness can be dramatically reduced to only around 1/10 {{of the current}} thickness (180µm) without any solar cell efficiency loss at 18.2%. Nano-particle integrated ultra-thin solar cells with only 3% of the current wafer thickness can potentially achieve 15.3% efficiency combining the absorption enhancement {{with the benefit of}} thinner wafer induced open circuit voltage increase.

30|$|Recently, a {{resurgence}} of interest in metal nanoparticles has resulted due to their potential applications in the emerging field of <b>plasmonics</b> [2 – 4]. <b>Plasmonics</b> uses the unique optical properties of metallic nanomaterials to manipulate the transfer {{of light on the}} nanoscale and is a promising technology for integrating the large data-carrying capacity of optical interconnects with nanoscale electronic devices.|$|R
2500|$|The basic {{principles}} for {{the functioning of}} <b>plasmonic</b> solar cells include scattering and absorption of light due to the deposition of metal nano-particles. [...] Silicon does not absorb light very well. [...] For this reason, more light needs to be scattered across the surface {{in order to increase}} the absorption.

[...] The equations that govern the scattering and absorption of light can be shown as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another recent {{advancement}} in <b>plasmonic</b> solar cells is using other methods {{to aid in}} the absorption of light. [...] One way being researched is the use of metal wires on top of the substrate to scatter the light. [...] This would help by utilizing a larger area of the surface of the solar cell for light scattering and absorption. [...] The danger in using lines instead of dots would be creating a reflective layer which would reject light from the system. [...] This is very undesirable for solar cells. [...] This would be very similar to the thin metal film approach, but it also utilizes the scattering effect of the nano-particles.|$|E
2500|$|A {{common design}} is to deposit metal nano-particles {{on the top}} surface of the thin film SC. [...] When light hits these metal nano-particles at their surface plasmon resonance, the light is {{scattered}} in many different directions. [...] This allows light to travel along the SC and bounce between the substrate and the nano-particles enabling the SC to absorb more light. The concentrated near field intensity induced by localized surface plasmon of the metal nanoparticles will promote the optical absorption of semiconductors. Recently, the <b>plasmonic</b> asymmetric modes of nano particles have [...] found to favor the broadband optical absorption and promote the electrical properties of solar cells.
