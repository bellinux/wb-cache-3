40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the biofuel potential in Europe from lignocellulosic waste (wood <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>waste).</b> Ethanol from fermentation and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) diesel from gasification are the two biofuels considered. As those biofuels are not yet commercially available, the optimal locations of the production plants have to be determined. The analysis is carried out with a geographic explicit model that minimizes the total cost of the biofuel supply chain. A mixed integer linear program is used for the optimization. The results show that ethanol production plants are selected in a majority of the studied cases. Ethanol plants are mainly set up in areas with a high heat demand and/or high electricity or heat price, whereas FT diesel production plants are set up in areas where the heat demand is low all year round. A high cost for emitting CO 2 as well as high transport fossil fuel prices favor the selection of FT diesel over ethanol production plants. With a CO 2 cost of 100 Euros/tCO 2 applied, the biofuel production from waste can potentially meet around 4 % of the European transport fuel demand...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{a comparison of}} two currently the most frequently occuring recycling waste systems in the United States of America [...] Single stream and Dual stream recycling systems and an assessment of feasible utilization of Single stream system in the Czech Republic. The comparison is performed from several aspects: investment costs, operating costs, costs of the processors of secondary raw materials, costs of environmental pollution caused by CO 2, SO 2 and NOx, capacity utilization and citizens participation in the system, focusing on a single commodity; <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>waste.</b> As according to realized studies the systems represent different load for individual entities in the economy cost-benefit method {{is used for the}} comparison. Using this method, four collection areas and the most important beneficiaries (municipal entity, secondary raw materials processors, landfill and residents) involved in the system are analyzed in the state of Pennsylvania. None of the existing studies did not take into account costs and benefits of more than one entity so far. In the Czech Republic no such studies have been realized, therefore this issue has become the subject of this thesis. In term of costs and benefits for the municipal entity the results of realized studies coincide in results of this thesis, i. e. Dual stream recycling system is more suitable for small collection areas. However {{from the point of view}} of all the major beneficiaries results of this thesis vastly differ. Based on this analysis it can be concluded that any of the above mentioned systems is not suitable for small communities, regarding the fact the values for the Single stream system are less negative. Application of Single stream system in the Czech Republic, namely in Prague, with all its limitations (we assume costs derived from the U. S. market) comes more favorable than the currently implemented system...|$|R
40|$|The “pay-as-you-throw” (PAYT) {{scheme is}} an {{economic}} instrument for waste management that applies the “polluter pays” principle by charging the inhabitants of municipalities according {{to the amount of}} residual, organic, and bulky waste they send for third-party waste management. When combined with well-developed infrastructure to collect the different waste fractions (residual <b>waste,</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard,</b> plastics, bio <b>waste,</b> green cuttings, and many recyclables) as well as with a good level of citizens’ awareness, its performance has frequently been linked to an increase in the collection rates of recyclables. However, the establishment and operation of PAYT systems can require significant resource inputs from municipalities. In this paper, PAYT is analysed through a case study from the German County of Aschaffenburg, covering nearly 20 years of implementation across 32 municipalities with 173, 000 inhabitants. Key performance indicators include temporal trends in the county’s recyclables collection rate, waste treatment fees for residents, and municipal waste management costs, benchmarked against German municipalities not implementing PAYT. We conclude that PAYT could make an important contribution towards material reuse and recycling objectives for the new circular economy...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} identified in waste collection integrated systems is the storage space. The design process of an automated system for the storage of collected waste includes finding solutions for the optimal exploitation of the limited storage space, seen that the equipment for the loading, identification, transport and transfer of the waste covers most of the available space inside the integrated collection system. In the present paper a three-dimensional model of an automated storage system designed by the authors for a business partner is presented. The storage system {{can be used for}} the following types of waste: plastic and glass recipients, aluminium cans, <b>paper,</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>and</b> WEEE (<b>waste</b> electrical and electronic equipment). Special attention has been given to the transfer subsystem, specific for the storage system, which should be able to transfer different types and shapes of waste.

40|$|Nowadays, rapid {{development}} and increase in population {{had contributed to}} a variety of problems including the uncontrolled environmental problems. As a result the unused resources will be classified as waste. One of the sources of waste generated is from the commercial area. This study will be conducted in Taman Sri Gading, Kuantan, Pahang. This study is aimed at determining the commercial solid waste composition, waste generation rate and the factors that influence the solid waste generation rate. There are two types of premises involved in this study which are product and service type premises. In order to get the generation rate, this study is carried out to get the data of waste collection by segregation and weighing of the solid waste from 30 premises which have been selected randomly. The solid waste collected from the samples will be segregate into six components which are organic, food scraps, paper & cardboard, plastic, glasses, aluminum and others. Other than that, there is about 30 questionnaires are distributed to get some information about the type of waste generated, solid waste management and public awareness. The questionnaire distribution is a way to identify and collect the information on factors effecting the solid waste composition. At the end of data collection, all of the data will be analyzed and fmdings from the analysis are being evaluated, discussed and summarized. According to this study, product type premise produced about 3. 15 kg/employee. day and service type premises produced about 3. 23 kg/employee. day. The range of waste composition for food waste in product and service type premises were about 1. 45 to 8. 35 kg/day and 0, 00 to 3. 88 kg/day. For <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard,</b> the <b>waste</b> compositions produced by product and service type premises were about 0. 02 to 0. 7 kg/day and 0. 03 to 0, 98 kg/day. Besides that, the waste compositions on plastics for product and service type premises were 0. 06 to 0. 66 kg/day and 0. 00 to 0. 57 kg/day. Meanwhile, the composition of glass waste for both product and service type premises were 0. 00 to 0. 65 kg/day and 0. 00 to 0. 04 kg/day. For aluminium waste composition, it was about 0. 00 to 0. 07 kg/day for product type premises and 0. 00 to 0. 03 kg/day for service. type premises. The composition for the others wastes such as rubber for product and service type premises were about 0. 00 to 0. 44 kg/day and 0. 07 to 1. 14 kg/day. The higher waste composition in this area was food waste and the 1 o'yest waste composition was aluminium. It was because of the factors of Asian people which had habit on eating. The other factors that influenced the solid waste generated because of that area was an urban area that was developed. So, the population growth had influenced the solid waste generation rate in Taman Sri Gading...|$|R

40|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> {{are those}} {{materials}} more frequent in the recyclables fraction of municipal solid <b>waste</b> (MSW). Both <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard</b> are easily <b>and</b> conveniently recycled {{in order to}} produce new material. In Italy, there is Comieco, which is the National Consortium for Recovery and Recycling of cellulosic-based packaging. The main aim of Comieco’s is recycling and recovery of packaging of cellulosic origin. The members of the Consortium Comieco are manufacturers, importers and processors of materials and board packaging. In 2014, each Italian has collected on the average slightly less than 52 kg of <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardboard.</b> The performance of citizens on the Center and in the Northern Italy are quite similar since several years, with a per capita collection of around 63 kg per capita per year.
