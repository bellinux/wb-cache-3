25|$|In August 1997, TMC {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} rebranding effort {{that resulted in}} the channel briefly premiering its own original movies (which were produced through Showtime's original <b>programming</b> <b>division),</b> along with the addition of daily movie marathons set around a specific theme and a companion block known as the Double Vision Weekend, a monthly weekend-long marathon of movies that comprised multiple themed mini-marathons. In addition, TMC also started running movie and celebrity trivia segments during promotional breaks (originally known as TMC Fun Facts and later TMC Reel Stuff), along with incorporating trivia during promos for movies that were scheduled to air on the channel (the channel had previously aired trivia segments between 1988 and 1991). In October of that year, The Movie Channel launched The Movie Channel 2 as its sole multiplex service (it was later renamed The Movie Channel Xtra in March 2001).|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1975, Fred Pierce, the newly {{appointed}} president of ABC Television, convinced Fred Silverman {{to become the first}} president and director of programming of the independent television production subsidiary ABC Entertainment, created from the network's namesake <b>programming</b> <b>division.</b> In 1974, ABC premiered the detective series S.W.A.T. That same year, the network made the decision to compete with NBC's morning news-talk program Today. Its first attempt at such competition was AM America; however, that show's success was not straightforward. One of its affiliates, WCVB-TV premiered morning show Good Day!. First premiering in 1973 as Good Morning!, it was groundbreaking for being entirely produced on the road and broadcasting from locations outside of the Boston area. Also, in the summer of 1975, ABC discovered that its Cleveland affiliate WEWS-TV was producing its own morning program The Morning Exchange, which debuted in 1972 and was now locally pre-empting AM America; it was the first morning show to utilize a set modeled after a living room, and established a concept now commonplace among network morning shows in which news and weather updates were featured at {{the top and bottom of}} each hour. Discovering that their formats seemed to appeal to their viewers, the network became the first to adopt them for a new national morning show, Good Morning America, which debuted on November 3, 1975.|$|E

500|$|When the U.S. {{version of}} Millionaire was first {{conceived}} in 1998, Michael Davies {{was a young}} television producer who was serving {{as the head of}} ABC's little-noticed reality <b>programming</b> <b>division</b> (at a time when reality television had not yet become a phenomenon in America). At that time, ABC was lingering in third place in the ratings indexes among U.S. broadcast networks, and {{was on the verge of}} losing its status as one of the [...] "Big Three" [...] networks. Meanwhile, the popularity of game shows was at an all-time nadir, as with the exception of The Price Is Right, the genre was absent from networks' daytime lineups at that point. Having earlier created Debt for Lifetime Television and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of Win Ben Stein's Money for Comedy Central, Davies decided to create a primetime game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows.|$|E
500|$|When Griffin {{pitched the}} idea for the show to Lin Bolen, then the head of NBC's daytime <b>programming</b> <b>division,</b> she approved, but wanted the show to have more glamour to attract the female audience. She {{suggested}} that Griffin incorporate a shopping element into the gameplay, and so, in 1973, he created a pilot episode titled Shopper's Bazaar, with Chuck Woolery as host and Mike Lawrence as announcer. The pilot started with the three contestants being introduced individually, with Lawrence describing the prizes that they chose to play for. The main game was played to four rounds, with the values on the wheel wedges increasing after the second round. Unlike the show it evolved into, Shopper's Bazaar had a vertically mounted wheel, which was spun by Woolery rather than by the contestants. This wheel lacked the Bankrupt wedge and featured a wedge where a contestant could call a vowel for free, as well as a [...] "Your Own Clue" [...] wedge that allowed contestants to pick up a rotary telephone and hear a private clue about the puzzle. At the end of the game, the highest-scoring contestant would play a bonus round called the [...] "Shopper's Special" [...] where all the vowels in the puzzle were already there, and the contestant had 30 seconds to call out consonants in the puzzle.|$|E
