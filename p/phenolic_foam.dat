40|$|Recovering from roof {{cavities}} on the {{longwall face}} is an endemic aspect of longwall mining {{and this is}} especially the case today as longwall faces are wider and higher than they have ever been, yet powered support ratings are effectively technology constrained. There {{is little doubt that}} the ever-increasing dimensions of longwall faces are consequently increasing the likelihood of major roof falls occurring, especially in those more challenging geotechnical environments containing poor immediate roof conditions at depths of cover greater than 250 m. As a result, the efficiency and safety of longwall roof cavity recoveries is being given increased attention and is more relevant than ever {{to the success of the}} coal industry. This has led to the now almost universal use of cavity fills during the recovery of major roof falls on the longwall face, albeit that there is industry discussion regarding what constitutes ideal properties for cavity fill material. The paper discusses the geotechnical reasons why it is believed that major roof falls on longwall faces are becoming more likely with time and defines a conceptual geotechnical model for the cavity recovery process and the inherent ground control problems involved. Furthermore the paper considers the needs of mine operators during the cavity recovery process and how these can be best achieved. Specifically the paper contrasts <b>foaming</b> cements and <b>phenolic</b> <b>foams</b> as the two main generic types of cavity fill and ranks them according to such parameters as strength, foaming properties, rate of cavity fill, material cost, effectiveness, safety and overall cost effectiveness. The paper concludes that on a holistic basis, <b>phenolic</b> <b>foams</b> are the more suitable means of cavity filling on the longwall face, accepting that foaming cements are also an effective medium. However in the final analysis neither type of cavity fill is cost effective when compared to the benefits of preventing such cavities occurring in the first place through layout design, equipment maintenance and good operating practices and this is the major point of the paper...|$|R

Moreover, the material has low flammability, low smoke toxicity, and is cost-competitive with conventional foams, such as polyurethane and expanded polystyrene (EPS).; This paper evaluated the potential of using <b>phenolic</b> <b>foam</b> as a building material in northern Thailand. Phenolic foam's mechanical and insulation properties, sustainable benefits, and costs were evaluated when used as an insulation material in the hot, arid, wet region of northern Thailand. Four types of fiber reinforced phenolic foams were fabricated: bamboo, aramid, glass, and cellulose. Choosing these materials provided a comparison study of natural and synthetic materials.; Water absorption and accelerated aging tests were conducted on fabricated composite foam samples to simulate the flooding and extreme heat and humidity conditions of northern Thailand. Compression, shear, and conductivity tests were performed after these climate simulations. Measurements of retained mechanical properties were performed {{to determine if the}} material would be a suitable insulation and/or load-bearing material.

Little distinction could be drawn between natural and synthetic fibers. Results also showed phenolic foam's stronger fire resistance and insulative properties under dry conditions than EPS.

However, the studies for hybrid foams have been very limited because of problems related to fiber dispersion in matrix, non-uniform mixing due to presence {{of more than one}} filler and partially cured foams. An effective approach to synthesize hybrid <b>phenolic</b> <b>foam</b> has been proposed and investigated here. Hybrid composite phenolic foams were reinforced with chopped glass and aramid fibers in varied proportions. On assessing mechanical properties in compression and shear hybrid foams exhibited a more graceful failure, greater resistance to cracking,and were significantly stiffer and stronger than foams with only glass and aramid fibers. The optimum ratio or the reinforced hybrid <b>phenolic</b> <b>foam</b> system was found to be 1 : 1 ratio of glass:aramid fibers. Also, the properties of hybrid foams were found to deviate from rule of mixture (ROM) and thus the existing theories of fiber reinforcement fell short in explaining their complex behavior.; In an attempt to describe and predict mechanical behavior of hybrid foams a statistical design tool using analysis of variance technique was employed. The utilization of a statistical model for predicting foam properties was found to be an appropriate tool that affords a global perspective of the influence of process variables such as fiber length, fiber weight fraction etc. on foam properties (elastic modulus and strength). Similar approach could be extended to study other fiber composite foam systems such as polyurethane, epoxy etc. and doing so will reduce the number of experimental iterations needed to optimize foam properties and identify critical process variables.; Diffusivity, accelerated aging and flammability of hybrid foams were evaluated and the results indicate that hybrid foam surpassed several commercial foams and thus could fulfill the current needs for an insulation material which is low cost,has excellent fire properties and retains compressive stiffness even after aging...|$|E

Per data from the Air Force study, a maximum external electric potential in the range of 100 kV can be developed on surfaces tribocharged by ice crystal impingement. Testing showed that under operational pressure ranges, this level of exterior voltage can result in a potential of about 6 kV induced on the electrically floating interior antenna vanes. Testing the vanes up to this voltage level showed that electrostatic discharges can occur between the electrically floating vanes and the center, grounded screw heads. Repeated tests with multiple invisible and visible discharges caused only superficial physical damage to the vanes. Fourier analysis of the discharge signals showed that the frequency range of credible discharges would not interfere with the nominal operation of the FTS antenna. However, due to the limited scope, short timetable, and limited funding of this study, a direct measurement of the triboelectric charge that could be generated on the Ares I antenna housing when the rocket traverses an ice cloud at supersonic speeds was not performed. Instead, data for the limited Air Force study [3] was used as input for our experiments. The Air Force data used was not collected with a sensor located to provide us with the best approximation at the geometry of the Ares I rocket, namely that of the windshield electrometer, because brush discharges to the metal frame of the windshield periodically depleted any charge accumulated. The configuration of the Ares I antenna assembly does not include any exposed metals in the vicinity and the windshield data could not be used. Since the windshield sensor data was unusable, we decided that the Patch 2 location would provide us with a rough approximation to the Ares I antenna configuration and would give us an indication of the possible charging levels that would develop. This was the data that we used in this study. Whether these charging levels would be of the same order of magnitude as the actual charges developed by the Ares I traversing a cloud with ice particles is at this point unknown. An actual experimental test, requiring the acquisition of additional instrumentation, is strongly advised before a final recommendation can be formulated regarding the safe levels of electrostatic charging on the antenna housing. Thus {{the results of this study}} should be considered to be preliminary...|$|R

The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific area, pore-size distribution and iodine value {{were used to}} characterize the properties of ACs. AC- 1 (with the method of KOH chemical activation) has the iodine value of 2300 mg/g, BET specific area of 1293 m 2 g- 1, average pore-size of 2. 4 nm, and mainly composed of micropore and relatively small mesopore. AC- 2 (with the method of steam physical activation) has the iodine value of 1665 mg/g. Compared with AC- 2, AC- 1 had a pore-size distribution with more evenly and relative concentrated, it’s belonging to the high microporosity materials. Actually, chemical activation had more significant influence on destruction of the pore wall than physical activation...|$|E
