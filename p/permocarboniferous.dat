Up to now, the relationship between the actual anatomy of the wood and a specific way of their permineralization has not been clarified from the petrographic point of view. Thin sections of silicified stems were first studied by light and polarized-light microscopy and then cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and electron microscopy with EDX analysis.

[...] Boston UniversityThe <b>Permocarboniferous</b> flora {{of north}} central Texas {{has not been}} studied as a whole, to my knowledge, {{although}} a few papers {{have been written about}} the plants in the area.

The area from which the fossil flora comes comprises portions of Archer, Baylor, Clay, Throckmorton, Wichita, and Young Counties. Stratigraphically, it contains one formation from the Pennsylvanian Period, and six from the Lower Permian; the former is the Harpersville, and the latter are the Pueblo, Moran, Putnam,. Admiral,. Belle Plains, and Clyde. Up {{to the top of the}} Harpersville formation, the deposits are mostly marine, broken here and there by lenses of coal, which represent short recessions of the epicontinental sea which was present at the time. At the top of the Harpersville formation is a conglomerate layer which create a disconformity, and above it, the deposits are predominately fluviatile. Thus, the sea had moved to the west, but occasional limestones mark short reinvasions of the area. The disconformity at the top of the Harpersville is the boundary between the Pennsylvanian and Permian periods in north central Texas. [TRUNCATED...|$|E

40|$|The {{world-class}} Idrija mercury deposit (western Slovenia) is {{hosted by}} highly deformed <b>Permocarboniferous</b> to Middle Triassic sedimentary rocks within a complex tectonic structure at the transition between the External Dinarides and the Southern Alps. Concordant and discordant mineralization formed concomitant with Middle Triassic bimodal volcanism in an aborted rift. A multiple isotopic (C, O, S) investigation of host rocks and ore minerals {{was performed to}} put constraints on the source and composition of the fluid, and the hydrothermal alteration. The distributions of the δ 13 C and δ 18 O values of host and gangue carbonates are indicative of a fracture-controlled hydrothermal system, with locally high fluid-rock ratios. Quantitative modeling of the δ 13 C and δ 18 O covariation for host carbonates during temperature dependent fluid-rock interaction, and concomitant precipitation of void-filling dolomites points to a slightly acidic hydrothermal fluid (δ 13 C≈− 4 ‰ and δ 18 O≈+ 10 ‰), which most likely evolved during isotopic exchange with carbonates under low fluid/rock ratios. The δ 34 S values of hydrothermal and sedimentary sulfur minerals were used to re-evaluate the previously proposed magmatic and evaporitic sulfur sources for the mineralization, and to assess the importance of other possible sulfur sources such as the contemporaneous seawater sulfate, sedimentary pyrite, and organic sulfur compounds. The δ 34 S values of the sulfides show a large variation at deposit down to hand-specimen scale. They range for cinnabar and pyrite from − 19. 1 to + 22. 8 ‰, and from − 22. 4 to + 59. 6 ‰, respectively, suggesting mixing of sulfur from different sources. The peak of δ 34 S values of cinnabar and pyrite close to 0 ‰ is compatible with ore sulfur derived dominantly from a magmatic fluid and/or from hydrothermal leaching of basement rocks. The similar stratigraphic trends of the δ 34 S values of both cinnabar and pyrite suggest a minor contribution of sedimentary sulfur (pyrite and organic sulfur) to the ore formation. Some of the positive δ 34 S values are probably derived from thermochemical reduction of evaporitic and contemporaneous seawater sulfates...|$|E
40|$|The type {{of organic}} matter (OM) in European Carboniferous and Permian swamp and lake sediments from the Carboniferous and Permian was {{determined}} using organic petrography, Rock-Eval data and biomarker distributions. Coals deposited in swamps contain humic OM formed under oxic conditions. Bog-head coals and black shales deposited in lakes contain a mixture of algal and humic OM formed under reducing conditions. Diterpanes and previous palaeobotanic studies constrain the species of plants living near the lacustrine shore or in the swamp during deposition, allowing the palaeoclimate to be inferred. During the Carboniferous, the climate was not always tropical wet, as some periods of dryness are evident from the sedimentology, palaeobotany and organic geochemistry. During the Permian, the climate was not always tropical dry as some periods of wetness associated with the monsoons are recorded (Roscher, M., Schneider, J. W., 2006. <b>Permocarboniferous</b> climate: Early Pennsylvanian to Late Permian climate development of central Europe in a regional and global context. In: Lucas, S. G., Cassini, G., Schneider, J. W. (Eds.), Non-Marine Permian Chronology and Correlation, vol. 265. The Geological Society of London, pp. 95 - 136). The appearance of xerophyte plants from the Stephanian was also recorded by way of aromatic hydrocarbons, retene for gymnosperms and arborane/fernane for cordaites and probably seed ferns. Cycles of wetness and dryness for Europe during the Carboniferous and Permian are proposed {{on the basis of}} comparison of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. delta D values provided information on the palaeotemperature of the air in the swamps and water in lakes, as well as palaeoclimate. Values of ca. - 100 parts per thousand seen in the Carboniferous coals and Permian limnic deposits are indicative of a tropical climate, in contrast to a glacial or temperate climate, where the values are ca. - 200 parts per thousand. The value for Carboniferous coals could result from high evapotranspiration of plants living under a wet tropical climate vs. a temperate climate. During the Early Permian the climate was dry tropical. For such samples, the delta D values for the n-alkanes derived from lacustrine algae were depleted in D relative to the values for the n-alkanes derived from terrestrial higher plants, attributed to the higher evapotranspiration on land than evaporation from the lake. Alternatively, the xerophytic plants that drifted into the lake via a river could have grown during a dry phase and the autochthonous algae bloomed during a wet phase. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The Upper Rhine Graben (URG) is {{the most}} {{discernible}} part of the European Cenozoic rift system. Uplifted Variscan basement is exposed in the Black Forest and the Vosges and forms the flanks of the southern URG. The impact of the Jurassic hydrothermal activity on the interpretation of fission track (FT) data from the southern URG is elaborated by means of new zircon FT analysis on samples with known U/Pb crystallisation ages. Zircon FT central ages range from 162 Ma to 247 Ma. The analysed samples experienced substantial annealing prior to Cretaceous cooling that cannot be explained by burial alone. Instead, {{it is suggested that}} circulating hydrothermal fluids with temperatures in the order of 200 - 250 °C are responsible for the observed thermal anomaly, which is also evidenced by vein mineralizations. FT ages of 28 outcrop samples collected along two E-W trending transects from the Black Forest and Vosges vary from 136 Ma to 312 Ma (zircon samples) and from 20 Ma to 83 Ma (apatite samples). Broad and/or bimodal track lengths distributions indicate a complex thermal history, which was determined by inverse modelling of apatite FT parameters and tested against the observed dataset and independent geological constraints. Cooling below 120 °C in the Early Cretaceous to Palaeogene was followed by a discrete heating event during the late Eocene and subsequent cooling to surface temperature. The modelled time-temperature paths point to a total denudation of the flanks of the URG in the range of 1. 0 - 1. 7 km for a paleogeothermal gradient of 60 °C/km, and 1. 3 - 2. 2 km for a paleogeothermal gradient of 45 °C/km since the late Eocene. Zircon and apatite FT data from four boreholes, which penetrate the Mesozoic and pre-Mesozoic sediments and crystalline basement of northern Switzerland, are also presented. Inverse thermal modelling of the apatite FT parameters reveals the low-temperature thermal history of the crystalline basement of northern Switzerland. Moderate to rapid cooling of the samples through the apatite partial annealing zone (PAZ) {{at the end of the}} Mesozoic was followed by a distinct thermal event during the Eocene and subsequent slow cooling to present-day temperatures. The Eocene heating episode coincides with the initial rifting phases of the neighbouring URG and associated volcanic activity.

40|$|We {{have found}} {{a new source of}} {{information}} about what lies beneath the Kalahari sands. The Kheis and Rehoboth Provinces of southern Africa were thought to be underlain by either an similar to 1800 Ma orogenic belt, or a northern branch of the similar to 1200 Ma Namaqua-Natal Province. Glacial diamictites of the <b>Permocarboniferous</b> Dwyka Group exposed at Rietfontein west of the Kalahari sands carry cobbles plucked from the bedrock by the ice sheet which covered the Gondwana supercontinent about 300 Ma ago. Despite altered mineralogy, the cobbles are not severely altered geochemically. Their normative mineral compositions give classifications as trondhjemites and granites, supported by rare earth element diagrams. Microbeam U-Pb zircon dating of the granitic cobbles shows that they contain no evidence of crustal growth or orogeny at either 1800 or 1200 Ma. Rather they testify to the presence of 2500 to 2900 Ma Archaean trondhjemitic and granitic crust beneath the Kalahari, with a lesser similar to 2050 Ma granite component. The pebble assemblages from the diamictites we sampled lack the diagnostic banded iron formation (BIF), stromatolitic limestone and other supracrustal pebbles which characterise diamictites derived from the Kaapvaal Craton, thus we envisage shorter transport distances and derivation from the region now beneath the Kalahari sands. Three of the Archaean granite cobbles have unusual less-than-mantle zircon oxygen isotope values around + 3 (delta(18) O VSMOW), which may reflect interaction of their source with high-temperature, originally meteoric water before melting to produce the granites. The mafic cobbles described in a companion paper are much younger and are related to intrusions of the 1. 1 Ga Umkondo Large Igneous Province, probably located on the Kalahari Line or Rehoboth Province. Five trondhjemitic granites from the westernmost outcrops of the Kaapvaal Craton were dated, the oldest being 3061 +/- 9 Ma and four others between 2882 +/- 7 Ma and 2854 +/- 7 Ma, reflecting the cratonisation of the Kimberley Terrane. Four of the Archaean Dwyka cobbles we dated are younger than the 2. 7 Ga Kaapvaal cover sequence and are thus too young to be derived from the craton. All the Dwyka cobbles described here are most likely derived from either the Rehoboth Province or the Kalahari Line with origins from the Kheis Province, Kaapvaal Craton, or further afield considered unlikely. We envisage the Rehoboth Province to consist of an Archaean core supplemented by Palaeoproterozoic granitoids, which was joined to the Kaapvaal Craton at an early stage of crustal development and played an important role during later tectonic events. This has important implications not only for the tectonic framework and assembly of Southern Africa, but also for exploration for diamonds and other ore deposits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Earth's {{global climate}} {{is a complex}} dynamic system with close {{interactions}} between atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere. Also, geological events are strongly correlated {{with the history of}} climatic changes. The interpretation of the traces of past climates helps us understand this system. Throughout geological time the climate by no means has been an invariant environment. There is evidence for ancient glaciations in the early Proterozoic period from the Canadian shield, in the Ordovician/Silurian period from the recent desert of Sahara and for a longer glaciation in the <b>Permocarboniferous</b> period - all very much older than the youngest glacial events of the Pleistocene. In between the earth enjoyed long warm periods in Cambrian, in Devonian, and during the Mesozoic era. But altogether the climate shows a remarkable stability. Throughout several billions of years - despite huge geological changes by floating continents - earth's life was given the possibility to develop and proceed from the earliest single cells to the recent variety of life. The small variations, however, have an immense influence on the evolution of the biosphere. There are several conceivable causes for climatic change. Extraterrestrial influence may result from variations of the energy supply from the sun due to variations of the earth's orbit or of the tilt of the earth's rotational axis. Terrestrial causes, changes of the earth's surface due to continental drift and orogenetic events, affect atmospheric and ocean circulation and hence influence the redistribution of the absorbed energy to different latitudes on earth's surface. The constitution of the atmosphere affects the absorption of radiation in the atmosphere and the penetration of radiation down to the surface. Also, the extent of polar ice, being a result of climatic change, influences the absorption of radiation and thus, represents a feedback mechanism of the climate system. Examining this system enables us to estimate the future climate by means of computer modelling. Thus, it is also possible to estimate human impact on the climate, e. g. by the emission of greenhouse gases. It is generally believed that the increasing atmospheric CO_ 2 level will lead to an increase of global temperature. There is evidence that the atmospheric CO_ 2 level was lower during the glacial periods and higher during the warmer periods, although {{it is not clear whether}} the CO_ 2 level affects the temperature or vice versa. The results of computer simulation of the greenhouse effect, nevertheless, strongly suggest a general global warming pronounced in the polar regions. A possible change of the climate from the present state to a state characterized by a shift of the prevailing atmospheric circulation system would be accompanied by violet fluctuations of the meteorological parameter. The observed anomalies of the meteorological conditions in the latest decades may express such change. (orig.)

40|$|The {{investigation}} of heat flow {{is one of}} the prerequisites for modeling the thermal structure of sedimentary basins and allows the determination of its geodynamic state as well as the composition and structure of the basement. Although maps of the surface heat flow in the Northeast German Basin (NEGB) are published, our knowledge of this parameter is rather flaw. With this work a well-founded determination and evaluation of heat flow in the NEGB are presented for the first time. Under conductive and stationary conditions heat-flow density (q) is calculated as the product of temperature gradient of a depth interval and its representative thermal conductivity. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of the rocks must be known, and temperature measurements must be available. The surface heat flow (q s) then can be calculated adding to this q the amount of heat generated by the radiogenic elements of the overburden. Deep boreholes, drilled in the course of oil and natural gas exploration, particularly in the years 1962 - 1990, were used in this study for the determination of q. Due to the targets of drilling and coring the depth intervals examined were predominantly in Permian rocks (<b>Permocarboniferous</b> magmatites and Permian sediments). Laboratory-derived thermal conductivity (TC) was determined in 363 core samples in dry and saturated conditions. The variability of TC within the lithotypes is related to facies, cementation, and degree of diagenesis. Based on the TC of lithotypes, the TC value of formations was estimated taking into account the respective facies conditions in the particular borehole. The TC of lithotypes and formations have higher values than previously supposed and used in modelings of the NEGB. Heat production (A) of rocks was determined on the one hand by direct measurement of the content of U, Th, and K in 52 rock samples {{and on the other hand}} indirectly by evaluating borehole measurements. In order to do so, total gamma-ray intensity logs (GR logs) recorded in older gamma units (GE) were converted to modern API units using an empirical equation: GR[API c]= 4. 95433 × GR[GE c] - 27. 24. The A value for the entire sedimentary succession of the NEGB calculated from GR logs (using API units) amounts to 1 - 6 µW/m 3 (4 µW/m 3 on average). The determination of q is accomplished and described in detail for 13 borehole locations. Possible disturbances were considered, and different correction procedures were applied. The corrections comprise the in-situ temperature correction of TC measured under room conditions, the corrections of temperature disturbances caused by the drilling process, corrections of lateral heat refraction at salt structures, and corrections of palaeoclimatic effects. The determined q values show an uncertainty, which is assumed to be approximately 15 % for all locations. The q s values range between 70 - 90 mW/m 2 (average value: 77 mW/m 2). It is shown that both, different magmatic successions at the basin basis and the different Mesozoic and Cenozoic deposits (depending on the situation in the basin and the positioning relative to the adjacent salt structures) affect a differentiation of q s. The q s values of this study do not coincide with the distribution pattern of former q s maps. In order to investigate the thermal consequences of different assumptions of structure and composition of the crust and the lithosphere, 2 D sections were modelled under steady-state conditions. Variable compositions of the crust and different thicknesses of the lithosphere could explain the determined q s values. It is assumed that the Pritzwalk gravity anomaly of dense rock with less heat production causes a negative thermal anomaly at the surface. Without a better knowledge of the deeper underground of the NEGB it cannot be estimated as to which parts the determined mean q depends on a high heat production of the crust or a high mantle heat flow. It also cannot be ascertained whether the assumption of a thermal stationary regime, which represents a substantial part of the computations, is justified for the NEGB. <br...|$|E
40|$|The Permian and Triassic were {{critical}} times for marine and continental life on Earth. These periods saw {{the transition from}} the typically Palaeozoic faunas and fl oras to the more modern communities of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic and witnessed profound climatic and oceanographic changes due to the assembly of the supercontinent Pangaea and other environmental factors. A series of important extinction events are known from this time interval, amongst others the largest mass extinction of all time near the Permian- Triassic boundary. The study of the mechanisms and patterns of extinctions and subsequent recoveries has attracted a wealth of research interest during the last decades. Most publications are focussed on marine invertebrates or on terrestrial vertebrates. However, the effects of the various biotic crises of the Permian-Triassic interval on fi shes (primary aquatic vertebrates) are still poorly understood. In addition, patterns of recovery after the end-Permian mass extinction are not yet well resolved. Carbon isotope excursions as well as changes in spore-pollen ratios and the palaeogeographic distribution of taxa during the Early Triassic have been interpreted as evidence for severe climatic changes, but little was known about an important component of climate: temperature. The present dissertation is based on new fi eld data and provides new insights into the reconstruction of relative temperature changes during the Early Triassic but also into the turnover and recovery of fi shes (Chondrichthyes, Osteichthyes) during the Permian-Triassic. The thesis is organised in two parts, focussing on (1) changes in seawater temperature during the Early Triassic (Chapter 1), and (2) descriptions of new Early Triassic fi sh material and evaluation of evolutionary trends within Permian and Triassic fi shes (Chapters 2 – 6). In Chapter 1, a new Early Triassic temperature record is presented based on oxygen isotope values from biogenic apatite (conodonts, actinopterygian teeth). The new data from mid-palaeolatitudes (northern Pakistan) suggests severe temperature changes during the Early Triassic, thus confi rming previous hypotheses. The trends in the oxygen isotope record correlate well with those of the carbon isotope record, and the latter {{have been shown to be}} of global signifi cance. Cooler climatic conditions coincide with early recovery pulses in ammonoids, conodonts and other marine taxa, whereas a phase of increased temperatures in the middle-late Smithian is associated with a severe turnover among nekto-pelagic clades (e. g. ammonoids, conodonts). The results suggest that climatic changes in the aftermath of the end-Permian event are largely responsible for the observed recovery patterns. An important driver for the observed climatic and biotic upheavals during the Early Triassic is eruptive activity of the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province, which already played a major role during the end-Permian extinctions. Chapter 2 is an extensive literature report on Early Triassic and some Anisian fi shes (Chondrichthyes, Osteichthyes) and provides an overview of their global diversity and palaeobiogeography. In Chapter 3 a new specimen of the rare hybodontoid chondrichthyan Palaeobates polaris is described from the Smithian of Spitsbergen (Svalbard, Norway). The new specimen is more complete than the type material of P. polaris and allows the reconstruction of the lower jaw and the determination of a few potential apomorphies of this durophagous fi sh. In Chapter 4 new fi sh material from the Early Triassic (late Smithian) of Bear Lake County (SE Idaho, USA) is presented, which amongst others includes a three-dimensionally preserved skull of the garfi sh-like actinopterygian Saurichthys. Due to its very peculiar morphology, which allows even fragmentary skeletal remains to be identifi ed at genus level, the Triassic Saurichthys has a well-known fossil record. The following trends are noted in Saurichthys: (1) a change from cosmopolitan distribution and high species richness in the Early Triassic to restricted palaeogeographic distribution and low species diversity in the Late Triassic, and (2) disappearance of plesiomorphic bauplans early in the Triassic (in the marine realm) and successive anatomical specialisations to increase predatory effi - ciency. Chapter 5 deals with the diversity dynamics and body size changes of Permian and Triassic bony fi shes based on a new data matrix adapted from the available literature. The results are compared to already existing data on Permian-Triassic Chondrichthyes. Genus diversity trends in Osteichthyes proceed from generally low levels in the Permian to higher values in the Triassic in combination with increased diversity and abundance of more derived taxa near the Permian-Triassic boundary and onwards. Exceptionally high extinction rates at genus level are absent during the Permian and Triassic, but peaks in origination rates for bony fi shes are observed in the Early and Middle Triassic. Signifi cant body size changes are noted at the Middle-Late Permian boundary (size increase) and again at the Early Triassic-Anisian boundary (size decrease). The former is related with the appearance of new taxa of larger body sizes within palaeopterygians and the latter with the emergence of numerous small taxa, mainly within neopterygians and derived palaeopterygians (‘Subholostei’). Strikingly, diversity trends in osteichthyans are opposed to those in chondrichthyans – the latter experienced a dramatic decline in genus diversity during the Middle and Late Permian. Hence, the Permian-Triassic marks an important turnover between the chondrichthyan- dominated communities of the <b>Permocarboniferous</b> to the osteichthyan-dominated (mainly actinopterygians) ichthyofaunas of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. During the Triassic, basal groups of actinopterygians (palaeopterygians) were subsequently replaced by neopterygians, which include the bulk of modern-day fi shes. Chapter 6 is a review of marine predator diversity (Chondrichthyes, Osteichthyes, Tetrapoda) in the Early Triassic and Anisian and aims at elucidating trophic complexity in the wake of the end-Permian mass extinction event. This review shows that large marine predators (> 1 metre) were present throughout the investigated interval and that they also had a wide palaeogeographic distribution. In the earliest Triassic (Griesbachian, Dienerian, Smithian), marine apex predators were composed of temnospondyl ‘amphibians’ (trematosaurids), chondrichthyans (e. g. hybodontoids, eugeneodontids) and osteichthyans (e. g. Birgeria, Saurichthys). In the early Spathian, sauropterygian reptiles and largesized ichthyosaurs were added. Although fossils of ichthyosaurs are still not known from older strata, these early forms already show a derived, fi sh-like body shape and it can be inferred that representatives of these predators were already present earlier in the Triassic. Eugeneodontids disappear from the fossil record and trematosaurids become much rarer near the Smithian-Spathian boundary, suggesting that they were possible victims of the end-Smithian event. Later in the Triassic, ma- rine apex predators were mainly represented by ichthyosaurs, sauropterygians, and some fi shes. In conclusion, the Permian and Triassic were evidently important intervals for fi shes as well as many other groups. During these periods, once dominant taxa disappeared and newer clades emerged and diversifi ed, many of which are still important in present-day faunas. This transition was, however, not sudden but took millions of years. Nevertheless, mass extinction events in combination with severe climatic and environmental changes played an important role during these turnovers near the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic boundary...|$|E
