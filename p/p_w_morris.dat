40|$|I {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the empirical mass-loss rates of hot and cool luminous stars. Stellar species included in this talk are luminous OB stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, and red supergiants. I discuss the scaling of mass loss with stellar properties, with special emphasis on the influences of chemical abundances. Observational errors and systematic uncertainties are still substantial and vary with stellar type. These uncertainties are a major impediment for the construction of reliable stellar evolution models. Comment: To appear in "Hot And Cool: Bridging Gaps in Massive Star Evolution", eds. C.

40|$|The {{integrated}} {{properties of}} young star clusters {{are subject to}} large cluster-to-cluster variations because they depend directly on small numbers of bright stars. At ages at which red supergiants are expected to exist, these luminous but rare stars can be blamed {{for most of the}} variations. If unresolved clusters are to be used to constrain red supergiant models, methods must be developed that take these stochastic fluctuations into account. We discuss prospects and open issues in this field, based on recent work on high mass clusters in M 82, and on first experiments towards a Bayesian study of cluster populations.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] Copyright: ElsevierA series of studies was conducted on lameness in dairy cattle in New Zealand. All cases of lameness that occurred in three dairy herds over a 12 -month period were studied to establish the types of lesions that commonly result in lameness, and to monitor the recovery process. While line disease (39 %), traumatic pododermatitis or sole bruising (42 %) and septic pododermatitis or sole abscess (9 %) were the most common lesions. There was a close association between the onset of lameness and time since calving, regardless of season of calving. Lameness was associated with wet weather conditions. Total lactation yields of the lame cows were significantly less than matched herd-mates of similar age and calving date. A longitudinal study of the feet of cows from a spring calving dairy herd with a low incidence of lameness (2 % over 12 months) was conducted over a 12 month period to measure the occurrence of subclinical hoof lesions. Sole haemorrhage, erosion of the heel bulb and minor white line separation were the most commonly observed lesions. Waves of each type of lesion affected different digits and passed through the herd at specific {{times of the year}} and breeding season. Methods were developed for assessing physical hoof properties such as hardness, moisture content, elastic modulus, compressive strength, resilience and sole concavity. A series of epidemiological studies was conducted to determine to what extent these properties varied between digits on different cows, between digits on the same cow, with changes in environmental moisture conditions, and with changes in husbandry {{over the course of a}} dairy herd's production year. There was a clear tendency for hoof moisture to vary in concert with various measures of environmental moisture and for the other physical hoof properties measured to be affected by hoof moisture content. Hoof growth and wear studies were also conducted on both autumn- and spring-calving cows. Rates of hoof wall growth were lower in autumn and winter than during spring and summer and were greater in 2 -year-olds than in mature cows. Both wall wear and sole wear were greater in lateral digits than in medial digits. Lateral digits almost always had less sole concavity than medial digits. Cows suffered a rapid and substantial loss of sole concavity following calving regardless of season of calving. Lame digits tended to have less sole concavity than non-lame digits, providing some evidence that lack of sole concavity is causally associated with occurrence of lameness. The effect of two different surface hoof treatments (daily formalin footbathing and bimonthly Hoof Bond application) on hoof characteristics and occurrence of lameness was examined. Both treatments failed to prevent lameness, reduce the incidence of subclinical hoof lesions or substantially alter hoof moisture, hardness or sole concavity changes. A tentative hypothesis is proposed to explain the well recognised association between lameness onset and rainfall.

40|$|Massive stars {{can develop}} into tepid supergiants at several stages of their post main-sequence evolution, prior to core He-burning, {{on a blue}} loop, or close to the final {{supernova}} explosion. We discuss observational constraints on models of massive star evolution obtained from the analysis of a sample of Galactic supergiants {{and put them in}} the context of the cosmic abundance standard as recently proposed from the study of their OB-type progenitors (Z= 0. 014 for stars in the solar neighbourhood). High-precision abundance analyses for He and CNO, with uncertainties as low as ~ 10 - 20 %, trace the transport efficiency of nuclear-processed material to the stellar surface, either by rotational mixing or during the first dredge-up. A mixing efficiency higher by a factor ~ 2 than predicted by current evolution models for rotating stars is indicated, implying that additional effects need to be considered in evolutionary models like e. g. the interplay of circulation and magnetic fields. Blue loops are suggested to extend to higher masses and to higher Teff than predicted by the current generation of stellar evolution models. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures.

40|$|Asynchronous {{rotation}} in {{binary stars}} produces non-radial oscillations {{that are known}} to cause observable variability on orbital timescales. The horizontal perturbations of the surface velocity fields {{are referred to as}} "tidal flows". In this paper we illustrate the manner in which tidal flows perturb the surface velocity field from that of uniform rotation, using a one-layer stellar model for the calculations. We justify the validity of this simplified model by the striking similarity between the photospheric absorption line-profiles it predicts and observational data of the binary system alpha Virginis. The velocity perturbations are used to compute the mechanical energy dissipation rates, dot-E, due to the shearing flows for the case of a massive (50 + 28 Mo) binary system having a moderately eccentric (e= 0. 3) orbit. The largest value of dot-E around periastron phases is found on the hemisphere facing the companion. However, at other orbital phases the maximum dot-E may migrate towards the poles. Assuming that dot-E plays a role in the mass-loss characteristics of massive binary systems, this suggests that peculiar binaries such as HD 5980 and eta Carinae may have a highly non-spherically symmetric mass-loss distribution which, in addition, is time-variable.

40|$|In {{this review}} {{given at the}} Hot and Cool: Bridging Gaps in Massive Star Evolution conference, I present {{the state of the}} art in red supergiant star {{atmosphere}} modelling. The last generation of hydrostatic 1 D LTE MARCS models publicly released in 2008 have allowed great achievements in the past years, like the calibration of effective temperature scales. I rapidly describe this release, and then I discuss in some length the impact of the opacity sampling approximation on the thermal structure of models and on their emergent spectra. I also insist on limitations inherent to these models. Estimates of collisional and radiative time scales for electronic transitions in e. g. TiO suggest that non-LTE effects are important, and should be further investigated. Classical 1 D models are not capable either to provide the large and non-gaussian velocity fields we know exist in red supergiants atmospheres. I therefore also present current efforts in 3 D radiative hydrodynamical simulation of RSGs. I show that line profiles and shifts are predicted by these simulations, without the need for fudge micro- and macroturbulence velocities. This is a great progress, although line depths and widths are slightly too shallow. This is probably caused by the simplified grey radiative transfer used in these heavy simulations. Future non-grey 3 D simulations should provide a better fit to observations in terms of line strengths and widths.

40|$|In {{the past}} {{years we have}} made great efforts to reduce the {{statistical}} and systematic uncertainties in stellar parameter and chemical abundance determinations of early B-type stars. Both the construction of robust model atoms for non-LTE line-formation calculations and a novel self-consistent spectral analysis methodology were decisive to achieve results of unprecedented precision. They were extensively tested and applied to high-quality spectra of stars from OB associations and {{the field in the}} solar neighbourhood, covering a broad parameter range. Initially, most lines of hydrogen, helium and carbon in the optical/near-IR spectral range were reproduced simultaneously in a consistent way for the first time, improving drastically on the accuracy of results in published work. By taking additional ionization equilibria of oxygen, neon, silicon and iron into account, uncertainties as low as ~ 1 % in effective temperature, ~ 10 % in surface gravity and ~ 20 % in elemental abundances are achieved - compared to ~ 5 - 10 %, ~ 25 % and a factor ~ 2 - 3 using standard methods. Several sources of systematic errors have been identified when comparing our methods for early B-type stars with standard techniques used in the nineties and also recently (e. g. VLT-FLAMES survey of massive stars). Improvements in automatic analyses are strongly recommended for meaningful comparisons of spectroscopic stellar parameters and chemical abundances ('observational constrains') with predictions of stellar and galactochemical evolution models.

40|$|We present {{modeling}} {{research work}} of the winds and circumstellar environments of prototypical hot and cool massive stars using advanced radiative transfer (RT) calculations. This research aims at unraveling the detailed physics of various mass-loss mechanisms of luminous stars in the upper H-R diagram. Very recent 3 -D RT calculations, combined with hydrodynamic simulations, show that radiatively-driven winds of OB supergiants are structured due to large-scale density- and velocity-fields caused by rotating bright spots. The mass-loss rates computed from matching DACs in HD 64760 (B Ib) do not reveal appreciable changes from the rates of smooth wind models. Intermediate yellow supergiants (such as Rho Cas, F-G Ia 0), on the other hand, show prominent spectroscopic signatures of strongly increased mass-loss rates during episodic outbursts. Long-term spectroscopic monitoring of hypergiants near the Yellow Evolutionary Void reveals that their mass-loss rates and wind-structure are dominated by photospheric eruptions and large-amplitude pulsations that impart mechanical momentum to the circumstellar environment by propagating shock waves. In massive red supergiants, however, clear evidence for mechanical wave propagation from the sub-photospheric convection zones is lacking. Recent spatially resolved HST-STIS observations inside Betelgeuse's (M Iab) very extended chromosphere and dust envelope show evidence of warm chromospheric gas far beyond the dust condensation radius of RT models. Models for these long-term spectroscopic observations demonstrate that the chromospheric pulsations are not spherically symmetric. The STIS observations point {{to the importance of}} mechanical wave propagation for heating and sustaining chromospheric conditions in the extended winds of red supergiants.
