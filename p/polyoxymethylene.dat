25|$|Formaldehyde is {{a common}} {{precursor}} to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from formaldehyde include urea formaldehyde resin, melamine resin, phenol formaldehyde resin, <b>polyoxymethylene</b> plastics, 1,4-butanediol, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. The textile industry uses formaldehyde-based resins as finishers to make fabrics crease-resistant. Formaldehyde-based materials are key to the manufacture of automobiles, and used to make components for the transmission, electrical system, engine block, door panels, axles and brake shoes. The value of sales of formaldehyde and derivative products was over $145 billion in 2003, about 1.2% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP) of the United States and Canada. Including indirect employment, over 4 million people work in the formaldehyde industry across approximately 11,900 plants in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E

It was found by H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and gel permeation chromatography of the product that the vapor reaction of (+)-catechin with formaldehyde without a solvent or a catalyst proceeds via methylolation, condensation, and polymerization. This {{is the same as}} the reaction in a solvent in the presence of an acid or a base. The formation of <b>polyoxymethylenes</b> such as paraformaldehyde was not confirmed.|$|R
40|$|Poly(alkylene oxides) {{containing}} pendant carboxylate groups {{separated from}} the main chain by a spacer-group of eight methylene units were synthesized from functionally-substituted epoxide and 1, 3 -dioxolane monomers. ^ Ester-substituted oxyethylene polymers of methyl 10, 11 -epoxyundecanoate and copolymers with various cyclic ethers were prepared {{in the presence of}} an aluminumalkyl-water coordination initiator system modified with acetylacetone. Poly(alkylene oxide) ionomers, polyelectrolytes and carboxylic acids were obtained by reactions on the pendant functional groups. The high molecular weight substituted poly(ethylene oxides) were characterized by spectral, thermal and dilute solution measurements. ^ Oxymethylene polymers containing 0. 5 - 2 mole-percent pendant ester groups were synthesized by the cationic copolymerization of trioxane with methyl 10, 11 -epoxyundecanoate or 4 -(1 -carbomethoxynonyl) - 1, 3 -dioxolane. A comparative study of the relative reactivities of the ester-substituted monomers with trioxane was made. The substituted 1, 3 -dioxolane monomer was shown to be more reactive than the substituted epoxide in ring-opening copolymerization with trioxane. Terpolymers of trioxane and 1, 3 -dioxolane with each of the two functional monomers were also prepared. The functional <b>polyoxymethylenes</b> were characterized by their spectral properties and thermal degradation behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Infrared observations, {{combined}} with realistic laboratory simulations, have revolutionized {{our understanding of}} interstellar ice and dust, {{the building blocks of}} comets. Ices in molecular clouds are dominated by the very simple molecules H 2 O, CH 3 OH, NH 3, CO, CO 2, and proba-bly H 2 CO and H 2. More complex species including nitriles, ketones, and esters are also present, but at lower concentrations. The evidence for these, as well as the abundant, carbon-rich, inter-stellar, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is reviewed. Other possible contributors to the interstellar/pre-cometary ice composition include accretion of gas-phase molecules and in situ pho-tochemical processing. By virtue of their low abundance, accretion of simple gas-phase species is shown to be the least important of the processes considered in determining ice composition. On the other hand, photochemical processing does {{play an important role in}} driving dust evolution and the composition of minor species. Ultraviolet photolysis of realistic laboratory analogs read-ily produces H 2, H 2 CO, CO 2, CO, CH 4, HCO, and the moderately complex organic molecules: CH 3 CH 2 OH (ethanol), HC(=O) NH 2 (formamide), CH 3 C(=O) NH 2 (acetamide), R-CN (nitriles), and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT, C 6 H 12 N 4), as well as more complex species including amides, ke-tones, and <b>polyoxymethylenes</b> (POMs).

40|$|The {{combination}} of realistic laboratory simulations and infrared observations have revolutionized {{our understanding of}} interstellar dust and ice-the main component of comets. Since comets and carbonaceous micrometeorites may have been important sources of volatiles and carbon compounds on the early Earth, their organic composition {{may be related to}} the origin of life. Ices on grains in molecular clouds contain a variety of simple molecules. The D/H ratios of the comets Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake are consistent with a primarily interstellar ice mixture. Within the cloud and especially in the presolar nebula through the early solar system, these icy grains would have been photoprocessed by the ultraviolet producing more complex species such as hexamethylenetetramine, <b>polyoxymethylenes,</b> and simple keones. We reported at the 1999 Bioastronomy meeting laboratory simulations studied to identify the types of molecules which could have been generated in pre-cometary ices. Experiments were conducted by forming a realistic interstellar mixed-molecular ice (H 2 O, CH 3 OH, NH 3 and CO) at approximately 10 K under high vacuum irradiated with UV light from a hydrogen plasma lamp. The gas mixture was typically 100 : 50 : 1 : 1, however when different ratios were used material with similar characteristics was still produced. The residue that remained after warming to room temperature was analyzed by HPLC, and by several mass spectrometric methods. This material contains a rich mixture of complex compounds with mass spectral profiles resembling those found in IDPs and meteorites. Surface tension measurements show that an amphiphilic component is also present. These species do not appear in various controls or in unphotolyzed samples. Residues from the simulations were also dispersed in aqueous media for microscopy. The organic material forms 10 - 40 gm diameter droplets that fluoresce at 300 - 450 nm under UV excitation. These droplets have a morphology and internal structure which appear strikingly similar to those produced by extracts of the Murchison meteorite. Together, these results suggest a link between organic material photochemically synthesized on the cold grains in dense, interstellar molecular clouds and compounds that may have contributed to the organic inventory of the primitive Earth. For example, the amphiphilic properties of such compounds permit self-assembly into the membranous boundary structures that required for the first forms of cellular life...|$|R

50|$|Pipe Chanters and {{practice}} chanters are typically {{made out of}} a hard wood such as African Blackwood; before {{the expansion of the}} British Empire, native woods were used, and are still used in many folk instruments. In the 1960s African Blackwood was in very short supply, and Ireland's only bagpipe maker, Andrew Warnock of The Pipers Cave in Northern Ireland, began making chanters from <b>polyoxymethylene</b> (also known by several names), an extremely strong and durable machinable plastic which at the time was used for making police batons. The Gibson and Dunbar chanters are made out of <b>polyoxymethylene.</b> It is a material that can be machined and polished much like soft metals. Since there is no danger of splitting with a plastic chanter, {{there is no need for}} a sole (see below), although some models retain it for decorative purposes.|$|E
50|$|The {{dry process}} is only {{suitable}} for polymers with high crystallinity.

50|$|<b>Polyoxymethylene</b> (POM), {{also known}} as acetal, {{polyacetal}} and polyformaldehyde, is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness, low friction, and excellent dimensional stability.

50|$|To make <b>polyoxymethylene</b> copolymer, {{formaldehyde}} {{is generally}} converted to trioxane (specifically 1,3,5-trioxane, {{also known as}} trioxin). This is done by acid catalysis (either sulfuric acid or acidic ion exchange resins) followed by purification of the trioxane by distillation and/or extraction to remove water and other active hydrogen containing impurities. Typical copolymers are Hostaform from Celanese and Ultraform from BASF.|$|E
