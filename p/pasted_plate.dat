40|$|Increased {{awareness}} {{of the effects of}} atmospheric pollution, especially in inner city areas, makes the use of electric vehicles more appealing. The lead-acid battery {{is one of the most}} viable power sources for such an application, due to its low cost. Unfortunately, it is one of the heaviest of such systems in use (in terms of energy stored per unit mass), and is traditionally slow to recharge. This can make it impractical for use in an electric vehicle as the largest usable battery only has a low capacity, yielding a short range. If electric vehicles are to become more commonplace, technological advances in the lead-acid battery system must be sought, not only to increase capacity, but also to reduce the charge time. It has been shown, using a constructed novel resonant power converter, that the overall charge time of a lead-acid battery can be reduced by a factor of five by employing a pulse charging technique, with further reductions possible, whilst evolving significantly less gas than a standard constant-current, constant-voltage technique. This increases battery life expectancy, especially in sealed cells. This method has also been proven suitable for recharging dry cells. It has also been shown that <b>pasted</b> <b>plate</b> cell performance can be improved by redesigning the grid structure. An increase in electrode current of 5 %, and reduction of 25 % in the lead used are both possible, without compromising cell performance. This is important for applications where portability is important. Lightweight electrodeposited lead plates are a feasible alternative to conventional pasted plates, although careful design is required to minimise cell weight...|$|E

The study suggests that the faradaic efficiencies for both types of lead-carbon hybrid ultracapacitors are comparable. However, their capacitance values as well as energy and power densities differ significantly. For substrate-integrated positive plate hybrid ultracapacitor, capacitance and energy density values are lower, but power density values are higher than <b>pasted</b> positive <b>plate</b> lead-carbon hybrid ultracapacitors due to their shorter response time.

40|$|Passive components, {{primarily}} resistors and capacitors, make up {{the majority}} of components for electronic circuits. Cost and performance are critical factors while size becomes important in hand held devices. Integrated passive components promise breakthroughs in performance, size, and eventually cost However, poor economic and business conditions have hampered the infrastructure development needed for widespread deployment of integrated passive components. This economic weakness has also made designers more risk evasive in the evaluation of new technologies. The 2002 NEMI Roadmap finds that performance is the main driver for embedded passives while the lack of design and simulation tools, and test equipment is the primary hindrance to the technology development. In spite of the problems, embedded passive component implementation has been accomplished by manufacturers who have internally developed design tools to circumvent the infrastructure weakness. The NEMI Roadmap has established new metrics to quantify and compare space savings for comparing discrete passives with integrated passive alternatives. New cost models have allowed us to evaluate the alternative passive component technologies. The space savings, component count savings, board size savings, and conversion cost savings are weighed against higher materials costs. The technical needs and infrastructure needs are spelled out for thin core laminates, ceramic loaded <b>pastes,</b> <b>plated</b> resistors, thin film resistor foils and polymer thick film resistors.

The strengthening of the bridge structural members can be attempted by replacing poor quality or defective materials by better quality materials, attaching additional load-bearing materials, and re-distribution of the loading actions through imposed deformation on the structure system. The objectives {{of this study are}} to explain the strengthening process of damaged structural members of Fu Feng bridge, and to evaluate the performance of the bridge structure by adopting static load test. The strengthening process of damaged structural members includes three stages.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a straightforward strategy to simultaneously improve the capacitance, rate capability, and cycle {{life of a}} supercapacitor by simply electrodepositing Ni-nanoparticles (Ni-NPs) on an as-prepared electrode. 3 D-structured current collectors such as metal foams, metal meshes, and carbon meshes {{have been widely used}} in supercapacitors, secondary batteries, glucose sensors, etc. In particular, the 3 D-metal foam readily improves device properties due to its unique 3 D-nature and high surface area. However, there are practical constraints when applying 3 D-current collectors to the industrial world, including high cost. Here, by simply electrodepositing Ni-NPs in a cost-efficient manner, a similar effect to that derived with the use of 3 D-metal foam was realized. After deposition, Ni-NPs are preferentially located near the contact area between the active materials and a plate-type current collector, which allows for tight binding between the active materials and the current collector as well as facile charge transfer and high capacitance.

This model is {{used to analyze the}} mechanical characteristics of steel <b>plate</b> <b>pasted</b> on the inner surface of the lining concrete. Influence of the ratio of viscose’s elasticity modulus to thickness on the stress transferred from steel plate to concrete is analyzed. The hoop stress of lining concrete and steel plate under the conditions of different ratios of viscose’s elasticity modulus to thickness is also studied. The analyses show that the internal water pressure undertaken by steel plate decreases and the internal water pressure undertaken by concrete increases when the ratio of viscose’s elasticity modulus to thickness (E/T) increases. Using the viscose with smaller ratios of elasticity modulus to thickness can increase the utilization of steel plate and improve the stress condition of lining concrete.

A modular phantom was designed which contained six layers of 1 -mm-thick Lexan plates, each spaced 1 mm apart. Eight to nine small, thin nylon fibrils were <b>pasted</b> on each <b>plate</b> in horizontal or vertical orientations such that they formed 25 crossing fibril pairs in a projected image. The depth separation between each fibril pair ranged from 2 to 10 mm. A change {{in the order of}} the Lexan plates changed the depth separation of the two fibrils in a pair. Stereoscopic image pairs of the phantom were acquired with a GE full-field digital mammography system. Three different phantom configurations were imaged. All images were obtained using a Rh target/Rh filter spectrum at 30 kVp tube potential and a ± 3 ° stereo shift angle. Images were acquired in both contact and 1. 8 X magnification geometry and an exposure range of 4 to 63 mAs was employed. The images were displayed on a Barco monitor driven by a Metheus stereo graphics board and viewed with LCD stereo glasses. Five observers participated in the study. Each observer visually judged whether the vertical fibril was in front of or behind the horizontal fibril in each fibril pair. It was found that the accuracy of depth discrimination increased with increasing fibril depth separation and x-ray exposure. The accuracy was not improved by electronic display zooming of the contact stereo images by 2 X. Under conditions of high noise (low mAs) and small depth separation between the fibrils, the observers' depth discrimination ability was significantly better in stereo images acquired with geometric magnification than in images acquired with a contact technique and displayed with or without zooming. Under our experimental conditions, a 2 mm depth discrimination was achieved with over 60 % accuracy on contact images with and without zooming, and with over 90 % accuracy on magnification images.
