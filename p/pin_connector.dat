500|$|Reception to the [...] was {{generally}} favorable. Reviewers noted Siri, the new camera, and processing speeds as significant advantages over the prior model. It was succeeded by the iPhone 5 as Apple's flagship phone on September 12, 2012. The iPhone 4S remained on sale, albeit being sold with reduced storage (from 16/32/64GB down to 8GB). The 4S was discontinued officially on September 9, 2014 following {{the announcement of}} the iPhone 6, although production did continue for developing markets until February 17, 2016. During the course of its lifetime, the iPhone 4S was the best-selling iPhone ever produced and it is the first iPhone to support five major versions of iOS: iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 8, and iOS 9 (the iPad 2 was supported from iOS 4 to iOS 9). The 4S is also the last iPhone to have the original 30 <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> as the succeeding iPhone 5 replaced it with the Lightning Connector.|$|E
2500|$|The Athlon Classic is a {{cartridge}}-based processor, named Slot A {{and similar}} to Intel's cartridge Slot 1 used for Pentium II and Pentium III. It used the same, commonly available, physical 242 <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> used by Intel Slot 1 processors but rotated by 180 degrees {{to connect the}} processor to the motherboard. The reversal served to make the slot keyed to prevent installation of the wrong CPU, as the Athlon and Intel processors used fundamentally different (and incompatible) signaling standards for their front-side bus. The cartridge assembly allowed the use of higher speed cache memory modules than could be put on (or reasonably bundled with) motherboards at the time. Similar to the Pentium II and the Katmai-based Pentium III, the Athlon Classic contained 512kB of L2 cache. This high-speed SRAM cache was run at a divisor of the processor clock and was accessed via its own 64-bit bus, known as a [...] "back-side bus" [...] allowing the processor to both service system front side bus requests (the rest of the system) and cache accesses simultaneously versus the traditional approach of pushing everything through the front-side bus.|$|E
50|$|A {{general rule}} is that DCE devices provide the clock signal (internal clocking) and the DTE device synchronizes on the {{provided}} clock (external clocking). D-sub connectors follow another rule for pin assignment. DTE devices usually transmit on <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 2 and receive on <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 3. DCE devices are just the opposite: <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 2 receives and <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 3 transmits the signals.|$|E

50|$|Most modern stage <b>pin</b> <b>connectors</b> {{feature a}} ground pin that {{is longer than}} the line and neutral pins, {{ensuring}} that the ground connection is made first, and thus the safety ground is in place before line voltage {{is applied to the}} downstream equipment.|$|R

50|$|The rotor basket had {{two sets}} of connectors, two with 26 pins and two with 10 pins, at each end that mated with the main assembly. Both 26 <b>pin</b> <b>connectors</b> were {{connected}} to the keyboard to enable the switching of the signal direction through the rotors. Both 10 <b>pin</b> <b>connectors</b> on each side were hard-wired with each other. If a signal that entered {{on one of the}} 26 pins left the rotor pack on one of these 10 pins, that signal was redirected back into the rotors on the entry side to perform a new pass through the rotors. This loop-back, the so-called re-entry, created complex scrambling of the signal and could result in multiple passes through the rotor pack, depending on {{the current state of the}} rotor wiring.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "Single Board Computer" [...] now {{generally}} {{applies to}} an architecture where the {{single board computer}} is plugged into a backplane to provide for I/O cards.

40|$|Automotive {{infotainment}} {{systems are}} automotive equipment manufactured with narrow tolerances. Besides the hardware itself, the components that {{interact with the}} user and {{with the rest of}} the car have to fulfil strict requirements. These components are the buttons face plate and the <b>pins</b> <b>connector.</b> The buttons must fulfil haptics requirements of force and stroke in order that the feeling of pressing them would be the same as the rest car buttonsâ€™ feeling. The <b>pins</b> <b>connector</b> must fulfil force requirements in order that ergonomic and resistance characteristics would be achieved. These characteristics must be measured to verify whether the prototypes are within required tolerances in order to produce the infotainment system model. Developing a test device to check the force and stroke characteristics of infotainment systems is the aim of this project. Having its own forcestroke test device in the Panasonic headquarter in Langen would speed up the process of verification and modification of the infotainment systems prototypes and would simplify the design task. To develop the suitable test device required, the characteristics of both kind of test have been taken into account. The button test and the <b>pins</b> <b>connector</b> tests have very different requirements. On one hand, the button test requires high resolution, accuracy and repeatability and its range of force is from 0 N to 10 N. On the other hand, the <b>pins</b> <b>connector</b> tests require applying higher force, from - 125 N to 450 N, being negative for pulling and positive for pushing. Moreover, these kinds of tests do not require sensors resolution and accuracy as high as those for the button test. Taking into account these requirements, a stable and stiff test device with an actuator, two force sensors and a displacement sensor has been developed. The simplicity of the device was a necessity due to the stability and the low cost required. Apart from the design and development of the test device, the application interface has also programmed, using LabVIEW software. The software for controlling and getting the result of the button test has already been developed and is totally functional. However, the software of the <b>pins</b> <b>connector</b> tests will be the next tasks to achieve. Although the repeatability of the test device is acceptable, its accuracy must be tested by a certification company, in order to validate the test device performance. To sum up, this test device has been a good inversion. Panasonic has got a low cost test device with which the company will save money, the infotainment systems will not be tested by an external company, and time, the test device will speed up the verification and modification process of prototypes...|$|R

50|$|The {{connector}} {{between the}} vehicles is the 18-pole UIC connector.

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the stage <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> over the NEMA 5-15 connector (commonly known as an Edison plug) {{is its ability to}} lie flat on a stage lessening the likelihood of being a trip hazard. In addition the stage <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> has an increased durability and resistance to damage due to its more robust construction and the ability to compensate for wear with a pin splitter. Having a distinct connector designated for dimmable power also helps prevent confusion of dimmed and non-dimmed circuits which could lead to equipment damage. Even the smallest stage pin connectors are rated for 20 A, which translates to 2.4 kW at 120 V, compared to the 15 A and 1.8 kW of the NEMA 5-15.|$|E
