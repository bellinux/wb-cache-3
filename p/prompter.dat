25|$|The Theodorian {{brothers}} were orphaned in 1879, when Ion died of chickenpox contracted {{on a political}} tour—as recounted in Caton's memoir, Prima durere ("The First Pain"). Mariu was adopted by his uncle Eugeniu and his aunt Sultana, while Caton began his education at the private C. Dima Popovici Institute in his native city, where his mother was the principal. He then attended Craiova's D. A. Sturdza College (1881–1885), and, according to his own testimony, was briefly colleagues with writer Traian Demetrescu. From 1885 to 1887, he attended military high school. His uncle wished for him to become an officer, but Caton ran away from school, allegedly spending some time studying in Paris, then working for Teodor Popescu's theatrical troupe as a <b>prompter,</b> copyist and extra. He secured his first government post in 1888, possibly through Carada's contacts.|$|E
25|$|While at Harvard Kittredge {{also joined}} several clubs and societies, wrote light verse, and won {{numerous}} consecutive Bowdoin prizes for his essays and translations, including one from English into Attic Greek. He {{also became a}} member of the editorial board of the Harvard Advocate. In 1881 Kittredge was the <b>prompter</b> and pronunciation coach in a celebrated theatrical performance by undergraduates of Sophocles's Oedipus Rex in the original Greek that was attended by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Julia Ward Howe, William Dean Howells, Charles Eliot Norton, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and classicist B. L. Gildersleeve of Johns Hopkins University among other luminaries. As an undergraduate, Kittredge also read widely outside of class, and became known as a witty after dinner speaker. In 1882, he was elected Ivy Orator (chosen to deliver a humorous speech) of his graduating class. Graduating with Kittredge that year was Owen Wister, author of the first Western novel, The Virginian.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to writing, {{of which he}} did relatively little, Theodorian worked as an actor and <b>prompter,</b> a newspaper editor, and finally as a clerk. He had jobs with various state regulatory bodies, and several times with the Romanian Police, briefly serving as commissioner in Vâlcea County. He then had a prominent position in the Romanian Writers' Society, but resigned due to political disagreements {{during the early stages}} of World War I. Like his brother Mariu Theodorian-Carada, Caton disliked the Entente Powers, and opposed Romania's entry into the war. He spent the war years fleeing occupation and bombardments, moving from Valea Mare to Iași, then to Paris, Lausanne, and Bern. He returned to a prominent job in the Romanian Arts Ministry, and, in his final year, took an executive position in the new General Directorate of the Press and Propaganda; he was also the founder, and for long president, of the Society of Romanian Dramatic Authors.|$|E

500|$|Each {{production}} was a gamble. The {{aspect of the}} machine plays that posterity knows most about is their economics, as this was what the old <b>prompter</b> Downes most vividly recalled when he wrote his Roscius Anglicanus in 1708.

500|$|In December 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that actress Elizabeth Banks would guest {{star on the}} show, and in this episode, she played right-wing CNBC anchor Avery Jessup, and love interest to Alec Baldwin's Jack Donaghy. In an interview with Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello, Banks revealed that she approached the show's staff about making an appearance on the show. [...] "I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true." [...] She said that on her first day on set she [...] "begged" [...] producers if she could use a teleprompter—in which she is first introduced in the episode on the set of her show The Hot Box, with her interviewing Jack and another guest (Douglas Rees)—so that she could deliver her lines quickly, explaining that her fast delivery would help [...] "sell" [...] the comedy and her 30 Rock character. They agreed to it, though, a problem ensued when they could not figure the <b>prompter</b> out, which resulted in Banks [...] "throwing fastballs at [...] and him battling them back as fast as possible and hoping they could cut it together faster than we were doing it." [...] Banks revealed to Ausiello that she had no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having [...] "too much fun" [...] making movies to commit to a television show full-time. According to a February 2010 report in the New York Post, after the airing of this episode, the Avery character was based on CNBC news anchor Melissa Francis, and it was Francis who [...] "pitched" [...] the character to a 30 Rock producer. Banks, however, denied this report, calling it [...] "false".|$|E

500|$|The Siege of Rhodes [...] "continued acting 12 {{days without}} {{interruption}} with great applause" [...] {{according to the}} <b>prompter</b> John Downes in his [...] "historical review of the stage" [...] Roscius Anglicanus (1708). This was a remarkable run for the limited potential audience of the time. As four more acclaimed Duke's Company productions [...] "with scenes" [...] followed at Lincoln's Inn Fields {{in the course of}} 1661 (including Hamlet), all highly admired by Pepys, the King's Company had no other recourse than to hastily commission a changeable-scenery playhouse of their own. Bowing to the inevitable just seven months after the opening of Lincoln's Inn Fields, Killigrew and his actors signed orders for a new, even more magnificent, theatre in Bridges Street. This theatre, {{the first step in the}} war of spectacle escalation of the 1660s, was so full when Pepys and his wife went to see an opera there that [...] "they told us we could have no room". The large, yet compact, Restoration playhouses, with audience capacities from 700 (Bridges Street) to upwards of 2,000 (the next house on the same site, the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, finished in 1674), were enormous investments, financed through selling shares in the companies, which were thus bound to make more and more money from ticket sales. Not only the theatres and their technical equipment, but the flats painted for a single performance, the special effects, and the elaborate stage clothes, were extremely expensive. Audiences appreciated both luxury and appropriateness of décor and costume: Pepys was quite capable of going several times to see a play that, as such, he disliked, purely for the pleasure of viewing striking and innovative scenery like [...] "a good scene of a town on fire". The companies struggled to outdo each other in catering to these expensive tastes, with precarious finances and the ever-present consciousness that the investments could literally burn to the ground in a few hours. When the theatre in Bridges Street did burn down in January 1672, with its entire stock of scenery and costumes, it was an economic blow from which the King's Company's never recovered.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the early}} reviewers, G. D.

To some degree, the notion resurfaces in other biographically-inclined scholars. Iorga believed that the work was not only generically autobiographical, but also an actual record of Eminescu's various cultural immersions, including his destitute career as a <b>prompter</b> in Bucharest and Giurgiu, and his enduring affection for Iași. Resisting the posthumous glorification of Eminescu, Lovinescu also suggests that, like his protagonist, Eminescu lived his final decades in abject squalor. More generally, Sanielevici described Poor Dionis as a record of youth, [...] "with its illusions, its sweet sorrow, its mirage of love eternal and fairy-tale life"; [...] "readers will feel [...] like they co-wrote [...] ". Knowing that Eminescu died as a mental ward patient, {{some have argued that}} the travel episodes are records of a developing schizophrenia.|$|E

In 1750, Catherine Charke married an actor named John Harman, despite Charlotte's aversion to him. [...] During these peripatetic years, Charlotte was once imprisoned (with males) as a vagabond actor, worked as a (male) pastry cook, and set herself up as a farmer. Earlier she had run a grocery store. [...] All her attempts at business ended alike in failure.

[...] There are numerous literary references to the clock, including in Thomas Hughes' Tom Brown's Schooldays, Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, both David Copperfield and Barnaby Rudge by Charles Dickens, The Warden by Anthony Trollope, David Lyddal's The <b>Prompter</b> (1810) and a poem by William Cowper. [...] In 1828, when the medieval church was demolished, the clock was removed by art collector Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford to his mansion in Regent's Park; during World War I, a new charity for blinded soldiers was lent the house, and took the name St Dunstan's from the clock. It was returned by Lord Rothermere in 1935 to mark the Silver Jubilee of King George V.|$|E
2500|$|Mireille {{performed}} {{poorly in}} elementary school because of dyslexia, requiring an extra year to graduate. She was born left-handed, and her teachers used a ruler to strike her hand each time she was caught writing with it. She became right-handed, although her left hand remains quite animated while singing. She has a fantastic memory, and never uses a <b>prompter</b> on stage. Abandoning higher education, at age 14 (1961), and after moving to Croix des Oiseaux, she began work in a local factory in Montfavet (a suburb southeast of town) where she helped with the family income and paid for her singing lessons. Popular at work, she often sang songs at lunch, or while working. Like her parents, she is a short woman at 1.52 m (5 feet) in height. Her sister Monique (...) , born on 8 July 1947, began work at the same factory a few months later. Both were given bicycles on credit to commute with, making for very long days, and many bad memories of riding against the Mistral winds. The factory went out of business, so Mireille and two sisters (Monique, and Christiane) became youth counselors at a summer camp before her rise to fame, a summer where she had her fortune told by Tarot cards by an old Gypsy woman, saying she would soon mingle with Kings and Queens.|$|E
