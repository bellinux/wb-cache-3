40|$|<b>Prifinium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{was used}} in twenty cases to control pain and urgency during urological {{endoscopic}} procedure. Twenty ml. of 20 % glucose and 15 mg. of <b>prifinium</b> <b>bromide</b> was given intravenously 15 to 20 minutes prior to instrumentation. Increase of bladder capacity, prevention of leakage of urine around the instrument and easier ureteral catheterization were noted...|$|E
40|$|<b>Prifinium</b> <b>bromide</b> was {{administered}} {{for eight weeks}} to three patients with exotropia. Under general anaesthesia active discharges from the lateral rectus muscles were demonstrated by electromyography. When a slight adductive force {{was applied to the}} straight or the master eye, active discharge from the lateral rectus of the associate eye disappeared in all patients, and this eye moved in the direction of orthophorisation. The discharge reappeared when the master eye was released from the forced adduction. From these results the authors concluded that proprioception is involved in the magician's forceps phenomenon discovered by Mitsui in exotropic patients in 1978...|$|E
