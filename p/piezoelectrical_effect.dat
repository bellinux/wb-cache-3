40|$|A {{resonant}} silicon beam {{force sensor}} with piezoelectric excitation and detection is being developed. The realization {{is based on}} IC and thin-film technology with ZnO as the piezoelectrical layer. The theory, realiza-tion and measurements of a bent-frame sen-sors are described. A frequency shift of about 3. 3 times the unloaded resonance frequency f 0 (fO N 6 kHz) is measured with an external load force up to 0. 4 N. The absohite sensitiv-ity of the force sensor is 64 kHz/N and the full-scale sensitivity is 29 kHz/N. Using a simple model for the load-force transduction from external to sensor force, the measure-ments are in good agreement with the theory. electrical excitation and detection of the vi-bration of the sensor beam using the <b>piezoelectrical</b> <b>effect</b> of a ZnO layer [1, 31. The bottom electrode is a highly boron doped (p++-) silicon layer and the top one is an aluminium layer. In order to improve {{the efficiency of the}} electromechanical transduction of the ZnO at low frequencies, a p + +-ZnO structure is used. This structure will have a better efficiency than the pi + SiO,-ZnO (MOS) structure presented in ref. 4 because of the complete depletion of the ZnO layer [5] and the ab-sence of a voltage drop across the oxide layer in the MOS structure...|$|E
40|$|Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DD) models {{provide a}} {{framework}} to advance the understanding of plasticity. However, existing DD models currently do not account for multiphysical effects. Multiphysical phenomena are often present during plastic deformation. Two particular examples are the electromechanical behavior of plastically deformed piezoelectric materials and the thermomechanical behavior of metals under high strain rate plastic deformation. Thus, I present two new DD models, that take these behaviors into account. The basic carriers of plastic deformation are dislocations, which are crystallographic defects. Therefore, in the two new DD models, dislocations are directly modeled as crystallographic line defects in an elastic continuum. These models {{are based on the}} Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM), which is a versatile tool used to analyze discontinuities, singularities, localized deformations, and complex geometries. The XFEM captures the slip from edge dislocations by way of Heaviside step enrichment function. This paper starts with the first fully coupled two-dimensional electromechanical Discrete Dislocation Dynamics model (EM-XFEM-DD) for anisotropic piezoelectric crystalline solids undergoing plastic deformation. The strong, weak, and discrete forms of the boundary value problem for the coupled system are presented. The computation of the Peach-Koehler force, the force driving dislocation motion, using the J-integral is discussed. The EM-XFEM-DD model for a domain with a single edge dislocation was verified by comparison with the solution obtained using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with Lagrange Multipliers. The <b>piezoelectrical</b> <b>effect</b> on the Peach-Koehler force on a single dislocation in a finite domain is evaluated. This effect is significant and can affect both the direction and magnitude of the force. The motion of a network of dislocations under different electrical and mechanical loads is simulated. The simulations demonstrate that for piezoelectric materials, the plastic response di ffers considerably when various electric potential di fferences are applied. In addition, the simulations illustrate that the physics of plasticity under electromechanical loads are more complex than in purely mechanical systems. Next, the first fully coupled two-dimensional thermomechanical Discrete Dislocation Dynamics model (TM-XFEM-DD) is developed. Since high strain rate plastic deformation leads to significant temperature rises due to the rapid rate of heat generation by dislocation motion, each dislocation is considered as a moving heat source. The strength of each heat source is the work done by the Peach-Koehler force on each dislocation. The TM-XFEM- DD model also accounts for the temperature dependence of dislocation drag. Parametric studies show that the temperature dependence of dislocation drag does not significantly impact the observed stress-strain response at low loading rates, but it is significant at higher loading rates. The simulations using TM-XFEM-DD qualitatively capture the salient properties of high strain rate plastic deformation, such as the increased importance of thermal effects with increased strain rate. Higher temperature increase is observed in specimens deformed at higher strain rates. In addition, the predicted stress-strain response of the TM-XFEM-DD model is softer than that predicted by a purely mechanical DD model. This softening effect is found to be stronger {{in the case of the}} adiabatic heating versus fixed temperature change on the boundary of the domain. Overall, the development of these two models that incorporate electro- and thermomechanical coupling will allow for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis of plastic deformation at the mesoscale...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} {{to being able to}} engineer the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) optical mode couplings, which is very beneficial for semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), QRs have a large intrinsic dipole moment, which opens up opportunities for their application in quantum memories and nonlinear electro-optic devices [3]. However, structural (TEM) analysis of such elongated nanostructures gives clear evidence of in-plane shape anisotropy [2]. This is confirmed by very recent theoretical and experimental optical studies which demonstrate the presence of optical anisotropy in multilayer InAs/GaAs QD stacks [4]. Material composition gradients, asymmetric strain distributions, <b>piezoelectrical</b> <b>effects,</b> and even bending of the stacking direction during growth have all been used to explain the large observed optical anisotropies. Yet, it is clear that further work is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.|$|R
