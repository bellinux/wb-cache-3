40|$|International audienceIonization {{chambers}} {{working in}} ambient air in current detection mode are attractive {{due to their}} simplicity and low cost and are widely used in several applications such as smoke detection, dosimetry, therapeutic beam monitoring and so on. The aim of this work was to investigate if gaseous detectors can operate in ambient air in pulse counting mode {{as well as with}} gas amplification which potentially offers the highest possible sensitivity in applications like alpha particle detection or high energy X-ray photon or electron detection. To investigate the feasibility of this method two types of open-end gaseous detectors were build and successfully tested. The first one was a single wire or multiwire cylindrical geometry detector operating in pulse mode at a gas gain of one (<b>pulse</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber).</b> This detector was readout by a custom made wide -band charge sensitive amplifier able to deal with slow induced signals generated by slow motion of negative and positive ions. The multiwire detector was able to detect alpha particles with an efficiency close to 22 %. The second type of an alpha detector was an innovative GEM-like detector with resistive electrodes operating in air in avalanche mode at high gas gains (up to 104). This detector can also operate in a cascaded mode or being combined with other detectors, for example with MICROMEGAS. This detector was readout by a conventional charge -sensitive amplifier and was able to detect alpha particles with 100 % efficiency. This detector could also detect X-ray photons or fast electrons. A detailed comparison between these two detectors is given as well as a comparison with commercially available alpha detectors. The main advantages of gaseous detectors operating in air in a pulse detection mode are their simplicity, low cost and high sensitivity. One of the possible applications of these new detectors is alpha particle background monitors which, due to their low cost can find wide application not only in houses, but in public areas: airports, railway station and so on...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the energy of}} a charged particle {{by means of the}} total amount of ionisation it produces in a gas, through which it passes, is well established. Gas filled devices may be subdivided into (a) current ionisation chambers and (b) pulse ionisation chambers, proportional counters and Geiger counters. Proportional counters in a very crude form were used by Rutherford and Geiger in 1908. Soon afterwards the Geiger counter was developed, which after considerable improvement by Geiger and Müller in 1928, became the well known Geiger-Müller counter. In fact the three gas filled devices mentioned in (b) can be achieved with the same counter by using it with different applied voltages. If the applied voltage on a typical cylindrical counter is varied and the output pulse height is measured for a fixed number of ion pairs liberated in the gas, a characteristic curve of the form shown in Fig. (1) will be obtained. With voltages between say v₁ and v₂, the field strength is just sufficient to collect all the ion-pairs and no new ion-pairs are liberated, so the pulse height will remain constant. This is the region of <b>pulse</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> where the gas gain is unity. As the voltage is further increased to between v₂ and v₃ both elastic and inelastic collisions take place and the pulse height increases exponentially [...] ...|$|R
40|$|When high-energy charged {{particles}} {{pass through a}} thin detector, the ionization energy loss in that detector is subject to fluctuations or straggling which {{must be considered in}} interpreting the data. Under many conditions, which depend upon the charge and energy of the incident particle and the detector geometry, the ionization energy lost by the particle is significantly different from the energy deposited in the detector. This problem divides naturally into a calculation of the energy loss that results in excitation and low-energy secondary electrons which do not travel far from their production points, and a calculation of energy loss that results in high-energy secondary electrons which can escape from the detector. The first calculation is performed using a modification of the Vavilov energy loss distribution. A cutoff energy is introduced above which all electrons are ignored and energy transferred to low energy particles is assumed to be equivalent to the energy deposited by them. For the second calculation, the trajectory of the primary particle is considered as a source of secondary high-energy electrons. The electrons from this source are transported using Monte Carlo techniques and multiple scattering theory, and the energy deposited by them in the detector is calculated. The results of the two calculations are then combined to predict the energy deposition distribution. The results of these calculations are used to predict the charge resolution of parallel-plate <b>pulse</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> that are being designed to measure the charge spectrum of heavy nuclei in the galactic cosmic-ray flux...|$|R

Thirteen of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> had a Farmer-type geometry but consisted of different combinations of wall and central electrode materials. All <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> were calibrated in terms of air kerma as well as in terms of absorbed dose to water in a Co- 60 beam.
