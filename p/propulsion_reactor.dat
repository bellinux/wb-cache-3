40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} related to the study of a nuclear <b>propulsion</b> <b>reactor</b> {{prototype}} for the French Navy. This prototype is built on ground and is to be dimensioned toward seismic loading. The dynamic analysis takes the coupled fluid structure analysis into account. The basic fluid models used by design engineers are inviscid incompressible or compressible. The fluid can be described in a bidimensional by slice or a three-dimensional approach. A numerical study is carried out on a generic problem for the linear FSI dynamic problem. The results of this study are presented and discussed. As a conclusion, the three-dimensional inviscid incompressible fluid appears to be the best compromise between the description of physical phenomena and the cost of modeling. The geometry of the reactor is such that large displacements of the structure in the fluid can occur. Therefore, the linearity hypothesis might not be longer valid. The case of large amplitude imposed oscillating motion of a cylinder in a confined fluid is numerically studied. A CFD code is used to investigate the fluid behavior solving the NAVIER -STOKES equations. The forces induced on the cylinder by the fluid are computed and compared to the linear solution. The limit of the linear model can then be exhibited...|$|E

40|$|Radioisotope heat {{sources and}} power systems, {{traditionally}} fuelled by 238 Pu, {{have been developed}} and used for spacecraft thermal management and to provide electrical power during many deep space and planetary science missions. The use of fission reactors in space, however, has been limited to high power applications in Earth orbit. Previous ground based research programs conducted by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission demonstrated the principal of nuclear thermal rocket propulsion but to date, flight heritage of nuclear propulsion has been limited to nuclear-electric propulsion. The development of space nuclear systems and tributary components {{that are capable of}} meeting the rigors of space flight is of paramount importance. Performance, lifetime and operational safety under all foreseeable conditions are essential considerations that must be made. The selection of appropriate materials and environmental compatibility is vital to the success of any given design. The ability for radioisotope heat sources to survive the extreme temperatures and mechanical loads associated with launch related accidents, is both legally mandated and necessary for the protection of life and the Earthâ€™s environment. Nuclear fuels for fission systems must provide equal protection during accidents while the integral design ensures that a reactor remains in a safe configuration. A historical overview of nuclear systems for space is presented. Traditional and modern system designs and fabrication techniques are discussed. Applicable solid state and mechanical power conversion methods are described and their performances are evaluated. Consideration is made for the effect of radioisotope selection and heat source encapsulation architecture upon radiation safety. The identification of 241 Am as an alternative isotope fuel is made. Other candidate isotopes such as 210 Po, 242 Cm and 244 Cm are assessed. The development of encapsulation methods that are resistant to the extraction and dispersion of the radioactive materials enclosed is increasingly attractive for security reasons. Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) processes are presented as novel, simple and rapid techniques for the encapsulation of radioisotopic materials within tungsten ceramic-metallic or cermet matrices. Computational modelling via Monte-Carlo simulation has shown that the encapsulation of radioisotopes within heterogeneous tungsten cermet matrices may reduce the neutron, X-ray and Gamma-ray radiation dose delivered to the localised environment. The prevention of fabrication related volatilisation of radioisotopic compounds is fundamental {{to the success of the}} encapsulation process. SPS is empirically demonstrated via the use of CeO 2 as an inert simulant for radioisotopic compounds such as PuO 2, AmO 2 and UO 2. The chemical compatibility of americium oxides within a tungsten matrix is also demonstrated through pressureless sintering within a Differential Scanning Calorimetric furnace. The techniques developed for radioisotope encapsulation are also demonstrated in context of cermet fuel fabrication for high temperature space power and <b>propulsion</b> <b>reactor</b> systems. The use of tungsten cermet fuels may eliminate material incompatibilities and failures experienced by historical nuclear thermal propulsion programs. Finally, three novel concept applications of nuclear energy as an enabling technology for planetary exploration are presented. Melt penetration of icy surfaces and long range mobility on planetary surfaces is proposed via the use of pulsed high power heat capacitive radioisotope sources. In-situ resource utilization is considered for propellant production. The use of CO 2 is proposed as a propellant for a radioisotope thermal rocket in the context of a â€˜Mars Hopperâ€™. A CO 2 propellant is also considered in the context of a high temperature (3000 Â°C) nuclear thermal propulsion system for a single stage surface ascent vehicle under a Mars sample return mission.

40|$|Abstract. Two {{different}} CERMET fueled Nuclear Thermal <b>Propulsion</b> <b>reactors</b> were modeled {{to determine}} the optimum coolant channel surface {{area to volume ratio}} required to cool a 25, 000 lbf rocket engine operating at a specific impulse of 940 seconds. Both reactor concepts were computationally fueled with hexagonal cross section fuel elements having a flat-to-flat distance of 3. 51 cm and containing 60 vol. % UO 2 enriched to 93 wt. %U 235 and 40 vol. % tungsten. Coolant channel configuration consisted of a 37 coolant channel fuel element and a 61 coolant channel model representing 0. 3 and 0. 6 surface area to volume ratios respectively. The energy deposition from decelerating fission products and scattered neutrons and photons was determined using the MCNP monte carlo code and then imported into the STAR-CCM+ computational fluid dynamics code. The 37 coolant channel case was shown to be insufficient in cooling the core to a peak temperature of 3000 K; however, the 61 coolant channel model shows promise for maintaining a peak core temperature of 3000 K, with no more refinements to the surface area to volume ratio.
