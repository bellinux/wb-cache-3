40|$|The {{manifestation of}} point {{sources in the}} {{upcoming}} PLANCK maps is a direct reflection of {{the properties of the}} pixelized antenna beam shape for each frequency, which is related to the scan strategy, pointing accuracy, noise properties and map-making algorithm. In this paper we firstly compare analytically the three filters for the PLANCK point source extraction, namely, the adaptive top-hat filter (ATHF), the theoretically-optimal filter (TOF), and the so-called <b>pseudo-filter</b> based on wavelet technique. Our analyses are {{based on the premise that}} the experiment parameters the TOF and the <b>pseudo-filter</b> assume and require are already known: the CMB and noise power spectrum and a circular Gaussian beam shape and size, whereas the ATHF does not need any a priori knowledge. The analyses show that the TOF is optimal of them all in terms of the gain after the parameter inputs. On the other hand, the wavelet technique is only asymptotic to the TOF. We simulate the PLANCK HFI 100 GHz channel with elliptical beam in rotation to test the efficiency of the TOF and the ATHF. The uncertainties on the angular power spectrum will hamper the efficiency of the TOF. To tackle the real situations for the PLANCK point source extraction, most importantly, the elliptical beam shape with slow precession and change of the ellipticity ratio due to possible mirror degradation effect, the adaptive top-hat filter is computationally efficient and well suited to the construction of the PLANCK Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC) ...|$|E
40|$|Some new {{properties}} of fuzzy associative filters (also known as fuzzy associative pseudo-filters), fuzzy p-filter (also known as fuzzy pseudo-p-filters), and fuzzy a-filter (also known as fuzzy pseudo-a-filters) in pseudo-BCI algebras are investigated. By these properties, the following important results are proved: (1) a fuzzy filter (also known as fuzzy pseudo-filters) of a pseudo-BCI algebra is a fuzzy associative filter if {{and only if}} it is a fuzzy a-filter; (2) a filter (also known as <b>pseudo-filter)</b> of a pseudo-BCI algebra is associative {{if and only if}} it is an a-filter (also call it pseudo-a filter); (3) a fuzzy filter of a pseudo-BCI algebra is fuzzy a-filter if and only if it is both a fuzzy p-filter and a fuzzy q-filter...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} {{characterization of the}} carbon-star to M-giant (C/M) ratio in the halo of M 31. Based on application of <b>pseudo-filter</b> band passes to our Keck/DEIMOS spectra we measure the 81 - 77 -color index of 1288 stars in the giant stellar stream and in halo fields out to large distances. From this well-established narrow-band system, supplemented by V-I colors, we find only a low number (five in total) of C-star candidates. The resulting low C/M ratio of 10 % {{is consistent with the}} values in the M 31 disk and inner halo from the literature. Although our analysis is challenged by small number statistics and our sample selection, there is an indication that the oxygen-rich M-giants occur in similar number throughout the entire halo. We also find no difference in the C-star population of the halo fields compared to the giant stream. The very low C/M ratio is at odds with the observed low metallicities and the presence of intermediate-age stars at large radii. Our observed absence of a substantial carbon star population in the these regions indicates that the (outer) M 31 halo cannot be dominated by the debris of disk-like or SMC-type galaxies, but rather resemble the dwarf elliptical NGC 147.

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} there are {{infinitely}} many distinct closed classes of colimits (in {{the sense of the}} Galois connection induced by commutation of limits and colimits in Set) which are intermediate between the class of <b>pseudo-filtered</b> colimits and that of all (small) colimits. On the other hand, if the corresponding class of limits contains either pullbacks or equalizers, then the class of colimits is contained in that of <b>pseudo-filtered</b> colimits. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the use of}} <b>pseudo-filters</b> that optimize the detection/extraction of sources on a background. We assume as a first approach that such sources are described by a spherical (central) profile and that the background is represented by a homogeneous & isotropic random field. We make an n-dimensional treatment making emphasis in astrophysical applications for spectra, images and volumes, for the cases of exponential and Gaussian source profiles and scale-free power spectra to represent the background...|$|R
40|$|As {{declared}} {{at the top}} {{of section}} 5 of the above mentioned article, Lemma 5. 8 there was taken from Kempf’s article [2, Proposition 6]. However, the way of citing was erroneous. In Kempf’s original paper, the intersection of two quasi-compact open subsets is assumed to be again quasi-compact. But in Lemma 5. 8, this assumption has been erroneously omitted, and as the following example shows, the lemma in the present form is wrong. The correct statement of Lemma 5. 8 is given below. Lemma 5. 8 Let X be a topological space. Assume that X has an open basis consisting of quasi-compact open subsets, and that the intersection of two quasi-compact open subsets is quasi-compact. Let U be a quasi-compact open subset of X, and (Mλ) a <b>pseudo-filtered</b> inductive system of sheaves of abelian groups on X. Then the canonical map is an isomorphism. li...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{explores the}} {{benefits}} of human interaction in a deterministic process such as topology optimisation. The benefits of real-time human input are explored through two different claims. The first claims– responding the need for several design options – states that there exist similarly optimal, yet visually different designs {{based on the same}} parameters. The second statement– addressing the time constraints of design practices – claims that accurately predicting the outcome can guide the program to faster convergence by skipping intermediary steps. In order to assess both claims, two sets of experiments were conducted. The first one modified the designs by adding and/or removing material and proved the existence of similarly optimal yet different designs. The second one explored the use of <b>pseudo-filters</b> to simulate intuition and managed significant decreases in the amount of iterations necessary for convergence. This second experiment also produced generally more optimal designs. Both experiments led to the conclusion that user interaction, when used responsibly, helps topology optimisation in generating creativity and in speeding up the optimisation process. This research and the program that supports it both reinforced the idea that technique can be at the service of aesthetics and that human input cannot, yet, be made redundant. For the purposes of this research, a topology optimisation tool based on Sigmund's 99 -line Matlab code for topology optimisation (2001) was implemented to enable real-time user-interaction. The program is a classical topology optimisation in the sense of material distribution (Bendsøe & Kikuchi, 1989). The problem’s domain is a rectangular beam discretised in a chosen amount of square 4 -node elements. The density of these elements is then set to the target volume to reach {{at the end of the}} iterative process. Finally, the algorithm iteratively uses a finite element solver to calculate the displacements and adapts the elements’ density accordingly until convergence is reached. Several methods are used to prevent early convergence as well as to reach a 0 - 1 design (full and void elements exclusively). This process is deterministic in that it will always produce the same design when run with the same parameters...|$|R
