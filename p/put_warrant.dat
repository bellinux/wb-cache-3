40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether investors’ valuations of {{cash and}} share-put warrants are influenced by their potential differential effect on firm solvency. It is motivated by the enactment of SFAS 150, which requires that all contingent <b>put</b> <b>warrant</b> obligations be classified as balance sheet liabilities regardless of put type. Consistent with the critics of SFAS 150, we show that market participants differentially value cash and share-puts based on their solvency characteristics beyond the firm’s recorded assets and liabilities. Our results add to existing capital structure literature by suggesting that complex financial instruments (such as cash and share-puts) be reported separately from each other on a firm’s balance sheet...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Nikkei <b>put</b> <b>warrant</b> market in Toronto and New York during 1989 - 1990. Three classes of long term American puts were traded which when evaluated in yen are ordinary, product and exchange asset puts, respectively. Type I {{do not involve}} exchange rates for yen investors. Type II, called quantos, fix in advance the exchange rate to be used on expiry in the home currency. Type III evaluate the strike and spot prices of the Nikkei Stock Average in the home currency rather than in yen. For typically observed parameters, type I are theoretically more valuable than type II which in turn are more valuable than type III. In late 1989 and early 1990 there were significant departures from fair values in various markets. This was a market {{with a set of}} complex financial instruments that even sophisticated investors needed time to learn about to price properly. Investors in Canada were willing to buy puts at far more than fair value based on historical volatility. In addition, US investors overpriced type II puts fixed in dollars rather than the type I's in yen. This led to cross border and US traded (on the same exchange) low risk hedges. The market's convergence to efficiency (that is, all puts priced within transaction cost bands) took about one month after the introduction of the US puts in early 1990 leading to significant profits for the hedgers. option mispricing, cross-border trading, Nikkei stock exchange, Shaw et al,...|$|E

When the historical standard deviation is used the mispricing of the call and the <b>put</b> <b>warrants</b> depends in a strong way on the mispricing of the previous trading day, and on the moneyness (in a non-linear way), the volatility, and the dividend yield.

40|$|By {{empirical}} studies of Chinese warrants pricing, we find there are systematic devi-ations in warrants price that call warrants are under valued and <b>put</b> <b>warrants</b> are over valued. Using high frequency data, we do further researches {{about the reasons}} of sys-tematic deviations according to the prospect theory and resell option theory owing to heterogeneous beliefs. The main reason caused the systematic deviations is the asym-metries in the risk exposure of warrants issuers. These asymmetries make the reference price of PT/MA investors low for call warrants issuers and high for <b>put</b> <b>warrants</b> issuers. These factors cause the systematic deviations in Chinese warrants. Individual specula-tion behaviors can explain only small parts of warrants price deviations. consequently, we think the main reason caused systematic price deviations is warrants creation mecha-nism, which create defective warrants, rather than only caused by individual investors’ speculative behaviors...|$|R

A unique data set from a large German discount broker gives us the opportunity to analyze the trading behavior of 1, 454 investors, making 89, 958 transactions in 6, 724 warrants on 397 underlyings. In different logit regression, we make use of the facts that investors can speculate on rising and falling prices of the underlying with call and <b>put</b> <b>warrants</b> and that we also have information about the stock portfolios of the investors. We report several facts about the trading behavior of individual investors in warrants that are consistent with the literature on the behavior of individual investors in the stock market. The warrant investors buy calls and sell puts if the price of the underlying has decreased over the past trading days and they sell calls and buy puts if the price of the underlying has increased. That means, the investors follow negative feedback trading strategies in all four trading categories observed. In addition, we find strong evidence for the disposition effect for call as well as <b>put</b> <b>warrants.</b> The trading behavior is also influenced if the underlying reaches some exceptionally prices, e. g. highs, lows or the strike price. We show that hedging, as one natural candidate to buy puts, does not {{play an important role in}} the market for bank-issued warrants. The probability to buy calls is positively related to the holding of the underlying in the portfolio, meaning that investors tend to leverage their stock positions, while the relation between put purchases and portfolio holdings of the underlying is negative.

40|$|Many people {{claim that}} the {{financial}} innovations {{that have taken place}} over the past twenty-five years are even more impressive. Perhaps they are right.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} prices of {{derivative}} securities which {{can be considered as}} substitute assets and can be traded at the same moment of time.

Interestingly, we now have several market examples in which call and <b>put</b> <b>warrants,</b> traded on the stock exchange, and call and put options traded on the options exchange exist simultaneously. Given the relative size of the warrants traded, the Spanish capital market is a rather special case. Our research concentrates in this market. We first investigate price differences between options and equivalent warrants in terms of alternative characteristics associated with both market designs. Secondly, we compare prices of warrants with the same payoff functions but issued by different issuers. The results show that Spanish warrants are systematically overpriced with respect to options, but at an even higher level than the overpricing reported in other countries. We also document an important relative price difference between warrants depending upon the issuer. Strikingly, this difference seems to be related to who issues first the corresponding warrant...|$|R

40|$|The {{covered warrant}} {{market in the}} UK has gained in {{popularity}} over time since first launched in 2002. This has opened up an alternative investment choice which offers derivative securities with a life of typically one to two years. It seems to fulfill many of the functions of a traded options market. Since most research {{has been focused on}} options trading, the investigation on covered warrants trading is still very limited. This is also largely {{due to the lack of}} readily available data for end-traded covered warrants and the existing covered warrants. A unique set of hand-collected data, supplemented by public and private data from main covered warrants issuer and the financial database are employed, making this thesis possible. The sample periods can be divided into two separate sets. The UK covered warrants trading during the period July 2004 - December 2006 are used to examine the impact of warrant introduction and expiration on the price, volume and volatility of the underlying securities. For the introduction analyses, both the announcement and listing of covered warrants have negative impacts on the price of underlying securities for both call and put features, though the impact of the announcement is more pronounced than that of the listing. These affects are temporary and do not persist much beyond the introduction of the warrants. Negative price impacts of the expiration event are also reported for both call and <b>put</b> covered <b>warrants.</b> However, this study finds no significant impacts on the volume of underlying securities trading from the announcement, listing and expiration of call and <b>put</b> covered <b>warrants.</b> Further evidence indicates an increase in volatility of the underlying securities during the announcement and listing of covered warrants. The results hold true for both call and <b>put</b> <b>warrants</b> cases. On the other hand, a decreasing stock volatility is found as a consequence of the expiration of both call and <b>put</b> covered <b>warrants.</b> The second data set involves the call covered warrants traded in the UK market between April 2007 and December 2008; this was analysed for evidence of the best appropriate covered warrants pricing model. This study suggests default risk as a major concern for the warrant price which is called the Vulnerable warrant price. The reasons behind this arise from concern about the issuer’s creditworthiness due to traders’ fraudulent action and the recent subprime problem, the difficulties of dynamic hedging by issuers because of market imperfections, as well as the no guarantees on covered warrant trading provided by the London Stock Exchange. The most salient findings of the study are the following. The Vulnerable warrant price is generally lower than both the Black-Scholes price and warrant market price throughout the warrant’s lifetime. The evidence suggests an overvalued warrant price in the UK market. Moreover, the in-the-money warrants indicate a higher rate of default in comparison to the out-of-the-money warrants. An additional finding shows that the market becomes aware of the default risk only on a short-term basis. The presentation of negative abnormal returns of both market and the Black-Sholes prices support the assumption that default risk is a relevant factor in pricing the UK covered warrants. These findings add to the literature dealing with the effect of derivatives trading on the underlying securities as well as providing more empirical evidence on a particular covered warrant market. This could be of interest not only for practitioners to widen their investment opportunities but also for regulators to have this as a guideline for their future related policies planning.

In contrast to past studies of China’s stock markets, this paper argues that individual investors, and especially those investing less than 100, 000 USD, are {{a critical part of}} the market.

40|$|In {{this work}} I explore {{some of the}} {{consequences}} of the lack of investor protection for the capital structure and the government of the firm, as well as the effects that the level of investor protection can have on the existence and organization of the venture capital industry. In the first chapter I explain how <b>put</b> <b>warrants</b> attached to a new equity issue (a protective put) can achieve the first best solution in a moral hazard framework when neither debt nor equity can. Firms in countries with low protection for both creditors and minority shareholders can use it in order to achieve higher levels of efficiency. In the second chapter I show how minority shareholder expropriation can be inefficient even if it is costless. I consider a model in which projects have attached a costless transfer among shareholders. This transfer biases the decision making process, causing the agents to disregard relevant information. For this reason a controlling shareholder will generally not be able to maximize the expected value of the firm. A supermajority rule can help to extract the private information of the minority; and a numerical example suggests that it might be possible for the controlling shareholder to be better off under the supermajority rule than making decisions by himself with only his private information. Finally, the third chapter establishes how the level of investor protection can shape both the investment and exit policies of the venture capitalist. It therefore might help to explain the correlation between the development of both the venture capital industry and the stock market across countries, {{as well as some of}} the differences between the venture capital industry in Europe and in the U.
