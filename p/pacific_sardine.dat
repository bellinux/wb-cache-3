40|$|The use of {{historical}} fishing records to understand relationships between climatic change and fish abundance {{is limited by}} the relatively short duration of these records, and complications due to the strong influence of human activity in addition to climatic change. Sedimentary records containing scales, bones or geochemical proxies of variability in fish populations provide unique insights on long-term ecosystem dynamics and relationships with climatic change. Available records from Holocene sediments are summarized and synthesized. The records are from several widespread locations near or along the continental margins of the South Atlantic and Pacific oceans, including Alaska, USA (Pacific salmon), Saanich and Effingham Inlets, British Columbia, Canada (pelagic fish), Santa Barbara Basin, California, USA (Northern anchovies and <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardines),</b> Gulf of California, Mexico (<b>Pacific</b> <b>sardines,</b> Northern anchovies and Pacific hake), Peru upwelling system (sardines, anchovies and hake). and Benguela Current System, South Africa (sardines, anchovies and hake). These records demonstrate that fish population sizes are not constant, and varied significantly over a range of time scales prior to the advent of large-scale commercial fishing. In addition to the decadal-scale variability commonly observed in historical records, the long-term records reveal substantial variability over centennial and millennial time scales. Shifts in abundance are often, but not always, correlated with regional and/or global climatic changes. The long-term perspective reveals different patterns of variability in fish populations, as well as fish-climate relationships, than suggested by analysis {{of historical}} records. Many records suggest prominent changes in fish abundance at ca. 1000 - 1200 AD, during the Little Ice Age, and during the transition {{at the end of the}} Little Ice Age in the 19 th century that may be correlative, and that were likely driven by major hemispheric or global reorganizations in the earth's climate system. Additional sedimentary records of marine fish abundance and corresponding paleoenvironmental conditions are likely to further enhance our understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the year-class strength of salmon populations is related to decadal scale climatic/ocean fluctuations. The interactions have complex latitudinal patterns and appear to involve the major food web and current structures of the North Pacific. To understand the effect of climate on Columbia River salmon the North Pacific system must be considered. A brief review of the patterns, the postulated mechanisms and indicators of the patterns follow. In general, two major climate regimes have been identified; one associated with cool and wet climate in the Pacific Northwest and another associated with warm and dry Pacific Northwest weather. The warm/dry regime favors stronger year class strengths of many Alaskan fish stocks while the cool/wet regime favors stocks on the West Coast of the lower United States.

Juvenile salmon were more abundant during the August cruise as compared to the June cruise and were mainly distributed northward from Cape Blanco. There were distinct differences in distribution patterns between salmon species: chinook salmon were found close inshore in cooler water all along the coast and coho salmon were rarely found south of Cape Blanco. Distance offshore and temperature were the dominant explanatory variables related to coho and chinook salmon distribution. The nekton assemblages differed significantly between cruises. The June cruise was dominated by juvenile rockfishes, rex sole, and sablefish, which were almost completely absent in August.

In the present study, we investigated 13 species of commercial finfish and rock crabs harvested in Monterey Bay, California for the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and compared them to the presence of A. catenella and PSTs in sentinel shellfish over a 3 -year period. Between 2003 and 2005, A. catenella was noted in 55 % of surface water samples (n =  307) and reached a maximum concentration of 17, 387 cells L− 1 at our nearshore site in Monterey Bay. Peak cell densities occurred in the month of July and were associated with elevated shellfish toxicity in the summers of 2004 and 2005.

2500|$|To {{support this}} hypothesis, Reuben Lasker cited the {{disconnect}} between spawning stock biomass and {{the recruitment of}} numerous fish species. One explanation of this disconnect suggests larval recruitment is influenced by spatial and temporal patterns of their food, like phytoplankton or zooplankton, which can be greatly affected by ocean currents and mixing. In his publication Marine fish larvae: Morphology, ecology, and relation to fisheries (1981), he points out, for example, the Peruvian anchovy fishery collapse that resulted from a dramatic decrease in population size during the early 1970s. [...] Officials and researchers from the Peruvian government and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization submitted that the causal factors were a combination of strong fishing pressure and weak year classes that resulted in insufficient reproduction and recruitment to support the fishery.

40|$|Decade-scale {{regimes of}} sardine #Sardinops sagax$ and anchovy #Engraulis$ spp. have been {{observed}} in the productive coastal waters of the North-Western, North-Eastern and South-Eastern Pacific and the South-Eastern Atlantic. In each of these systems, the two genera fluctuate out of phase with each other. The subdominant genus may initiate a recovery while the other species is still abundant, so population growth {{is not necessarily a}} response to a vacant niche. Rather, it appears to be triggered by formation of one or a few powerful year-classes. At high population levels, quality of sardine and their eggs decreased in Japan, leading to decreased production and survival of eggs, poor year-classes and stock collapse. Excessive fishing of strong year-classes early in the recovery stage may prevent a species from assuming dominance, so influencing the natural succession of species. This may greatly alter the structure and functioning of an ecosystem. For example, a mesopelagic forage fish may replace an epipelagic one, with severe repercussions for predators that can only feed in the upper ocean, e. g. some seabirds. Biological factors also may influence the succession of forage fish. For example, off California, peaks in abundance of predatory species such as bonita #Sarda$, and chub mackerel #Scomber$ separate those of the planktivorous sardine and anchovy. In the <b>Pacific</b> Ocean, <b>sardine</b> distribution has changed greatly.

S. <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardine</b> harvesters and processors, as well as sardines being traded as a global commodity are factors that may confound this relationship. Preliminary results from our analysis reveal that the ex-vessel price of sardines is relatively unresponsive to changes in the quantity landed. With price inflexibility and recent declines in the annual sardine harvest guideline, if harvest costs do not decrease with the decrease in landings, rents will decrease as well. Under current derby fishing conditions in the <b>Pacific</b> <b>sardine</b> fishery harvest costs are likely to increase if a continued reduction in the harvest guideline intensifies the race for fish. This situation becomes even bleaker without a corresponding increase in ex-vessel price {{as a result of the}} decrease in landings. We consider how these circumstances might be improved under rights-based management of the fishery...|$|E
40|$|Regime {{shifts and}} El Niño events {{can be viewed}} as natural large scale {{experiments}} that involve changes in salinity, temperature, nutrients, trace metals, and subsequent shifts in species composition in the ecosystem. The impacts of the 1997 - 98 El Niño event off the northwest coast of British Columbia revealed distinct changes in nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton. During the 1997 - 98 El Niño, the coastal area where the summer nitrate was 2 larger than during the 1999 La Niña. Surface nitrate concentrations in 1998 were half of the concentrations in the 1970 s. In contrast, during the 1999 La Niña, the mixed layer depth was 20 m deeper which increased the winter nutrient levels. Stratification was very pronounced in 1998 due to the increased temperature and this produced a bottom-up effect of a decrease in the productivity of the plankton communities through decreased nutrient concentrations (i. e. increased N limitation). During the 1997 - 98 El Niño, there was a lower total zooplankton biomass and shifts in community composition (reduced abundance of endemic boreal and temperate species and an increase in abundance of California species). Although the changes were most extreme in 1998, these changes in the zooplankton biomass and composition had been progressively developing off the BC coast throughout the 1990 s. Therefore, even though the El Niño originates in the tropics, the effects are propagated poleward and there was a poleward shift of the west coast marine ecosystem, partially due to the stronger northward current flows. The 1977 regime shift demonstrated the importance of the carrying capacity of the ocean on fish stocks such as the Pacific salmon. Prior to 1977, attempts to rebuild fish stocks failed, but by 1985, catches exceeded historic levels because the 1977 regime shift increased the oceanic carrying capacity. After the probable 1999 regime shift, pink salmon, <b>Pacific</b> halibut, <b>sardine,</b> herring and ocean perch have increased in abundance. One plausible mechanism is that an increase in the oceanic carrying capacity and productivity after a regime shift may increase early marine growth and enable fish to reach a critical size and survive the first ocean winter when there is a high demand on energy stored by the fish...|$|R
