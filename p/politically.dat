5|$|Aboriginals protested {{against the}} 14th Dalai Lama {{during his visit}} to Taiwan after Typhoon Morakot and denounced it as <b>politically</b> motivated.|$|E
5|$|According to a Sinhalese {{primary source}} Culavamsa, a warlord or {{minister}} named Aryacakravarti invaded the Sinhalese capital of Yapahuwa {{on behalf of}} the Pandyan king Maaravarman Kulasekaran between the years 1277–1283 and took the <b>politically</b> significant Buddha’s tooth relic.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} {{speculation}} and party infighting, {{he said he}} did not want to become Prime Minister. In mid-March 2008, he chose Yousaf Raza Gillani for Prime Minister in a snub to the more <b>politically</b> powerful Makhdoom Amin Fahim.|$|E
5|$|Banton is <b>politically</b> {{subdivided}} into 17 barangays. In 1954, the sitios of Mahaba, Angomon, Solocan, Kapanranan, and Yabawon were consolidated into the barangay known as Yabawon.|$|E
5|$|Drusus' first {{office was}} that of {{quaestor}} in AD 10. Being <b>politically</b> inclined, he was made a permanent member of the Senate committee Augustus had founded in AD 13 to draw up the Senate's daily business.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 20th century, the Republican Party {{replaced}} the Democratic Party {{as the dominant}} party in the state, as the latter became more <b>politically</b> liberal and as demographic changes favored the former.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} {{discovery}} of oil at Spindletop, energy has been a dominant force <b>politically</b> and economically within the state. If Texas were its own country {{it would be the}} sixth largest oil producer in the world.|$|E
5|$|H. Roy Cullen, H. L. Hunt, Sid W. Richardson, and Clint Murchison {{were the}} four most {{influential}} businessmen during this era. These men became among the wealthiest and most <b>politically</b> {{powerful in the}} state and the nation.|$|E
5|$|Iceland, {{not part}} of the EU, is {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its currency, which has effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive. Lee Harris argues that floating exchange rates allows wage reductions by currency devaluations, a <b>politically</b> easier option than the economically equivalent but <b>politically</b> impossible method of lowering wages by political enactment. Sweden's floating rate currency gives it a short-term advantage, structural reforms and constraints account for longer-term prosperity. Labour concessions, a minimal reliance on public debt, and tax reform helped to further a pro-growth policy.|$|E
5|$|In Algeria, the Muslims {{were not}} {{considered}} French and did not share the same political or economic benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. <b>Politically,</b> the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, {{they were required to}} renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' <b>politically</b> and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.|$|E
5|$|In Quebec, as {{commissioner}} of the NFB, he attracted controversy for his decision to suppress distribution of several <b>politically</b> sensitive films by French Canadian directors.|$|E

5|$|McCain {{developed}} a reputation for independence during the 1990s. He took pride in challenging party leadership and establishment forces, becoming difficult to categorize <b>politically.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mubarak {{asked the}} current {{aviation}} minister and {{former chief of}} Air Staff Ahmed Shafiq, {{to form a new}} government. Shafiq, a Mubarak loyalist, had often been mentioned as a potential successor to Mubarak due to his <b>politically</b> reliable nature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Politically,</b> Hergé was {{a fervent}} royalist, and {{remained}} so throughout his life, also {{believing in the}} unity of Belgium.|$|E

5|$|<b>Politically,</b> {{the island}} is divided between the Republic of Ireland, an {{independent}} state, and Northern Ireland (a constituent country of the United Kingdom). They share an open border and both {{are part of the}} Common Travel Area.|$|E

5|$|The police {{officers}} were written to come across as everyday guys and Cory Edwards has explained {{that the decision to}} make three of them pigs was not <b>politically</b> motivated.|$|E
5|$|A further {{source of}} {{difference}} between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the Anglican communion at her English coronation. Anne had been brought up a Lutheran, but she may have discreetly converted to Catholicism at some point, a <b>politically</b> embarrassing scenario which alarmed ministers of the Scottish Kirk and caused suspicion in Anglican England.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a recent}} survey, the ONA has more female {{supporters}} than either the Church of Satan or the Temple of Set; more women with children; more older supporters; more supporters who are better established in socio-economic terms; and more who <b>politically</b> are further to the Right.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economist}} Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric {{about the end}} of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of the belief that the Balcerowicz Plan would quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies to be <b>politically</b> unrealistic.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} result, Miller refused to endorse McEwen, though McEwen tried to soothe {{feelings}} by introducing H.R. 5727 in the House {{to name the}} dam and locks on the Ohio River near Gallipolis after Miller. Miller carried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the redistricting to the United States Supreme Court, insisting district lines should be drawn on a <b>politically</b> neutral basis.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{settlers}} received {{the benefit of}} a section of public opinion, <b>politically</b> and legally every decision was going the way of the railroad. In March 1880, Stanford himself attempted a reconciliation by appearing in Hanford and meeting with the Settler's League in an attempt to find some sort of compromise.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} shrine of {{religious}} Christian Armenians worldwide, Etchmiadzin {{has been an}} important location in Armenia not only religiously, but also <b>politically</b> and culturally. A major pilgrimage site, {{it is one of the}} most visited places in the country. Along with several important early medieval churches located nearby, the cathedral was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp's {{defense team}} {{attempted}} to discredit Patrick Darby by stressing {{his association with}} the Old Court and suggesting the murder was <b>politically</b> motivated. They also presented witnesses who testified that they knew of no hostility between Beauchamp and Sharp, and questioned whether Darby and Beauchamp's 1824 meeting ever occurred.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, the {{population}} of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Around 98 per cent of {{the population}} was baptized and around 80 per cent of marriage ceremonies were held with traditional Catholic services, while <b>politically</b> the country was dominated by the Catholic Party.|$|E
5|$|Conspiracy {{theorists have}} long {{associated}} Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly {{in control of}} world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the <b>politically</b> far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) and the far left (e.g. the former Communist states in Eastern Europe).|$|E
5|$|Forster's {{attitude}} {{brought him}} into conflict {{with the people of}} the different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere, as he was too revolutionary and antinational for Germans, proud and opposing in his dealings with Englishmen, too unconcerned about Polish science for Poles, and too insignificant <b>politically</b> and ignored while in France.|$|E
5|$|He {{nonetheless}} persevered, {{staging a}} three-week, 17-city {{tour of the}} nation's ghettos and disadvantaged areas that none of his advisors thought <b>politically</b> worthwhile. He sought to engage militants in dialogue, found himself exposed to the harsh realities and language of ghetto areas, and had an unusual encounter with hippies and The Diggers in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury.|$|E
