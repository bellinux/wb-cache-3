5000|$|Before {{creation}} of the Special Forces Tab, Special Forces status was indicated by wearing a full-size unit flash on the green beret. A support soldier (military intelligence soldiers, signal <b>personnel,</b> <b>parachute</b> riggers, clerical and administrative personnel, etc.) assigned to a Special Forces unit wore a 1/4" [...] high bar (nicknamed a [...] "Candy Stripe") below the Special Forces Crest on their green beret. The bar matched {{the colors of the}} unit's flash. This was not, however, the norm during the Vietnam war, when all soldiers assigned to 5th Special Forces wore identical unit flashes. After the {{creation of}} the tab in 1983 and until January 1993, all personnel in a Special Forces unit wore the same beret and flash. Today, only Special Forces-qualified soldiers may wear the green beret, making obsolete the unit bar under the flash. Each Special Forces Group has its own unique beret flash, which is worn by all members assigned to the unit; Special Forces-qualified soldiers wear it on the green beret while support personnel wear it on the maroon beret.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist badge was {{originally}} {{known as the}} U.S. Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge and designed by American Insignia Company in 1942 for graduates of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School. During WWII, despite being against uniform regulations it became common for U.S. Marine Corps paratroopers who were issued the silver U.S. Army Basic Parachutist badge to wear the gold Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge because they believed the gold [...] "Rigger wings" [...] looked better on their uniform. This out of regulations wearing of the Parachute Rigger badge became so common that in July 1963 the Commander of United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Bruce F. Meyers sent a request to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral George W. Anderson Jr. via Marine Corps Commandant General David M. Shoup requesting to officially make the Navy Parachute Rigger badge the parachutist badge for the Navy and Marine Corps. The request was approved by Admiral Anderson on July 12, 1963 per BuPers Notice 1020. Since 1963, being {{a graduate of the}} U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School is no longer a requirement to earn the badge.The badge is authorized for officers and enlisted personnel who were awarded the basic parachutist insignia and, under competent orders, have completed a minimum of five additional static-line or premeditated <b>personnel</b> <b>parachute</b> jumps, to include a combat equipment day jump, two combat equipment night jumps, and employ at least two different types of military aircraft.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{accuracy}} of a new method for estimating {{the value of the}} peak inflation drag sustained by slow-landing cargo and <b>personnel</b> <b>parachutes</b> without ever using load cell or accelerometer data. The method is based on equations derived from the Momentum-Impulse Theorem, used together with the known steady-descent rate of the parachute-payload system and the known drop conditions. Most importantly, the calculation involves using also the value of the actual inflation time measured from the video of the inflation sequence. The method is validated by comparing with the load cell and video data of over 60 instrumented drops and jumps collected by the authors and by others...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a derivation {{of the opening}} shock factor (Ck) and inflation duration (tfill) that characterize the inflation of slider-reefed parafoils. The results apply to large-mass ratio systems, such as <b>personnel</b> <b>parachutes,</b> that inflate along a downward vertical trajectory and experience maximum drag (Fmax) during slider-descent. The derivation of Ck {{is based on a}} formulas derived from the well-validated inflation computer model discussed in another paper presented at this conference (see paper 2007 - 2501). The formula for tfill is obtained by merging this result with a general expression for Ck, obtained from the Momentum-Impulse theorem in which the inflation time is a crucial input. These derivations are followed by an altitude-scaling study of the maximum deceleration (and force) sustained by the system. The importance of the duration and characteristics of the “slider-up ” phase in determining overall inflation performance is also examined...|$|R
40|$|Although many {{sophisticated}} stability {{models of}} parachutes have appeared, advances {{are concentrated in}} the simulation of dynamics of the solid body components of multibody systems. For the complex canopy aerodynamics it is routine to quote several standard simplifying assumptions, few {{of which can be}} factually justified since none of the models has convincingly demonstrated its validity by detailed comparison with experimental data. Such demonstrations are essential for confident prediction. This study investigates a fundamental three-dimensional parachute model. Fluid accelerative reactions are represented by an idealised added mass tensor, and it is shown that the equations of motion in previous treatments are either inadequately or incorrectly derived and/or implemented. Nonlinear solutions of the six degree-of-freedom equations for a rigid axisymmetric system are obtained, and a parameter sensitivity analysis for dynamic stability of a typical <b>personnel</b> <b>parachute</b> indicates that the most important aerodynamic parameters are the added mass components and the pitch damping derivative, not one of which has been adequately estimated. A systematic validation method is outlined. The kinematics of four free-falling parachute scale models, with canopy flight diameters from 1. 4 m to 5. 8 m, have been acquired from a strapdown inertial measurement system. Spectral analysis of the transducer signals reveals sharply defined frequencies of oscillation. Comparisons of simulation and experiment demonstrate that satisfactory agreement in frequencies and mean amplitudes of oscillation can be extracted. However, no inherent influence is evident in the model to enable the observed, apparently random amplitude modulation to be reproduced. Sources of the random motion are discussed, one significant and hitherto ignored source being self-excited unsteadiness of the separated flow around the canopy. Measurements of unsteady aerodynamic forces on parachute canopies are needed, also improved estimates of fluid accelerative reactions and aerodynamic damping...|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of World War I the RFC, {{commanded}} by Brigadier-General Sir David Henderson, consisted of five squadrons - one observation balloon squadron (RFC No 1 Squadron) and four aeroplane squadrons. These were first used for aerial spotting on 13 September 1914 but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915. Aerial photography was attempted during 1914, but again only became effective the next year. By 1918, photographic images could be taken from 15,000 feet and were interpreted by over 3,000 <b>personnel.</b> <b>Parachutes</b> were not available to pilots of heavier than air craft in the RFC - nor were they used by the RAF during the First World War - although the Calthrop Guardian Angel parachute (1916 model) was officially adopted just as the war ended.

5000|$|The Hague Rules of Air Warfare {{never came}} into force. There was no legal {{prohibition}} of targeting parachuting enemy airmen before or during World War II. In 1949, {{as a result}} of widespread practices and abuses committed during the Second World War, the newly modified and updated versions of the Geneva Conventions came into force providing greater protections to protected persons, but there was still no explicit prohibition on the shooting of parachuting enemy combatants. However, despite this, military manuals around the world issued prohibitions on attacking enemy <b>personnel</b> <b>parachuting</b> from aircraft in distress. Paragraph 30 of the United States Army's Field Manual published by the Department of the Army, on July 18, 1956 (last modified on July 15, 1976), under the title [...] "The Law of Land Warfare", states:30.
