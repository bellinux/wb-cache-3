500|$|In 1888, Austrian botanical {{physiologist}} Friedrich Reinitzer, {{working at}} the Karl-Ferdinands-Universität, examined the <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>properties</b> of various derivatives of cholesterol which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the freezing point, but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative cholesteryl benzoate were not the most peculiar feature. He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not melt {{in the same manner}} as other compounds, but has two melting points. At [...] it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at [...] it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to Otto Lehmann, at that time a [...] in Aachen. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing crystallites. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate [...] "fluid" [...] was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.|$|E

[...] Protein purification is vital for the characterization of the function, structure and interactions of the protein of interest.

Separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification.

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{obstacles}} in inferring a protein grammar {{is the size of}} the alphabet that should encode the 20 different amino acids. It has been proposed to address this by using <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>properties</b> of amino acids to reduce significantly the number of possible combinations of right side symbols in production rules: 3 levels of a quantitative property are utilised instead of the 20 amino acid types, e.g. small, medium or large van der Waals volume. Based on such a scheme, PCFGs have been produced to generate both binding site [...] and helix-helix contact site descriptors. A significant feature of those grammars is that analysis of their rules and parse trees can provide biologically meaningful information.|$|E

Implementation of these approaches, involves encoding a multiset of molecules that are assembled in a tube having a number of physical attributes.

Based on realistic definitions of these elementary operations, we define complexity of a DNA-based algorithm using the <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>property</b> of each operation.

40|$|International audienceIt {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that ice, {{no matter what}} phase, is unable to incorporate large amounts of salt into its structure.

Here, we show that this behaviour is not an intrinsic <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>property</b> of ice phases. We demonstrate by neutron diffraction that substantial amounts of dissolved LiCl can be built homogeneously into the ice VII structure if it is produced by recrystallization of its glassy (amorphous) state under pressure. Such ‘alloyed' ice VII has significantly different structural properties compared with pure ice VII, such as an 8 % larger unit cell volume, 5 times larger displacement factors, an absence of a transition to an ordered ice VIII structure and plasticity.

To validate the approach, methyl-, dimethyl-, and ethylnaphthalenes have been chosen, according to the availability of experimental data.

Simultaneous overestimation of aqueous solubilities and vapor pressures of comparable magnitude leads to partial error cancellation in the Henry's law constants.

Data confirm that for a decreasing ε value of the pore fluid a decrease in LL is observed for the smectitic clays, with different magnitude depending on the main ion, whereas for kaolinitic clays this decreasing ε causes an increase in attractive forces causing flocculation and increase in LL values. A probabilistic approach has been performed to assess the robustness of the regression functions. For smectitic and kaolinitic clays the mathematical dependency of LL with ε is validated by the probabilistic analysis...|$|R
