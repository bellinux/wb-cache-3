A <b>prospective</b> <b>study</b> takes a group of healthy individuals and tries to predict which ones would become alcoholic based on their histories—a much broader technique that often yields surprising results.|$|E

25|$|Chronic alcohol {{ingestion}} can impair multiple critical cellular {{functions in the}} lungs. These cellular impairments can lead to increased susceptibility to serious complications from lung disease. Recent research cites alcoholic lung disease as comparable to liver disease in alcohol-related mortality. Alcoholics have {{a higher risk of}} developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and experience higher rates of mortality from ARDS when compared to non-alcoholics. Despite these effects, a large <b>prospective</b> <b>study</b> has shown a protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption on respiratory mortality.|$|E

25|$|Tramadol's use in {{pregnancy}} is generally avoided {{as it may}} cause some reversible withdrawal effects in the newborn. A small <b>prospective</b> <b>study</b> in France found that, while there was {{an increased risk of}} miscarriages, there were no major malformations reported in the newborn. Its use during lactation is also generally advised against, but a small trial found that infants breastfed by mothers taking tramadol were exposed to about 2.88% of the dose the mothers were taking. There was no evidence of this dose having a harmful effect on the newborn.|$|E
25|$|Prospective {{studies have}} many {{benefits}} over case control studies. The RR {{is a more}} powerful effect measure than the OR, as the OR is just an estimation of the RR, since true incidence cannot be calculated in a case control study where subjects are selected based on disease status. Temporality can be established in a <b>prospective</b> <b>study,</b> and confounders are more easily controlled for. However, they are more costly, {{and there is a}} greater chance of losing subjects to follow-up based on the long time period over which the cohort is followed.|$|E
25|$|Although {{conscientiousness}} {{is generally}} {{seen as a}} positive trait to possess, recent {{research has suggested that}} in some situations it may be harmful for well-being. In a <b>prospective</b> <b>study</b> of 9570 individuals over four years, highly conscientious people suffered {{more than twice as much}} if they became unemployed. The authors suggested this may be due to conscientious people making different attributions about why they became unemployed, or through experiencing stronger reactions following failure. This finding is consistent with perspectives which see no trait as inherently positive or negative, but rather the consequences of the trait being dependent on the situation and concomitant goals and motivations.|$|E
40|$|Background: Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) {{have been}} {{associated}} with impaired neurocognitive functioning, which may (partly) improve with sustained abstinence. New treatments are emerging, aimed at improving cognitive functions, and being tested. However, no integrated review is available regarding neurocognitive recovery following sustained abstinence. Objectives: In this review, results from <b>prospective</b> <b>studies</b> on neurocognitive recovery using neuropsychological assessments before and after sustained abstinence from SUDs are summarized and discussed. Results: Thirty-five <b>prospective</b> <b>studies</b> were selected for this review, including twenty-two alcohol, three cannabis, four cocaine, three (meth) amphetamine, and three opioid studies. Results suggest that some cognitive functions (partially) recover after sustained abstinence, and that there are predictors of an unfavorable course such as poly-substance use and number of previous detoxifications. Conclusions: <b>Prospective</b> <b>studies</b> indicate that sustained abstinence after SUDs generally results in (partial) neurocognitive recovery. However, a final answer regarding full recovery awaits <b>prospective</b> <b>studies</b> with neurocognitive assessments before, during, and after sustained abstinence from SUDs. New interventions that might enhance neurocognitive recovery after abstinence are discussed, including neurocognitive training, medication and neuromodulation...|$|R

25|$|The former type {{of study}} is purely {{descriptive}} and {{cannot be used}} to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient's history, may lead to formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case control studies or prospective studies. A case control study would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A <b>prospective</b> <b>study</b> would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease's natural history.|$|E
25|$|By 1980, {{primidone}} {{was seen}} as not worth mentioning as an option for childhood temporal lobe epilepsy by doctors in the United Kingdom. In January 1981, Dr. O'Brien and colleagues reported that primidone had {{a positive effect on}} the essential tremor of one of their patients. This led them to initiate a twenty-person <b>prospective</b> <b>study.</b> Twelve of the participants responded well. By 1984, valproic acid was the drug of choice for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and not the equally effective primidone. However, as late as 1985, primidone was {{still one of the most}} widely used anticonvulsants. At the close of the 1980s, primidone was still the preferred anticonvulsant for complex partial seizures in Germany. In 1989, Dainippon Pharmaceutical launched Exegran (zonisamide), the first new, chemically unique, non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsant in decades.|$|E
25|$|The {{most serious}} {{consequence}} of untreated OSA {{is to the}} heart. Persons with sleep apnea have a 30% higher {{risk of heart attack}} or death than those unaffected. In severe and prolonged cases, increased in pulmonary pressures are transmitted to {{the right side of the}} heart. This can result in a severe form of congestive heart failure known as cor pulmonale. Dyastolic function of the heart also becomes affected. One <b>prospective</b> <b>study</b> showed patients with OSA, compared with healthy controls, initially had statistically significant increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (P=.003) and significantly lower levels of nitrite-nitrate (P=.008), which might be pathogenic factors in the cardiovascular complications of OSA. These factors reversed to normal levels after 12 weeks of treatment by CPAP, but further long-term trials are needed to assess the impact of this therapy.|$|E
