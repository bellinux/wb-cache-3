This factor, which quantifies the effect of <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapping,</b> depends on beam radius and spot size.

Data on 141 eyes operated on LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis) with a Gaussian profile show that the discrepancy between experimental and expected data on corneal power is significantly lower when using the correction factor. For an effective improvement of post-surgical visual quality, this factor should be applied in ablation algorithms that do not consider the effects of <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapping</b> with a Gaussian beam...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{communication}} {{has emerged}} as a very promising technology for short-range wireless applications, including high-speed multimedia transmissions and sensor networks. UWB system designs involve many different aspects covering analog and digital processing, channel estimation and modeling, and modulation and demodulation. Although UWB still faces many challenges, significant progress has been made to commercialize UWB systems. This thesis focus on schemes to improve the performance and to lower the complexity of the UWB physical layer. We first propose a frequency-hopped multi-band UWB system structure for higher throughput with better inter-symbol interference (ISI) immunity. This system is analyzed and compared to a single-band system. <b>Pulse</b> <b>overlapping</b> causes inter-pulse interference and may limit the system performance, especially in dense multipath environments. We then build a mathematical model with <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapping</b> considered and investigate the optimum linear RAKE receiver structure in such situation. The analysis is further is extended to systems that employ a prerake diversity combining scheme, in more realistic channel environments. The prerake scheme shifts RAKE receivers' related signal processing needs to the transmitter side and helps combat narrow-band interference. To lower complexity, we develop a decision-directed autocorrelation (DDA) receiver, which offers more effective multipath energy capture at a lower complexity than the conventional RAKE receiver structures. Compared with transmit-reference receivers, the proposed DDA methods can considerably lower the noise level in the self-derived template waveform by operating in an adaptive decision-directed mode, thus improving the overall detection performance. There is little loss in energy efficiency since no reference pilots are required during adaptation. Finally, we propose a hybrid modulation method that enables a heterogeneous network structure where users can flexibly choose a coherent RAKE receiver or a transmit-reference receiver structure. While neither type of receiver sacrifices performance loss by enabling the heterogeneous structure, the coherent RAKE receivers enjoy great performance advantages when further combined with forward error correction and iterative decoding methods. Throughout the thesis, theoretical performance analysis is always presented along with corroborating simulations...|$|E

The proposed circuit has many advantages, such as simple structure, multi-touch, low operating power, as well as significant current to be read out easily by low cost ICs.

40|$|The {{light source}} power {{stability}} of the Fiber-Optic Gyroscope (FOG) affects directly the scale factor and bias stability of FOG. The typical control scheme of the light source power employs an additional photodetector to detect the output power of the light source.

The spike <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapping</b> on the gyro signal denotes potentially the change of the light power and fiber loss. In the novel scheme, the spike pulse is extracted from the gyro signal, and is transformed into the square wave by the differential circuit.

In dependence on the laser parameters two different material removal processes were found. For a low <b>pulse</b> <b>overlap</b> the laser <b>pulse</b> penetrates the CIGS film and is absorbed in the interface between the CIGS and the Mo causing a lift-off process of the CIGS from the Mo back contact.

However, {{the pulse}} overlap {{turns out to}} be of significant influ-ence on the resulting surface quality. This {{can be traced back to}} particulate process emission from the workpiece surface that influences subsequent pulses in the case of large <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapping</b> and can even agglomerate to debris layers above the processed surface. Measurements of particle emission indicate that 90 % of the ablated particulate material consists of nanoparticles, raising the demands on safe machine housing and suction measures.

Regarding its adhesion to dental cement, Y-TZP has deficits compared to dentin. The fixation between cement and Y-TZP surfaces can be improved by artificial microstructures, added to the inner surface of laser-processed dental crowns in a final step during ultrafast-laser-based manufacturing.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Rashba {{interaction}} and electromagnetic {{field on the}} edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator are investigated in a non-perturbative way. We show that the electron dynamics is equivalent to a problem of massless Dirac fermions propagating with an inhomogeneous velocity, enhanced by the Rashba profile {{with respect to the}} bare Fermi value $v_F$. Despite the inelastic and time-reversal breaking processes induced by the electromagnetic field, no backscattering occurs without interaction. The photoexcited electron densities are explicitly obtained in terms of the electric field and the Rashba interaction, and are shown to fulfil generalised chiral anomaly equations. The case of a Gaussian electromagnetic pulse is analysed in detail. When the photoexcitation occurs far from the Rashba region, the latter effectively acts as a "superluminal gate" boosting the photoexcited wavepacket outside the light-cone determined by $v_F$. In contrast, for an electric <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapping</b> the Rashba region the emerging wavepackets are squeezed in a manner that depends on the overlap area. The electron-electron interaction effects are also discussed, for both intra-spin and inter-spin density-density coupling. The results suggest that Rashba interaction, often considered as an unwanted disorder effect, may be exploited to tailor the shape and the propagation time of photoexcited spin-polarised wave packets.

40|$|Plants {{limit the}} range of insect substrate-borne {{vibratory}} communication by their architecture and mechanical properties that change transmitted signal time, amplitude and frequency characteristics. Stinkbugs gain higher signal-to-noise ratio and increase communication distance by emitting narrowband low frequency vibratory signals that are tuned with transmission properties of plants. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate hitherto overlooked consequences of duetting with mutually overlapped narrowband vibratory signals. The overlapped vibrations of the model stinkbug species Eushistus heros, produced naturally or induced artificially on different plants, have been analysed. They represent female and male strategies to preserve information within a complex masked signal. The brown stinkbugs E. heros communicate with species and gender specific vibratory signals that constitute characteristic duets in the calling, courtship and rivalry phases of mating behaviour. The calling female pulse overlaps the male vibratory response when the latency of the latter is shorter than the duration of the female triggering signal or when the male response does not inhibit the following female <b>pulse.</b> <b>Overlapping</b> of signals induces interference that changes their amplitude pattern to a sequence of regularly repeated pulses in which their duration and the difference between frequencies of overlapped vibrations are related inversely.

40|$|We present {{numerical}} {{results of}} 3 -D MHD {{model of a}} dipole active region field containing a loop with a higher density than its surroundings. We study different ways of excitation of vertical kink oscillations by velocity perturbation: as an initial condition, and as an impulsive excitation with a pulse of a given position, duration, and amplitude. These properties are varied in the parametric studies. We find that the amplitude of vertical kink oscillations is significantly amplified in comparison to horizontal kink oscillations for exciters located centrally (symmetrically) below the loop, but not if the exciter is located a significant distance {{to the side of}} the loop. This explains why the pure vertical kink mode is so rarely observed in comparison to the horizontally polarized one. We discuss the role of curved magnetic field lines and the <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapping</b> at one of the loop's footpoints in 3 -D active regions (AR's) on the excitation and the damping of slow standing waves. We find that footpoint excitation becomes more efficient in 3 -D curved loops than in 2 -D curved arcades and that slow waves can be excited within an interval of time that is comparable to the observed one wave-period due to the combined effect of the pulse inside and outside the loop. Additionally, we study the effect of AR topology on the excitation and trapping of loop oscillations. We find that a perturbation acting directly on a single loop excites oscillations, but results in an increased leakage compared to excitation of oscillations in an AR field by an external source...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - With {{the aid of}} the calculational system {{developed}} by the authors, the analysis of the problem of laser shock processing (LSP) treatment for induction of residual stress (RS) fields for fatigue life enhancement in relatively thin sheets in a way compatible with reduced overall workpiece deformation due to spring-back self-equilibration has been envisaged. Numerical results directly tested against experimental results have been obtained confirming the critical influence of the laser energy and irradiation geometry parameters. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Plane rectangular specimens (160 mm× 100 mm× 2 mm) of Al-cladded (- 80 µm) Al 2024 -T 351 were considered both for LSP experimental treatment and for corresponding numerical simulation. The test piece is fixed on a holder and is driven along X and Y directions by means of an anthropomorphic robot. The predefined <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapping</b> strategy is used for the irradiation of extended areas of material. From the geometrical point of view, a full 3 D configuration for the real geometry and for the sequential overlapping strategy of pulses has been considered. The FEM elements used for the simulation are an eight-node brick reduced integration with hourglass control in the treated area, namely C 3 D 8 RT, and a six-node trainer prism {{in the rest of the}} geometry, where there is no applied load, namely C 3 D 6 T, that ease meshing complex partitions. The element size in the nearest of the treated surface is 100 × 100 × 25 µm, being the maximum element size which allows to maintain calculation convergence. Findings ? Numerical results directly tested against experimental results have been obtained confirming: first, the critical influence of the laser energy and irradiation geometry parameters on the possible thin sheets deformation, both at local and global scales. Second, the possibility of finding LSP treatment parameter regimes that, maintaining the requirements relative to in-depth RSs fields, are able to reduce the relative importance of sheet deformation. Third, the possibility of finding LSP treatment parameter regimes able to provide through-thickness compressive RSs fields at levels compatible with an effective fatigue life enhancement. Fourth, the possibility of improving this through-thickness compressive RSs fields by double-side treatments. Fifth, the capability of the experimental LSP treatment system at the authors site (CLUPM) of practically achieve the referred through-thickness compressive RSs fields in excellent agreement with the predictive assessment obtained by the used numerical code (SHOCKLAS®). Practical implications - The referred results provide a firm basis for the design of LSP treatments able to confer a broad range of RSs fields to thin components aiming the extension of their fatigue life, an enormously relevant field in which the authors are currently working. Originality/value - The LSP treatment of relatively thin specimens brings, as an additional consequence, the possible bending in a process of laser shock forming. This effect poses a new class of problems regarding the attainment of specified RS's depth profiles in the mentioned type of sheets, and, what can be more critical, an overall deformation of the treated component. The analysis of the problem of LSP treatment for induction of tentatively through-thickness RS's fields for fatigue life enhancement in relatively thin sheets in a way compatible with reduced overall workpiece deformation due to spring-back self-equilibration is envisaged in this paper for the first time to the authors knowledge. The coupled theoretical-experimental predictive approach {{developed by}} the authors has been applied to the specification of LSP treatments for achievement of RS's fields tentatively able to retard crack propagation on normalized specimens...|$|E

40|$|Stereotyped {{intervals}} between successive sound pulses {{characterize the}} acoustic signals of anurans and other organisms and provide critical information to receivers. One class of midbrain neuron responds selectively when pulses are repeated at slow rates (long intervals). To examine the mechanisms that underlie long-interval selectivity, we made whole cell recordings, in vivo, from neurons in the anuran inferior colliculus (anuran IC). In most cases, long-pass interval selectivity appeared to arise from interplay between excitation and inhibition; in ∼ 25 % of these cases, the delayed inhibition to a <b>pulse</b> <b>overlapped</b> with the excitation {{to the following}} pulse at fast pulse repetition rates (PRRs), resulting in a phasic “onset” response.
