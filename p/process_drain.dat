The building layout is shown in Fig. 1. A photograph of the facility is shown in Fig. 2. The manufacturing process employed a wide variety of acids, bases, and other hazardous materials. As the cold war wound down, the need for naval fuel declined. Consequently, the facility was shut down and underwent initial deactivation. All process systems were flushed with water and drained using the existing <b>process</b> <b>drain</b> valves. However, since these drains were not always installed at the lowest point in piping and equipment systems, a significant volume of liquid remained after initial deactivation was completed in 1990. At that time, a non-destructive assay of the process area identified approximately 17 (+/- 100 %) kg of uranium held up in equipment and piping...|$|E

30|$|In the {{academic}} domain, using cross-lagged panel path analysis, Brandstätter and colleagues [16, 41] provided {{convincing evidence that}} an action crisis temporally antecedes devaluation of goal-desirability and deterioration in perceived goal-attainability. Similarly, recent neuroeconomic research found that in a fatigued state, and moderated by endurance capacity, anticipated costs of future efforts are escalated, while the attractiveness of anticipated rewards are discounted [42]. During psychophysiological crises, stimulus-driven reactive control therefore seems to undermine goal-driven proactive control and negatively impact on thinking-action coupling in the self-regulatory control of goal-striving [43]. However, according to Brick et al. [44], endurance athletes can monitor and control their thoughts and actions in self-regulated endurance performance through metacognitive processes, albeit at the speculated cost of accruing mental fatigue. Thus, the HTW phenomenon {{can be understood as}} psychophysiological stress <b>process</b> <b>draining</b> on fatigable and temporally limited physiological and psychological resources, eventually leading to the dissolution of the initially aspired performance goal.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{determine}} an “activation gradient” able to develop the generative energy of a process of participated planning in conditions of indeterminateness. The research {{is based on a}} critical re-reading of four personal experiences and an intuition: the margin of energy, i. e. the funding element of participated processes, may express itself at its best along specific trajectories. The ex post analysis of those experiences evidences that the “institutionalisation” of the <b>process</b> <b>drained</b> off their generative energy. Involvement and sharing produced compromises that alienated the project from its authors, whilst its institutionalisation made participation red tape. Which the reasons of this ineffectiveness? This is a Khunian “anomaly”, unexplainable through existing theories: it requires a new paradigm. This anomaly brings in indeterminateness as the “planning engine” that stimulates innovation and involvement, favouring the activation of self-regenerating free spaces and processes. The “activation gradient” was then introduced to measure the paths of creative energy within an interactive process. The indeterminateness of the project, preventing an excess of compromises, avoids civic alienation whilst keeping alive participation through a longer dialectic process. Keeping margins means the continuity of involvement even when facing red tape paths, through the use of self-organisational practises giving life to structural subjects as “embryos of civitas ”...|$|R

Eight animals were injected with a cinnabar, mercury, zinc oxide mixture (Teichmann's paste) for dissection and for cleared specimens, two with radiopaque material, and two others with India ink. Findings indicate that the coronoid, condylar, and angular processes of the mandible are supplied by vessels which are primarily concerned with the nutrition of the muscles that attach to these areas, and not from the inferior alveolar artery. The inferior alveolar artery supplies {{the body of the}} mandible, teeth and adjacent structures. After entering the mandibular foramen this artery bifurcates beneath the third molar tooth. The larger inferior stem passes downward and backward to supply multiple branches to the pulp of incisor tooth and branches to the periodontium about this tooth.

Emphasizing Hawaii, Tahiti, and Tonga 1797 - 1830, this paper tests these assertions of cultural intervention. While literary scholarship has targeted missionary successes celebrated in the published accounts of missionary legends John Williams and William Ellis, around whom a veritable hagiography developed {{in the wake of}} Polynesian mass conversions to Christianity, this paper hones in on the decades of missionary failures in Polynesia which preceded spectacular episodes of iconoclasm. With an examination of visual and textual narration of missionary impact, comparing published and unpublished sources, this paper argues that early missionaries did try to change culture in Polynesia – and failed; the civilizing intent of the mission backfired until after extensive patient conversations kindled a situation receptive to the textual logos of evangelism rapidly expedited by the establishment of the printing press. In the South Seas, initially material possessions impeded the work of evangelism, and later cultural impacts of missionaries in architecture, agriculture, fashion, manufacturing, medicine, and other domains included a large measure of indigenous agency, which initially operated as outright rejection. By attending to the details of early failures, monotonous archival descriptions of the mechanics of evangelism frequently bypassed in favor of more salacious content, and the dynamism of culture change through additional vectors, this paper reconfigures missionary impact on culture during the years surrounding Polynesian mass conversions to Christianity...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest in minimizing analytical laboratory wastes. The driving forces behind this interest are the ever increasing costs and liabilities associated with waste disposal. Thus, many analytical laboratories, like the Defense Waste Processing Technology-Analytical Laboratory (DWPT-AL), located at the Savannah River Site (SRS), are looking into treating their own wastes. The DWPT-AL operates four laboratory modules that produce hazardous liquid effluents from the analytical instrumentation: Spectroscopy, Chromatography I, Chromatography II, and Wet Chemistry. The hazardous waste from these modules is being sent to SRS Waste Management {{at a cost of}} approximately $ 13, 000 per drum, which corresponds to approximately $ 325, 000 to $ 520, 000 per year.

A secondary goal was to develop in-line methods using primarily adsorption/ion exchange columns that can be used to treat the liquid effluent as it emerges from the analytical instrument as a slow, dripping flow. The second goal allows the treatment method to become part of the operating procedure associated with the instrument; thus, the effluent would not be considered a waste until it emerges from the in-line column...|$|R
