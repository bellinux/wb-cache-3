50|$|There are a {{large number}} of First and Second World War war graves in the cemetery, the greater {{proportion}} (592 graves) being Commonwealth service burials from the former war. Most of those are concentrated between three war graves plots: the United Kingdom <b>plot</b> (<b>Square</b> 89), holding 266 graves, the Australian plot which holds 23 graves, and the Canadian <b>plot</b> (<b>Square</b> 52) which holds 36 graves including burials of South African and New Zealand servicemen. Those buried in the UK plot and in individual graves outside the three plots are, because of not being marked by headstones, listed by name on a Screen Wall memorial inside the cemetery's main entrance. A second Screen Wall lists 110 Commonwealth service personnel of the Second World War who are buried in another war graves <b>plot</b> (<b>Square</b> 5), and elsewhere whose graves could not be marked by headstones. There is also a Belgian war grave of the First World War.|$|R

50|$|In Ohio, {{the effects}} of patch shape and {{proportion}} of edge were investigated by mowing strips between study <b>plots.</b> The <b>square</b> <b>plots</b> were 132 feet per side (40 m x 40 m), and the rectangular patches were 52.8 feet by 330 feet (16 m x 100 m). Square habitat patches {{were not significantly different}} from rectangular patches in meadow vole density. Edge effects in patches of this size were not found, suggesting meadow voles are edge-tolerant. Habitat patch shape did affect dispersal and space use behaviors. In rectangular patches, home ranges were similar in size to those in square patches, but were elongated.|$|R

30|$|The two-parameter Weibull {{distribution}} {{is widely used}} in reliability engineering and lifetime data analysis because of its flexibility to properly model increasing and decreasing failure rates. It has gained the interest of researchers who have worked on its various aspects, such as inference, application and parameter estimation (see Nelson 1982; Cohen 1991; Johnson et al. 1994; Meeker and Escobar 1998).

40|$|International audienceAgroforestry {{systems have}} been {{recognized}} as areas with high conservation potential, {{and there is a}} need to quickly assess the biodiversity and tree stocking density available in these systems. However, it is not clear if the commonly used fixed area plot is most efficient for sampling such landscapes, or if a different method could provide equivalent data with less effort. Thus, a field and simulation-based study was carried out to compare the efficiency and accuracy of a variable area transect versus the fixed area <b>square</b> <b>plot.</b> Field efficiency tests were carried out in three habitat types, robusta coffee plantations, arabica coffee plantations and a privately owned forest fragment, in Kodagu, southern India. A simulation study of bias, precision and accuracy of the two methods for tree density estimation also was carried out using various spatial distribution patterns and densities. The variable area transect was significantly more efficient per unit effort in the field than the fixed area <b>square</b> <b>plot.</b> In the simulation tests both methods performed equally well under random spatial distribution. However, under simulated aggregated distribution both methods were positively biased (<b>square</b> <b>plot</b> up to 12 % at low density, variable area transect 9 – 12 % at all densities), and under simulated regular distribution the variable area transect was slightly negatively biased (− 5 to − 7 % at medium to high density). The variable area transect thus can be recommended over the <b>square</b> <b>plot</b> for rapid assessment of tree diversity and density, when the vegetation is expected to be randomly dispersed...|$|R
