5000|$|Most metal {{produced}} by a steel mill or aluminium plant is formed (via rolling or extrusion) into long continuous strips of various size and shape. These strips are cut at regular intervals and allowed to cool, each segment becoming a piece of bar stock. A good analogy is <b>pasta-making,</b> in which lumps of dough are extruded into various cross-sectional shapes; cut into lengths; and then dried in that form. The cross-sectional shapes of pasta vary from simple bar or tube shapes (such as linguine or penne) to more elaborate extrusions (such as rotelle, fiori, or rotini). The {{same is true of}} metal bar stock. The most common shapes are round bar (also called rod), rectangular bar (including square bar, the special case of equal sides), and hexagonal bar (usually called hex bar for short). Tube and pipe are similar, but have hollow centers and are traditionally not called [...] "bar" [...] in industrial usage. (However, a product called hollow bar, essentially tube but with custom-orderable OD and ID and thus custom wall thickness, is marketed for lathe bar work which can benefit from obviation of drilling and rough boring.) Also similar in concept, but not called [...] "bar", are the common structural shapes such as angle stock and channel stock. These are commonly available in steel and aluminum; the names [...] "angle iron" [...] and [...] "channel iron" [...] are still commonly used (informally) even though their literal namesake, wrought iron, has been replaced by steel and aluminum for most uses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Knowledge of {{patterns}} of genetic diversity enhances {{the efficiency of}} germplasm conservation and improvement. In this study 96 Iranian landraces of Triticum turgidum originating from different geographical areas of Iran, along with 18 durum cultivars from ten countries were evaluated for variation in morphological and high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) composition. The first two principal components clearly separated the Iranian landraces from cultivars. Three alleles were present at the Glu-A 1 locus and 11 alleles at Glu-B 1. In both cultivars and landraces of durum wheat, the null allele (Glu-A 1 c) was observed more frequently than the Glu-A 1 a and Glu-A 1 b alleles. Two alleles, namely Glu-B 1 a (subunit 7) and Glu-B 1 e (subunit 20) represented the more frequent alleles at Glu-B 1 locus. The {{results showed that the}} evaluated Iranian landraces formed an interesting source of favourable glutenin subunits that might be very desirable in breeding activities for improving <b>pasta-making</b> quality.

40|$|High {{protein content}} and a &#x 2018;strong&#x 2019; gluten are {{required}} in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) to process semolina into a suitable final pasta product. The variation in grain protein content and quality realized through breeding and the concomitant variation in biomass production and partitioning have been analyzed by comparing in a 2 -year field trial, four groups of cultivars released in different eras {{and areas of}} breeding. Three groups of cultivars represented {{the evolution of the}} Italian germplasm from the first landraces and genealogical selections (Group 1) to the cultivars constituted by crossing Mediterranean types with Syriacum types (Group 2), and the modern dwarf and semi-dwarf cultivars (Group 3). Group 4 was an ICARDA collection of breeding lines bred for adaptation to high altitudes. The measured traits included both biomass production and its partitioning to the grain, and total nitrogen uptake and its partitioning to the grain. Grain protein percentage, gluten content and gluten index were utilized as quality traits. Breeding resulted in an increased earliness, reduced height without significant decreases in total biomass, and improved partitioning. The concomitant total nitrogen uptake did not change, whereas the changed biomass partitioning caused a parallel change in nitrogen partitioning, with an increase in nitrogen harvest index from 0. 41 to 0. 59. The lower protein percentage in the grains of modern cultivars was therefore not due to a reduced nitrogen uptake, nor to a lower NHI or to less milligram of nitrogen per grain, but to the dilution effect caused by the heavier grains of modern cultivars. A notable increase in gluten index was observed in the modern cultivars, reflecting an improvement in the <b>pasta-making</b> quality of grain proteins...|$|E
40|$|Humans perform {{fascinating}} science experiments {{at home on}} a {{daily basis}} when they undertake the modification of natural and naturally-derived materials by a cooking process prior to consumption. The material properties of such foods are of interest to food scientists (texture is often fundamental to food acceptability), oral biologists (foods modulate feeding behavior), anthropologists (cooking is probably as old as the genus Homo and distinguishes us from all other creatures) and dentists (foods interact with tooth and tooth replacement materials). Materials scientists may be interested in the drastic changes in food properties observed over relatively short cooking times. In the current study, the mechanical properties {{of one of the most}} common (and oldest at 4, 000 + years) foods on earth, the noodle, were examined as a function of cooking time. Two types of noodles were studied, each made from natural materials (wheat flour, salt, alkali and water) by kneading dough and passing them through a <b>pasta-making</b> machine. These were boiled for between 2 - 14 min and tested at regular intervals from raw to an overcooked state. Cyclic tensile tests at small strain levels were used to examine energy dissipation characteristics. Energy dissipation was > 50 % per cycle in uncooked noodles, but decreased by an order of magnitude with cooking. Fractional dissipation values remained approximately constant at cooking times greater than 7 min. Overall, a greater effect of cooking was on viscoplastic dissipation characteristics rather than on fracture resistance. The results of the current study plot the evolution of a viscoplastic mixture into an essentially elastic material in the space of 7 minutes and have broad implications for understanding what cooking does to food materials. In particular, they suggest that textural assessment by consumers of the optimally cooked state of food has a definite physical definition. © 2007 Materials Research Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In {{durum wheat}} (Triticum turgidum L. var durum), grain protein {{concentration}} (GPC) and gluten quality {{are among the}} important factors influencing <b>pasta-making</b> quality. Semolina with high protein content produces pasta with increased tolerance to overcooking and greater cooked firmness. However, genetic improvement of GPC is difficult largely because of its negative correlation with grain yield, and a strong genotype x environment interaction. Therefore, identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for high GPC and the associated markers is a priority to enhance selection efficiency in breeding durum wheat for elevated GPC. At a physiological level, GPC is influenced by several factors including nitrogen remobilization from vegetative organs and direct post-anthesis nitrogen uptake (NUP) from the soil. Understanding the relationship between elevated GPC and nitrogen remobilization, and post-anthesis NUP will enable durum wheat breeders to develop varieties that not only produce high yield and high GPC, but also exhibit better nitrogen use efficiency. The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify and validate QTL for elevated GPC in two durum wheat populations; and (2) to determine if elevated GPC is due to more efficient nitrogen remobilization and/or greater post-anthesis NUP. A genetic map was constructed with SSR and DArT® markers in a doubled haploid population from the cross Strongfield x DT 695, and GPC data were collected in replicated trials in six Canadian environments from 2002 to 2005. Two stable QTL for high GPC, QGpc. usw-B 3 on chromosome 2 B and QGpc. usw-A 3 on 7 A, were identified. Strongfield, the high GPC parent, contributed the alleles for elevated GPC at both QTL. These two QTL were not associated with variation in grain weight (seed size) or grain yield. QGpc. usw-A 3 was validated in a second Strongfield-derived population as that QTL was significant in all six testing environments. Averaged over five locations, selection for QGpc. usw-A 3 resulted in a + 0. 4 % to + 1. 0 % increase in GPC, with only small effects on yield in most environments. A physiological study of grain protein accumulation revealed that regardless of the growing condition, nitrogen remobilization was the major contributor for grain nitrogen in durum genotypes evaluated, accounting {{for an average of}} 84. 3 % of total GPC. This study confirmed that introgression of Gpc-B 1 into Langdon resulted in increased GPC, and this GPC increase was due to higher N remobilization. Strongfield expressed greater N remobilization than DT 695 and the semi-dwarf cultivar Commander, but N remobilization was not the determining factor for Strongfield’s elevated GPC. Strongfield expressed greater post-anthesis NUP than DT 695. Similarly, a selection of six high-GPC doubled haploid (DH) lines from the cross DT 695 x Strongfield expressed significantly greater post-anthesis NUP than six low-GPC DH selections, supporting the hypothesis that elevated GPC in Strongfield is derived from greater post-anthesis NUP. All six high-GPC DH selections carried the Strongfield allele at QGpc. usw-A 3, suggesting this QTL maybe associated with post-anthesis NUP...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the food {{industry}} has put in much effort to pos itively contribute to animal and human health using functional foods suc h as prebiotics. Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that ben eficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or a ctivity {{of one or more}} types of favourable bacteria such as bifidobacter ia and lactobacilli. Fermentation of prebiotics stimulates the saccharolytic activity of the colonic microbiota resulting in the production of short chain fatty acid s (acetic acid, butyric acid and propionic acid). To the contrary, prote olytic activity is reduced with less production of potentially toxic met abolites (phenols, sulfides and amines). Until now, fructo-oligosacchari des and inulin are well-established prebiotics, whereas other non-digest ible carbohydrates such as xylo-, galacto- isomalto- and soybean-oligosa ccharides have been considered as candidate prebiotics. Recently, arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) have been proposed as a n ew prebiotic substrate by the Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Biochemis try (Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, K. U. Leuven). AXOS consist of a x ylopyranosyl backbone which is substituted with arabinofuranosyl residue s. They are produced by enzymatic degradation of arabinoxylans (AX), a c ereal dietary fibre. Through their high viscosity and water-binding capa city, AX {{have a positive impact on}} the functionality of cereals in biote chnological food processes such as bread-making and <b>pasta-making.</b> AX do not exert prebiotic properties since they are only partly fermented in t he colon. Depending on the substrate specificity of the endo- and exo-en zymes, AXOS with variable average degree of polymerisation (avDP) and av erage degree of arabinose substitution (avDAS) are obtained. Based upon experimental animal studies, performed at the Laboratory of F ood Chemistry and Biochemistry, low doses of AXOS have been demonstrated to have prebiotic activity. In humans, however, the effect of AXOS on t he colonic metabolism and fermentation pattern was largely unknown. The present research project aimed to characterise the influence of AXOS on the human gastrointestinal tract. Parameters of proximal motility an d digestion have been measured to evaluate the effects of AXOS on the pr oximal part of the gastrointestinal tract. To examine the prebiotic acti vity of AXOS, we studied the influence of AXOS on the composition of the microbiota as well as the metabolic activity of the microbiota. The bio marker lactose-[15 N, 15 N]-ureide has been used to study the colonic ammo nia metabolism. The intake of prebiotics results in a larger fraction of [15 N]-NH 3 being taken up by the bacteria and excreted in faeces and a s maller fraction of the label being excreted in urine. Urinary p-cresol a nd phenol excretion were measured as an indication of protein fermentati on. Furthermore, bacterial enzyme activities and faecal volatile organic compounds were analysed as parameters of the colonic bacterial metaboli sm. To study the effects of AXOS on these different gastrointestinal par ameters, several dietary intervention studies were performed in healthy subjects. In Chapter III. 1, a preliminary study was performed in which AXOS was ad ministered for the first time to healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the minimal dose of AXOS with an avDP of 15 and an avDA S of 0. 27 (AXOS- 15 - 0. 27) that causes a detectable effect on the colonic metabolism. Therefore, single doses of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 ranging between 0. 0 g and 5. 0 g were administered. The increased hydrogen excretion upon a dos e of 2. 2 g demonstrated that AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 is fermented by the bacteria in the colon. Gastric emptying rate, oro-caecal transit and total transit were not influenced by the administration of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27. Upon a dose o f 2. 2 g AXOS- 15 - 0. 27, a decrease in urinary 15 N-excretion was observed al ong with an increase of 15 N in faeces. These results indicated a stimula tion of bacterial activity and, consequently, a higher uptake of 15 N by the bacteria. These findings suggested that a minimal dose of 2. 2 g AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 favourably modulates the colonic bacterial metabolism. Subsequently, we evaluated the influence of 2. 2 g AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 on proxima l motility and nutrient digestion (Chapter III. 2). This study was necess ary to exclude that changes in transit and digestion through supplementa tion of prebiotics affect the supply of substrates to the colon and thus influence the fermentation process. We established that a low dose of A XOS- 15 - 0. 27 did not influence the supply of proteins and lipids to the c olon. Therefore, we assumed that the observed influences of AXOS on colo nic metabolism were not due to differences in proximal motility and dige stion, yet, could be attributed to events occurring in the colon. In Chapter III. 3, two placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over studies were performed to investigate the gastrointestinal effects of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 and placebo. In the first study, the substrates were administered fo r two weeks in a dose of 2. 2 g/d, whereas the dose was increased to 5. 0 g/ d in the second study. In both studies, the colonic ammonia metabolism, protein fermentation and bacterial enzyme activity remained unchanged. H owever, the levels of bifidobacteria were increased after administration of 5. 0 g/d AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 for 2 weeks, indicating the prebiotic potential of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 in healthy humans. Chapter III. 4 describes the results of a randomised, cross-over study in which the influence of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 on several gastrointestinal paramete rs was compared to those of the reference prebiotic fructo-oligosacchari de enriched inulin (FOS-IN). In the presence of 5. 0 g/d AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 or FO S-IN, a clear effect on colonic ammonia metabolism was observed. The lev els of bifidobacteria were slightly increased after a 2 -weeks intake per iod of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 or FOS-IN. Because of the positive effects on colonic metabolism and microbiota observed in this study, we performed a second study with a reduced dose (2. 2 g/d) of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 and FOS-IN. This dose did not influence the colonic ammonia metabolism. However, the levels o f bifidobacteria were significantly increased. In both studies, protein fermentation and bacterial enzyme activities were not changed. Obviously, the effects of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 and FOS-IN were very similar at the same do ses. We also concluded that changes in microbiota were not necessarily a ssociated with changes in the colonic metabolism. In a next study, a higher dose of AXOS (10. 0 g/d) was administered to the subjects. Again, we evaluated their influence on different gastrointest inal parameters as well as the tolerance of AXOS (Chapter III. 5). Theref ore, we performed a placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over study in which 10. 0 g/d AXOS- 6 - 0. 26 was administered to healthy subjects for 3 wee ks. The intake of AXOS- 6 - 0. 26 did not cause biologically relevant change s in haematological and clinical chemistry parameters. Furthermore, the total symptom score was only slightly increased. Urinary p-cresol excret ion was significantly decreased, whereas bifidobacteria levels were sign ificantly increased after intake of AXOS- 6 - 0. 26. These results show that AXOS is well-tolerated in healthy subjects. In addition, protein fermen tation was influenced at these relatively high doses. To accurately characterise the bacterial colonic metabolism, metabolite profiling of volatile organic components from faeces was applied (Chapte r III. 6). Faecal samples collected during the intervention studies descr ibed in Chapter III. 4 and III. 5 were analysed. Multivariate data analysi s allowed discrimination of the faecal samples collected after intake of 5. 0 g/d AXOS- 9 - 0. 26, 10. 0 g/d AXOS- 6 - 0. 26 or 5. 0 g/d FOS-IN from the sampl es collected at baseline on the basis of a different metabolite pattern. The results indicate that this technique of metabolite profiling is a p romising tool to study the influence of dietary interventions. During the execution of the project, a considerable variability was obse rved in the biomarkers used to evaluate the colonic metabolism (urinary p-cresol and phenol excretion, and 15 N-excretion). Therefore, the repeat ability of these biomarkers was evaluated in the last chapter (Chapter I II. 7). From the results, we concluded that the repeatability of the para meters was acceptable and that the observed variability was not due to i ncomplete urine collections nor to variability in dietary intake. In general, we concluded that AXOS is also in humans a carbohydrate with prebiotic activity. Additional research is necessary to further unravel the structure activity pattern of different types of AXOS preparations and to elucidate the relation between microbiota and their metabolic act ivity. status: publishe...|$|E
