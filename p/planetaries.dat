5000|$|Clark has {{had three}} trucks over the years. His first truck was a late 80's blue and silver Chevrolet Silverado that had five ton {{military}} axle housings, Rockwell PS250 <b>planetaries,</b> and 46 offroad shock absorbers. Clark ran this truck till 1988. His second truck was a {{pink and white}} 1989 Chevrolet Silverado with a 144" [...] wheelbase with an extended front clip. Deciding his axles were good {{after two years of}} use, he used him on his new truck. After a rollover due to a drag race with Wild Hair to the pits at Dallas stadium in 1990, Clark decided to rebuild the truck and repaint the body all pink with silver stripes and a horse on the door. This truck was called Clydesdale 3 for this reason. At its first race, Clark was racing at Louisville Motor Speedway. In the first round, racing No Problem, Clark had a rough landing over the set of cars, causing the left rear wheel to come off and ruin his brand new body. John Moore was interviewed and was worried because {{he was the one that}} welded that flange back on after the same thing happened in Chicago, Illinois the previous year. Clark ran this truck until 1998, when he completed his current truck, Clydesdale 4. His newest truck is his best truck yet, a 2002 Chevrolet Silverado with Knight Stalker shocks. This truck has Clark 20 ton <b>planetaries,</b> F-106 axle housings and features a $6500 paint job. This truck also runs as Taurus at certain events. His second truck now runs as Johnny Rocket #7 monster truck.|$|E
50|$|The average male {{polar bear}} is 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) tall when {{standing}} {{on its hind}} legs.

The buggies are full-time four-wheel drive and have the capability to lock the differentials if needed.|$|E
5000|$|The Helix Nebula was {{the first}} {{planetary}} nebula discovered to contain cometary knots. Its main ring contains knots of nebulosity, which have now been detected in many nearby <b>planetaries.</b> These knots are highly radially symmetric (from the PNN) and are described as [...] "cometary", each centered on a core of neutral molecular gas and containing bright cusps (local photoionization fronts) towards the central star and tails away from it. All tails extend away from the PNN in a radial direction. Excluding the tails, they are (very approximately) {{the size of the}} Solar system, while each of the cusp knots are optically thick due to Lyc photons from the PNN.

50|$|The Abell Catalog of Planetary Nebulae {{was created}} in 1966 by George O. Abell and was {{composed}} of 86 entries thought to be planetary nebulae that were collected from discoveries, about half by Albert George Wilson and the rest by Abell, Robert George Harrington, and Rudolph Minkowski. All were discovered before August 1955 {{as part of the}} National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Survey on photographic plates created with the 48 in Samuel Oschin telescope at Mount Palomar. Four are better known from previous catalogs: Abell 50 is NGC 6742, Abell 75 is NGC 7076, Abell 37 is IC 972, and Abell 81 is IC 1454. Another four were later rejected as not being planetaries: Abell 11 (reflection nebula), Abell 32 (red plate flaw), Abell 76 (ring galaxy PGC 85185), and Abell 85 (supernova remnant CTB 1 and noted as possibly such in Abell's 1966 paper). Another three were also not included in the Strasbourg-ESO Catalogue of Galactic Planetary Nebulae (SEC): Abell 9, Abell 17 (red plate flaw), and Abell 64. <b>Planetaries</b> on the list are best viewed with a large aperture telescope (e.g. 18 in) and an OIII filter.|$|E
5000|$|To effect gear changes, one of {{two types}} of {{clutches}} or bands are used to hold a particular member of the planetary gearset motionless, while allowing another member to rotate, thereby transmitting torque and producing gear reductions or overdrive ratios. These clutches are actuated by the valve body (see below), their sequence controlled by the transmission's internal programming. Principally, a type of device known as a sprag or roller clutch is used for routine upshifts/downshifts. Operating much as a ratchet, it transmits torque only in one direction, free-wheeling or [...] "overrunning" [...] in the other. The advantage {{of this type of}} clutch is that it eliminates the sensitivity of timing a simultaneous clutch release/apply on two <b>planetaries,</b> simply [...] "taking up" [...] the drivetrain load when actuated, and releasing automatically when the next gear's sprag clutch assumes the torque transfer. The bands come into play for manually selected gears, such as low range or reverse, and operate on the planetary drum's circumference. Bands are not applied when drive/overdrive range is selected, the torque being transmitted by the sprag clutches instead. Bands are used for braking; the GM Turbo-Hydramatics incorporated this..|$|E
5000|$|Black Stallion is {{a monster}} truck that races on the USHRA circuit {{and for other}} promoters. Black Stallion {{started out as a}} stock 1982 Ford F350 back in 1982, owned and {{modified}} by Michael Vaters. The first modification was a homemade 12" [...] lift kit, since such kits were unavailable at the time. Mike then later added two sunroofs, an Alpine stereo system, a Ford 460 Engine, Rockwell 5 ton toploaders, Clark 20 ton <b>planetaries,</b> 66" [...] terra tires, a 9" [...] television and later on, a 1988 Ford F series front end. Between 1990 and 1991, Mike realized the future of monster trucks, which was racing. To be competitive, Mike replaced the leaf springs with airbags, the old heavy split ring rims with lightweight one piece rims, fiberglass body pieces, cutting the tires, gutting the interior out, 4 linking the truck and putting in a bigger engine. The modifications proved to be beneficial to Mike, with close races with First Blood, and competing in some Pendaliner Special Events racing events. After a violent rollover in Bloomsburg Pennsylvania in 1991, Mike decided to put King shocks on the truck, which he later added coil springs in 1992. Along with the coil springs, Mike also removed the airbags. Mike is credited as the first owner to use bypass shocks. Also for 1992, Mike changed the front clip to a 1992 Ford F-series front end. Mike rarely ran this truck after he built the popular Boogey Van in 1993, driven by his then wife, Pam Vaters. Due to this, the truck was nicknamed Rodney, after the comedian, Rodney Dangerfield. Mike then built a truck for the 1996 season for research and development, named Black Stallion 2000, since his crew members joked about Mike not building a new truck for himself until the new millennium. This chassis is still running strong to this day. For his 20th anniversary, Mike decided to repaint Black stallion, with the front of the truck yellow, going into black with a horse face painted on. The truck currently has the same paint scheme. The drivers for 2016 are Michael Vaters & Matt Cody. Vaters will compete in the Fox Sports 1 Championship Series. Cody will travel to Birmingham, Toronto, Newark, Charleston, Columbia, Worcester, Wheeling & Baton Rouge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. I {{review the}} {{progress}} {{in research on}} intracluster planetary nebulae {{over the last five}} years. Hundreds more intracluster planetary nebulae have been detected in the nearby Virgo and Fornax galaxy clusters, searches of several galaxy groups have been made, and intracluster planetary candidates have been detected in the distant Coma cluster. The first theoretical studies of intracluster <b>planetaries</b> have also been completed, studying their utility as tracers of the intracluster light as a whole, and also as individual objects. From the results to date, it appears that intracluster <b>planetaries</b> are common in galaxy clusters (10 - 20 % of the total amount of starlight), but thus far, none have been detected in galaxy groups, a result which currently is not well understood. Limited spectroscopic follow-up of intracluster <b>planetaries</b> in Virgo indicate that they have a complex velocity structure, in agreement with numerical models of intracluster light. Hydrodynamic simulations of individual intracluster <b>planetaries</b> predict that their morphology is significantly altered by their intracluster environment, but their emission-line properties appear to be unaffected...|$|E
40|$|The {{infrared}} sizes at {{the four}} IRAS wavelengths of 57 <b>planetaries,</b> most with 20 - 60 arcsec optical size, are derived from spatial deconvolution of one-dimensional survey mode scans. Survey observations from multiple detectors and hours confirmed (HCON) observations are combined to increase the sampling to a rate that is sufficient for successful deconvolution. The Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm is used to obtain an increase in resolution of a factor of about 2 or 3 from the normal IRAS detector sizes of 45, 45, 90, and 180 arcsec at wavelengths 12, 25, 60, and 100 microns. Most of the <b>planetaries</b> deconvolve at 12 and 25 microns to sizes equal to or smaller than the optical size. Some of the <b>planetaries</b> with optical rings 60 arcsec or more in diameter show double-peaked IRAS profiles. Many, such as NGC 6720 and NGC 6543 show all infrared sizes equal to the optical size, while others indicate increasing infrared size with wavelength.
