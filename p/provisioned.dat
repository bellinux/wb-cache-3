5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the natural history of the Borneo shark. It is {{viviparous}} like other requiem sharks; the females bear litters of six pups, which are <b>provisioned</b> through gestation by a placental connection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed this species as Endangered, at which time it had not been seen since 1937. While an extant population has since been found, the Borneo shark continues to merit conservation concern given its highly limited range within heavily fished waters.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what they could to restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had not been adequately <b>provisioned</b> and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E
5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several bee {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells <b>provisioned</b> by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also. The Arctic bee species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 1903, the {{expedition}} reached Port Stanley, where they received their first {{news from the}} outside world since leaving the Cape Verde Islands.

Bruce had further business in the city; he intended to persuade the Argentine government to assume responsibility for the Laurie Island meteorological station after {{the expedition}}'s departure. During the voyage to Buenos Aires, Scotia ran aground in the Río de la Plata estuary, and was stranded for several days before floating free and being assisted into port by a tug, on 24 December.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1620 (Old Style date), {{the initial}} group of English Dissenters living in Leiden boarded the Speedwell, which {{was meant to}} {{accompany}} another ship to be hired in England. This initial group included the mostly Brownist congregation. Myles and Rose Standish were aboard, along with the Bradfords, Winslows, Carvers, and others. The small, 60-ton pinnace sailed to Southampton with about 30 passengers, to be <b>provisioned</b> there and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the New World. Another 90 passengers would board the 180-ton Mayflower. The Speedwell had some significant leaks while in port that caused delays, but both vessels departed Southampton August 5.|$|E
5|$|Sheerness {{began as}} a fort built in the 16th century to protect the River Medway from naval invasion. In 1665 plans were first laid by the Navy Board for Sheerness Dockyard, a {{facility}} where warships might be <b>provisioned</b> and repaired. The site was favoured by Samuel Pepys, then Clerk of the Acts of the navy, for shipbuilding over Chatham inland. After the raid on the Medway in 1667, the older fortification was strengthened; in 1669 a Royal Navy dockyard {{was established in the}} town, where warships were stocked and repaired until its closure in 1960.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} how Chinese bank <b>provisioning</b> behaviour is related to business cycle using a GMM for 619 bank-year observations from 2003 to 2010. Loan loss <b>provisioning</b> is heavily dependent upon {{the performance of the}} real economy. <b>Provisioning</b> turns out to be substantially lower when real GDP growth rate is higher and asset price is rising, suggesting increased risks of loan portfolio in economic downswing. The pro-cyclicality of <b>provision</b> behaviour is also exacerbated by the fact that banks <b>provision</b> less when loan growth is strong and regulatory capital ratio is negatively correlated with <b>provisioning,</b> suggesting capital management via loan loss <b>provision.</b> This effect is mitigated by earning management, where <b>provision</b> rise when earnings are positively higher. When examining the ownership effect on banks’ <b>provision</b> behaviour, state banks <b>provision</b> more than non-state banks when credit risks increase, suggesting more prudent <b>provisioning</b> behaviour...|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} year, Tone and {{his companions}} tried again, this time persuading {{the government of the}} Batavian Republic, which was under French occupation, to prepare their own expedition. During 1797, the Dutch fleet was readied and <b>provisioned,</b> intending to combine with the French fleet and launch a second invasion attempt. The Batavian fleet sailed on a preparatory raiding cruise in the North Sea in October 1797 and on their return were confronted off the Dutch coast by the Royal Navy's North Sea Fleet under Admiral Sir Adam Duncan. Duncan immediately attacked, and in the ensuing Battle of Camperdown captured or destroyed ten ships and scattered the rest, ending the Batavian invasion threat.|$|E
5|$|While in prison, George Orsborne lent {{his name}} to a ghost-written account of the Girl Pat adventure, which {{repeated}} {{the claim that the}} vessel had been sent out inadequately equipped and <b>provisioned.</b> Marstrand's successfully sued the publishers, Hutchinsons, and two newspapers which had repeated the details. On his release, Orsborne planned to make a single-handed transatlantic crossing in an open boat, but the trip was delayed, and finally cancelled when war began in September 1939. Likewise, nothing came of an announcement in 1938 that Orsborne would lead an expedition to the Caribbean and up the Amazon.|$|E
5|$|With the {{encouragement}} of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 {{so that he could}} request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was a fool, and presciently warned his son that he would live to regret the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool. An under-funded makeshift army under Ernst von Mansfeld set off to recover the Palatinate, but it was so poorly <b>provisioned</b> that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the value relevance of the legally mandated <b>provisions.</b> This paper examines the effects of changes in <b>provisions</b> on the value relevance of earnings. The results show that the calculation of <b>provisions</b> will deteriorate the relevance of earnings when the changes in <b>provisions</b> may artificially and mechanically smooth earnings. However, the <b>provision</b> for railroad maintenance functions as a allocation method of operating revenues and the <b>provision</b> for insurance payment functions as a allocation method of operating expenses. These <b>provisions</b> seem to improve the value relevance of earnings. Therefore, we cannot discriminate against the legally mandated <b>provisions</b> for the very reason that their calculation is formally restricted. Whether <b>provision</b> is legally mandated or not, we still have many unresolved problems about <b>provisions</b> on the disclosure in the balance sheet and on the calculation in the income statement. ...|$|R
5|$|In 548, Emperor Justinian {{dispatched}} 8,000 {{men under}} Dagisthaeus, who {{together with a}} Lazic force set siege to the Persian garrison at Petra. As the Persians were well <b>provisioned,</b> the siege dragged on. Dagisthaeus had neglected to keep watch over the mountain passes that led into Lazica, and a far larger Persian relief force under Mihr-Mihroe arrived and raised the siege. Yet, the Persians lacked sufficient supplies, and so, after strengthening the garrison at Petra and leaving further 5,000 men under Phabrizus to secure its supply routes, Mihr-Mihroe left. In the spring of the next year, Gubazes and Dagisthaeus combined their forces, destroyed Phabrizus's army in a surprise attack, and pursued the survivors into Caucasian Iberia. In the same summer, they won another victory against a new Persian army, led by Khorianes. The allies failed, however, to prevent another Persian army from reinforcing Petra, and Dagisthaeus was recalled and replaced by Bessas.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the nervous}} shark is viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their initial supply of yolk, they are <b>provisioned</b> {{by the mother}} through a placental {{connection}} formed from the depleted yolk sac. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites {{at the sides of}} the female as a prelude to mating. After mating, the female stores the sperm for approximately four weeks prior to fertilization. In Darwin Harbor, mating occurs from January to March and birthing occurs in October and November following a gestation period of eight to nine months. In Shark Bay, mating occurs from late October to early November and birthing occurs around the same time the following year, following a gestation period of 11 months; this slower development likely reflects the cooler temperatures of Shark Bay.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical {{specifications}} carried over, {{except for}} a new five-speed manual transmission, optional on the 1.9-litre four-cylinder and 2.85-litre six-cylinder versions. In an attempt to improve sales figures of the inline-four engine, Holden spent considerable time improving its performance and efficiency. Modifications were also made to the 2.85-litre six to lift economy, and the powerplants managed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} by as much as 12.5 and 14percent, correspondingly. Holden released the sports-oriented Commodore SS sedan in September 1982—reintroducing a nameplate used briefly ten years prior with the HQ series. <b>Provisioned</b> with a choice of 4.2- or optional 5.0-litre V8 engines, both versions of the VH SS were teamed with a four-speed manual transmission. Racing driver Peter Brock's Holden Dealer Team (HDT) high performance outfit produced three upgraded versions, known as Group One, Group Two and Group Three, the latter version available in either 4.2-litre or more commonly 5.0-litre V8 configuration.|$|E

5|$|Relatively common, the Portuguese dogfish is {{an active}} hunter capable of {{tackling}} fast, large prey. It feeds mainly on cephalopods and fishes, though it also consumes invertebrates and cetacean carrion. This shark has acute vision optimized for detecting the bioluminescence of its prey, as sunlight does not reach the depths at which it lives. The Portuguese dogfish is aplacental viviparous, with the young <b>provisioned</b> by yolk and perhaps uterine fluid. The females give birth to up to 29 young after a gestation period of over one year. Valued for its liver oil {{and to a lesser}} extent meat, Portuguese dogfish are important to deepwater commercial fisheries operating off Portugal, the British Isles, Japan, and Australia. These fishing pressures and the low reproductive rate of this species have led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army's pace was {{dictated}} by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, {{had the advantage of}} superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously <b>provisioned</b> from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when it was almost cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard's army had a respite from attack because while it hugged the coast and had gone round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin's army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always within striking distance, and waiting for an opportunity to attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze and}} group antitakeover <b>provisions</b> {{as they relate}} to CEO’s {{monetary}} benefits. We specifically focus on the determinants of the six E-index <b>provisions</b> that were proposed by Bebchuk et al. (2009) to conversely affect firm value. The six <b>provisions</b> are split into two indices: those that provide managers with a monetary benefit if a takeover was successful (MB <b>provisions)</b> and those that do not (TP <b>provisions).</b> Results indicate that CEOs with a role duality use their power to influence the adoption of MB <b>provisions</b> and resist the adoption of TP <b>provisions.</b> Moreover, in the presence of CEO duality, the relationship between MB <b>provisions</b> and firm value worsens. On the other hand, the relationship between TP <b>provisions</b> and firm value is unaffected by the presence of CEO duality. This suggests that CEOs having a role duality do not feel the need to work in the shareholders’ best interest when entrenched with MB <b>provisions.</b> Our findings suggest that studying all the <b>provisions</b> of the E-index as a whole can be misleading in some cases...|$|R
