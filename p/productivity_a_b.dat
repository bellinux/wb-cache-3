30|$|State merit aid {{programs}} have grown significantly {{since the early}} 1990 s, but these programs could have unintended effects that harm the economic interests {{of the state and}} the nation. In particular, merit programs may inadvertently cause students to choose different college majors than they would have in the absence of merit aid. The U.S. has experienced increasing concern that the nation is producing too few graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. STEM graduates play an important role in creating new technologies that lead to new production processes and increased <b>productivity</b> (Winters, 2014 <b>a,</b> <b>b).</b> Producing too few STEM graduates could have very harmful economic effects for the nation and individual states.|$|R

Fusarium wilt disease of tomato caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici {{is one of the most}} devastating disease worldwide which causes yield reduction and affects tomato production (Hanaa et al. 2011). The fungal pathogen resides in the soil and causes infection to susceptible tomato plants by the roots throughout their course of development causing necrosis and inducing wilting of the plants at the later stages of their infection and reduces the yield and hence limits the overall economic <b>productivity</b> (El-khallal 2007 <b>a,</b> <b>b).</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} on {{the productivity of}} D 7 G Caterpillar tractors was carried out at a forest company in Jambi in 1985. Three tractors were selected randomly to be observed. The productivity of these tractors was collected through work time study. The purpose {{is to find the}} productivities of D 7 G Caterpillar tractors so that this information can be used by forest companies in planning skidding operations. This investigation results reveal that : 1. D 7 G Caterpillar tractors can be used to skid logs at dryland forests having easy and moderate topographies. At skidding distances ranuine from 75 - 535 m with an average of 324 m these tractors can skid logs having volumes ranging from 5. 01 - 16. 88 m 3 /trip with an average of 9. 08 m 3 /trip. 2. The average <b>productivities</b> of <b>A,</b> <b>B</b> and C skidding tractors were 59. 22, 89. 81 and 123. 69 m 8. hm/hour, respectively.

40|$|Heavy-ion {{irradiation}} {{technology has}} advantages over {{traditional methods of}} mutagenesis. Heavy-ion irradiation improves the mutation rate, broadens the mutation spectrum, and shortens the breeding cycle. However, few data are currently available regarding its effect on Streptomyces avermitilis morphology and productivity. In this study, the influence of heavy-ion irradiation on S. avermitilis when cultivated in approximately 10 [*]L stirred-tank bioreactors was investigated. The specific productivity of the avermectin (AVM) B 1 a-producing mutant S. avermitilis 147 -G 58 increased notably, from 3885 to 5446 [*]μg/mL, approximately 1. 6 -fold, compared to the original strain. The mycelial morphology of the mutant fermentation processes was microscopically examined. Additionally, protein and metabolite identification was performed by using SDS-PAGE, 2 - and 3 -dimensional electrophoresis (2 DE and 3 DE). The results showed that negative regulation gene deletion of mutants led to metabolic process upregulating expression of protein and improving the <b>productivity</b> of <b>an</b> avermectin <b>B</b> 1 <b>a.</b> The {{results showed that the}} heavy-ion beam irradiation dose that corresponded to optimal production was well over the standard dose, at approximately 80 [*]Gy at 220 AMeV (depending on the strain).

The MESMIS the methodological basis was chosen for model development and evaluation indicators.

40|$|The {{judicial}} appointments {{process has}} grown increasingly frustrating in recent years. Both sides claim that their candidates are the "most meritorious" {{and yet there}} is seldom any discussion of what constitutes merit. Instead, the discussion moves immediately to the candidates' likely positions on hot-button political issues like abortion, gun control, and the death penalty. One side (these days, the Republicans) claims that it is proposing certain candidates based on merit, while the other (the Democrats) claims that the real reason for pushing those candidates is their ideology and, in particular, their likely votes on certain key hot-button issues. With one side arguing merit and the other side arguing ideology, the two sides talk past each other and the end result is often an impasse. To get past the impasse, we propose placing judges in a tournament based on relatively objective measures of judicial merit and <b>productivity.</b> <b>A</b> tournament allows the public to test the politicians' claims of merit. Being able to test those claims helps make transparent the occasions on which the real debate is over ideology. It is harder to disguise a purely ideological candidate as the best from a "merit" standpoint when the candidate performs poorly relative to many other judges based on objective factors. Once merit-based arguments have been isolated (or at least reduced in scope) to factors related to the tournament, {{it should be possible to}} have a transparent and meaningful debate over ideology. The Article runs such a tournament using data on opinions authored by active federal circuit court judges from one common time period: the beginning of 1998 to the end of 2000.
