50|$|The first, and oldest, is that rights {{transferred}} to a voluntary association are held by the current members of the association as joint tenants or tenants in common. This has the result that the member can receive {{his or her own}} share (allowing for severance in the case of joint tenants) irrespective of the other members. In Bowman v Secular Society this construction was even applied to a gift given to be applied for the general purposes of the association. It is difficult to imagine, however, that this construction would be correctly applied {{in the case of a}} philanthropic society where construing the gift as one to the members would contradict its stated purpose. There is also the possibility that the gift is to the current and future members of the society, which, by operation of the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964 will operate for the benefit of those members within the <b>perpetuity</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{rule against}} perpetuities, more specifically, the rule against {{remoteness}} of vesting, invalidates future property interests {{which do not}} become effective within a defined &# 039;perpetuity period&# 039;. The rule also invalidates powers possessed by people to dispose of other&# 039;s property if those powers can be exercised outside the <b>perpetuity</b> <b>period.</b> Powers to appoint trust property conferred on most discretionary trustees are potentially invalid for this reason. The lifetimes of discretionary trusts must be limited to applicable perpetuity periods as modified by statute. Unit trusts are superficially similar. Powers for trustees and/or the responsible entities of unit trusts to issue new units or redeem existing units are often thought to be perpetuitous by analogy. The assumption is denied here. Arguing from functional as well as doctrinal perspectives, the author concludes that the rule against perpetuities has no application to unit trusts...|$|E

40|$|Australian {{adoption}} of {{international accounting standards}} from 1 July 2005 has {{had a number of}} unintended consequences. When unit trust deeds have "buy-back" provisions, operative on pre-determined vesting days, international accounting standards re-classify units in those trusts as "debt" rather than "equity" interests. Responsible entities of managed investment schemes structured as unit trusts are among those affected. Unit buy-back provisions operative on vesting day are a common feature of scheme constitutions because of the widely-held belief that unit trusts are void unless they vest within a period defined by the rule against perpetuities. This article examines that belief and concludes that the rule against perpetuities does not generally affect Australian unit trusts. Attempts to elude the perpetuities rule are then reviewed. An apparently insuperable problem involving unit trusts and perpetuities in the conflict of laws is identified. Mutually inconsistent <b>perpetuity</b> <b>periods</b> may apply to unit trusts which hold real property in several jurisdictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{rule against}} {{remoteness}} of vesting, {{otherwise known as}} the modern rule against perpetuities, has few admirers these days. Within universities, property law teachers conscientiously discharge their obligation to explain, as clearly as possible, this infamously abstruse rule. Mystified students struggle to comprehend it- motivated solely by a potent (although usually unfounded) fear {{that it will be}} assessed. Beyond law school, the rule against perpetuities is regarded by many practitioners as an anachronism - a lingering remnant of 18 th century property law invariably circumvented by the stipulation of a statutory <b>perpetuity</b> <b>period.</b> Each Australian jurisdiction has implemented legislative reforms to simplify the rule and ameliorate its operation. However, it is submitted that these reforms have had only limited success and, indeed, have sometimes compounded the problems. This chapter briefly examines three key areas of concern and puts a case for undertaking coordinated legislative reforms to produce consistent and workable perpetuity laws throughout Australia...|$|E
40|$|The public {{pension system}} in Germany allows early {{retirement}} albeit {{at the cost}} of pension deductions. Deductions are calculated under the assumption that life expectancy is indepen-dent of the age of retirement and apply equally for men and women. The "fair" amount of deductions is currently debated, the general feeling being that they are too low. In this paper we show that remaining lifetime and thus the <b>perpetuity</b> <b>period</b> vary with the age of retirement. In a survival analysis using micro data from the German Pension Insurance, we find that remaining life expectancy of men at age 65 receiving old-age pensions with age 60 to 66 is up to 1. 9 years higher if retirement occurred later. For women, instead, life expec-tancy is almost independent of retirement age. Extending the analysis to invalidity pensioners (they receive pensions before the age of 60), we find that men and women reaching the age of 65 have a more than 3 years lower remaining life expectancy than old-age pensioners on average. Many other variables, like residence (West and East Germany), lifetime wage in-come and number of children are considered, too. In a simple model we finally calculate and compare actuarial deductions under the alternative assumptions of constant and age-of-retirement dependent life expectancy. The main conclusion is that deductions currently in law are too high for very early retirees (below age 63) and too low for all others.

40|$|After {{years of}} debate, {{perpetuity}} reform is still controversial. To be sure, there is agreement among {{virtually all of}} the commentators and experts in the field that the Rule Against Perpetuities is in need of reform. The disagreement, on the surface, centers on the methods of reform to be employed. At least three basic methods have been advanced: (1) specific statutory repair of discrete problem areas; (2) reformation; and (3) wait-and-see. Each method has its sponsors, and each has {{in one form or another}} been adopted as part of the law of a few states. These methods are not mutually exclusive, and some of the states have combined more than one of them in their statutes. The most controversial of the reform methods is wait-and-see, which posits that a perpetuity violation should only occur if an interest actually remains contingent beyond the <b>perpetuity</b> <b>period.</b> The controversy surrounding the wait-and-see concept was rekindled when the American Law Institute adopted it as part of the Restatement (Second) of Property,I only a few years after the 1971 decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Pearson Estate 2 misapplied an already inadequate statutory formulation of the concept. The wait-and-see controversy has, over the years, centered on the problem of the concept 2 ̆ 7 s workability - specifically, the uncertainty over how the measuring lives are to be determined. Although the workability of wait-and-see and of the other methods of reform is an important matter, and is one that will be addressed in this Article, the main attention here has a rather different focus. For underlying the debate over the methods of reform lurks a largely unarticulated and perhaps largely unrecognized issue: Should reform reach all perpetuity violations or be restricted to those that fall into discrete problem areas? With respect to the discrete problem areas, which in this Article are termed technical violation categories, the Rule defeats dispositions that are reasonable: The Rule violations rest on such unlikely possibilities as an elderly woman having additional children or the probate of an estate taking more than twenty-one years to complete. The original case for perpetuity reform, indeed the only case for reform that has been systematically presented, argues from the technical violation categories and rests on the Rule 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 harshness 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 illogicality 2 ̆ 2 in defeating such reasonable dispositions. This case is an argument for reversing the invalidity in the technical violation categories, but not for interfering with the normal operation of the Rule in all cases of perpetuity violation. Since the invalidity in the technical violation cases is so easily reversed by the specific statutory repair method of reform, it is a great curiosity that wait-and-see - the method of reform most ardently advocated - interferes with the normal operation of the Rule in all cases of violation. Part of the controversy surrounding the wait-and-see method may at bottom be traceable to this discrepancy. The theme of this Article is that there is a respectable case for intercession in all cases of perpetuity violation. The case is grounded upon and is in fact an application of the theme of another article that John Langbein and I recently co-authored, entitled Reformation of Wills on the Ground of Mistake: Change of Direction in American Law? 3 Pointing to the long-recognized reformation doctrine for nonprobate transfers, that article advocates the forthright adoption of a similar doctrine for wills. Cases of well-proven mistake of law or fact in the formulation of the terms of gratuitous transfers invoke the fundamental principle of equity jurisprudence: preventing unjust enrichment. If mistakes are not corrected, unintended takers are enriched at the expense of the intended beneficiaries. In one respect, the application of this idea to the perpetuity area is easier than in the generalized cases of mistake that are the main focus of attention in the earlier article. Extrinsic evidence is hardly necessary to show that a perpetuity violation is the product of a mistake, but such evidence is frequently necessary to prove a mistake in other cases. The application of the prevention-of-unjust-enrichment idea to the perpetuity area is easier, though more subtle, in another respect. Preventing unjust enrichment in generalized cases of mistake requires an open-ended remedy of reformation, to be applied by courts on an ad hoc basis. Because perpetuity violations are relatively homogeneous, the method to be applied in the correction of the mistake can take a common and hence more automatic form. It need not, in fact, be framed overtly as a method of correcting a mistake but can be cast as a legislative reformulation of the Rule Against Perpetuities itself. This approach will be effective as long as it is understood that correction of mistake is the underlying objective of the reformulation, so that the reformulation is shaped by the legislature and administered by the courts in accordance with that objective. Part I of this Article examines the common law Rule and identifies a paradox in the Rule 2 ̆ 7 s operation: The requirement of initial certainty, which is the Rule 2 ̆ 7 s central test of validity, is both the culprit that defeats reasonable dispositions in the technical-violation categories and the hero that makes the common law Rule workable. Part II details the discrete categories of technical violations and the specific statutory repair method of perpetuity reform that is designed to eliminate them. Part III examines the two basic methods of perpetuity reform that interfere with the normal operation of the Rule in all cases of Rule violation - reformation and wait-and-see. As we will see, some versions of both methods comport with the objective of preventing unjust enrichment of unintended takers at the expense of the intended beneficiaries. Unfortunately, until quite recently no American jurisdiction had adopted any of these versions. At long last, one state - Iowa - within the past few months enacted a statute that accords with the prevention-of-unjust-enrichment objective. 4 The details of the new Iowa statute will be noted in Part III...|$|E

5000|$|The White Cloud Temple {{was first}} {{founded in the}} mid-8th century during the Tang dynasty, and was {{initially}} called Tianchang Abbey (天長觀; Abbey of Celestial <b>Perpetuity).</b> During this <b>period,</b> the abbey was state-sponsored and staffed by an elite clergy. From 1125 to 1215 when what is now Beijing was controlled by the Jin dynasty, the abbey served as the Daoist administrative headquarters and {{played an important role}} in state ceremonies. After Beijing was taken by the Mongols in 1215, the abbey was taken over by the Quanzhen patriarch Qiu Chuji, and became the headquarters of the Quanzhen movement until the establishment of the Ming dynasty. Qiu renamed the abbey Changchun Gong (長春宮; Palace of Eternal Spring). In October 1222, Qiu gave his exposition of Daoism to Genghis Khan after a three-year trek from Shandong Province after being summoned. [...] Qiu's successor, Yin Zhiping (尹志平; 1169-1251) built a memorial shrine over Qiu's grave. This shrine became a temple in its own right called White Cloud Temple. The abbey was damaged when the Mongols took over in the late 13th century, and during the Ming dynasty the Changchun Gong disappeared. However, White Cloud Temple survived and took over the functions of Changchun Gong. During the Ming dynasty, monks from the Zhengyi school took over operations of the abbey, but continued Quanzhen traditions and ordination ceremonies. Zhengyi control over the temple continued until the 17th century, when their monopoly ended and the Quanzhen master Wang Changyue (王常月; ?-1680) took over. To this day, White Cloud Temple remains Quanzhen controlled. During the 20th century, the abbey was without an abbot for the 1940s, and was closed when the Communists came to power in 1949. Unlike many other historical sites which were damaged during the Cultural Revolution, White Cloud Temple was well-protected and remained safe. Today it is again a fully functioning temple and is the seat of the Chinese Daoist Association.|$|R
