40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of tribological investigations conducted on steel 20 with the carbon content of up to 0. 2 %. The steel was studied in the three conditions: initial (hot-rolled), after heat-treatment (quenching+tempering) and after heat treatment with subsequent severe plastic deformation (SPD) performed by equal channel angular pressing technique (ECAP). It was stated that after various treatments the material acquires various structural conditions and possesses various strength properties and has a considerable difference in oxygen content in the surface layer. This influences the tribological properties during the contact with tool steel. The lowest values of adhesive bond shear strength, friction coefficient and wear rate are demonstrated in the material after martempering with subsequent SPD by ECAP technique. The surface of the investigated material after SPD treatment by the ECAP technique <b>possesses</b> <b>a</b> highest <b>bearing</b> capacity and requires more time for wearing-in in friction assemblies. Oxygen content increase in the form of metal oxides on the surface of low-carbon steels is accompanied by a decrease of the adhesive component of friction coefficien...|$|R
50|$|After {{stealing}} a bracelet from the Louvre that bears the same symbol as a coin {{left behind by}} his father, Raphael encounters a girl named Marie who <b>possesses</b> <b>a</b> violin <b>bearing</b> the same symbol. However, she is being chased by a man claiming to be Napoleon, who demands an item known as the 'Dragon Crown.' Phantom R saves Marie and they visit Notre Dame where they recover the Dragon Crown for themselves. Phantom R also meets Jean-François, who serves as Marie's guardian at her convent. Phantom R visits Napoleon's underground hideout where he learns of someone working for Napoleon referred to as 'Graf' who Phantom R believes is his father. In order to further find clues about his father, and Napoleon, Phantom R visits the Paris Opera, and steals the 'Queen's Pendant' from Duchess Elisabeth. Marie also visits the opera, as Jean-François believes that Elisabeth is her mother. However, Elisabeth promptly denies this, and Marie runs off crying. Phantom R narrowly dodges arrest and takes Marie back to his flat where he reveals the true reason behind his acts of theft. His father, Isaac, was a forger and Phantom R was returning the true paintings hidden in his apartment.|$|R

50|$|Practice pad {{implements}} can {{be constructed}} {{in a variety of}} shapes and sizes, and by typical design, may be adequately compact (thin) and lightweight for ease in transport. Many variances include harder or softer playing surfaces, non-skid bases (that can also double as muted playing surfaces), receivers affixed to or embedded on{{to the base of the}} implement to allow for attachment to existing percussion hardware, a cymbal stand thread or snare drum stand for example. Modification to the base of the device can be fashioned to rest affixed via a strap to the player’s knee. A simulation of snare-drum-style resonance can be implied via various hardware features added to the implement. These devices can be placed on a myriad of surfaces, including directly onto the top batter head of an actual 14” snare drum or other drum (one <b>possessing</b> <b>a</b> true rim <b>bearing</b> <b>a</b> diameter greater than the total span of the base of the device), which, when struck, could have the added effect of transferring to the drum’s natural snare-side response along with severely muting the sound of the drum.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{release of}} heavy metal-containing {{nanoparticles}} (NP) {{into the environment}} may be harmful to the efficacy of beneficial microbes that function in element cycling, pollutant degradation and plant growth. Nanoparticles of Ag, CuO and ZnO are of interest as antimicrobials against pathogenic bacteria. We demonstrate here their antimicrobial activity against the beneficial soil microbe, Pseudomonas putida KT 2440. Results Toxicity was detected in a KT 2440 construct <b>possessing</b> <b>a</b> plasmid <b>bearing</b> the luxAB reporter genes. "As manufactured" preparations of nano- Ag, -CuO and -ZnO caused rapid dose-dependent loss of light output in the biosensor. Cell death accompanied loss in Lux activity with treatments by nano-Ag and -CuO, but with -ZnO the treatments were bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. Bulk equivalents of these products showed no inhibitory activity, indicating that particle size was determinant in activity. Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (FlFFF) of an aqueous suspension of the nano-CuO and ZnO revealed {{a small proportion of}} 5 nm NP and aggregated particulates with sizes ranging between 70 nm and 300 nm; the majority portion of material was aggregated into particles larger than 300 nm in size. Thus within the commercial preparation there may be microbially active and inactive forms. Conclusion The "as-made" NP of Ag, CuO and ZnO have toxic effects on a beneficial soil microbe, leading to bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects depending on the NP employed. The lack of toxicity from bulk materials suggests that aggregation of the NP into larger particles, possibly by factors present in the environment may reduce their nontarget antimicrobial activity. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Sir John Cary {{appears to}} have been seated at the chief ancestral seat of Cary, the {{location}} of which is uncertain, by some sources said to be Castle Cary in Somerset, elsewhere said to be somewhere in Devon. According to the Devon biographer John Prince (died 1723), relying on Risdon, the estate of Cary was in the parish of St Giles in the Heath, Devon, on the border with Cornwall. The Devon historian Tristram Risdon (died 1640) stated the village of St Giles in the Heath to be [...] "Hemmed in with the Tamer River on the one side and a pretty brook called Cary on the other; whereof (if I conceive not amiss) the sirname of the Carys took beginning, for in this parish that family <b>possessed</b> <b>an</b> ancient dwelling <b>bearing</b> their name". He purchased the manor of Clovelly, on the north coast of Devon, where a junior branch of his descendants was seated until 1739 when it was sold to Zachary Hamlyn (1677-1759) [...] His son and heir Robert Cary is generally stated to have been the first of the family seated at Cockington, on the south coast of Devon in Torbay. He also held a moiety of the manor of Great Torrington, Devon, possibly inherited from his heiress mother's family, de Bryan, which had inherited a one-fifth moiety of the feudal barony of Great Torrington from the Sully family.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of type 2 parainfluenza virus in HeLa and stable human amnion cells was examined {{by use of}} antisera labeled with fluorescein and ferritin. Serum containing antibody predominantly to soluble viral antigen gave specific fluorescence which was first detectable in small cytoplasmic foci 8 to 10 hr after initiation of infection. By 20 to 24 hr, when the production of infective virus and hemagglutinin was maximal, large perinuclear aggregates of fluorescence were observed which corresponded in distribution and time of appearance to the eosinophilic inclusions seen in similar preparations stained with azure eosin. The inclusions, examined by electron microscopy, were composed of fibrils, presumably viral ribonucleoprotein, which specifically bound the antibody labeled with ferritin. With antiserum to concentrated virus, on the other hand, specific fluorescence was most marked at the surface of infected cells. Foci of fluorescence at the surface represented segments of membrane which had become differentiated morphologically and antigenically to resemble the viral envelope. These were the sites where mature virions appeared. The latter exhibited marked pleomorphism; in some instances, particles were formed which lacked recognizable internal fibrils but which <b>possessed</b> <b>an</b> enclosing membrane <b>bearing</b> viral antigen. Filamentous forms showing an organized internal structure were also observed at the cell surface, but were never encountered in negatively stained preparations. No clear relationship between these filaments and the spherical or oval forms could be established.
