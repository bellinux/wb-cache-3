5|$|Though sound-on-film would {{eventually}} become the universal standard for synchronized sound cinema, Lauste never successfully exploited his innovations, {{which came to}} an effective dead end. In 1914, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt was granted German patent 309,536 for his sound-on-film work; that same year, he apparently demonstrated a film made with the process {{to an audience of}} scientists in Berlin. Hungarian engineer Denes Mihaly submitted his sound-on-film Projectofon concept to the Royal Hungarian <b>Patent</b> <b>Court</b> in 1918; the patent award was published four years later. Whether sound was captured on cylinder, disc, or film, none of the available technology was adequate for big-league commercial purposes, and for many years the heads of the major Hollywood film studios saw little benefit in producing sound motion pictures.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from the}} tabards, the heralds also wear scarlet court uniforms with gold {{embroidery}} during formal events; with white breeches and stockings for coronations and black {{for all other}} times together with black <b>patent</b> <b>court</b> shoes with gold buckles (the Scottish heralds wear black wool serge military style trousers with wide gold oak leaf lace on the side seams and black patent ankle boots; or for women, a long black skirt). The heralds are also entitled to distinctive sceptres, which have been a symbol of their office since the Tudor period. In 1906 new sceptres were made, most likely the initiative of Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty. These {{take the form of}} short black batons with gilded ends, each with a representation of the badges of the different offices of the heralds. In 1953 these were replaced by white staves, with gilded metal handles and at its head a blue dove in a golden coronet or a [...] "martinet". These blue martinets are derived from the arms of the College. Another of the heralds' insignia of office is the Collar of SS, which they wear over their uniforms. During inclement weather, a large black cape is worn. At state funerals, they would wear a wide sash of black silk sarsenet over their tabards (in ancient times, they would have worn long black hooded cloaks under their tabards).|$|E

In this respect we draw a number of conclusions about the types of claims brought, and by whom, as well as the value of the patents litigated and the case outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The {{recent years}} have seen a {{tremendous}} growth in research and developments in science and technology, and an emphasis in obtaining Intellectual Property (IP) protection for one’s innovations.

Although {{a great deal of}} legal and scientific information is now available online, the scattered distribution of the information, combined with the enormous sizes and complexities, makes any attempt to gather relevant IP-related information on a specific technology a daunting task. This paper describes a knowledge-based software framework to facilitate retrieval of patents and related information across multiple diverse and uncoordinated information sources in the US patent system.

50|$|The Unified <b>Patent</b> <b>Court</b> is a {{proposed}} court, common to several member {{states of the}} European Union, including Germany, France and the UK. Once it enters into force it will have jurisdiction regarding European patents as any national court would do.

For the latter patents, the Unified <b>Patent</b> <b>Court</b> will generally have exclusive competence.
