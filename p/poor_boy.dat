5|$|After soccer practice, Bart {{waits for}} Homer {{to pick him}} up, though his father has forgotten. When Homer finally remembers, he reasons to an angered Bart that they should just both admit they are wrong and try to put the issue behind them. Later, Bart views a {{commercial}} for a mentor program called The Bigger Brothers, which pairs up fatherless boys with positive male role models. Still angry at Homer, Bart goes to the agency {{pretending to be a}} young boy whose father was a drunken gambler who abandoned him. Bart's story is so sad that the receptionist pairs him up with their best Bigger Brother, a military test pilot named Tom. The two spend time together doing a variety of activities, though Bart begins to feel guilty over taking up Tom's time despite not actually being fatherless. Eventually, Homer finds out about Bart's Bigger Brother and confronts Bart for it. Homer then decides to go to the Bigger Brothers Agency to get revenge by being assigned with a replacement son; a young <b>poor</b> <b>boy</b> named Pepi. Just like Tom and Bart, Homer and Pepi spend time together doing activities.|$|E
25|$|In those days, {{there was}} such a mad rush for {{learning}} English and the opportunities were so limited that young boys used to run alongside David Hare’s palanquin, pleading “Me <b>poor</b> <b>boy,</b> have pity on me, me take in your school.” The number of aspirants were so many that David Hare could hardly do anything much.|$|E

This article draws on original research to explore the failure to tackle the exclusion of <b>poor</b> <b>boys</b> from school, arguing that paid work has become more attractive in {{a context in which}} education is of poor quality and there are no social sanctions against child labour. Recently there has been a shift of policy attention towards <b>poor</b> <b>boys,</b> amidst concerns about security, militancy and Islamic education. Given steady economic growth, <b>poor</b> <b>boys</b> may not necessarily inherit deeper poverty, but in the absence of state or social sanctions against child labour, they are likely to inherit a position {{at the lower end of}} the social scale...|$|R

25|$|In the 19th {{and earlier}} 20th century, Welby {{was part of}} the rural deanery of Grantham North, and archdeaconry and Diocese of Lincoln.

In 1824 Rev'd William Dodwell bequeathed to the parish £1,608 11s. 6d., with the bank annuities of 2½ per cent to be used {{for the benefit of the}} poor. £15 of the yearly dividend was given to the schoolmaster for the education of six boys and six girls, and £10 for the apprenticing of a <b>poor</b> <b>boy,</b> with the remainder to provide clothing and coal to poor parishioners. From 1867 the rector was Rev. William Armetriding Frith MA, of Worcester College, Oxford, and from 1926, the Rev. Thomas Augustus Child BD, of London University.|$|E
25|$|One of Attiya's {{greatest}} accomplishments {{was changing}} the way that yeshiva education was viewed in the Sephardic world. Until that time, full-time Torah learning {{past the age of}} bar mitzvah was reserved for gifted students from Sephardic homes; most Sephardic boys went to work to help support their families. Attiya did everything he could to enable boys to continue learning into their teens, many times offering to underwrite the costs of their education. In one case, a <b>poor</b> <b>boy</b> from Iraq applied for admission to the yeshiva but could not provide the necessary tuition. Attiya went to Rabbi Ben Zion Chazan, the yeshiva's founder and secretary, and offered to reduce his own salary to accommodate the boy. Rabbi Chazan then offered to reduce his own salary as well. The boy {{went on to become a}} respected talmid chacham.|$|E

25|$|Chocolate {{has been}} the center of several {{successful}} book and film adaptations. In 1964, Roald Dahl published a children's novel titled Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The novel centers on a <b>poor</b> <b>boy</b> named Charlie Bucket who takes a tour through the greatest chocolate factory in the world, owned by Willy Wonka. Two film adaptations of the novel were produced. The first was Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, a 1971 film which later became a cult classic, and spawned the real world Willy Wonka Candy Company, which produces chocolate products to this day. Thirty-four years later, a second film adaptation was produced, titled Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The 2005 film was very well received by critics {{and was one of}} the highest-grossing films that year, earning over US$470,000,000 worldwide. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was also recognized at the 78th Academy Awards, where it was nominated for Best Costume Design for Gabriella Pesucci.|$|E
25|$|For {{many of the}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of people who visit Graceland each year, the visit takes on a quasi-religious perspective. They may plan for years to journey to the home of the ‘King’ of rock and roll. On site, headphones narrate the salient events of Elvis’s life and introduce the relics that adorn the rooms and corridors. The rhetorical mode is hagiographic, celebrating the life of an extraordinary man, emphasizing his generosity, his kindness and good fellowship, how he was at once a <b>poor</b> <b>boy</b> who made good, an extraordinary musical talent, a sinner and substance abuser, and a religious man devoted to the Gospel and its music. At the meditation garden, containing Elvis’s grave, some visitors pray, kneel, or quietly sing one of Elvis’s favorite hymns. The brick wall that encloses the mansion's grounds is covered with graffiti that express an admiration for the singer as well as petitions for help and thanks for favors granted.|$|E
25|$|The School {{was kept}} clean by the labour of 'a <b>poor</b> <b>boy</b> of the said School' who was paid 4 pence {{annually}} {{by each of}} his fellows; normal repairs were {{paid for by the}} town; the town also added a further £10 to the School's annual income, but when that income had to be divided between the Headmaster and the Usher (who took the younger boys) it was naturally difficult to find and still more so to keep good masters. In 1635, for instance, the School contained only six boys. The reason for the long Headmasterships of Rev. Richard Cornes from 1677 to 1726 and of Rev. Hugh Stackhouse from 1726 to 1743 was that they were both also incumbents of St Mary's Church. Rev. Stackhouse bequeathed to the Bridgnorth his collection of theological books and his memory is preserved {{in the name of the}} Stackhouse Library, the octagonal brick building with a dome, built on the northeast side of St Leonard's Church to house the collection of books which he had begun, and by a marble tablet over the building's fireplace. After 1766 no Usher was appointed; but the emoluments could not now support even a single master unless he could attract boarders to the School. Distinguished eighteenth century alumni of the School include Bishop Thomas Percy, Bishop of Dromore and author of Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, Sir John Josiah Guest, the engineer, entrepreneur and Member of Parliament, Dr Thomas Beddoes, the physician and scientific writer, and Dr William Macmichael, physician to Kings George IV and William IV and author of The Gold-Headed Cane.|$|E

500|$|Nijinsky's genius as {{a dancer}} would {{translate}} {{into the role of}} ballet-master; he was not dissuaded when Nijinsky's first attempt at choreography, Debussy's L'après-midi d'un faune, caused controversy and near-scandal because of the dancer's novel stylised movements and his overtly sexual gesture at the work's end. It is apparent from contemporary correspondence that, at least initially, Stravinsky viewed Nijinsky's talents as a choreographer with approval; a letter he sent to Findeyzen praises the dancer's [...] "passionate zeal and complete self-effacement". However, in his 1936 memoirs Stravinsky writes that the decision to employ Nijinsky in this role filled him with apprehension; although he admired Nijinsky {{as a dancer}} he had no confidence in him as a choreographer: [...] "...the <b>poor</b> <b>boy</b> knew nothing of music. He could neither read it nor play any instrument". Later still, Stravinsky would ridicule Nijinsky's dancing maidens as [...] "knock-kneed and long-braided Lolitas".|$|E

500|$|The Danish {{sociologist}} Benedikte Brincker {{observes that}} {{the perception of}} Nielsen and his music in his home country is rather different from his international appreciation. His interest and background in folk music had special resonance for Danes, and this was intensified during the nationalistic movements of the 1930s and during World War II, when singing was an important basis for the Danes to distinguish themselves from their German enemies. Nielsen's songs retain an important place in Danish culture and education. The musicologist Niels Krabbe describes the popular image of Nielsen in Denmark as being like [...] "the ugly duckling syndrome" [...] – {{a reference to the}} tale of the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen – [...] whereby [...] "a <b>poor</b> <b>boy...</b> passing through adversity and frugality... marches into Copenhagen and... comes to conquer the position as the uncrowned King". Thus while outside Denmark Nielsen is largely thought of as the composer of orchestral music and the opera Maskarade, in his own country he is more of a national symbol. These two sides were officially brought together in Denmark in 2006 when the Ministry of Culture issued a list of the twelve greatest Danish musical works, which included three by Nielsen – Maskarade, the Fourth Symphony, and a pair of his Danish songs. Krabbe asks the rhetorical question: [...] "Can 'the national' in Nielsen be demonstrated in the music in the form of particular themes, harmonies, sounds, forms, etc., or is it a pure construct of reception history?" ...|$|E
