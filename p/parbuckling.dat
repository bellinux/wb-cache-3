60|$|Parbuckling.--A round log or {{a barrel}} should be rolled, not dragged; and many irregularly-shaped objects may have bundles of faggots lashed round them, {{by which they}} become {{barrel-shaped}} and fit to be rolled. In these cases, <b>parbuckling</b> doubles the ease of rolling them; one or more ropes have one of each of their ends made fast in the direction to which the log has to be rolled, while the other is carried underneath the log, round it, and back again. By pulling at these free ends, the log will be rolled on. An equivalent plan, {{and in some cases}} a more practicable one, is to make fast one end of the rope to the log itself; then, winding the rope two or three times round it, like cotton on a reel, to haul at the free end as before. Horses can be used, as well as men, for this work.|$|E

5000|$|Parbuckle salvage, or <b>parbuckling,</b> is the righting of {{a sunken}} vessel using {{rotational}} leverage.

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} {{they were on the}} deck of the Spartane. It was a scene of {{extraordinary}} activity. The lower mast had already been <b>parbuckled</b> on to the deck, where sheer-legs had been erected by another party. The mast was soon in its place, and the wedges driven in, the shrouds had been shortened, and men were engaged in tightening the lanyards. The topmast was on deck ready to be hoisted. The carpenters were busy constructing a temporary rudder with a long spar, to one end of which planks were being fixed, so that it looked like a gigantic paddle. As soon as this was completed, the other end of the spar was lashed to the taffrail. Strong hawsers were then to be fastened to the paddle, and brought in one on each quarter and attached to the drum of the wheel.|$|R
60|$|The sailors had now {{caught the}} idea, and very soon {{they had the}} gun tightly packed into its novel carriage. Two long ropes were then passed round the puncheon, the ends being carried a little way up the hill. This formed a <b>parbuckle,</b> and when the men hauled upon the upper lengths of the ropes the cask easily rolled up {{to the ends of}} the lower lengths. This {{operation}} was repeated again and again, and gradually the cask moved up the rock. At places it had to be hauled up lengthways, boards being placed underneath it to give it a smooth surface over which to glide instead of the rough rock, and men encouraging it from behind with levers. While they were at work Nelson came up and stood watching them for some minutes without speaking.|$|R
50|$|While the {{mechanical}} advantage {{used by the}} laborer to parbuckle a cask up an incline is 2:1, <b>parbuckling</b> salvage is not so limited. Each of the 21 winches used to roll the Oklahoma used cables that passed through two 17-part tackle assemblies (17:1 advantage).

60|$|No sooner was the spar {{alongside}} than {{a couple}} of sailors lowered themselves down and passed ropes round it. These ropes were then passed through blocks and taken to the capstan. The bars were fitted and seized by a dozen men. The boatswain's whistle sounded, and starting their anchor song the men tramped round and round, the ropes tightened, and the heavy spar was <b>parbuckled</b> up on to the deck. No sooner was it got on board than the four chiefs who had before visited the ship came alongside. There was another talk, and they were presented with a considerable number of presents for themselves and followers as a reward for their service in sending off the spar. Mr. Atherton and Wilfrid did not approach the group of passengers round the chiefs, keeping their attention vigilantly upon the boats, from which the danger, if it existed, would come.|$|R
50|$|Cask beer is the {{traditional}} method of service, via a hand pump or by gravity straight from the cask on stillage. Cask conditioned beer is unfiltered, unpasteurized and lacking artificial carbonation (the bubbles are produced by the ongoing fermentation), giving it a limited shelf-life. This dispense method is strongly associated with ale, {{although there is no}} technical barrier to serving lager or stout this way. Most pubs use hand pumps ("beer engines") to draw the beer, whereas stillages are commonly employed at beer festivals. Cask ale and bottle conditioned beer are championed by the Campaign for Real Ale under the name real ale. Prior to stainless steel casks, beer was delivered in large wooden barrels, which were delivered to the cellar via a trap-door on the footpath using two ropes wound about the barrels midriff (a <b>parbuckle)</b> to lower the barrel gently down the cellar's ramp. They then had to stand on their sides for a few days so the sediment would settle {{to the bottom of the}} belly of the barrel, after which they would be 'tapped' by punching the pre-cut centre of the (traditionally cork) bung (at the lower edge of the barrel end) into the barrel by hitting the tapered brass 'tap' with a mallet. One could then attach the pipe connector onto the tap, so that the cellarman could turn the tap on when ready. In a similar manner, one would punch through the centre of a bung on the upper side of the barrel's belly with a hardwood spile (tapered peg). The hardwood spile prevents air access. Once the barrel is in use, the spile is replaced with a 'soft' spile, traditionally made from softwood, but nowadays from bonded-together (woody) fibres. The soft spile prevents a vacuum forming at the upper surface of the beer: it allows sufficient air in for the beer engine to work, but keeps dust, flies and other mischief-makers out.|$|R
5000|$|On 17 September 2013, Costa Concordia {{was brought}} to a {{vertical}} position through a <b>parbuckling</b> procedure. The cost for salvaging the ship increased to $799 million. [...] In addition, the ship had suffered severe hull deformations in two places. Titan Salvage, the company directing the salvage operations, estimated that {{the next phase of}} the salvage operation would be completed by early-to-mid-2014. After this [...] "floating" [...] operation, the ship would be towed to a salvage yard on the Italian mainland for scrapping or [...] "breaking".|$|E
50|$|Preparatory work {{consisted}} of building an underwater metal platform and artificial seabed made {{of sand and}} cement on the downhill side of the wreck and welding sponsons {{to the side of}} the ship above the surface. Once this was completed, the ship was pulled upright by cables over the course of two days and settled on the platform, a method called <b>parbuckling.</b> Additional sponsons would then be attached to the other side of the ship; both sets would be flushed of water and their buoyancy would refloat the ship to allow her to be towed away, probably for demolition.|$|E

50|$|Preparations for righting the {{overturned}} hull took under {{eight months}} to complete. Twenty-one derricks {{were attached to}} the upturned hull; each carried high-tensile steel cables that were connected to hydraulic winching machines ashore. The righting (<b>parbuckling)</b> operation began on 8 March and was completed by 16 June 1943. Teams of naval specialists then entered the previously submerged ship to remove any additional human remains. Cofferdams were then placed around the hull to allow basic repairs to be undertaken so that the ship could be refloated; this work was completed by November. On 28 December, Oklahoma was towed into dry dock No. 2 at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Once in the dock, her main guns, machinery, and remaining ammunition and stores were removed. The severest structural damage on the hull was also repaired to make the ship watertight.|$|E
5000|$|... "Purbuckling" [...] (or <b>parbuckling)</b> {{can be used}} to lift a {{casualty}} from the water up a vertical surface such as a high sided boat, pontoon or a jetty. For a 1.5 metre lift, a length of rope of at least 4 metres / 13 feet is needed. The casualty is brought horizontally alongside. A rescuer in the water with the casualty takes the loop of rope under the casualty and passes it back to two rescuers {{at the top of the}} vertical face. The loop of rope is positioned so that in passes outside the arms between the shoulder and elbow and around the outside of the legs between the knee and the hip. The two rescuers on land secure the end of the loop that they control by standing heavily on it with one foot. They both pull on the central part of the loop rolling the casualty up the surface taking care to co-ordinate the tension so that the casualty remains horizontal and that the rope remains in position on the casualty's arms and thighs. A rescuer should take care that the casualty's head and neck are not injured during the lift.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operation}} (from June 2013 onwards) was delineated by Costa's Cristiano De Musso, Head of Corporate Communications, {{according to}} the following plan:* Site inspections {{of the ship and}} its position;* Securing of the wreck to ensure on-going safety and stability;* Installation of sponsons on port side of vessel and construction of submarine platforms;* <b>Parbuckling</b> of the wreck, rotating it past a critical angle of about 24° from its resting position, beyond which the sponsons would be flooded and the ship would roll into a fully upright position on the underwater platforms;* Installation of sponsons on the starboard side of the ship;* Sponsons are dewatered to raise the ship from the bottom;* Ship delivered to an Italian port for processing according to regulations;* Cleaning and replanting of marine flora. By 20 February 2012, the tanks in the forward part of the ship, which had held about two-thirds of the fuel, had been emptied, but the following day defuelling was suspended because of poor weather conditions. On 3 March 2012, salvage workers cut a hole in the ship for access to the engine room, the location of the remaining fuel. On the morning of 12 March, defuelling operations resumed and were completed on 24 March.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effort to}} salvage Oglala began on 12 December 1941. The {{first attempt to}} refloat her by blowing {{compressed}} air into her hull proved to be ineffective. Several plans for her future were considered including floating her enough to drag her ashore. Once on dry land, she would be dismantled. After a reexamination of the situation, a plan was formulated to raise and refit her. By the early spring of 1942 the salvage operation was underway. It was decided that using ten [...] submarine salvage pontoons in concert with anchor chains and the aforementioned air bubble technique to right her. The salvage effort was complex work, with the inherent difficulties of righting and refloating a capsized ship compounded by Oglalas poor stability. Fifteen to eighteen divers were kept busy for nearly 2000 underwater hours during the salvage, patching her hull, rigging chains, cutting away unwanted structure and executing many other tasks. After her tophamper had been removed, the salvage pontoons were used to pull the ship upright while air was pumped into her to lighten the load. The <b>parbuckling,</b> or righting attempt, was begun on 11 April 1942, on 22 April, the crane barge Gaylord, of the Hawaiian Dredging Company, was rigged to Oglala to pull her over, if needed, as she was righted the following day. The operation was a success and Oglala came upright to rest on her bottom.|$|E
