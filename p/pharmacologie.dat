When fast relief is required and/or oral or iv routes are not available because of the patient&# 39;s condition, the transmucosal route may be an alternative. Methodology: A new transmucosal/buccal (b) pharmaceutical form of APAP dissolved in 50 % wt alcohol is compared with other routes of administration. Two consecutive randomized, crossover, double-blind clinical trials (CT 1 : NCT 00982215 and CT 2 : NCT 01206985) included 16 healthy volunteers. CT 1 compared the pharmacology of 250 mg bAPAP with 1 g iv APAP. CT 2 compared the pharmacodynamics of 125 mg bAPAP with 1 g iv and 125 mg sublingual (s) APAP. Mechanical pain thresholds are recorded in response to mechanical stimuli applied on the forearm several times during 120 minutes. The objective is to compare the time of onset of antinociception and the antinociception (area under the curve) between the routes of administration with analysis of variance (significance P< 0. 05). Results: bAPAP has a faster time of antinociception onset (15 minutes, P< 0. 01) and greater antinociception at 50 minutes (P< 0. 01, CT 1) and 30 minutes (P< 0. 01, CT 2) than ivAPAP and sAPAP. All routes are similar after 50 minutes. Conclusion: bAPAP has a faster antinociceptive action in healthy volunteers. This attractive alternative to other routes would be useful in situations where oral or iv routes are not available. This finding must now be confirmed in patients suffering from acute pain of mild and moderate intensity. Keywords: transmucosal delivery, pain, healthy voluntee...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Different {{treatment}} {{strategies have}} been used to control variceal haemorrhage including drugs, oesophageal tambonade, endoscopie sclerotherapy or ligation, TIPS, and surgery. Optimal therapy should stop bleeding and prevent early rebleeding. The initial resuscitation of patients {{is as important as the}} other specific measures to promote haemostasis. Balloon tambonade is a highly effective treatment to achieve a temporary control of bleeding but it carries a very high risk of complications. <b>Pharmacologie</b> treatment has the theoretical advantage of allowing specific therapy without requiring any complicated equipment and experienced personnel. Drugs currently used in the treatment include vasopressin, terlipressin and somatostatin or its analogues octreotide and vapreotide. In clinical studies somatostatin was more effective than vasopressin and as effective as terlipressin but with improved safety profile. Endoscopie treatments (sclerotherapy and ligation) are highly effective in achieving haemostasis but they are largely depended on the experience of the endoscopist. The association of endoscopie with <b>pharmacologie</b> therapy (preferably somatostatin), used as soon as the diagnosis is suspected (before the endoscopy) and continued for five days, currently appears to be the best approach to treatment. TIPS is indicated in patients in whom bleeding cannot be controlled or recurs after two sessions of endoscopie treatment.

Methods and results: This randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial in 17 healthy volunteers (NCT 01562704) aimed to evaluate how APAP modulates pain-evoked {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} signals. We used behavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the response to experimental thermal stimuli with APAP or placebo administration. Region-of-interest analysis revealed that activity in response to noxious stimulation diminished with APAP compared to placebo in prefrontal cortices, insula, thalami, anterior cingulate cortex, and periaqueductal gray matter. Conclusion: These findings suggest an inhibitory effect of APAP on spinothalamic tracts leading to a decreased activation of higher structures, and a top-down influence on descending inhibition. Further binding and connectivity studies are needed to evaluate how APAP modulates pain, especially in the context of repeated administration to patients with pain.

This literature review has been conducted to provide an overview of the current knowledge regarding the etiology and pathophysiology of localized neuropathic pain (LNP), its assessment and the existing topical pharmacological treatments. Materials and methods: Literature review was performed using Medline from 2010 to December 2016, and all studies involving LNP and treatments were examined. A multidisciplinary expert panel of five pain specialists in this article reports a consensus on topical approaches that may be recommended to alleviate LNP and on their advantages in clinical practice. Results: Successive international recommendations have included topical 5 % lidocaine and 8 % capsaicin for LNP treatment. The expert panel considers that these compounds can be a first-line treatment for LNP, especially in elderly patients and patients with comorbidities and polypharmacy. Regulatory LNP indications should cover the whole range of LNP and not be restricted to specific etiologies or sites. Precautions for the use of plasters must be followed cautiously. Conclusion: Although there is a real need for more randomized controlled trials for both drugs, publications clearly demonstrate excellent risk/benefit ratios, safety, tolerance and continued efficacy throughout long-term treatment. A major advantage of both plasters is that they have proven efficacy and may reduce the risk of adverse events such as cognitive impairment, confusion, somnolence, dizziness and constipation that are often associated with systemic neuropathic pain treatment and reduce the quality of life. Topical modalities also may be used in combination with other drugs and analgesics with limited drug–drug interactions.

Animal studies have suggested an improved cognitive performance but the link with analgesic and antipyretic modes of action is incomplete. This study aims at exploring cognitive tests in healthy volunteers {{in the context of}} antinociception and temperature regulation. A double-blind randomized controlled study (NCT 01390467) was carried out from May 30, 2011 to July 12, 2011. Methods: Forty healthy volunteers were included and analyzed. Nociceptive thresholds, core temperature (body temperature), and a battery of cognitive tests were recorded before and after oral APAP (2 g) or placebo: Information sampling task for predecisional processing, Stockings of Cambridge for spatial memory, reaction time, delayed matching of sample, and pattern recognition memory tests. Analysis of variance for repeated measures adapted to crossover design was performed and a two-tailed type I error was fixed at 5 %. Results: APAP improved information sampling task (diminution of the number of errors, latency to open boxes, and increased number of opened boxes; all P< 0. 05). Spatial planning and working memory initial thinking time were decreased (P= 0. 04). All other tests were not modified by APAP. APAP had an antinociceptive effect (P< 0. 01) and body temperature did not change. Conclusion: This study shows {{for the first time that}} APAP sharpens decision making and planning strategy in healthy volunteers and that cognitive performance and antinociception are independent of APAP effect on thermogenesis. We suggest that cognitive performance mirrors the analgesic rather than thermic cascade of events, with possibly a central role for serotonergic and cannabinoid systems that need to be explored further in the context of pain and cognition.

Purified, recombinant MAPK phosphorylated porcine stomach h-caldesmon to a stoichiometry approaching 2 mol phosphatemol protein. Phosphorylated h-caldesmon was subjected to proteolysis and the phosphopeptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Two major phosphopeptides were identified and sequenced.

40|$|Microglia are the {{professional}} phagocytes {{of the brain}} and express phagocytic receptors such as complement receptor 3 (CR 3 or CD 11 b/CD 18). Using mimics of the amyloid deposit made of heat-killed yeasts coated with either Aβ 1 - 40 or Aβ 1 - 42, we were able to study how microglia interacted with and ingested these particles in vitro. We have shown previously that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is largely implied in the phagocytosis of Aβ 1 - 42 -opsonized heat-killed yeasts and partly in that of Aβ 1 - 40 -opsonized heat-killed yeasts. Here, we report that antibodies against CD 11 b or CD 18 reduced the uptake of the artificial amyloid deposit by microglial cell showing that CR 3 is involved in the mechanism. Moreover, a concomitant inhibition of LRP and CR 3 completely blocked the ingestion of both kinds of particles suggesting that no other receptors participate to this mechanism. © 2010 The Authors Fundamental and Clinical Pharmacology © 2010 Société Française de <b>Pharmacologie</b> et de Thérapeutique...|$|E

Methods: Modeling was used to determine which antiretroviral therapy response predictors (baseline CD 4 cell count, clinical state, age, and adherence) significantly influence immunological response in terms of CD 4 cell gain compared to a reference value at different periods of monitoring. Results: At 6 months, CD 4 cell response was significantly influenced by baseline CD 4 count alone. The probability of no increase in CD 4 cells was 2. 6 higher in patients with a baseline CD 4 cell count of &ge; 200 /mm 3. At 12 months, CD 4 cell response was significantly influenced by both baseline CD 4 cell count and adherence. The probability of no increase in CD 4 cells was three times higher in patients with a baseline CD 4 cell count of &ge; 200 /mm 3 and 0. 15 times lower with adherent patients. At 18 months, CD 4 cell response was also significantly influenced by both baseline CD 4 cell count and adherence. The probability of no increase in CD 4 cells was 5. 1 times higher in patients with a baseline CD 4 cell count of &ge; 200 /mm 3 and 0. 28 times lower with adherent patients. At 24 months, optimal CD 4 cell response was significantly influenced by adherence alone. Adherence increased the probability (by 5. 8) of an optimal increase in CD 4 cells. Age and baseline clinical state had no significant influence on immunological response. Conclusion: The relationship between adherence and CD 4 cell response was the most significant compared to that of baseline CD 4 cell count.

40|$|AbstractThe {{protein kinase}} C (PKC) {{activating}} phorbol esters {{are known to}} prevent the decay of mRNA of several cytokines and proto-oncogenes. To examine whether the phorbol ester signal is continuously required for this stabilizing effect, THP- 1 monocytic cells were stimulated either with phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu), which can {{be removed from the}} cells by washings, or with the more hydrophobic phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). Both of these stimuli induced high levels of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) mRNA. When the cells were washed {{at the peak of the}} IL- 1 β mRNA expression, this mRNA decayed rapidly in the PDBu stimulated cells while in PMA stimulated cells the mRNA levels were not affected. Moreover, this mRNA degradation induced by the removal of PDBu could be inhibited by readdition of the phorbol ester. This restabilization could be prevented by <b>pharmacologie</b> inhibitors of PKC, but not by inhibiting protein or RNA synthesis. Thus these data suggest that the phorbol ester must be continuously present to exert its mRNA stabilizing effect and that its effect is PKC-mediated but does not require active protein or RNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{phospholipase}} A 2 (PLA 2) enzymes play {{a central}} role in diverse cellular processes including phospholipid digestion and metabolism, host defense, and cell signaling. We investigated the ability of CD 16 clustering to trigger PLA 2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in human NK cells, as well as their possible involvement in CD 16 -stimulated degranulation. Both secretory (sPLA 2) and cytosolic (cPLA 2) PLA 2 were rapidly activated upon CD 16 cross-linking; sPLA 2 was found in the supernatant and also in a cell-associated form. cPLA 2 activation was controlled by the ERK pathway as indicated by the close correlation between their kinetics of activation and by the ability of the specific MEK inhibitor, PD 098059, to abolish cPLA 2 activation. CD 16 stimulation also resulted in the generation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and leukotrienes; both phospholipases contributed to their biosynthesis. Using the <b>pharmacologie</b> inhibitors AACOCF 3, p-bromophenacyl bromide (pBPB), and PD 098059, which specifically inhibit cPLA 2, sPLA 2, and MEK, respectively, we demonstrated that the ERK signaling pathway, but not cytosolic or secretory PLA 2, is required for CD 16 -triggered granule release...|$|E
40|$|Affiliation: Jean-François Gauchat : Département de <b>Pharmacologie,</b> Faculté de médecine, Université de MontréalBACKGROUND:The ciliary {{neurotrophic}} factor (CNTF) receptor is composed of two signalling receptor chains, gp 130 and the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor, associated with a non-signalling CNTF binding receptor a component (CNTFR). This tripartite receptor {{has been shown to}} play important roles in the development of motor neurons, but the identity of the relevant ligand(s) is still not clearly established. Recently, we have identified two new ligands for the CNTF receptor complex. These are heterodimeric cytokines composed of cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) associated either with the soluble receptor subunit cytokine-like factor- 1 (CLF) or the soluble form of the binding receptor itself (sCNTFR). RESULTS:Here we show that, during development, clc is expressed in lung, kidney, vibrissae, tooth, epithelia and muscles during the period of development corresponding to when motoneuron loss is observed in mice lacking a functional CNTF receptor. In addition, we demonstrate that it is co-expressed at the single cell level with clf and cntfr, supporting the idea that CLC might be co-secreted with either CLF or sCNTFR. CONCLUSION:This expression pattern is in favor of CLC, associated either with CLF or sCNTFR, being an important player in the signal triggered by the CNTF receptor being required for motoneuron development...|$|E
40|$|Exercise 99 mTc-tetrofosmin {{myocardial}} scintigraphy is {{as accurate as}} exercise 201 TI imaging. Thus far, no data are available on tetrofosmin imaging during <b>pharmacologie</b> stress. We evaluated thefeasibility of using ""Tc-tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT during vasodilation with dipyridamole for detecting coronary artery dis ease. Methods: Sixty-four patients, enrolled in three centers in the U. S., underwent one-day dipyridamole/rest tetrofosmin SPECT. Coronary angiography, performed in 59 patients within 2 mo of the SPECT study, revealed normal coronary arteries or insignificant coronary stenosis in 11 patients and significant (> 50 % luminal diameter stenosis) coronary stenoses in 48 patients. Results: Sen sitivity and specificity of tetrofosmin SPECT for detecting coronary artery disease were 85 % and 55 %, respectively, in the overall population and 81 % and 55 % in patients without prior coronary artery bypass surgery. The overall sensitivity and specificity of tetrofosmin tomographic imaging for detection of individual coro nary stenoses were 53 % and 72 %, respectively, in the overall population and 54 % and 80 % in the patients without prior coronary artery bypass surgery. Conclusion: One-day dipyridamole/rest ""Tc-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion imaging is feasible and has a high sensitivity for detection of coronary artery disease.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the duration of}} blockade of mu-opiate receptors by naltrexone, we measured the binding of [11 C]carfentanil in the brain of five normal volunteers with a positron radiation detection system before and 1, 48, 72, 120, and 168 hr after naltrexone administration. The half-time of blockade by naltrexone in the brain ranged from 72 to 108 hr which {{is greater than the}} fast plasma clearance components (4 - 12 hr) of naltrexone or its metabolite, betanaltrexol, but corresponds well to the half-time of the terminal phase of plasma naltrexone clearance (96 hr). These results are consistent with the duration of the <b>pharmacologie</b> effects of naltrexone in response to heroin administration and indicate that 50 mg/day of oral naltrexone results in plasma levels in excess of that needed to saturate opiate receptors. This is the first example of the use of a simple dual-detector system with positron-emitting radioactive drugs to provide information regarding the duration of action of the drug on its specific receptor site. The plasma clearance half-time of a drug may not give an accurate reflection of the duration of action of the drug on a specific neuroreceptor site. Direct measurement of drug effects on recognition sites greatly extend current studies of pharmacokinetics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjective The {{incidence}} of chronic diseases regularly increases thus focusing {{quality of care}} as a priority in chronically illness. In 2014, prescription renewal was the first reason of outpatient visit in French general practice. In fact, the follow-up of chronic disease may be somewhat longer and more complex than other standard cares. This work aimed to explore patients’ preferences with regard to prescription renewal and its variation {{according to their own}} illness profiles. Methods Between June and July 2014, patient perceptions were collected through a self-administered questionnaire addressed to adults from 14  French GPs offices. Results In one month, 307  questionnaires were returned. More than two-third patients (69. 7 %) evaluated the physician intervention as important as for another reason. The prescription was essential or very important for 70 %. Priority points were those related to share therapeutic options with the physician and to obtain more information on their own illness. Older were more seeking for information on symptoms and disease than younger (OR =  1. 14 [1. 03 – 1. 23]). Conclusion Patients are dealing with their own monitoring of chronic diseases. They expect more information and they look for shared decisions. The term “renewal” does not match their expectations thus leading against patient preference: we advocate substituting it to “prescription revaluation”. © 2016 Société française de <b>pharmacologie</b> et de thérapeutiqu...|$|E
