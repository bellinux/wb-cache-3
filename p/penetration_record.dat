40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) based solar home systems (SHS) {{are often}} the least {{expensive}} electrification option in sparsely populated areas with low electric loads. This makes the SHS appropriate for rural electrification in the developing countries. However, the acquisition of a SHS requires high initial investment and moderate operating and maintenance cost. The lack of financial services for users of SHS is often regarded as the main barrier for their commercial dissemination. Several financing approaches have been practiced in different countries and reflected {{both positive and negative}} impacts. This paper reviews various financing mechanisms used worldwide for dissemination of SHS and discusses the potential of commercialization of SHS in remote rural areas in presence of a financial service. The success of a mechanism depends on various factors ranging from selection of the right mechanism for right location to implementation strategy of the selected mechanism. Donated or highly subsidized projects are found not to sustain for long term.

40|$|The {{design of}} driven pile {{foundations}} involves an iterative process requiring an initial {{estimate of the}} refusal level to determine the depth of boreholes for subsequent analyses. Current procedures for determining borehole depths incorporate parameters typically unknown at the investigation stage. Thus, a quantifiable procedure more applicable at this preliminary stage would provide greater confidence in estimating the founding level of driven piles. This paper examines {{the effectiveness of the}} Standard Penetration Test (SPT) in directly estimating driven pile refusal levels. A number of significant correlations were obtained between SPT information and pile <b>penetration</b> <b>records</b> demonstrating the potential application of the SPT. Results indicated pile penetration was generally best described as a function of both the pile toe and cumulative shaft SPT values. The influence of the toe SPT increased when piles penetrated rock.

Thus {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of using QmiX alone, QmiX with EndoActivator and QmiX with Er,Cr:YSGG laser for final irrigation on sealer penetration into the dentinal tubules. 75 extracted human mandibular premolar teeth were treated with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) irrigation. The samples were divided into 5 groups according to the final irrigation solution used: (1) 17 % EDTA and 2. 5 % NaOCl, (2) QmiX (3) QmiX with Er,Cr:YSGG laser and (4) QmiX with EndoActivator (5) 2. 5 %NaOCl. All teeth were obturated using cold lateral condensation technique with gutta percha and AH 26 sealer (Dentsply; DeTrey,Konstanz, Germany) labeled with Rhodamine B dye. The teeth were sectioned at distances of 2 and 5 from root apex. Total percentage and maximum depth of sealer penetration were measured using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results of one way Anova analysis showed that there was a significant difference in the percentage and depth of sealer penetration among all groups at 3 and 5 mm level sections (P <. 05). Within the groups maximum sealer <b>penetration</b> was <b>recorded</b> for Er,Cr:YSGG laser activated group.

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the sheep cervix is highly {{variable}} between animals and may explain the differing success of transcervical AI between individuals. This study aims to quantify the variation in cervical morphology between ewes and investigate the relationship between cervical anatomy and cervical penetration. Two series of reproductive tracts were collected. Series A: 132 adult anoestrous ewes, and series B: 165 cycling adult ewes and ewe lambs which were identified as luteal or non-luteal based {{on the presence of}} a corpus luteum. The morphology of the cervical external os was classified as slit, papilla, duckbill, flap or rose. An inseminating pipette was inserted into the lumen and the depth of <b>penetration</b> <b>recorded.</b> The cervix was opened longitudinally, its length recorded, the number of cervical rings counted and the arrangement of those rings graded. The maximum depth of cervical penetration was affected by cervical grade (series A: P = 0. 021; series B: P = 0. 037) and the stage of the oestrous cycle (P = 0. 008). Grade 1 cervices were more penetrable than grade 2, with grade 3 the least penetrable and non-luteal cervices could be penetrated further than luteal cervices. The distribution of os types differed with age, with rose types more common in adult ewes, and papilla os types more common in ewe lambs. These results indicate that the depth of cervical penetration is affected by the {{anatomy of the}} cervical lumen. Cervices with a less convoluted lumen (grade 1) were more penetrable. Non-luteal cervices are likely to have higher oestradiol concentrations than luteal, stimulating cervical relaxation and enabling deeper penetration. The difference in os types with age may be contributable to a morphological alteration at parturition. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|For long-duration in-space {{storage of}} {{cryogenic}} propellants, an axial jet mixer is one concept for controlling tank pressure and reducing thermal stratification. Extensive ground-test {{data from the}} 1960 s to the present exist for tank diameters of 10 ft or less. The design of axial jet mixers for tanks {{on the order of}} 30 ft diameter, such as those planned for the Ares V Earth Departure Stage (EDS) LH 2 tank, will require scaling of available experimental data from much smaller tanks, as well designing for microgravity effects. This study will assess the ability for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to handle a change of scale of this magnitude by performing simulations of existing ground-based axial jet mixing experiments at two tank sizes differing by a factor of ten. Simulations of several axial jet configurations for an Ares V scale EDS LH 2 tank during low Earth orbit (LEO) coast are evaluated and selected results are also presented. Data from jet mixing experiments performed in the 1960 s by General Dynamics with water at two tank sizes (1 and 10 ft diameter) are used to evaluate CFD accuracy. Jet nozzle diameters ranged from 0. 032 to 0. 25 in. for the 1 ft diameter tank experiments and from 0. 625 to 0. 875 in. for the 10 ft diameter tank experiments. Thermally stratified layers were created in both tanks prior to turning on the jet mixer. Jet mixer efficiency was determined by monitoring the temperatures on thermocouple rakes in the tanks to time when the stratified layer was mixed out.

Fresh or frozen-thawed semen was used and each insemination dose contained approximately 100 million spermatozoa. Half of these ewes were treated prior to AI with clenbuterol hydrochloride (PanipartTM) {{in an attempt}} to cause cervical softening to allow insertion of an inseminating pipette through the cervix. Reproductive tracts were recovered from 32 ewes in which transcervical insemination was achieved. After flushing each tract the spermatozoa were counted from the cervix and from the left uterine segment. 94 % of ewes showed oestrus within 48 h of CIDR withdrawal. Variation in time of onset of oestrus prior to AI did not affect conception rate (P> 0. 05). The conception rate based on non-return to oestrus was 34 %. A greater percentage of ewes conceived to insemination with fresh semen (42 %) than that for frozen-thawed (24 %) (P< 0. 05). Clenbuterol did not affect depth of cervical penetration but it did reduce bleeding at the cervical os observed at AI (P< 0. 01). Parity/age of ewe significantly affected depth of cervical penetration (P< 0. 001) and the time taken to inseminate (P< 0. 01), with few two tooth ewes successfully transcervically inseminated (76 % were vaginally inseminated). Sperm numbers were significantly higher in the cervices of ewes that were inseminated with fresh rather than frozen-thawed semen (P< 0. 05). Numbers of spermatozoa recovered were low in comparison to similar studies and were related to the extent of cervical damage (recorded at dissection of reproductive tracts). Uterine sperm counts were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) for those ewes where cervical damage was observed. The depth of insemination was estimated at the time of AI, and full cervical <b>penetration</b> was <b>recorded</b> in 68 % of the mature ewes. However examination of the ewe cervices at dissection suggested that this figure was misleading. Anatomical evidence suggested that the inseminating needle had frequently lodged in the cervical wall and successful passage had not been achieved. Therefore it was likely that semen was deposited frequently in areas of damaged cervical tissue which would have been detrimental to survival of spermatozoa. This was probably the main reason for the low sperm numbers in the reproductive tracts and consequently the low conception rate.

40|$|BACKGROUND One {{cross-linked}} polyethylene (XLPE) liner is manufactured using a lower dose of radiation, 5 Mrad, which {{may result in}} less cross-linking. The reported in vivo wear rate of this XLPE liner in patients undergoing THA has varied, and has included some patients in each reported cohort who had greater than 0. 1 mm/year of wear, which is an historical threshold for osteolysis. Previous studies have measured wear on plain radiographs, an approach that has limited sensitivity. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We therefore measured the amount and direction of wear at 6 years using Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) in patients who had THAs that included a {{cross-linked polyethylene}} liner manufactured using 5 Mrad radiation. METHODS We prospectively reviewed wear in 30 patients who underwent primary THAs with the same design of cross-linked acetabular liner and a 28 -mm articulation. Tantalum markers were inserted during surgery and all patients had RSA radiographic examinations at 1 week, 6 months, 1, 2, and 6 years postoperatively. RESULTS The mean proximal, two-dimensional (2 -D) and three-dimensional (3 -D) wear rates calculated between 1 year and 6 years were 0. 014, 0. 014, and 0. 018 mm/per year, respectively. The direction of the head <b>penetration</b> <b>recorded</b> between 1 week and 6 years was in a proximal direction for all patients, proximolateral for 16 of 24 patients, and proximomedial for eight of 24 patients. CONCLUSIONS The proximal, 2 -D and 3 -D wear of a XLPE liner produced using 5 Mrad of radiation was low but measurable by RSA after 6 years. No patients had proximal 2 -D or 3 -D wear rates exceeding 0. 1 mm/year. Further followup is needed to evaluate the effect of XLPE wear particles {{on the development of}} long-term osteolysis.

These fields are: the primary somatosensory area, SI or area 3 b; a field caudal to area 3 b, area 1 / 2; the second somatosensory area, SII; the parietal ventral area, PV; and the ventral somatosensory area, VS. A large number of closely spaced electrode <b>penetrations</b> <b>recording</b> multiunit activity revealed {{that each of these}} fields had a complete somatotopic representation. Microelectrode maps of somatosensory fields were related to architecture in cortex that had been flattened, cut parallel to the cortical surface, and stained for myelin. Receptive field size and some neural properties of individual fields were directly compared. Area 3 b was the largest field identified and its topography was similar to that described in many other mammals. Neurons in 3 b were highly responsive to cutaneous stimulation of peripheral body parts and had relatively small receptive fields. The myeloarchitecture revealed patches of dense myelination surrounded by thin zones of lightly myelinated cortex. Microelectrode recordings showed that myelin-dense and sparse zones in 3 b were related to neurons that responded consistently or habituated to repetitive stimulation respectively. In cortex caudal to 3 b, and protruding into 3 b, a complete representation of the body surface adjacent to much of the caudal boundary of 3 b was defined. Neurons in this area habituated rapidly to repetitive stimulation. We termed this caudal field area 1 / 2 because it had properties of both area 1 and area 2 of primates. In cortex caudolateral to 3 b and lateral to area 1 / 2 (cortex traditionally defined as SII) we describe three separate representations of the body surface coextensive with distinct myeloarchitectonic appearances. The second somatosensory area, SII, shared a congruent border with 3 b at the representation of the nose. In SIl, the overall orientation of the body representation was erect. The lips were represented rostrolaterally, the digits were represented laterally, and the toes were caudolateral to the digits. The trunk was represented caudally and the head was represented medially. A second complete representation, PV, had an inverted body representation with respect to SII and bordered SII at the representation of the distal limbs, The proximal body parts were represented rostrolaterally in PV. Finally, caudal to both SII and PV, an additional representation, VS, shared a congruent border with the distal hindlimb representation of both SII and PV. VS had a crude topography, and receptive fields of neurons in VS were relatively large. Many neurons in VS responded to both somatosensory and auditory stimulation...|$|R
40|$|The IDEF multiple-foil microabrasion {{experiment}} (MAP) {{was exposed}} in five pointing directions stabilized {{relative to the}} orbit motion vector. <b>Penetration</b> <b>records</b> from this exposure provide an excellent opportunity for the decoding of the possible contribution from Earth orbital (bound) components and hyperbolic (unbound) particulates of extraterrestrial origin. Complemented by other experimental data at larger dimensions on LDEF, a preliminary flux distribution is derived for the nominal east- (ram), west-(trailing), and space-pointing detector surfaces. Modeling of the orbital dynamics for these two classes of population, and their collisional probabilities with IDEFs near-circular orbit, demonstrates a high anisotropy in the flux rate for the different detector locations. Bound and unbound particulates are also seen to have quite different signatures regarding anisotropy. According to the modeling, the west- and space pointing flux distributions must dominantly represent the unbound extraterrestrial populations. The different impact velocities on these two faces also permits, with computer modeling, the derivation of the average geocentric particle impact velocity, {{an extension of the}} same modeling permits, further, a transformation to predict the flux distribution of the same unbound particulates on the east face. Hence we can identify any excess flux observed on the east face as a possible component in Earth orbit. The east-to-west flux ratio for the MAP data is 34 +/- 7 for the penetration of aluminum at 5 mum and 7. 3 +/- 1. 7 at 30 mum; the space-to-west ratio is 4. 9 +/- 1. 0 at 5 mum (Niblett, 1991). These data demonstrate, using the modelling developed and that of Zook (1991), that LDEF impacts on all detectors are dominated by unbound and hence extraterrestrial particulates above particulate masses of 6. 4 x 10 (- 10) g mass. However, for small particulates an orbital component is clearly identified on the east and side (N,S) faces that exceeds the interplanetary flux distribution by a factor of around 4 on the east face. The source is not yet identified, but the possible role of space debris and aerocaptured natural interplanetary dust is discussed. The data are compared to craters reported on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) louvres (Laurence and Brownlee, 1986). The SMM data are consistent with IDEF MAP data as a crater distribution, but very significant revisions to the interpretation of the SMM data are identified. The application of a new dimensionally scaled penetration formula, incorporating hypervelocity impact calibration to 16 km s- 1 velocity, shows that the interplanetary component measured on the LDEF foils is consistent with interplanetary sources measured at 1 AU heliocentric distance...|$|R
5000|$|Artur Schnabel (17 April 1882 - 15 August 1951) was an Austrian {{classical}} pianist, {{who also}} composed and taught. Schnabel {{was known for}} his intellectual seriousness as a musician, avoiding pure technical bravura. Among the 20th century's most respected and most important pianists, his playing displayed marked vitality, profundity and spirituality in the Austro-German classics, particularly the works of Beethoven and Schubert. His performances of these compositions have often been hailed as models of interpretative <b>penetration.</b> His best-known <b>recording</b> is of the complete Beethoven piano sonatas; recorded between 1932 and 1935, it is the first recording ever made of the complete cycle of 32 sonatas, leading Harold C. Schonberg to refer to Schnabel as [...] "the man who invented Beethoven".|$|R
40|$|Tasmania {{provides}} one of {{the most}} diverse ranges of soil types for viticultural production in the world ranging from alkaline heavy clay soils (Vertosols) to acidic sandy soils (Podosols). Wide variations in yield and quality have hindered the development of the industry in Tasmania, {{the extent to which these}} variations are influenced by soil factors is largely unknown. This diverse Tasmanian environment provides an ideal location for the investigation of soil - root interactions and their relationship to vine productivity. Investigations of grapevine root distribution were undertaken within a range of soil types across three vineyards located in Tasmania. Soil trenches were excavated to expose soil profiles and vine root distribution with root size frequency and soil <b>penetration</b> resistance <b>recorded</b> across the soil face. The soil profile was described for physical properties and all horizons were sampled for chemical analysis. Vine growth parameters such as pruning weight and fruit yield were also measured over several seasons. The percentage distribution of roots vertically through the soil profiles was very similar regardless of soil type. Highest root abundance occurred at 10 – 30 cm depth for all but {{one of the}} studied profiles. Root numbers declined with depth below 30 cm, with most profiles having 80...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate in vitro apical microleakage of root canal filling materials for primary teeth. Methods: Fifty extracted primary anterior teeth were distributed into 6 groups: 4 experimental groups; 1 negative control group; and 1 positive control group. Zinc oxide and eugenol (ZOE), Kri paste, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2), and Vitapex were inserted into the canal using a lentulo spiral mounted in a slow-speed handpiece. All teeth were then subjected to a dye leakage test using 2 % methylene blue as the tracer. Results: The highest dye <b>penetration</b> was <b>recorded</b> for teeth filled with ZOE, with mean values of 9. 01 ± 1. 23 mm. Vitapex showed the lowest dye penetration, with mean values of 4. 02 ± 1. 79 mm. Comparison between groups showed significant difference when the Vitapex and Kri paste groups were compared to the ZOE group (P<. 0001). Also, a significant difference between the Vitapex and Ca(OH) 2 group (P=. 014) was detected. The result showed no difference between Vitapex and Kri paste (P=. 658) nor between Kri paste and Ca(OH) 2 (P=. 185). Conclusions: All the resorbable root canal filling materials used in primary teeth showed apical leakage. The highest apical leakage was recorded for ZOE, while Vitapex showed minimum dye leakage.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the functional {{architecture of the}} inferior colliculus (IC) in rhesus monkeys. We systematically mapped multiunit responses to tonal stimuli and noise in the IC and surrounding tissue of six rhesus macaques, collecting data at evenly placed locations and recording nonresponsive locations to define boundaries. The results show a modest tonotopically organized region (17 of 100 <b>recording</b> <b>penetration</b> locations in 4 of 6 monkeys) surrounded by a large mass of tissue that, although vigorously responsive, showed no clear topographic arrangement (68 of 100 penetration locations). Rather, most cells in these recordings responded best to frequencies {{at the low end}} of the macaque auditory range. The remaining 15 (of 100) locations exhibited auditory responses that were not sensitive to sound frequency. Potential anatomical correlates of functionally defined regions and implications for midbrain auditory prosthetic devices are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Microelectrode {{recordings}} of single unit neuronal activity were used during stereotactic surgery {{to define the}} subthalamic nucleus for chronic deep brain stimulation {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson’s disease. By using five parallel trajec-tories, often two to three microelectrodes allow us to recognize subthalamic nucleus (STN) neuronal activity. STN neurons were easily distinguished from cells of the overlying zona in-certa and the underlying substantia nigra. During a typical ex-ploratory track, we can observe a very low background noise in the zona incerta and almost complete absence of single cell <b>recording.</b> <b>Penetration</b> of the electrode tip into the STN is char-acterized by a sudden increase in background activity and single cell activity of spontaneously active neurons. The exit of electrode tip out of the STN corresponds to a decrease in back-ground noise and a loss of single cell activity. Spontaneou...|$|R
