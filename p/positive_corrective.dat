40|$|In this paper, we derive entropy {{estimates}} {{for a class}} of schemes for the Euler equations which present the following features: {{they are based on}} the internal energy equation (eventually with a <b>positive</b> <b>corrective</b> term at the righ-hand-side so as to ensure consistency) and the possible upwinding is performed with respect to the material velocity only. The implicit-in-time first-order upwind scheme satisfies a local entropy inequality. A generalization of the convection term is then introduced, which allows to limit the scheme diffusion while ensuring a weaker property: the entropy inequality is satisfied up to a remainder term which is shown to tend to zero with the space and time steps, if the discrete solution is controlled in L ∞ and BV norms. The explicit upwind variant also satisfies such a weaker property, at the price of an estimate for the velocity which could be derived from the introduction of a new stabilization term in the momentum balance. Still for the explicit scheme, with the above-mentioned generalization of the convection operator, the same result only holds if the ratio of the time to the space step tends to zero...|$|E
40|$|Income {{distribution}} as {{a central}} topic in development has waxed and waned over the last half-century. In the immediate post-Second World War period, income distribution was seen as central, linked to such issues {{as the need for}} land distribution and the generation of a surplus by transferring underused labour from rural to urban areas, as outlined in the theory of Arthur Lewis. Income distribution then faded as an issue until the 1970 s, when priorities for generating employment and meeting basic needs were often seen as requiring macro strategies of redistribution with growth. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, income distribution faded once more as attention shifted to policies of economic stabilisation and structural adjustment. By the early twenty-first century, income distribution became once again an important point of focus, both for policy and analysis. This was stimulated in part by concerns that globalisation was creating forces in many countries that were exacerbating greater inequalities of income distribution, which required <b>positive</b> <b>corrective</b> action. Concerns with income distribution in development reflect values and objectives, theory and analysis. The links with values and objectives are readily apparent – although it is important to stress that attention to income distribution goes well beyond concern wit...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{question}} of how to correct and rehabilitate scoliosis {{remains one of the most}} difficult problems of orthopaedics. Controversies continue to arise regarding various types of both symmetric and asymmetric scoliosis-specific therapeutic exercises. Objective. The aim of the present paper was to conduct an electromyographic assessment of functional symmetry of paraspinal muscles during symmetric and asymmetric exercises in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. Materials and Methods. The study was conducted in a group of 82 girls, mean age 12. 4 ± 2. 3 years with single- or double-major-idiopathic scoliosis, Cobb angle 24 ± 9. 4 °. The functional biopotentials during isometric work of paraspinal muscles in “at rest” position and during two symmetric and four asymmetric exercises were measured with the use of the Muscle Tester ME 6000 electromyograph. Results. In general, asymmetric exercises were characterised by larger differences in bioelectrical activity of paraspinal muscles, in comparison with symmetric exercises, both in the groups of patients with single-curve and double-curve scoliosis. Conclusion. During symmetric and asymmetric exercises, muscle tension patterns differed significantly in both groups, in comparison with the examination at rest, in most cases generating <b>positive</b> <b>corrective</b> patterns. Asymmetric exercises generated divergent muscle tension patterns on the convex and concave sides of the deformity...|$|E

40|$|American law, {{whether in}} the shape of legislation, court decisions, or {{administrative}} action, continues in many instances to accord men and women different treatment solely because of sex. Such differences in treatment have often been challenged in the courts as alleged violations of state or federal constitutional provisions. But, for the most part, these constitutional attacks have met with failure, leading to, among other things, persistent pressure for a federal constitutional amendment that would specifically prohibit legal discrimination based on sex (the so-called 2 ̆ 2 equal rights 2 ̆ 2 amendment). In recent years—no doubt partly due to a general rekindling of interest in the status of women in society and the emergence of <b>positive</b> <b>corrective</b> legislation in the field—constitutional challenges of laws that discriminate on grounds of sex have increased. There are many indications in fact that reliance upon existing constitutional provisions as a basis for attacking many expressions of sex-based legal discrimination is no longer as fruitless an approach as it may have been in the past. The purposes of the present article are, therefore, three: (1) To describe and analyze leading decisions that have disposed of constitutional attacks upon laws that discriminate on the basis of sex; (2) To discern the current developments in this area, including a forecast of the shape of things to come; and (3) To consider the desirability vel non of the proposed equal rights amendment...|$|E

They were divided in three equal groups and they were all received instruction for two badminton skills with different complexity: a) backhand-short-serve (simple) and b) forehand-long-serve (complex). The three groups received different instructions for the two skills and a) the first group received instructional cues for the correct (C) execution of the performance b) the second group received instructional cues on errors (E) of the execution and c) the third group received instructions on errors and how to correct them (E-C). The training program lasted 12 -practice units. There was a pre-test, and a post test {{after the end of the}} training program which lasted ten weeks, as well as a retention test, after two weeks which measured the result of their performance. A two way analysis of variance ANOVA (3 groups X 3 measures) with repeated measures on the last factor was used to analyse {{the effects of}} the three practice methods of corrective feedback for the two badminton skills on their result (R) scores of their skill performance.

Two peer-teaching programs, Classwide Peer Tutoring and Classwide Student Tutoring Teams, are described, as well as findings from recent investigations in mainstream and resource room settings. Implications for teacher preparation are reviewed. Peer-mediated instruction refers to an alternative teaching arrangement in which students serve as instructional agents for their classmates or other children. In many respects, these programs resem-ble informal peer tutoring and study group ar-rangements that have frequented the instructional scene for years. However, recent programs are more structured and consistent with principles of effective instructional practice. That is, students are taught to present information systematically, elicit peer responses, monitor the accuracy of these responses, and provide immediate feedback (both <b>positive</b> and <b>corrective)</b> contingent upon their classmate's performance (e. g., Delquadri, Green...|$|R

40|$|After {{two decades}} of largely {{unfulfilled}} promise, computers have finally begun to {{play a significant role}} in higher education beyond functioning as high-tech typewriters and calculators. In the chemical engineering curriculum, courses have been able to incorporate increasingly complex and realistic examples through the use of spreadsheets, mathematical and process simulation software, multimedia courseware, and resources available through the World Wide Web. Well-designed instructional technology can facilitate learning in ways that cannot be achieved in a traditional classroom setting. A good courseware package can provide a high level of both visual and verbal presentation of material, as opposed to the overwhelming verbal content of most lectures. It can also provide customized mentoring, enabling students to take an active role in the learning experience by calling on them to answer questions, solve problems, and explore what-if scenarios through the use of simulations.

40|$|Abstract: Teacher {{preparation}} programs are under scrutiny for {{their role in}} the troubled American educational system. Thus, teacher educators must encourage teachers to use effective teaching practices. One technique for increasing use of effective practices is providing feedback to teachers on both newly acquired and ingrained teaching behaviors. To determine attributes of effective performance feedback, a systematic search for empirical literature was completed. Analysis of the ten identified studies indicates attributes of feedback that have been studied fall into categories of (a) nature of feedback, (b) temporal dimensions of feedback, and (c) who gives feedback. Through this review, attributes of feedback were classified as either promising or effective practice in changing specific teaching behaviors. Only immediate feedback was identified as an effective attribute. Promising practices for feedback to teachers included feedback that was specific, <b>positive,</b> and/or <b>corrective.</b> These findings, recommendations and directions for additional research in feedback and teacher preparation are discussed. Many individuals have expressed concernregarding teacher effectiveness. These concerns have implications for teacher prep-aration at both preservice and inservice level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Feedback {{as a part}} {{of teacher}} talk plays a crucial role in {{language}} learning. Feedback not only gives reinforcement to maintain good behaviors of the students but also makes students aware of the mistake they make during the learning and teaching process so that they are able to revise it. This study aims to identify the types of feedback expressions used by the teacher in teaching learning process, both <b>positive</b> and <b>corrective</b> feedback. The focus of the study was on the oral teacher feedback. To gather the data, one English teacher and her students who were studying English as a foreign language were observed while they were in a teaching learning process. Their interactions in the classroom were recorded, transcribed, and then analyzed to find out the types of feedback expressions used by the teacher during the interaction. The finding revealed that the teacher used both positive and negative feedback in the teaching and learning process. In terms of positive feedback, the teacher mostly used repetition, followed by praise and affirmation. In terms of negative feedback, the teacher also used a variety of ways which include repetition as the most common feedback provision, followed by recast, clarification request, elicitation, explicit correction, and prompting.

This study investigated the CuPiD-system’s feasibility and effectiveness compared with conventional gait training when applied in the home environment. Methods Forty persons with PD undertook gait training for 30 minutes, three times per week for six weeks. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} i) CuPiD, in which a smartphone application offered <b>positive</b> and <b>corrective</b> feedback on gait, or ii) an active control, in which personalized gait advice was provided. Gait, balance, endurance and quality of life were assessed before and after training and at four weeks follow-up using standardized tests. Results Both groups improved significantly on the primary outcomes (single and dual task gait speed) at post-test and follow-up. The CuPiD group improved significantly more on balance (MiniBESTest) at post-test (from 24. 8 to 26. 1, SD∼ 5) and maintained quality of life (SF- 36 physical health) at follow-up whereas the control group deteriorated (from 50. 4 to 48. 3, SD∼ 16). No other statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the two groups. The CuPiD system was well-tolerated and participants found the tool user-friendly. Conclusion CuPiD was feasible, well-accepted and seemed to be an effective approach to promote gait training, as participants improved equally to controls. This benefit may be ascribed to the real-time feedback, stimulating corrective actions and promoting self-efficacy to achieve optimal performance. Further optimization of the system and adequately-powered studies are warranted to corroborate these findings and determine cost-effectiveness. status: publishe...|$|R

The present study was an attempt to investigate the type of both <b>positive</b> and <b>corrective</b> feedback moves utilized by L 2 teachers in L 2 reading comprehension classes. The study concentrated on six different kinds of corrective feedback, namely, explicit correction, recast, clarification request, metalinguistic feedback, elicitation, and repetition, as well as four positive feedback techniques: acknowledgment, acceptance, rephrasing, and repetition. To this end, 40 participants were selected from a total population of 52 female EFL learners, aged 20 - 25, from an English language institute in Iran. In order to ensure the homogeneous entry behavior of the participants in terms of proficiency, the Oxford Placement Test (OPT), with reasonable measures of validity and reliability, was used to screen the students. All that happened in reading comprehension classes were audio recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed. To ensure about the consistency of the researchers in coding the data, the inter-coder reliability was run using Cronbach’s Alpha. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that repetition was the most frequently provided positive feedback by L 2 teachers (53 %), followed by rephrasing (27 %). Regarding corrective feedback, explicit correction was the most frequent feedback technique and elicitation the second one utilized by L 2 teachers (49 % & 19 %, respectively). The results of Chi-square test showed that {{there was a significant difference}} among the frequencies of the feedback types.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted to examine the literature base on supervisory coaching, an approach in which an outside expert or supervisor gives specific, <b>positive,</b> and <b>corrective</b> coaching when needed and is offered to the teacher after the completion of the observed lesson in an effort to move the recipient toward a desired level of performance (Joyce 2 ̆ 6 Showers, 1981; 1982; Maeda, 2001; Simonsen, Myers, 2 ̆ 6 DeLuca, 2010). Sixteen quasi-experimental and single-subject studies were identified and reviewed using quality indicators specific to quasi-experimental (Gersten et al., 2005) and single subject (Horner et al., 2005) research. Only six of the sixteen studies met all quality indicators. Mixed results were found across the studies, with six reporting improved teacher results and four reporting improved student behaviors. The subsequent study explored an alternative means to offering supervisory coaching to teachers: professional development and virtual teacher coaching with videoconferencing. A single-case multiple baseline design was used to investigate the effect the intervention had on the frequency with which teachers offer Opportunities to Respond (OTR) and on the on-task behavior of middle school students with emotional/ behavior disorders (E/BD). OTR is a teacher behavior that petitions a student response (Haydon et al., 2010). After baseline data was collected, virtual coaching sessions were implemented to increase OTR after every other observed session. Results indicated there was a functional relation between virtual teacher coaching with videoconferencing and teacher rates of OTR. However, no functional relation was observed between teachers given OTR and student on-task behavior. Implications for virtual teacher coaching, OTR, and future research are discussed...|$|R

They are: 1) determining and normalizing thinking and behaving, 2) evaluating language, 3) shifting attention away from problem talk 4) describing times when the attachment problem isn't happening, 5) focusing on how family members [...] "successfully" [...] solve problematic attachment behavior; 6) acknowledging [...] "unpleasant emotions" [...] (i.e., angry, sad, scared) underlying negative interactional patterns, 7) identifying antecedents (controlling conditions) and associated negative cognitive emotive connections in behavior (reciprocal role of thought and emotion in behavioral causation), 8) encouraging previously abused children to experience or [...] "own" [...] negative thoughts and associated aversive emotional feelings, 9) modeling and rewarding positive behavior change (with themselves and in relationships), and 10) encouraging and rewarding thinking and behaving differently. This type of therapy shifts victims thoughts away from the bad and changes their behavior.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a training program designed to teach parents skills for facilitating the academic performance of their children. Specifically, the parents were taught to use fa) modeling (physical and verbal), (b) <b>positive</b> feedback; (c) <b>corrective</b> feedback, and (d) verbal reinforcement to teach their children letter-printing skills. A multiple base-line design across parents and children was employed. Training was conducted and data were collected in the pediatric clinic and home via direct observation of behavior and performance. Results suggested that child printing performance increased substantially when the parents were trained in the four component skills. Generalization of parent skills occurred across settings and target skills, and was maintained on follow-up measures taken at 2 - and 4 -week intervals. Pediatricians {{are one of the most}} frequently consulted professionals for physical and psychological development of young children. Their role in the psychological development of the child has been recognized by parents who seek their services (e. g., Berger, 1977). Increasingly, psychologists are employed in pediatric settings such as hospitals, clinics, and private practice offices, and the information and skills they provide to parents in such settings can have a major impact on the child's academic and social development.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the role of corrective feedback in helping Malaysian students learn difficult grammatical items through essay writing. Studies have suggested that corrective feedback is beneficial for students and is effective in teaching writing in Second Language Acquisition environment. However, {{a number of studies}} have also doubted the efficacy of teachers’ corrective feedback on students’ acquisition of difficult grammatical items. Scholars have argued that corrective feedback does not help the students to notice the difficult grammatical items corrected by teacher. Thus, the current study was set to investigate how direct corrective feedback given by teachers could help students notice difficult grammatical item in particular the ‘be’ verb forms in their essay writing. This case study involved four form four students from native Malay L 1 background from a rural school. The students wrote three different drafts of five types of essay for a period of 10 weeks and underwent two sessions of Stimulated Recall Interview. Analysis of errors made in students’ drafts revealed that corrective feedback does help the students to notice ‘be’ verb forms. Analysis of Errors across different genre suggests that errors involving ‘be’ verb forms persist in students albeit in a smaller number. During the stimulated recall interview, students did notice specifically ‘be’ verb forms being corrected by teacher. ‘Be’ verb forms were found to be difficult for the students because they mainly rely on translation method for essay writing. The essays from different types of genres were found to be particularly challenging for the students. However, given more practice and opportunities to learn, students will have higher chances to acquire ‘be’ verb forms. Considering students’ <b>positive</b> response towards <b>corrective</b> feedback, teachers could use corrective feedback as a way to help students to notice and learn difficult grammatical items through essay writings. The pedagogical implication of this study is that improvement is needed in teaching of writing in Malaysia with more emphasis given on a variety of practice on writing as well as providing of corrective feedback. The findings also suggest that teachers need to be creative in providing corrective feedback considering the limitations that they work unde...|$|R
40|$|A atual pesquisa faz parte do grupo de pesquisa, cadastrado no Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, sobre moda na cadeia têxtil, tendo como foco as questões sociais da manufatura do vestuário de moda. No sistema fast fashion, a substituição ocorre de modo rápido e instantâneo, {{conforme}} o feedback das vendas, sendo um setor influenciado pelo universo da moda, buscando atender consumidores que procuram peças que contenham estilo, moda e/ou modismo. Para seguir com este modelo de negócio, as empresas começaram a se concentrar no seu core business, que muitas vezes corresponde ao marketing, gestão de marcas, comercialização, design, pesquisas, repassando a terceiros a produção das peças de vestuário, onde é predominante a subcontratação. Com essas ramificações, abrem-se brechas para comportamento oportunistas, as quais buscam o seu lucro em função da precarização das relações de trabalho. No entanto, há um aumento de ações que visam a eliminação dessas práticas espúrias de competição, promovendo sistemas produtivos com conceitos pautados em requisitos de responsabilidade social, resultando em melhores condições de trabalho, competitividade e lucratividade. Assim, tornam-se importantes pesquisas que identifiquem empresas com esse novo desempenho estratégico em nível nacional, pois contribui tanto para a sociedade quanto ao meio acadêmico, por meio da geração de bibliografia e identificação de pontos que podem resultar em mudança corporativa. Portanto, esta pesquisa teve por objetivo estudar e analisar os impactos percebidos na cadeia de fornecimento com o selo ABVTEX em responsabilidade social pelo programa de certificação de fornecedores da Associação Brasileira do Varejo Têxtil, bem como a identificação de práticas de monitoramento pelos varejistas signatários. Em um primeiro momento realizou-se pesquisas bibliográficas que possibilitaram a fundamentação teórica, a qual auxiliou na construção dos questionários com perguntas estruturadas e semiestruturas a serem aplicados aos integrantes do estudo de múltiplos casos, e na elaboração do questionário aos fornecedores por meio da pesquisa survey. Após foi possível analisar os casos e comparar o aprendizado organizacional dos varejistas em responsabilidade social através do modelo proposto por Zadek (2004). Os resultados permitiram confirmar as proposições norteadoras, e identificar que o impacto percebido pelos fornecedores e varejistas é positivo, porém necessita de ações corretivas afim de garantir maior transparência e credibilidade. The {{present research}} is part of the research group, registered on the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, about trendy in the textile chain, focusing on the social issues of the manufacture of fashion apparel. In fast fashion system, the replacement is make quickly and instantly, following feedback from sales, being an industry influenced by the fashion universe, seeking for consumers which are looking for products with style, fashion and / or fad. To continue with this business model, companies began to focus on their core business, which often corresponds to marketing, brand management, commercialization, design, research, passing on to third parties the production process of garments where it is predominant subcontracting. With these ramifications in the chain, gaps are opened for opportunistic companies, which seek their profit due to the precariousness of working conditions. However, there is an increase of actions aimed at eliminating these spurious practices competition, promoting productive systems with concepts guided by social responsibility requirements, resulting in better working conditions, competitiveness and profitability. Thus, it becomes important research to identify companies with this new strategic behavior at a national level, as it contributes both to society and to academic environment, through the generation of bibliography and identification of points that can result in corporate change. The objective {{of this study was to}} study and analyze the perceived impacts of the supplier chain with the ABVTEX seal on social responsibility by the supplier certification program of the Brazilian Association of Textile Retail, as well as the identification of monitoring practices by the signatory retailers. At first, bibliographical research was carried out, which enabled the theoretical framework, which helped to build of the questionnaires, with structured questions and semi-structures to be applied to the members of the study of multiple cases, and in the elaboration of the questionnaire to the suppliers through the research survey. Afterwards, it was possible to analyze the cases and compare the organizational learning of retailers about social responsibility through the model proposed by Zadek (2004). The results allowed us to confirm the guiding propositions and to identify that the impact perceived by suppliers and retailers is <b>positive,</b> but requires <b>corrective</b> actions to guarantee greater transparency and credibilit...|$|R
