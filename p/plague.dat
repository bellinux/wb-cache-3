5|$|The Great <b>Plague,</b> lasting from 1665 to 1666, was {{the last}} major {{epidemic}} of the bubonic <b>plague</b> to occur in England. It happened within the centuries-long time period of the Second Pandemic, {{an extended period of}} intermittent bubonic <b>plague</b> epidemics which began in Europe in 1347, {{the first year of the}} Black Death, an outbreak which included other forms such as pneumonic <b>plague,</b> and lasted until 1750.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{disturbing}} events troubled Monteverdi's {{world in the}} period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The <b>plague</b> was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and {{over a period of}} 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the <b>plague</b> victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. The <b>plague</b> and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect on the economy and artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from the <b>plague.</b>|$|E

5|$|Josquin did {{not stay}} in Ferrara long. An {{outbreak}} of the <b>plague</b> {{in the summer of}} 1503 prompted the evacuation of the Duke and his family, as well as two-thirds of the citizens, and Josquin left by April of the next year, possibly also to escape the <b>plague.</b> His replacement, Jacob Obrecht, died of the <b>plague</b> in the summer of 1505, to be replaced by Antoine Brumel in 1506, who stayed until the disbanding of the chapel in 1510.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{state that}} Deusdedit {{died of the}} <b>plague</b> that was {{prevalent}} in England at the time. Because Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after he mentions {{the outbreak of the}} <b>plague,</b> the historian J. R. Maddicott asserts that both Deusdedit and Eorcenberht were struck suddenly with the disease and died quickly. Bede is not specific on the type of <b>plague,</b> but Maddicott argues that because of the time of its eruption and the way it arrived in England it was probably bubonic <b>plague.</b> Although Bede does not describe either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit's symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, who suffered from a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of bubonic <b>plague.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Plague</b> cases {{continued}} to occur sporadically at a modest rate until {{the summer of}} 1666. On {{the second and third}} of September that year, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the City of London, and some people believed that the fire {{put an end to the}} epidemic. However, it is now thought that the <b>plague</b> had largely subsided before the fire took place. In fact, most of the later cases of <b>plague</b> were found in the suburbs, and it was the City of London itself that was destroyed by the Fire.|$|E

5|$|Seven years later, in 542, {{a devastating}} {{outbreak}} of Bubonic <b>Plague,</b> {{known as the}} <b>Plague</b> of Justinian and second only {{to that of the}} 14th century, laid siege to the world, killing tens of millions.

5|$|The Great <b>Plague</b> {{epidemic}} of 1665 {{is believed to}} have killed a sixth of London's inhabitants, or 80,000 people, and it is sometimes suggested that the fire saved lives in the long run by burning down so much unsanitary housing with their rats and their fleas which transmitted the <b>plague,</b> as <b>plague</b> epidemics did not recur in London after the fire. Historians disagree as to whether the fire played a part in preventing subsequent major outbreaks. The Museum of London website claims that there was a connection, while historian Roy Porter points out that the fire left the most insalubrious parts of London, the slum suburbs, untouched.|$|E
5|$|The Great <b>Plague</b> {{killed an}} {{estimated}} 100,000 people—almost {{a quarter of}} London's population—in 18 months. The <b>plague</b> {{was caused by the}} Yersinia pestis bacterium, which is usually transmitted through the bite of an infected rat flea.|$|E
5|$|The Great <b>Plague</b> of 1665/1666 was {{the last}} major {{outbreak}} of bubonic <b>plague</b> in Great Britain. The last recorded death from <b>plague</b> came in 1679, and it was removed as a specific category in the Bills of Mortality after 1703. It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten percent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years. Urban areas were more affected than rural ones; Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Southampton and Winchester were badly affected, while the West of England and areas of the Midlands escaped altogether.|$|E

Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albermarle, both of whom had stayed in London {{for the whole of}} the epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from <b>plague</b> during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.|$|E

25|$|In visual art, the <b>plagues</b> have {{generally}} been reserved for works in series, especially engravings. Still, relatively few depictions in art emerged compared to other religious themes until the 19th century, when the <b>plagues</b> became more common subjects, with John Martin and Joseph Turner producing notable canvases. This trend probably reflected a Romantic attraction to landscape and nature painting, for which the <b>plagues</b> were suited, a Gothic attraction to morbid stories, and a rise in Orientalism, wherein exotic Egyptian themes found currency. Given the importance of noble patronage throughout Western art history, the <b>plagues</b> may have found consistent disfavor because the stories emphasize the limits of a monarch's power, and images of lice, locusts, darkness, and boils were ill-suited for decoration in palaces and churches.|$|R

25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in 1996, physician-epidemiologist John S.

2500|$|Alternatively, the Gemara {{tentatively}} {{suggested that}} in both cases, the synagogue has no dwelling, {{but the first}} teaching refers to urban synagogues, while the second refers to rural synagogues. But the Gemara asked whether urban synagogues really {{are not subject to}} uncleanness from house <b>plagues.</b> For a Baraita taught that the words, [...] "in the house of the land of your possession" [...] in [...] teach that a house of the land of the Israelites' possession could become defiled through house <b>plagues,</b> but Jerusalem could not become defiled through house <b>plagues,</b> because Jerusalem did not fall within any single Tribe's inheritance. Rabbi Judah, however, said that he had heard that only the Temple in Jerusalem was unaffected by house <b>plagues.</b> Thus Rabbi Judah's view would imply that synagogues and houses of learning are subject to house <b>plagues</b> even in large cities. The Gemara suggested, however, that one should read Rabbi Judah's view to say that sacred places are not subject to house <b>plagues.</b> The Gemara suggested that the principle that the first Tanna and Rabbi Judah were disputing was whether Jerusalem was divided among the Tribes; the first Tanna holds that Jerusalem was not divided, while Rabbi Judah holds that Jerusalem was divided among the Tribes.|$|R
