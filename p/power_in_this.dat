5|$|Dante's {{rewriting}} of the Lucanian scene 'recuperates' {{the witch}} Erichtho by making her {{necessary to the}} Dantean Virgil's status as guide: she thus functions {{in accord with the}} Christian providence that controls the advancement of the Commedias plot line.

5|$|It is {{conceivable}} that Ímar received some form of support from Knútr's son and successor in Britain, Haraldr Knútsson, King of England (died 1040). The latter was certainly in power when Ímar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between Ímar and Haraldr could explain why the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later. Ímar's reign lasted about eight years, {{and one of his}} first royal acts appears to have been the invasion of Rathlin Island within the year. The fact that he proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} within the fictional {{universe}} in which prior Traveller releases are also set. The most significant <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> universe is the human-dominated Imperium which predominates across thousands of inhabited solar systems. Bordering the regions controlled by the Imperium are other interstellar powers including the Zhodani Consulate. The Imperium and the Zhodani {{have a long history}} of tense relations and, as the game begins, rumors of another frontier war are circulating. Against this backdrop, a security agent working for Sharushid, a large corporation active throughout the Imperium, discovers that a company sub-sector chief named Konrad Kiefer is secretly aiding the Zhodani by smuggling arms across the border into the hands of dissidents in preparation for an uprising within the Imperium to be coordinated with a Zhodani attack. This security agent encounters five experienced adventurers in a bar on the planet Efate and entrusts them with evidence of Kiefer's treachery. These adventurers are tasked with delivering the evidence to a second Sharushid agent located in another solar system and ultimately with stopping Kiefer and his conspiracy against the Imperium. The player assumes control over the party just after the security agent entrusts it with the evidence against Kiefer.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} of Þórfinnr's {{power in the}} Isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the Dublin kingship. Þórfinnr's predatory operations in the Irish Sea region {{may have contributed to}} Echmarcach's loss of Dublin in 1038. Just as Echmarcach may have seized upon Knútr's demise to expand, {{it is possible that the}} vacuum caused by Knútr's death allowed Þórfinnr to prey upon the Irish Sea region. Certainly, the corresponding annal-entry of the Annals of Tigernachstating that Ímar mac Arailt (died 1054) succeeded Echmarcach as King of Dublin that yearappears to indicate that Echmarcach had been forced from the kingship. Ímar appears have been a descendant (possibly a grandson) of Amlaíb Cuarán, and thus a close relative of the latter's son, Sitriuc, whom Echmarcach drove from the kingship only two years before. It is possible that Ímar received some form of support from Knútr's son and successor in England, Haraldr Knútsson, King of England (died 1040). The latter was certainly in power when Ímar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between Ímar and Haraldr Knútsson could explain why the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later. The fact that Ímar proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin. Whatever the case, Ímar's reign lasted only eight years. In 1046, the Annals of the Four Masters records that he was expelled by Echmarcach, who was then elected king by the Dubliners. The Annals of Tigernach, on the other-hand, simply state that Echmarcach succeeded Ímar.|$|E

25|$|The 1978 University of London Act saw the {{university}} {{defined as a}} federation of self-governing colleges, starting the process of decentralisation {{that would lead to}} a marked transference of academic and financial <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period from the central authorities in Senate House to the individual colleges. In the same period, UCL and King's College regained their legal independence via acts of parliament and the issuing of new royal charters. UCL was reincorporate in 1977, while King's College's new charter in 1980 reunited {{the main body of the}} college with the corporation formed in 1829. One of the largest shifts in power of this period came in 1993, when HEFCE switched from funding the University of London, which then allocated money to the colleges, to funding the colleges directly and them paying a contribution to the University.|$|E
25|$|Further critiques {{have emerged}} from feminist, constructionist and discursive sources. Key to these {{is the issue of}} <b>power.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both inside and outside the {{consulting}} room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics. A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{projected}} capital costs, {{and the low}} cost of fuel and in-service maintenance, in 1994 power from CANDU was predicted to be well under 5 cents/kWh. In 1998, Ontario Hydro calculated {{that the cost of}} generation from CANDU was 7.7 cents/kWh, whereas hydropower was only 1.1 cents, and their coal-fired plants were 4.3 cents. As Ontario Hydro received a regulated price averaging 6.3 cents/kWh for <b>power</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, the revenues from the other forms of generation were being used to fund the operating losses of the nuclear plants. The debt left over from the nuclear construction could not be included in the rate base until the reactors were declared in service, thereby exacerbating the total capital cost of construction with unpaid interest, at that time around $15 billion, and another $3.5 billion in debts throughout the system was held by a separate entity and repaid through a standing charge on electricity bills.|$|E
25|$|A driver with {{a higher}} maximum power rating cannot {{necessarily}} be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100W driver ("A") rated at 92dB for 1W @ 1m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200W driver ("B") rated at 89dB for 1W @ 1m when both are driven with 100W of input <b>power.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> particular example, when driven at 100W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or loudness as speaker B would produce with 200W input. Thus, a 3dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier—and often, to reduced overall system cost.|$|E

The key victory was decided in late March 1929 at the Battle of Jiménez, Chihuahua, where after several days of air raids, Escobar was defeated by General Calles, taking about 6000 prisoners.
