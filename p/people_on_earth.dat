5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth.</b> Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E
5|$|Converts were {{provided}} with elaborate details of Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to other planets. The couple believed that humans could learn from great teachers on these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate and heal humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of other worlds. The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including Jesus and Mary of Bethany among their past identities. Ruth stated that she had lived about 50lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> as well as beings from other planets and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast their beliefs as a pastiche or bricolage of the surrounding culture.|$|E

5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim {{of the project was}} to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the explosive device detonated on the surface, not in a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> with their naked eye, a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E

5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b> Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E

5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
5|$|Written by Peter Ling & Hazel Adair, {{this story}} {{developed}} out of plans by producer Nathan-Turner {{to create a}} sequel to the 1960s soap opera Compact, entitled Impact. When, after drafting three or four scripts for the proposed Impact, Nathan-Turner informed the pair that plans for the soap had been cancelled, the producer offered {{them the opportunity to}} write for Doctor Who as a form of compensation. A scene breakdown (whittled down from six parts to four) was commissioned on 12 July 1983, but after three months of development on the scripts, during which the story was restructured into two 45-minute episodes, it was ultimately rejected. The plot involves the disappearance of various <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth,</b> which leads the Doctor and Peri to the planet Hexagora where the Doctor becomes romantically involved with Queen Zafia who is trying to save the insect race of Hexagora from destruction through a plan to infiltrate and take over Earth. It was later adapted as Hexagora by Paul Finch for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in November 2011.|$|E

25|$|Many of today's Biblical scholars, such as N. T. Wright, in {{tracing the}} concept of Heaven back to its Jewish roots, see Earth and Heaven as {{overlapping}} or interlocking.

This belief states that Heaven is where God lives and reigns whilst being active and working alongside <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b> One day when God restores all things, Heaven and Earth will be forever combined into the New Heavens and New Earth of the World to Come.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Meropis {{is neither a}} utopia nor a {{political}} allegory; it is a parody of Plato's Atlantis, {{in a similar vein}} to the True History which parodied Homer's Odyssey. Theopompos somewhat overstates many of Plato's aspects of the Atlantis myth. While it is an Egyptian priest who is telling Solon the story of Atlantis according to Plato's Timaeus, it is an Ipotane (a mythical half-man half-horse creature) who is telling the Meropis story to king Midas according to Theopompus Philippica. Although Atlantis was incredibly big by Plato's account, Theopompus describes Meropis as even bigger, to make it completely absurd. Also, while the invading Atlanteans were beaten by Athens due to its perfect society, the Méropes (Μέροπες)—attacking with an army of ten million soldiers—attempt to conquer Hyperborea, but return in disgrace after realizing that the Hyperboreans were the luckiest <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> and not worth looting.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the minor}} Midrashim, esoteric {{attributes}} of Enoch are expanded upon. In the Sefer Hekalot, Rabbi Ishmael {{is described as}} having visited the 7th Heaven, where he met Enoch, who claims that earth had, in his time, been corrupted by the demons Shammazai, and Azazel, and so Enoch was taken to Heaven to prove that God was not cruel. Similar traditions are recorded in Sirach. Later elaborations of this interpretation treated Enoch as having been a pious ascetic, who, called to mix with others, preached repentance, and gathered (despite {{the small number of}} <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth)</b> a vast collection of disciples, {{to the extent that he}} was proclaimed king. Under his wisdom, peace is said to have reigned on earth, to the extent that he is summoned to Heaven to rule over the sons of God. In a parallel with Elijah, in sight of a vast crowd begging him to stay, he ascends to Heaven on a horse.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, as the world's {{population}} {{passed the}} seven billion mark Ehrlich {{has argued that}} the next two billion <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> would cause more damage than the previous two billion because we are now increasingly having to resort to using more marginal and environmentally damaging resources. As of 2013, Ehrlich continues to perform policy research concerning population and resource issues, with an emphasis upon endangered species, cultural evolution, environmental ethics, and the preservation of genetic resources. Along with Dr. Gretchen Daily, he has performed work in countryside biogeography; that is, the study of making human-disturbed areas hospitable to biodiversity. His research group at Stanford University examines extensively natural populations of the Bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis). The population-related disasters Ehrlich predicted have largely failed to materialize, with population growth rates slowing and new food production technologies increasing the food supply faster than the population. Ehrlich endorses his general thesis that the human population is too large, posing a direct threat to human survival and the environment of the planet.|$|E
