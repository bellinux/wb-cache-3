Therefore, the primary objective {{of this study is}} to assess the impact of three psychological antecedents (position involvement, volitional choice and informational complexity) on affective, calculative and normative commitment to a bank. In turn, we assess the impact of an individual difference variable (consumer relationship proneness) on these three psychological antecedents. And finally, this research project addresses the consequences of affective, calculative and normative commitment on loyalty in terms of word of mouth, purchase intention, <b>price</b> <b>insensitivity</b> and complaining. An empirical research among 439 bank customers was conducted to test our conceptual model. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results reveal the pivotal role of affective commitment as an antecedent of customer loyalty.

According to the European Union Conference, Agenda 2010, 1998, in European tourism small and medium-sized enterprises account for 90 percent of all businesses and more than 94 percent of them are micro operators employing less than ten individuals. The purpose of this bachelor’s thesis is to study how small travel operators are pricing their products, and if there is there any connection between pricing and positioning and if that is the case how the two marketing activities effect each other. In order to achieve this purpose, case studies of two small travel operators were carried out. The required data was gathered through interviews over the telephone. The outcome of this thesis shows that pricing is mostly done based on the non-formal practises, and that there are a connection between positioning and pricing in many aspects. The study also found that smaller travel operators are aware of these connections, but they do not use the knowledge in any scientific way. Instead they use their accumulated experience and are pricing their products according to the upper limit set by the <b>price</b> <b>insensitivity,</b> which varies for each segment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of three separate essays that share a similar theme: physician private practices. The first essay revisits prior research that has proposed a general framework for physician cost function estimation. The econometric specification is a multi-product cost function, and my model addresses and deals with many measurement problems and data complications in physician practice surveys. In particular, I expand upon existing theory to include those practices that yield zero outputs. This modification allows allow me to utilize a more representative and larger sample. The results of my analysis confirm that previous estimates have yielded a downward bias in reported marginal cost estimates, a point often speculated in the literature but not formally addressed empirically. The second essay uses the econometric specification from the first essay to develop a means for testing market power in physician private practices. Using the 1998 American Medical Association Physician Socioeconomic Monitoring Survey, I test the hypothesis of physician collusion in an oligopolistic setting for five fields of specialty. The collusion hypothesis is tested in a traditional conjectural-variation framework that reveals physicians are not highly collusive. However, a Lerner index shows that physicians do possess {{a high degree of}} monopoly power, consistent with many of the claims brought forward by the Department of Justice, primarily due to consumer <b>price</b> <b>insensitivity.</b> The third essay uses the marginal cost estimates of the second paper to revisit the Harberger partial equilibrium approach for computing welfare loss. Deadweight loss estimates are computed by physician, practice, and office visit. The reported losses are indicative of a loss in consumer surplus from the monopoly power that physicians possessed in 1998. The third essay concludes by showing that significant price markups led to substantial losses in welfare by the consumer and third-party payer...|$|E

This dissertation {{is comprised of}} two essays, both of which study how particular market environments affect firms' abilities to price discriminate. In the first chapter, I analyze the pricing decisions of airlines in monopoly markets. Airline markets are noted for having several key features: (1) airlines have limited capacity and limited time to sell, (2) airlines face uncertainty in the popularity of any given flight, and (3) consumers who purchase tickets close to the departure date are less price sensitive than those who buy well in advance. These forces influence the pricing decision - what I call dynamic adjustment to stochastic demand (1 and 2) and intertemporal price discrimination (3). While the previous literature has emphasized each force in isolation, in this chapter, I estimate a model of dynamic airline pricing taking both into account. I use an original data set of daily fares and seat availabilities at the flight level. With model estimates, I disentangle key interactions between the arrival pattern of consumer types and remaining capacity under stochastic demand. I find dynamic adjustment to stochastic demand is particularly important {{as a means to}} secure seats for high-valuing consumers who arrive close to the departure date. It leads to substantial revenue gains compared to pricing policies which depend on date of purchase but not remaining capacity. In aggregate consumers benefit, despite facing higher fares on average, as a result of more efficient capacity allocation. Finally, I show an empirical procedure abstracting from stochastic demand will systematically understate the <b>price</b> <b>insensitivity</b> of consumers who search for tickets close to the date of travel. In the second chapter, Brian Adams and I develop an empirical analysis of zone pricing under competition. While monopolists can only increase profits by adopting more granular pricing policies, this is not necessarily the case in markets with competition. Using an original data set for the retail drywall industry, we estimate a structural model of supply and demand. We use the model estimates to calculate equilibrium under alternative pricing policies to quantify the welfare implications of zone pricing. We find consumer surplus decreases substantially but firm profits appear to increase with finer pricing. As firms have not adopted these policies, they must face some additional costs. We call these costs "spatial menu costs," and our analysis finds them to be substantial: at least 22. 1 % of estimated profits, or 2. 2 % of revenues. Finally, we show that competitive interaction {{plays an important role in}} recovering menu costs - failing to account for competitive effects leads to an overestimate of profit gains and implied menu costs by 32. 9 %...|$|E
40|$|Advance selling {{occurs when}} sellers allow buyers to {{purchase}} {{at a time}} preceding consumption (Shugan and Xie 2000). Electronic tickets, smart cards, online prepayments, and other technological advances make advance selling possible for many, if not all, service providers. These technologies {{lower the cost of}} making complex transactions at a greater distance from the seller's site. They also give sellers more control over advance selling by decreasing arbitrage. As technology enhances the capability to advance sell, more academic attention is vital. This paper strives to exploit these technologies by developing advance-selling strategies. Until recently, advance-selling research focused on the airline industry and specific characteristics of that industry. These characteristics included the <b>price</b> <b>insensitivity</b> of late arrivals (e. g., business travelers) compared with early arrivals (e. g., leisure travelers), demand uncertainty across flights on the same day, and capacity constraints. Recent findings by Shugan and Xie (2000) show that advance selling is a far more general marketing tool than previously thought. It does not require these industry-specific characteristics. It only requires the existence of buyer uncertainty about future valuations. Moreover, sellers without the ability to price discriminate can use advance selling to improve profits to the level of first-degree price discrimination. This finding is important because buyers are nearly always uncertain about their future valuations for most services (e. g., the utility of next year's vacation or a future college education). In this paper, we take the next step from Shugan and Xie (2000). We show that advance-selling profits do not come from buyer surplus, but from more buyers being able to purchase. We determine when and how to advance sell in a variety of situations, including situations with limited capacity, second-period arrivals, refunds, buyer risk aversion, exogenous credibility, continuous preference distributions, and premium pricing. We determine when advance selling improves profits and, when it does, how to set advance prices. We ask and answer seven questions. First, when should sellers advance sell? Second, how much can advance selling improve profits compared with only spot selling? Third, what factors impact the profitability of advance selling and how? Fourth, should advance prices be higher or lower or the same as spot prices? Fifth, how do capacity constraints impact advance-selling strategies? Sixth, should sellers limit the number of advance sales? Finally, what is the possible impact of buyer risk aversion? First, we provide precise conditions when sellers should advance sell. For example, without capacity constraints, we show that sellers should advance sell when marginal costs are sufficiently low to make it profitable to sell to buyers with low valuations and sufficiently high to convince buyers that the spot price will be higher than the advance price. Second, we find that advance selling can almost double the profits from optimal spot selling to early arrivals. We also show that advance selling has no impact on consumer surplus in markets with homogenous consumers and no capacity constraints. Therefore, advance selling can increase social welfare because seller profits increase. Third, we find that two very important factors impacting the profitability of advance selling are seller credibility and marginal costs. Buyers only advance buy when they expect an advantage from advance buying over spot buying. Without capacity constraints, sellers must credibly convince buyers that the advance price is at a discount to the spot price. We show that this condition is met under different circumstances. For example, large marginal costs can create credibility because buyers believe that these costs will lead to high spot prices. Fourth, we find (although optimal advance prices can be at a discount to the spot price) that sometimes a premium is optimal. Premiums are optimal when capacity is large (but limited) and marginal costs are not too large. Buyers advance purchase at a premium to spot prices when capacity is limited and spot prices are low. (Note {{that this is not a}} risk premium, and risk aversion is not required.) No prior research has suggested this strategy because that research relies on the assumption that early arrivals are more price sensitive than later ones. Without that assumption, premium advance pricing is sometimes optimal. Fifth, we find that binding capacity constraints can impact the profitability of advance selling in opposite ways. On one hand, capacity constraints create seller credibility. Buyers believe that spot prices will be high when they know spot capacity is limited (and, perhaps, more limited by advance sales). On the other hand, when capacity is limited, the need to increase sales from discounted advance prices diminishes. Sixth, consistent with Desiraju and Shugan (1999) we find that limiting advance sales can be profitable, but only under restrictive conditions. These conditions are: (1) selling to all early arrivals would leave insufficient capacity in the spot period to sell to all second-period arrivals with high valuations, (2) the optimal spot price is high, and (3) marginal costs are sufficiently small to make advance selling profitable. Finally, we find that buyer risk aversion can sometimes increase the profitability of advance selling. Our findings provide precise guidelines for a large number of service providers that will have the technical capability to advance sell. For those service providers, advance selling provides a creative pricing strategy that can potentially provide substantial improvements in profits.
