Point-to-point tunnels can be more reliable and are more accountable than Teredo, and typically provides permanent IPv6 addresses that do {{not depend on the}} IPv4 address of the tunnel endpoint. Some <b>point-to-point</b> <b>tunnel</b> brokers also support UDP encapsulation to traverse NATs (for instance, the AYIYA protocol can do this). On the other hand, point-to-point tunnels normally require registration. Automated tools (for instance AICCU) make it easy to use Point-to-Point tunnels.|$|E

Unfortunately, due to lack of QoS support across ISP boundaries, it is difficult to achieve even two 9 s (99 %) reliability in today’s Internet. In this paper, we propose SmartTunnel, an end-to-end approach to achieving reliability. A SmartTunnel is a logical <b>point-to-point</b> <b>tunnel</b> between two end points that spans multiple physical network paths. It achieves reliability by strategically allocating traffic onto multiple paths and performing FEC coding. Such an end-to-end approach requires no explicit QoS support from intermediate ISPs, and is therefore easy to deploy in today’s Internet. To fully realize the potential of SmartTunnel, we analytically derive near-optimal traffic allocation schemes that minimize loss rates. We extensively evaluate our approach using trace-driven simulations, ns- 2 simulations, and experiments on PlanetLab. Our results clearly demonstrate that SmartTunnel is effective in achieving high reliability. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are {{commonly}} used to provide secure connectivity over public networks. VPNs use tunnels to provide encryption, compression, and authentication functions, which are identically applied to every packet passing through them. However, this behavior may be overly rigid in many situations where the applications require different functions {{to be applied to}} different parts of their streams. Current VPNs are unable to offer such differential treatment, posing a heavy computational burden on edge routers, reducing their flexibility and degrading network performance. Additionally, the administrative cost of maintaining these tunnels is as high as O(N 2) for an N node VPN. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a flexible VPN architecture (called Flexi-Tunes) where within a single VPN tunnel, different VPN functions are applied to different packet streams. Flexi-Tunes also replaces the traditional <b>point-to-point</b> <b>tunnels</b> with packet switched tunnels that improve scalability by reducing administrative costs to O(N). Simulation of this enhanced model demonstrates 170 % improvement in bandwidth and 40 times improvement in endto-end delay. ...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{mobility}} {{management techniques}} are critical in providing seamless connectivity and session continuity between a mobile node {{and the network}} during its movement. Current mobility management solutions generally require a central entity in the network core, tracking IP address movement and anchoring traffic from source to destination through <b>point-to-point</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Intuitively, this approach suffers from scalability limitations as it creates bottlenecks in the network, due to sub-optimal routing via the anchor point. Meanwhile, alternative anchorless, solutions are not feasible due to the current limitations of the IP semantics, which strongly ties addressing information to location. In contrast, novel path-based forwarding solutions may be exploited for feasible anchorless solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel network-based mobility management solution that facilitates IP mobility over such a path-based forwarding substrate. Our solution exploits the advantages of such substrates in decoupling path calculation from data transfer to {{eliminate the need for}} anchoring traffic through the network core; thereby, allowing flexible path calculation and service provisioning. Furthermore, by eliminating the limitation of routing via the anchor point, our approach reduces the network cost compared to anchored solution through bandwidth saving while maintaining comparable handover delay. We evaluate our solution through analytical and simulation models and compare it with the IETF standardized solution, Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6). Evaluation results illustrate a significant saving in the total network cost when using our proposed solution, compared to its counterpart...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) {{provide the}} {{security}} and isolation properties of private networks, but at lower costs made possible by using a shared infrastructure such as the Internet. VPNs use <b>point-to-point</b> <b>tunnels</b> to create a secure overlay network, with every tunnel being pre-configured to encrypt, compress, and/or authenticate traffic. Once the tunnels are created such properties are maintained throughout its lifetime and traffic streams from different application flowing through the tunnel are subjected to same treatment. This poses a heavy computational burden on the edge routers and may be unnecessary for many applications, which only require a subset of these functions (or variations thereof) {{to be applied to}} their streams. Current VPNs are unable to offer such differential and application specific treatment, which makes them inflexible. Moreover, performing unnecessary computations on every packet degrades network performance. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a flexible VPN architecture (called Flexi-Tunes) where within a single VPN tunnel, different VPN functions can be applied to different applications, thus offering differential and customized treatment. Flexi-Tunes empowers applications on end-hosts to either specify the kind of treatment they expect for their traffic streams or take active part in applying the tunneling functions themselves. This is realized by enhancing the VPN edge router architecture and introducing a new IP Option. Simulations of this enhanced model show that 90 % of the bandwidth is used compared to only 20 % bandwidth utilization in conventional VPNs. Similarly, end-to-end delay is improved by almost 60 % over the conventional case. Key Words: System design, Simulations, Network measurements. A...|$|R

40|$|Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide leased-line like {{connectivity}} {{to private}} networks using a public infrastructure like the Internet. A number of commercial VPN products {{can now be}} purchased, but the freely available OpenSource Linux based VPN solutions (OSLVs) seem to be gaining immense popularity. This is mainly due to their open-source licensing, which gives complete access to the source-code allowing developers to customize and optimize it at will. Some fundamental problems facing current OSLV deployment, however, are poor scalability (varying as O(N)) and poor network performance (< 50 % bandwidth utilization and increased end-to-end delay). The scalability problem {{can be traced to}} maintaining the <b>point-to-point</b> VPN <b>tunnels</b> and the network performance problem {{can be traced to the}} static way in which these tunnels apply different VPN functions like encryption, compression and authentication to all packets passing through it. In this paper, we propose a novel packetswitched tunneling architecture (called Flexi-Tunes) that provides a scalable and flexible implementation for VPN tunnels. Simulation results with Flexi-Tune enhanced VPNs reveals a drastic improvement in network-performance (90 % of the bandwidth is used compared to only 35 % bandwidth utilization in conventional VPNs and end-to-end delay is improved by almost 60 % over the conventional case). Further an analysis of this architecture reveals the scalability is also reduced to O(N). Moreover, Flexi-Tunes also solves several difficult problems like increased reliability, load balancing, site sharing and access control that mar conventional VPN deployment...|$|R
