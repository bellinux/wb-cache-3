5|$|The {{most common}} method of {{controlling}} the louvers is the balanced swell <b>pedal.</b> This device is usually placed above {{the centre of the}} pedalboard and is configured to rotate away from the organist from a near-vertical position (in which the shades are closed) to a near-horizontal position (in which the shades are open). An organ may also have a similar-looking crescendo <b>pedal,</b> found alongside any expression pedals. Pressing the crescendo <b>pedal</b> forward cumulatively activates the stops of the organ, starting with the softest and ending with the loudest; pressing it backwards reverses this process.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the 73-note Stage Piano was {{introduced}} as a lighter and more portable {{alternative to the}} existing two-piece style, featuring four detachable legs (used in Fender steel <b>pedal</b> guitars), a sustain <b>pedal</b> and a single output jack. Although the Stage could be used with any amplifier, catalogs suggested {{the use of the}} Fender Twin Reverb. The older style piano continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed the Suitcase Piano, with 88 note models also becoming available.|$|E
5|$|The {{connectors}} at {{the back}} of the Stage allow the connection of a sustain <b>pedal,</b> a swell <b>pedal</b> for organ, a footswitch to select the rotary speaker emulation speed, and a control <b>pedal</b> to modify effects such as wah-wah. A set of screw-in legs are an available option for the 88 and 76 note models and a custom designed soft case is also available from Clavia. A third party company, Ocean Beach Digital, has manufactured a set of MIDI controlled drawbars for the Nord Stage, for users who prefer to use real drawbars instead of the buttons provided as standard.|$|E

5|$|The cephalic {{molluscs}} {{have two}} pairs of main nerve cords organized around a number of paired ganglia, the visceral cords serving the internal organs and the <b>pedal</b> ones serving the foot. Most pairs of corresponding ganglia {{on both sides of}} the body are linked by commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves). The ganglia above the gut are the cerebral, the pleural, and the visceral, which are located above the esophagus (gullet). The <b>pedal</b> ganglia, which control the foot, are below the esophagus and their commissure and connectives to the cerebral and pleural ganglia surround the esophagus in a circumesophageal nerve ring or nerve collar.|$|E

A lever <b>pedal</b> can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the claim that {{reductions}} of 8 - 18 % in submaximal oxygen consumption (VO 2) could be due to changing components on a Monark ergometer, from standard <b>pedals</b> without toe-clips or straps (flat <b>pedals)</b> to racing <b>pedals</b> of that era, which included toe-clips and straps (toe-clip <b>pedals).</b> This previously untested assertion was evaluated using 11 males (mean age 22. 3 years, s= 1. 2; height 1. 82 m, s= 0. 07; body mass 82. 6 kg, s= 8. 8) who completed four trials in a randomized, counterbalanced order at 60 rev center dot min(- 1) on a Monark cycle ergometer. Two trials were completed on flat <b>pedals</b> and two trials on toe-clip <b>pedals.</b> The Douglas bag method was used to assess VO 2 and gross efficiency during successive 5 -min workloads of 60, 120, 180, and 240 W. The mean VO 2 was 2. 1 % higher for toe-clip <b>pedals</b> than flat <b>pedals</b> and there was a 99 % probability that toe-clip <b>pedals</b> would not result in an 8 % lower VO 2. These results indicate that toe-clip <b>pedals</b> do not reduce VO 2...|$|R

5000|$|Analog overdrive/distortion <b>pedals</b> work {{on similar}} {{principles}} to preamplifier distortion. Because most effects <b>pedals</b> {{are designed to}} operate from battery voltages, using vacuum tubes to generate distortion and overdrive is impractical; instead, most <b>pedals</b> use solid-state transistors, op-amps and diodes. Classic examples of overdrive/distortion <b>pedals</b> include the Boss OD series (overdrives), the Ibanez Tube Screamer (an overdrive), the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi (a fuzz box) and the Pro Co RAT (a distortion). Typically, [...] "overdrive" [...] <b>pedals</b> are designed to produce sounds associated with classic rock or blues, with [...] "distortion" [...] <b>pedals</b> producing the [...] "high gain, scooped mids" [...] sounds associated with heavy metal; fuzz boxes are designed to emulate the distinctive sound of the earliest overdrive <b>pedals</b> such as the Big Muff and the Fuzz Face.|$|R

5|$|Alkan's {{compositions}} for organ {{have been}} among the last of his works to be brought back to the repertoire. As to Alkan's pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of the instrument, they are once again being performed as originally intended (rather than on an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist Roberto Prosseda, and recordings of Alkan on the <b>pedal</b> piano have been made by Jean Dubé and Olivier Latry.|$|E
5|$|Different {{national}} {{styles of}} organ building began to develop, often due to changing political climates. In the Netherlands, the organ became a large instrument with several divisions, doubled ranks, and mounted cornets. The organs of northern Germany also had more divisions, and independent <b>pedal</b> divisions became increasingly common. The {{divisions of the}} organ became visibly discernible from the case design. 20th-century musicologists labelled this the Werkprinzip.|$|E

5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft <b>pedal,</b> which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft <b>pedal</b> is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the <b>pedal</b> is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E

5|$|Sea anemones {{have great}} powers of {{regeneration}} and can reproduce asexually, by budding, fragmentation, or by longitudinal or transverse binary fission. Some {{species such as}} certain Anthopleura divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and markings. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing halfway up the column before it splits horizontally. Some species can also reproduce by <b>pedal</b> laceration. In this process, a ring of material may break off from the <b>pedal</b> disc {{at the base of}} the column which then fragments, the pieces regenerating into new clonal individuals. Alternatively, fragments detach separately as the animal creeps across a surface. In Metridium dianthus, fragmentation rates were higher in individuals living among live mussels than among dead shells, and all the new individuals had tentacles within three weeks.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{the cortex}} during {{locomotion}} remains unclear, but recent advances in neural imaging technologies have aided in developing ways to measure brain activity during motor tasks. One method is by measuring activations produced by neural oscillations which {{have been associated with}} a variety of human behaviors, from sleep and rest to cognitive actions and movement. The physiological and functional methods in which oscillations contribute to cortical control are still largely unknown. In this study, we aim to expand that knowledge by examining human cortical activity in the sensory and motor cortices during <b>pedaling</b> using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We hypothesized that, if the sensory and motor cortices are important for controlling locomotion, then the MEG signal would differ during <b>pedaling</b> as compared to rest and would be modulated with the phase of the <b>pedaling</b> cycle. Moreover, if locomotor-related brain activity is solely caused by sensory feedback, then the MEG signal would be the same during active and passive <b>pedaling.</b> We scanned eight healthy subjects using MEG while they <b>pedaled</b> a custom-made <b>pedaling</b> device. The subjects’ magnetocortical activity was measured in two minute recordings during rest, continuous, self-paced active <b>pedaling,</b> and passive <b>pedaling.</b> The passive condition consisted of the subject relaxing their leg muscles while the experimenter <b>pedaled</b> the device for them at a velocity matching that subject’s active <b>pedaling</b> bout. Task-dependent magnetocortical activity was examined in the primary sensorimotor cortex (M 1 and S 1), supplemental motor area (SMA), and premotor area (PMA). The power spectrum of the MEG signal during the different tasks was extracted using a Welch periodogram to examine the frequency content throughout each task. The power in the alpha and beta bands of all regions of interest decreased significantly during active and passive <b>pedaling</b> as compared to rest. No significant difference was found between any of the tasks in the gamma band. The temporal pattern of the beta frequency band was also examined across the <b>pedaling</b> cycle by performing a time-frequency decomposition using a Morlet wavelet. Both <b>pedaling</b> conditions demonstrated modulation of the beta band at twice the <b>pedaling</b> frequency. These fluctuations were not found in the rest condition. Our results showed that the brain becomes engaged during <b>pedaling</b> as compared to rest. The magnetocortical activity is different across the movement cycle, suggesting that the brain has input into the regulation of locomotor-like movement. There is also a strong sensory component during movement since the active and passive <b>pedaling</b> conditions are similar...|$|R
