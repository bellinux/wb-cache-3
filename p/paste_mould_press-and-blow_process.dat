The blends were reconstituted into a thick <b>paste,</b> manually <b>moulded</b> into kokoro stick and deep fried in hot vegetable oil at about 170 °C for 5 minutes. These flour blends were analyzed for pasting, proximate and functional properties. The result {{showed that there}} was significant difference (p 0. 05) in the pasting time and temperature. The functional properties reflected that water absorption, oil absorption and foaming capacity significantly increased with increase in cowpea flour with their values ranging from 186. 67 – 210. 00 g/ 100 g, 163. 33 – 195. 00 g/mg and 30. 73 – 39. 27 % respectively.

40|$|In this paper, a {{functionally}} graded {{solution is}} proposed for stress distribution in functionally graded geopolymers under flexural loading with the load direction {{parallel to the}} gradient direction. A functionally graded geopolymer specimen is made by sequential pouring and subsequent vibration of two different mixtures of alkali activated <b>pastes</b> into appropriate <b>moulds.</b> Diffusion of the two mixes into each other during vibration and an early age curing process causes chemically graded distribution of the constituent oxides. Because of the variation of the elastic modulus in functionally graded specimens, the stress distribution pattern is related to its pseudo-strain function through different equations. According to the considered functions for both the modulus of elasticity and pseudo-strain, different equations are proposed to predict the flexural strength of functionally graded geopolymers. The best performance model is acquired by adopting an inverse tangent for variation of strain in the deflected beam and the exponential function for variation of the modulus of elasticity in the functionally graded region...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} predict the mechanical behaviour of paste during forming process, the friction law between the carbon <b>paste</b> and the <b>mould</b> wall {{is an important}} parameter to be determined. This paper presents the tribological behaviour of the lubricated paste/steel interface subjected to high stress conditions at the anode forming temperature of 150 °C. A method to characterize the tribological behaviour has been developed and an apparatus was built. The method {{is based on the}} comparison of two successive experiments. In the first experiment, the paste is in contact with the friction plate. In the second one, a layer of Teflon is placed under the paste in order to excite another parameter thereby allowing the identification of the friction coefficient between the paste and steel wall. These experiments were performed with a paste under different normal loads. The static and kinetic friction coefficients of the Teflon/steel, steel/steel and paste/steel interfaces have been estimated. The static and kinetic friction coefficients of the Teflon/steel are respectively 0.17 and 0.13. The steel/steel friction coefficients were evaluated twice which gave a static coefficient that varies between 0.22 and 0.30. The kinetic coefficient varies between 0.18 and 0.25. The static and kinetic paste/steel friction coefficients obtained from both experiments are clearly similar. Their values are 0.15 and 0.13 respectively.|$|R
40|$|The mine {{tailings}} are generated as the wastes worldwide {{as a result}} of exploration, excavation, blasting, beneficiation and extraction of mineral ores. In Western Australia, due to the extensive mining activities and increasing low grade ores, there is generation of {{mine tailings}} in large quantities, which could lead to environmental and disposal problems. The common practice of handling the tailings are to store them in tailing dams or as stockpiles near mine sites. Limited quantities are sometimes used as backfills and other applications. The utilisation of tailings in building and construction projects, which may consume a large volume of wastes, have not been explored extensively so far. Additionally, the understanding of chemical composition-based utilisation of tailings has very limited investigation. In the present research, a critical review of the literature was made focusing on the utilisation of mine tailings in large quantities. Experiments have been conducted by developing a methodology to characterise the tailings based on the relationship that exists between electrical resistivity and the relative density of the tailings in dry and wet conditions. The results show that the electrical resistivity of iron ore mine tailings produced in Western Australia in dry condition ranges from 11 kΩm in a more dense state to 19 kΩm in a very loose state, while that in fully saturated condition ranges from 20 Ωm for a very dense state to 31 Ωm in a very loose state. The laboratory investigation has been conducted to utilise iron ore tailings to produce geopolymer bricks. The sized tailings were mixed with sodium silicate solution used as an activator to form a paste. The <b>paste</b> was <b>moulded</b> and cured for different durations. It was found that the geopolymer bricks produced from iron ore tailings could have a compressive strength as high as 50. 35 MPa. This is either superior or similar to international standard specifications for conventional bricks. Additionally, the new bricks will be more economical than conventional bricks with potential cost reduction of 36. 8 %. The research has also investigated the utilisation of iron ore mine tailings to replace conventional aggregates in concrete. 100 % of both fine and coarse conventional aggregates were replaced with tailings in the mixed design. The concrete mix was casted into moulds and cured. It was found that the compressive strength of the concrete with tailings aggregates at 28 days was 36. 95 MPa which shows an improvement of 11. 56 % over the concrete with conventional aggregates. Additionally, the new concrete met all other requirements for quality assessment of concrete. Finally, the research has conducted investigation into load-settlement behaviour of iron ore tailings to be considered as a structural fill material. The experiment was conducted in a model test tank in the laboratory varying the relative density of the tailings. It was found that the load-bearing capacity is 22 times higher, and the stiffness is 13. 5 times higher than their values for conventional fill materials...|$|R
40|$|Summary Usually low basis-weight Chinese {{painting}} {{papers are}} mostly made from silk or non-wood long fibers which are thinner {{and easy to}} brittle by aging as well. In order to have attractive appearance and storage convenience, Chinese painting papers are backed with flax paper cotton fabrics i. e., so called "mounting". Paste varieties show apparent influence on the mounting properties {{and the life of}} Chinese painting. The {{purpose of this study was}} intended to investigate:(1) the manufacturing procedures of pastes and their properties (2) effect of preservatives and cooling on the conservation of paste varierties (3) effect of commercial preservatives-phenol and aluminum sulfate on the properties of mounting pastes and Chinese painting papers. The experimental results were summarized as follows: 1. For wheat starch, the concentration of starch to water 1 : 6 in gelatinazation achieved a stable pasting property, but the gelatinization temperature should not over 80 ℃. 2. The pH of pastes decreased as prior to wheat starch soaking, and picking strength decreased as the soaking time (days) increasing. Besides, the viscosity of diluted liquor increased as the soaking time increasing. 3. It was apparent that aluminum sulfate has much influence on brightness, tensile and fold of Chinese painting papers. Phenol addition resulted in paste color change. In addition, color change of paste may be inhibited by addition of both of alum and phenol. No color change occurred while over 2 % alum followed by phenol were added in the paste. 4. There was no significant beneficial effect on the conservation of Chinese painting papers by the addition of alum in paste. Besides, sodium benzoic acid, borax and potassium sorbate addition can not prevent the <b>paste</b> from <b>mould</b> growth, but benzoic acid and thymol have better mold growth resistance. 5. Alum and phenol-containing commercial pastes are not available for the conservation of papers. It is apparent to lessen the paper aging for the use of high pH and viscosity of paste while NaOH was added. Paste showed the highest viscosity at pH 7 - 8. The improved picking strength can be achieved by the addition of optimum amount of NaOH, MgCO 3 and CaCO 3 in the paste, but Ca(OH) 2 and Ba(OH) 2 were in vain. 6. The improved picking strength and softness of mounted paper were caused by the addition of preservatives i. e., benzoic acid and thymol in the paste, nevertheless, there was no apparent paper strength deterioration occurred. 7. Cold storage make paste preservation available. Cold the water-covered paste in a cold room will not deteriorate the properties of the paste and the picking strength of papers, in addition to this, picking strength can be improved with no mould growth. 摘 要 中國的書畫主要採用絲絹或宣紙為材料作成，其材料質地纖薄，柔軟，歷 時較久易破碎。為了利於收藏、欣賞，以麻紙、布帛等在書畫背面裝裱， 稱之為「裱褙」。裱褙所使用的材料中，以漿糊最為重要，因漿糊的好壞 會影響裝裱的品質，也關係到書畫日後之保存性。本研究主要針對裱褙用 漿糊的製法及性質，及添加防腐劑及冷藏對漿糊的保存性影響，並針對市 售裱褙用漿糊使用的防腐劑-酚及硫酸鋁對漿糊及紙張性質的影響做一探 討，並嘗試以添加鹼於工業用漿糊的方式中和其酸性物質。試驗結果如下 ﹕ 1. 以小麥澱粉為原料，製糊時濃度以澱粉﹕水＝ 1 ﹕ 6 ，所製得的糊性質 較穩定，而煮糊溫度以不超過 80 ℃為佳。 2. 小麥澱粉之前浸泡處理所製之糊pH值會下降，且剝離強度會隨泡水天 數增加而下降，稀釋液的黏度則會有隨泡水天數增加的趨勢。 3. 硫酸鋁對紙張之白度、引張強度及耐摺力影響很大，酚會導致漿糊的 變色，二者同時添加，硫酸鋁會抑制酚對漿糊的變色，添加 2 %以上硫酸 鋁之漿糊，再添加酚則沒有變色的情形。添加硫酸鋁及酚可增加漿糊的黏 度及剝離強度。 4. 添加硫酸鋁對漿糊保存性並沒有太大幫助，苯甲酸鈉、硼砂及己二烯 酸鉀不能防止漿糊的發霉﹔而酚、苯甲酸及瑞香草酚的防黴抗菌性較佳。 5. 添加硫酸鋁及酚的工業用漿糊不利於紙張的保存。添加鹼可提升工業 用漿糊液的pH值及黏度，並對紙張劣化有明顯的緩和作用。漿糊的黏度在 pH值為 7 ~ 8 時最大。添加適當的氫氧化鈉、碳酸鎂及碳酸鈣可增加漿糊的 剝離強度﹔添加氫氧化鈣及氫氧化鋇則較無效果。 6. 苯甲酸及瑞香草酚可作為漿糊的防腐劑使用，劣化後紙力衰退並不明 顯，並可增加漿糊的剝離強度及裱褙後的柔軟度。 7. 冷藏為保存漿糊的可行辦法，漿糊表面覆水後冷藏在低溫下並不會降 低漿糊的品質，在未發霉的情況下可增加剝離強度...|$|R
60|$|It is {{a curious}} reflection, however, {{that in spite of}} all the later {{improvements}} in the fictile art--in spite of wheels and <b>moulds,</b> <b>pastes</b> and glazes, stamps and pigments, and all the rest of it--the most primitive methods of the first potter are still in use in many countries, side by side with the most finished products of modern European skill and industry. I have in my own possession some West Indian calabashes, cut and decorated under my own eye by a Jamaican negro for his personal use, and bought from him by me for the smallest coin there current--calabashes carved round the edge through the rind with a rude string-course, exactly like the common rope pattern of prehistoric pottery. I have seen the same Jamaican negroes kneading their hand-made porous earthenware beside a tropical stream, moulding it on fruits or shaping it inside with a free sweep of the curved hand, and drying it for use in the hot sun, or baking it in a hastily-formed kiln of plastered mud into large coarse jars of prehistoric types, locally known by the quaint West African name of 'yabbas.' Many of these yabbas, if buried in the ground and exposed to damp and frost, till they almost lost the effects of the baking, would be quite indistinguishable, even by the skilled archæologist, from the actual handicraft of the palæolithic potter. The West Indian negroes brought these simple arts with them from their African home, where they have been handed down in unbroken continuity from the very earliest age of fictile industry. New and better methods have slowly grown up everywhere around them, but these simplest, earliest, and easiest plans have survived none the less for the most ordinary domestic uses, and will survive for ages yet, as long as there remain any out-of-the-way places, remote from the main streams of civilised commerce. Thus, while hundreds of thousands of years, in all probability, separate us now from the ancient days of the first potter, it is yet possible for us to see the first potter's own methods and principles exemplified under our very eyes by people who derive them in unbroken succession from the direct teaching of that long-forgotten prehistoric savage.|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{required}} for the reduction of alumina by electrolysis in the Hall-Héroult process is supplied by the anode. Anodes are produced from a mixture of petroleum coke with coal tar pitch as the binder. The minimum theoretical carbon consumption is 0. 334 kg C/kg Al. But due to current efficiency and oxidation losses the consumption is typically 400 kg C/kg Al. Petroleum coke is a by-product from crude oil refineries, but as its value represents only about 2 per cent of the overall production it has a limited interest to the producers. Mechanical and physical properties of coke {{are influenced by the}} crude oil, processes within the refineries and calcining of the coke. Continuous high demand for calcined coke by aluminium smelters has created a difficult situation with respect to quality and availability, leading to the use of lower quality coke in aluminium smelters and potential disturbances in the production. Understanding the consequences of varying calcined coke qualities is crucial for to possibly compensate and adjust process parameters in the subsequent use of the coke, in order to obtain economical production of aluminium. In the present work, the subject of study was four different petroleum coke types, where three were derived from a single source (SSA, SSB and SSC) and one was from a blend of different cokes. All of the cokes had different chemical and physical properties. Single source cokes have homogenous chemical and physical composition in the whole size range while the blended coke had heterogeneous composition due to the mixture of different coke types used. The blended coke consisted of several different coke types (25) {{in order to meet the}} required specification. This work also describes new characterisation/measurement methods which can contribute to a better understanding of variations in material properties due to physical and mechanical changes in the calcined coke feed materials. Each step in the production of pilot scale anodes is described. A new method was developed for the characterisation of the mechanical strength of calcined coke. This method, the drop test, originates from the study of materials for road construction for the determination of the grain stability of rock materials. The method determines the coke grain strength in the entire size distribution. On the other hand, established measuring methods for calcined coke, HGI (ASTM D 5003 - 95) and grain stability (ISO 10142), determine only the mechanical strength in a specific size range, + 0. 6 - 1. 18 mm and + 4 - 8 mm, respectively. In other words, both methods give limited information about coke mechanical strength distribution throughout the whole size range, which is especially important when blended cokes are used. Additionally, the results from the drop test are expressed in volume reduction, size reduction, impact force and amount of fines below 148 μm generated during the test. A good correlation between ISO 10142 and the drop test was found. The results show good correlation between the size and volume reduction and the specific grinding energy. The method can also determine the grain strength of a specific size fraction which might be critical to further processing during anode production. Totally, about 8 tons of four calcined coke types were processed during this work. The majority of this material was ground in the air swept ball mill, for production of the finest fraction, dust. The pilot scale air swept ball mill circuit is identical to the equipment used in industry today. This investigation showed the importance of process optimisation for the stable production of dust with the required specification (particle size and Blaine). Each coke exhibited different behaviour in the grinding circuit, due to different mechanical strengths, which is reported as a specific grinding energy. The mechanically weakest coke produced dust with the lowest specific grinding energy. The particle size variation in the coke used in the mill produced a significant disturbance in the product quality. It was found that the sweeping speed through the mill influences the particle size distribution in terms of the proportion of the finest particles. It also affected the particle roundness of the produced dust, which can influence the flowability of the coke when mixed with pitch. The ratio of ball sizes and the rotational speed of the mill influenced the particle size distribution, Blaine and specific grinding energy. On-line particle size control was utilised during the dust production. This system allowed continuous control of the product size by regulation of the air classifier rotor speed. Three different dust sizes were produced in the air swept ball mill, which were all below about 200 μm but contained different proportions of material below 63 μm. Sieved coke fractions together with dust were weighed according to a specified recipe and blended in a sigma blade mixer together with coal tar pitch. A vibration compactor was used for the production of green anodes under optimal conditions. The anodes were produced with three different pitch contents (15, 18 and 20 wt%) and three different dust sizes (45, 63 and 94 %, - 63 μm). Core samples of green anodes were investigated in an improved dilatometer for the determination of thermal expansion and shrinkage during baking. Improvements made to the dilatometer during this work contributed to better reproducibility, increased precision and a healthier working environment. An increase in the heating rate influenced the initial expansion, shrinkage and baking loss of the anode. The heterogeneous pitch distribution throughout the anode due to the forming force, friction between coke particles and between the <b>paste</b> and <b>mould</b> showed the importance of selecting a consistent sampling position. The results showed that the bottom samples have greater expansion due to a thicker pitch bridge layer while the top samples have reduced expansion. The sample packing material contributed to a higher initial expansion due to the reduced free surface area for binder volatiles release, and the shrinkage was reduced because of the radial thrusts from the packing material. Thermal dilation results showed differences between samples with varying pitch, dust size and coke type, which can be used to indicate the final properties of baked anodes. A good correlation was found between the thermal dilation after the pitch expansion and the dust content. Green anodes were baked under controlled conditions and then characterised. The baked apparent density showed a good correlation with the pitch content and dust size. The results showed that 18 % pitch content and 63 % - 63 μm produced the highest baked densities. The variation in coke type exhibited differences in baked density, specific electrical resistance, air permeability, CO 2 and air reactivity and modulus of elasticity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
