The first leap showed the Marlin to be the smallest of the day so far. But what he lacked in weight he made up in activity.

Alas! that human steam-winch at the rod drew him right up to the boat, where he looked to weigh about one hundred and twenty-five pounds.|$|E

50|$|However, the {{electrical}} <b>plugs</b> turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> {{not be the}} only problem with the booster. Examination of telemetry also showed that the Titan had actually began experiencing thrust decay before the <b>plug</b> dropped <b>out.</b> Engine No. 1 was unaffected and nearly reached 100% thrust at shutdown, while Engine No. 2 never transitioned to in-flight performance levels. Engineers spent all night combing through the first stage, but failed to find any cause for the thrust decay. Eventually however, one technician identified the problem, which was a plastic dust cover inside the gas generator that had been carelessly left inside when the booster was assembled months earlier at the Martin-Marietta plant, blocking the flow of oxidizer. The cover was removed and the Titan II cleared for another launch attempt.|$|R

50|$|The {{combined}} area of {{the phase}} plug slots is typically about one-eighth to one-tenth of the {{area of the}} diaphragm. This gives a pressure-to-volume velocity change ratio in the range of 8:1 to 10:1, which serves to match the impedance of the diaphragm to the horn throat. A larger slot area admits more sound wave energy but also reflects more energy backward onto the diaphragm. A smaller slot area traps more wave energy between the phase plug and the diaphragm. In researching the diaphragm/phase plug interface, David Gunness found that only half the wave energy, at best, travels directly from the diaphragm through the phase <b>plug</b> slots and <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the listener. The other half (or more) causes cancellations within the space between the diaphragm and the phase plug, or causes temporal anomalies (time smear) upon leaving the phase plug later than the direct sound. To minimize the problem, Gunness modeled the behavior mathematically and used digital signal processing to apply a polarity-reversed version of the undesired wave behavior to the original audio signal.|$|R

30|$|In the {{decentralized}} control architecture, every unit controller works locally, without a control center [12] and without direct communication with other units.The local controllers can be appropriately adjusted when the parameters or the topology {{of the system}} changes, and moreover, {{it is not difficult}} for this architecture to offer additional degrees of freedom and increased controllability for each unit [13, 14].

30|$|Considering the microgridplugs in and <b>plugs</b> <b>out,</b> {{this paper}} proposes a hybrid {{hierarchical}} architecture for MGC control, {{consisting of a}} upper layer using distributed control and a lower layer using centralized control. In the upper layer, each microgrid in an MGC coordinates with others using distributed control based on flexible communication between microgrids, which means there is no centralized controller for the MGC. Meanwhile, the lower layer employs centralized control to manage all units within each microgrid. The advantage of hierarchical architecture lies on combining MGC global targets and each microgrid’s local targets. Meanwhile, distributed optimization in the upper layer can manage microgrid plug-in and plug-out.|$|R
30|$|Microgrid control {{architecture}} can {{be classified}} into three modes: centralized, decentralized and distributed. The centralized control architecture features a control center, which sends control command to all dispatchable units (loads and generators) in the microgrid, and receives information from them. The advantage of this control mode is speedy and accurate control, addressing voltage fluctuations, frequency variation, harmonic distortion [10], and maintaining reliable supply [11]. Efficient centralized control would construct efficient and stable communication links from the control center to every unit. Microgrid plugs in and <b>plugs</b> <b>out,</b> without stable communication links with the control center, which would increase the realization difficulties of the control center.|$|R
