40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} how novel Software + Services approaches can significantly improve productivity for scientists and engineers. In partnership with Rolls-Royce, Airbus and BAE Systems we demonstrate how {{to accelerate the}} understanding of engineering systems and product development. We approached different levels of the enterprise engineering process using a series <b>of</b> user-driven <b>Proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>Concept</b> (<b>PoCs)</b> projects. By exploiting workflow tools and HPC capabilities we show how to formalise the engineering design and optimisation process, thus providing accountability and Quality Assurance. Using SharePoint, we demonstrate advanced engineering search capabilities and data management, seamlessly integrating existing data across multiple locations. Locating and retaining knowledge within an enterprise infrastructure is often difficult. Much of the knowledge is retained within people and social networks within organisations. Through the natural cycle of people and the difficulty in locating relevant information, much knowledge is lost or not utilised. We demonstrate how to capture and retain knowledge, exposing it through an extensible framework, providing a persistent audit trail detailing the thought process behind decisions. By abstracting infrastructure, audit and QA from engineering design we can improve the understanding of design processes thus improving overall engineering process. In combination, these approaches {{pave the way for}} providing significant reduction in time to insight and execution of scientific investigation and engineering design in real-world applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of both fronthaul and backhaul {{into a single}} transport network (namely, 5 G-Crosshaul) is envisioned for the future 5 G transport networks. This requires a fully integrated and unified management of the fronthaul and backhaul resources in a cost-efficient, scalable and flexible way through the deployment of an SDN/NFV control framework. This paper presents the designed 5 G-Crosshaul architecture, two selected SDN/NFV applications targeting for cost-efficient resource and energy usage: the Resource Management Application (RMA) and the Energy Management and Monitoring Application (EMMA). The former manages 5 G-Crosshaul resources (network, computing and storage resources). The latter is a special version of RMA with {{the focus on the}} objectives of optimizing the energy consumption and minimizing the energy footprint of the 5 G-Crosshaul infrastructure. Besides, EMMA is applied to the mmWave mesh network and the high speed train scenarios. In particular, we present the key application design with their main components and the interactions {{with each other and with}} the control plane, and then we present the proposed application optimization algorithms along with initial results. The first results demonstrate that the proposed RMA is able to cost-efficiently utilize the Crosshaul resources of heterogeneous technologies, while EMMA can achieve significant energy savings through energy-efficient routing of traffic flows. For experiments in real system, we also set up <b>Proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>Concepts</b> (<b>PoCs)</b> for both applications in order to perform real trials in the field...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{tropical}} Africa, {{where the}} spectrum of the bacterial pathogens that cause fevers is poorly understood and molecular-based diagnostic laboratories are rare, the time lag between test results and patient care is a critical point for treatment of disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: We implemented POC laboratory in rural Senegal to resolve the time lag between test results and patient care. During {{the first year of}} the study (February 2011 to January 2012), 440 blood specimens from febrile patients were collected in Dielmo and Ndiop villages. All samples were screened for malaria, dengue fever, Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii, Tropheryma whipplei, Rickettsia conorii, R. africae, R. felis, and Bartonella spp. Conclusions/Significance: We identified DNA from at least one pathogenic bacterium in 80 / 440 (18. 2 %) of the samples from febrile patients. B. crocidurae was identified in 35 cases (9. 5 %), and R. felis DNA was found in 30 cases (6. 8 %). The DNA of Bartonella spp. was identified in 23 / 440 cases (4. 3 %), and DNA of C. burnetii was identified in 2 cases (0. 5 %). T. whipplei (0. 2 %) was diagnosed in one patient. No DNA of R. africae or R. conorii was identified. Among the 7 patients co-infected by two different bacteria, we found R. felis and B. crocidurae in 4 cases, B. crocidurae and Bartonella spp. in 2 cases, and B. crocidurae and C. burnetii in 1 case. Malaria was diagnosed in 54 cases. In total, at least one pathogen (bacterium or protozoa) was identified in 127 / 440 (28. 9 %) of studied samples.

This research expands CEC applications in cancer biomarker and chiral CE analysis. Chapter 1 is a review of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE/MS) for analysis of metabolites in prostate cancer diagnostics and therapies. In this chapter, a literature survey was performed within the databases PubMed, 4 Caplus/Webline and Web of Sciences. A total 17 studies reporting on various analytical platforms for metabolite identification in prostate cancer research, which often include case-control comparison were identified and reviewed. Chapter 2 described the analysis of metabolite biomarkers in prostate cancer tissues by capillary electrochromatography mass spectrometry. In this chapter, a capillary CEC–MS/MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination and separation <b>of</b> eight <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> (<b>POC)</b> metabolites (betaine, malate, proline, N-acetyl aspartate, N-acetylglucosamine, uracil, xanthine, and alanine) as potential prostate cancer diagnostic markers.

After CEC separation, samples were analyzed by a triple–quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode. After optimization, the data showed that the CEC-MS/MS method using monolithic column achieved a much better chromatographic selectivity compared to coated columns and increased sensitivity than bare fused silica column The effect of mobile phase pH, ACN percentage and additive were studies. Under the optimum mobile phase conditions, this method was carried out to separate and detect eight metabolites in the biopsy sample. The LOD for the metabolites is between 50 nM- 100 nM. This method has successfully used to examine patients’ prostate cancer with an accuracy of 95 %.

By varying the linker (amide and carbamate), head group (alanine, leucine, and valine) and chain length (C 8, C 10 and C 12) of the amino acid bound surfactants; monolithic column was made to ultimately understand the factors governing chiral stationary solid phase. Through the comparison of system parameters, we can see that surfactant head group, linker and chain length affect the separation of achiral and chiral compounds. Also, with the same type surfactant, data was presented to show how the trend of LSER parameters and how it affects separation between in CEC.

40|$|Cyber-attacks have {{nowadays}} {{become more}} frightening than ever before. The growing dependency {{of our society}} on networked systems aggravates these threats; from interconnected corporate networks and Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) to smart households, the attack surface for the adversaries is increasing. At the same time, it is becoming evident that the utilization of classic fields of security research alone, e. g., cryptography, or the usage of isolated traditional defense mechanisms, e. g., firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), {{is not enough to}} cope with the imminent security challenges. To move beyond monolithic approaches and concepts that follow a “cat and mouse” paradigm between the defender and the attacker, cyber-security research requires novel schemes. One such promis- ing approach is collaborative intrusion detection. Driven by the lessons learned from cyber-security research over the years, the aforesaid notion attempts to connect two instinctive questions: “if we acknowledge the fact that no security mechanism can detect all attacks, can we beneficially combine multiple approaches to operate together?” and “as the adversaries increasingly collaborate (e. g., Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks from whichever larger botnets) to achieve their goals, can the defenders beneficially collude too?”. Collabora- tive intrusion detection attempts to address the emerging security challenges by providing methods for IDSs and other security mech- anisms (e. g., firewalls and honeypots) to combine their knowledge towards generating a more holistic view of the monitored network. This thesis improves {{the state of the art}} in collaborative intrusion detection in several areas. In particular, the dissertation proposes methods for the detection of complex attacks and the generation of the corresponding intrusion detection signatures. Moreover, a novel approach for the generation of alert datasets is given, which can assist researchers in evaluating intrusion detection algorithms and systems. Furthermore, a method for the construction of communities of collab- orative monitoring sensors is given, along with a domain-awareness approach that incorporates an efficient data correlation mechanism. With regard to attacks and countermeasures, a detailed methodology is presented that is focusing on sensor-disclosure attacks in the con- text of collaborative intrusion detection. The scientific contributions can be structured into the following categories: Alert data generation: This thesis deals with the topic of alert data generation in a twofold manner: first it presents novel approaches for detecting complex attacks towards generating alert signatures for IDSs; second a method for the synthetic generation of alert data is pro- posed. In particular, a novel security mechanism for mobile devices is proposed that is able to support users in assessing the security status of their networks. The system can detect sophisticated attacks and generate signatures to be utilized by IDSs. The dissertation also touches the topic of synthetic, yet realistic, dataset generation for the evaluation of intrusion detection algorithms and systems; it proposes a novel dynamic dataset generation concept that overcomes the short- comings of the related work. Collaborative intrusion detection: As a first step, the the- sis proposes a novel taxonomy for collaborative intrusion detection ac- companied with building blocks for Collaborative IDSs (CIDSs). More- over, the dissertation deals with the topics of (alert) data correlation and aggregation in the context of CIDSs. For this, a number of novel methods are proposed that aim at improving the clustering of mon- itoring sensors that exhibit similar traffic patterns. Furthermore, a novel alert correlation approach is presented that can minimize the messaging overhead of a CIDS. Attacks on CIDSs: It is common for research on cyber-defense to switch its perspective, taking on the viewpoint of attackers, trying to anticipate their remedies against novel defense approaches. The the- sis follows such an approach by focusing on a certain class of attacks on CIDSs that aim at identifying the network location of the monitor- ing sensors. In particular, the state of the art is advanced by proposing a novel scheme for the improvement of such attacks. Furthermore, the dissertation proposes novel mitigation techniques to overcome both the state of art and the proposed improved attacks. Evaluation: All the proposals and methods introduced in the dis- sertation were evaluated qualitatively, quantitatively and empirically. A comprehensive study of the state of the art in collaborative intru- sion detection was conducted via a qualitative approach, identifying research gaps and surveying the related work. To study the effective- ness of the proposed algorithms and systems extensive simulations were utilized. Moreover, the applicability and usability of some of the contributions in the area of alert data generation was additionally supported via <b>Proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>Concepts</b> (<b>PoCs)</b> and prototypes.

40|$|Since 2000 {{there has}} been a {{significant}} development in the number of applications based on XML and Data Warehouses. As these types of applications need to interact with different technologies and other applications, interoperability is an important factor. In parallel, in the same period {{there has been}} an evolution of the economic data needed by companies and financial institutions, increasing the number of entities that need more information, but also requiring this information to be reliable and on time. That economic or financial information is reliable does not refer to encoding or transmission errors, since there were already enough reliable procedures for this in 2000, but that these reports have to be semantically correct. It is in this decade that the need for economists and accountants to obtain their reports with semantic content has been observed. For this reason some specifications for the transmission of economic information have arisen, such as the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX). The reports of both specifications have semantic content and are dedicated to sending and processing financial and / or statistical information. However, both specifications were created by expert economists or statisticians, and their only purpose was to solve their problems without formalizing their definitions and conceptual rules, because there is a Conceptual Model and the Logical Model created is very close to the Physical Model, that is to say, to its implementation. The aim of this thesis is to formalize the specification of economic financial reports using the XBRL specification, analysing and auditing that specification. In addition, the design of these reports is studied in depth by making use of the methodology of the Model Driven Architecture (MDA), with the ultimate goal of analysing its interoperability. Finally, some <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>concept</b> are shown, with different validations that are the proposal of the thesis. The thesis begins by analysing the necessity of this specification (XBRL), its historical origin, and the general state of the art that has led to the use of it as a de facto standard. In addition, this research work studies its evolution and utilization, both historically, as it is today, and its expected future. Once {{the state of the art}} of economic financial semantic reports has been analysed, the next step is to analyse the XBRL specification. After giving an overview of the XBRL language or specification, the thesis begins to detail it and finally shows the set of meta-metadata used in XBRL, using UML. This thesis proposes designing both the metadata of the reports and the reports themselves. This research work also proposes to study the different implementations of these reports and their design in totality. MDA provides a good consolidated framework for automatic code generation in the life cycle of software development, in addition to solving the problems of heterogeneity and interoperability between systems with different platforms. One of the main challenges of this research is the formalization of the specification in the conceptual model. Different types of design are also discussed, including those already making intensive use of dimensions (European design) and making less use of dimensions (mainly US and Canadian design). This work is mainly based on the reports of the European Supervision - Regulation, thus making intensive use of dimensions. This is due to the fact that the author of this thesis belongs to various groups that deal with harmonised European supervision reports and is a civil servant of the Bank of Spain, and this institution is part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), and this in turn through the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European National Central Banks (NCBs) participates in the Eurosystem (monetary Authority in the Eurozone (Eurosystems)). Therefore the conceptual model proposed in this research is the Multidimensional Data Model (MDM). The proposal is based on reports defined for the European Supervision/Regulation. These reports are the data requested of financial institutions or supervised companies, being the Universe of the Discourse (UD), also called the Computation Independent Model (CIM), using the methodology of the MDA. Once the definitions are fulfilled the next step is analysing the processes of validation of this proposal, showing algorithms for the MDM and the process of generating assertions, or formulas in the XBRL Data Model (XBRLDM) data. In addition, its implementation is displayed in the logical and physical models. The entire proposal is supported by different <b>Proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Concept</b> (<b>POCs)</b> submitted in specialized forums of the European financial and economic supervision. These tests are based on three European taxonomies: Financial Report 2008 (FINREP), 2012 and Solvency II (Eurofiling 2015). FINREP taxonomy is sponsored by the European Banking Authority (EBA). Solvency II codifies and harmonizes the regulation of insurance in the European Union (EU) and is sponsored by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). In these POCs all the proposals of this thesis are shown and analysed. In addition, tables show the different tests that show the validation of this proposal at the various levels of the MDA methodology. In addition, the interoperability of economic financial reports, and their need for mapping XBRL, spreadsheets, Access, Database Management System (DBMS), XML and others are analysed. Finally, research work that has to be done in the immediate future as a result of this thesis is proposed.

40|$|Current X-ray telescopes such as Chandra and XMM were {{designed}} and built to privilege the angular resolution or the collecting area respectively, but using two different manufacturing techniques, and these two key aspects could not be optimised at the same time. The {{result is that the}} high-redshift X-ray Universe is still too unresolved to provide us with the understanding of the time evolution of the universe as we see it nowadays. Now the ATHENA mission, approved for the L 2 slot in the Cosmic Vision program, is required to have an effective area of 2 m 2 at 1 keV and an angular resolution better than 5 arcsec Half-Energy Width (HEW). At this regard, in addition to the baseline solution based on Silicon Pore Optics (SPO), thin glass foils are considered a viable alternative. Slumped glass foils are also considered as substrates for X-ray optics being developed in other projects; for example, the X-ray Surveyor mission being developed at SAO/CfA in USA, and the AXYOM project being developed in Italy. They both foresee the use of piezo-electric actuators to correct the shape errors of the mirrors. The Brera Astronomical Observatory (INAF-OAB, Merate - Italy) has been working, from 2009 till 2013, under ESA contract aimed to develop in Europe a Slumped Glass Optics (SGO) technology, alternative to the one based on silicon pores, and based on the slumping of thin glass foils, in parallel to the work being carried out at NASA/GSFC and other institutes. The INAFOAB innovation is the use of pressure in the hot slumping process to replicate the mould figure. This technology is coupled with an integration process able to damp low frequency errors. My Ph. D. activity, carried out at the INAF-OAB, is devoted to the advancement in the hot slumping technology assisted by pressure, for the production of glass mirrors for future X-ray telescopes. As a preliminary work, I have developed a new method to precisely characterise the mid frequency errors of the glass foils. An existing model, developed by Jimenez-Garate in 2003 to account for the relaxation of ripples in the slumped glass foil when in contact with the slumping mould, was modified to include the application of pressure, and the model was compared to the experimental results. The pressure was found to be essential, also from the the theory viewpoint, to reduce mid-frequency errors in the profile of slumped glass foils, which crucially degrade the performances of the optics. As for the slumping process, I have introduced a new glass material (Corning Eagle XG) combined with the Schott Zerodur K 20, already chosen at earlier times as slumping mould material for its anti-sticking properties. I have developed cleaning protocols, used different thermal cycles and different pressures conditions, and reconditioned the pressure control system. I have also optimised the mould height with experiments based on Finite Element Analysis, and reduced the thermal gradients inside the mould and the glass foils. The final result obtained in this research are slumped glass foils with angular resolution improved from the initial 7 arcsec to 2. 2 ± 0. 3 arcsec in single reflection, as expected from metrology at 1 keV X-ray energy and 0. 7 incidence angle, and computed by simulating a perfect integration. This result has to be compared with 2 arcsec defined as the error budget allocated for the slumped glass foils. About 1 arcsec is due to replication of the mid-frequency errors in the slumping mould which, owing to the improved result in the slumping, are now a limiting factor in the quality of the slumped glass foils. From the roughness point of view, the contribution to the HEW is guaranteed to be less then 1 arcsec at 1 keV, with an rms improvement from 21 to 11 Å throughout my Ph. D. Moreover, the last tests carried out proved that the roughness of the slumped glass foils can be further reduced to _ 7 Å, making the technology attractive also for higher X-ray energies and higher incidence angles. The glass foils slumped during this Ph. D. have been used for the production <b>of</b> two SGO <b>Proof</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Concept</b> prototypes (<b>POC)</b> for the ATHENA mission: the POC# 3, (with 2 glass foils assembled) is characterised by HEW value of 5. 5 arcsec at 0. 27 keV in the best portion of the module, as tested at the PANTER facility; the POC# 4 (with 8 glass foils) has expected HEW of about 15 arcsec from metrological data, but the result in X-ray was much higher because of accidental problems during the integration. The next prototype, the POC# 5 (with the best eight glass foils produced during my Ph. D. activity), will soon be integrated and tested in X-rays, to assess the improvement already proven by metrology and simulations. Some of the produced slumped glass foils have also been used for studies of active profile corrections with piezoelectric elements, both for the AXYOM project and X-ray Surveyor mission. Alternative materials and techniques have been used in this research to further improve the result. To reduce the surface micro-roughness of the slumped glass foils, I have proven that the slumping technique with pressure application can also be suited in the indirect slumping, in which the optical surface of the glass is not in contact with the mould, thus preserving its initial surface smoothness. Moreover, the dip coating technique was studied to fill the micro-pores present {{on the surface of the}} glass foils slumped with the direct technique. Alternative materials for the slumping mould were tested, defining Si 3 N 4 as a very promising candidate, owing to its higher rigidity with respect to Zerodur K 20 and therefore preferable to avoid mould deformations with the slumping, as experienced with K 20. The Gorilla glass (normally used for smartphones and tablets), was proven to preserve the surface quality of the glass foils, once slumped and chemically tempered to increase the mirror endurance against the vibrations experienced at launch. Finally, I have also studied the scattering and the reflectivity properties of multilayer coatings for X-ray optics. I have upgraded an IDL code to simulate the roughness growth in the multilayer deposition process, extending the computations from periodic to the more general case of graded multilayers. I have also contributed to the X-ray measurements at the BEAR beamline of the Elettra synchrotron in Trieste, on multilayers deposited on glass, silicon and electroformed nickel, for the polarimetric LAMP projec...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} JRC <b>Proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>Concept</b> (<b>PoC)</b> programme {{was established}} {{with the aim}} of encouraging researchers to further develop and exploit innovative technologies arising from research activities, by way of transforming them into products, processes and services for the benefit of society at large {{as well as for the}} market place. The program provides financial resources for technology development activities, prototyping, and market feasibility studies. The JRC budget, thus, not only funds research to support all stages of the European level policy cycle, but also allows researchers to undertake innovative work in relation to novel, original, and proprietary technologies.

Traditionally, such organisations discard data related to customer enquiries within {{a relatively short period}} of time due to limited storage capacity. However, in recent years, the value of retaining and analysing this information has become clear, enabling call centres to identify customer patterns, improve first call resolution and maximise daily closure rates. This paper proposes a <b>Proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>Concept</b> (<b>PoC)</b> end to end solution that utilises the Hadoop programming model, extended ecosystem and the Mahout Big Data Analytics library for categorising similar support calls for large technical support data sets. The proposed solution is evaluated on a VMware technical support dataset.|$|E

The exploratory study was conducted using a single case study of a hardware retailer stocking 5000 product lines provided by 110 active suppliers. To analyze the present mode of operation, procedural documents, semi-structured interviews and a participant observation was conducted. The basis for the proof of concept was a future mode of operation using a quasi-experimental design. Results indicate that in a small-to-medium retail environment, RFID technology could act as a loss prevention mechanism, an enabler for locating misplaced stock, and make {{a significant contribution to}} the overall improvement of the delivery process...|$|E
