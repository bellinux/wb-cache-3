25|$|Facilitation of {{non-native}} species, {{either by}} native species or other non-native species, {{may increase the}} invasibility of a community, or {{the ease with which}} non-native species become established in a community. In an examination of 254 published studies of introduced species, 22 of 190 interactions studied between introduced species in the studies were facilitative. It is worth noting that 128 of the 190 examined interactions were predator–prey relationships of a single <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insect</b> reported in a single study, which may have overemphasized the importance of negative interactions. Introduced plants are also facilitated by native pollinators, dispersers, and mycorrhizae. Thus, positive interactions must be considered in any attempt to understand the invasibility of a community.|$|E

50|$|Insect mandibles are {{as diverse}} in form as their food. For instance, {{grasshoppers}} {{and many other}} <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insects</b> have sharp-edged mandibles that move side to side. Most butterflies and moths lack mandibles as they mainly feed on nectar from flowers.|$|R
5|$|Omphalea, {{like many}} {{other members of the}} Euphorbiaceae, {{possesses}} leaf nectaries that attract polistine wasps, which are predators of early instar caterpillars. The leaf nectaries also attract ants. The ants usually protect their host plant, eating both the nectar and <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insects</b> on it. However, they generally completely ignore Chrysiridia caterpillars, making it likely that the caterpillars possess a chemical deterrent as a primary defence. This chemical deterrent comes from the host plants. Omphalea species contain polyhydroxy alkaloids potentially sequestered or excreted by the caterpillar, the pupa and the adult moth.|$|R

50|$|The {{common alder}} is {{important}} to wildlife all year round and the seeds are a useful winter food for birds. Deer, sheep, hares and rabbits feed on the tree and it provides shelter for livestock in winter. It shades the water of rivers and streams, moderating the water temperature, and this benefits fish which also find safety among its exposed roots in times of flood. The common alder is the foodplant of the larvae {{of a number of}} different butterflies and moths and is associated with over 140 species of <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insect.</b> The tree is also a host to a variety of mosses and lichens which particularly flourish in the humid moist environment of streamside trees. Some common lichens found growing on the trunk and branches include tree lungwort (Lobaria pulmonaria), Menneguzzia terebrata and Stenocybe pullatula, the last of which is restricted to alders. Some 47 species of mycorrhizal fungi have been found growing in symbiosis with the common alder, both partners benefiting from an exchange of nutrients. As well as several species of Naucoria, these symbionts include Russula alnetorum, the milkcaps Lactarius obscuratus and Lactarius cyathula, and the alder roll-rim Paxillus filamentosus, all of which grow nowhere else except in association with alders. In spring, the catkin cup Ciboria amentacea grows on fallen alder catkins.|$|E
50|$|Extrafloral nectaries (also {{known as}} extranuptial nectaries) are nectar-secreting plant glands that develop outside {{of flowers and}} are not {{involved}} in pollination. They are highly diverse in form, location, size, and mechanism. They have been described in virtually all above-ground plant parts - including leaves (in which case they are known as foliar nectaries), petioles, stipules, cotyledons, fruits, and stems, among others. They range from single-celled trichomes to complex cup-like structures {{that may or may not}} be vascularized. In contrast to floral nectaries, nectar produced outside the flower generally have a defensive function. The nectar attracts predatory insects which will eat both the nectar and any <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insects</b> around, thus functioning as 'bodyguards'. Foraging predatory insects show a preference for plants with extrafloral nectaries, particularly some species of ants and wasps, which have been observed to directly defend the plants. Among passion flowers, for example, extrafloral nectaries prevent herbivores by attracting ants and deterring two species of butterflies from laying eggs. In many carnivorous plants, extrafloral nectaries are also used to attract insect prey.|$|R
500|$|Banded sugar ants are omnivores {{and feed}} on sweet substances. They tend <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insects</b> such as aphids, and {{feed on the}} fluids they secrete. Honeydew {{secretions}} are produced from the anus of the aphid, which is later provided to the ants. This behaviour is mutually beneficial to both organisms, as the ants protect the aphids from predation and the aphids provides a nutritious liquid to the ants. Banded sugar ants also tend the larvae of the southern purple azure butterfly (Ogyris genoveva). They are visitors to flowers of Eucalyptus globulus trees, where they can act as pollinators. They may be [...] seen at night foraging under lights in urban areas for arthropod prey, such as termites and the southern cattle tick (Rhipicephalus microplus). During the night, banded sugar ants are known to [...] "rob" [...] food sources excreted by Hemiptera insects that are fed on by meat ants during the day. Banded sugar ants and meat ants tend to nest near one another, and areas where the two ants forage have shorter foraging periods due to interference between the species. However, banded sugar ants are nocturnal while meat ants are not, so foraging periods are extended by one or two hours if no interference occurs.|$|R
40|$|Insects ("Bugs " is {{actually}} a specific term for <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insects,</b> not a generic term for all insects) in Hawai'i eat {{a wide variety of}} foods: there are those which plague our living plants and animals, and those which are attracted to non-living organic materials: wood of all kinds, paper, paste and glue, tapa, gourds, lauhala and other dried plant material, feathers, horn, fur, leather, cotton, wool and linen. Insects can work quickly to damage the things we care about. Insect activity is not something that will "go away " of its own accord. In Hawai'i, because of our climate, we have to monitor, prevent and react to insect activity continually. This handout will help you to identify insects and the problems caused by them, and give you some ideas about what to do to prevent or stop them. In many cases, the adult insect locates a food source which will nourish its offspring, and lays its eggs on that material. The young larvae ("grubs, maggots, caterpillars") do the damage, consuming the food as they mature. As adults, some of these insects (e. g., wood-boring beetles, clothesmoths) do not eat at all, but merely mate, reproduce and die. With termites, cockroaches and silverfish, however, the adults also subsist on our possessions. It is important to understand the life cycle of these insects, s...|$|R
40|$|For plant-eating insects, {{we still}} have only a nascent {{understanding}} of the genetic basis of host-use promiscuity. Here, to improve that situation, we investigated host-induced gene expression plasticity in the invasive lobate lac scale insect, Paratachardina pseudolobata (Hemiptera: Keriidae). We were {{particularly interested in the}} differential expression of detoxification and effector genes, which are thought to be critical for overcoming a plant's chemical defenses. We collected RNA samples from P. pseudolobata on three different host plant species, assembled transcriptomes de novo, and identified transcripts with significant host-induced gene expression changes. Gene expression plasticity was pervasive, but the expression of most detoxification and effector genes was insensitive to the host environment. Nevertheless, some types of detoxification genes were more differentially expressed than expected by chance. Moreover, we found evidence of a trade-off between expression of genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism; hosts that induced lower expression of genes for detoxification induced higher expression of genes for growth. Our findings are largely consonant with those of several recently published studies of other <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insect</b> species. Thus, across <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insect</b> species, there may be a common set of gene expression changes that enable host-use promiscuity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGlasshouse tomato {{production}} {{is reduced by}} the whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum, a major worldwide pest of glasshouse crops. Whitefly control is achieved using pesticides or parasitoids, which have drawbacks. There is thus a need for other control methods. For instance, the use of volatile compounds from plant odours could profoundly change the behaviour of <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insects.</b> This practice should be safe because plant odours are usually harmless to humans. Therefore, we have studied the effect of plant volatiles on whiteflies feeding on tomato plants. The rationale was to use the confusion effect by supplying whiteflies with a super-abundance of volatiles. We removed plant headspace volatiles from multiple whitefly host plants. Then, we presented these volatiles to whiteflies feeding on tomato plants. At the same time, whitefly stylet penetration is monitored using electrical penetration graphs (EPG). Plant colonisation, egg laying and honeydew production are analysed in separate experiments. Data are compared to controls in which extracted volatiles from tomato and air alone are presented to the whiteflies. The only significant effect produced by exposure to multiple-host volatiles is a pronounced reduction {{in the incidence of}} phloem-related waveforms during the 15 -h EPG recording. This represents a delay in, rather than a cessation of, phloem-related activities as there is no related reduction in long-term performance. The confusion effect thus does not appear to exert strong effects on whitefly behaviour here...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{management}} {{not only}} affects biodiversity but also might alter ecosystem processes {{mediated by the}} organisms, i. e. herbivory the removal of plant biomass by <b>plant-eating</b> <b>insects</b> and other arthropod groups. Aiming at revealing general relationships between forest management and herbivory we investigated aboveground arthropod herbivory in 105 plots dominated by European beech in three different regions in Germany in the sun-exposed canopy of mature beech trees and on beech saplings in the understorey. We separately assessed damage by different guilds of herbivores, i. e. chewing, sucking and scraping herbivores, gall-forming insects and mites, and leaf-mining insects. We asked whether herbivory differs among different forest management regimes (unmanaged, uneven-aged managed, even-aged managed) and among age-classes within even-aged forests. We further tested for consistency of relationships between regions, strata and herbivore guilds. On average, almost 80 % of beech leaves showed herbivory damage, and about 6 % of leaf area was consumed. Chewing damage was most common, whereas leaf sucking and scraping damage were very rare. Damage was generally greater in the canopy than in the understorey, in particular for chewing and scraping damage, and the occurrence of mines. There was little difference in herbivory among differently managed forests {{and the effects of}} management on damage differed among regions, strata and damage types. Covariates such as wood volume, tree density and plant diversity weakly influenced herbivory, and effects differed between herbivory types. We conclude that despite of the relatively lo...|$|R
50|$|Like {{all other}} {{hymenopteran}} insects, sawflies {{go through a}} complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages - egg, larva, pupa and adult. Many species are parthenogenetic, meaning that females {{do not need to}} reproduce to fertilise their eggs. Unfertilized eggs develop as male, fertilized eggs develop into females, see Arrhenotoky.The lifespan of an individual sawfly is two months to two years, though the adult life stage is often very short (approximately 7 - 9 days), only long enough for the females to lay their eggs. The female uses its ovipositor to drill into plant material to lay her eggs (though the family Orussoidea lay their eggs in other <b>insects).</b> <b>Plant-eating</b> sawflies most commonly are associated with leafy material but some specialize on wood, and the ovipositors of these species (such as the family Siricidae) are specially adapted for the task of drilling through bark. Once the incision has been made, the female will lay as many as 30 to 90 eggs. Females avoid the shade when laying their eggs because the larvae develop much slower and may not even survive, and they may not also survive if they are laid on immature and glaucous leaves. Hence, female sawflies search for young adult leaves to lay their eggs on.|$|R
