2500|$|The rifle was {{equipped}} with a firing-pin lock {{on the left side}} of the receiver, which acted as a safety. [...] Pushing down on the slide-type lever unlocked the firing <b>pin</b> <b>striker</b> and made the weapon ready to fire.|$|E
50|$|Ambidextrous Manual Decocking Lever. Accessible by {{the thumb}} of a right- or left-handed shooter, it was spring-loaded. When pushed down, the rear {{part of the}} firing <b>pin</b> (<b>striker)</b> rotated out of {{alignment}} with the front part of the firing pin.|$|E
50|$|The CZ 110 is a striker-fired pistol; {{the firing}} <b>pin</b> (<b>striker)</b> can be fully cocked by the slide {{retraction}} cycle and then, if immediate fire is not required, {{can be brought}} down to rest by the decocking lever. The only other safeties are an automated firing pin block and a loaded chamber indicator. The CZ 110 also features an accessory rail for tactical flash lights and laser pointers.|$|E

500|$|Next was Matt Striker versus Balls Mahoney in a [...] "Striker's Rules" [...] match, a {{match with}} [...] "no gouging of the eyes, no pulling of the hair, no {{maneuvers}} {{off the top}} rope and, most importantly, no foul language". Mahoney won the match after he performed a spinebuster and <b>pinned</b> <b>Striker</b> for the victory.|$|R
5000|$|Firing: firing <b>pin</b> or <b>striker</b> impacts primer igniting {{the main}} {{propellant}} charge.|$|R
50|$|The M9 {{features}} multiple internal safeties, {{including a}} firing pin block that prevents {{the firing pin}} from moving without the trigger being pulled, and a firing <b>pin</b> <b>striker</b> that rotates when the safety lever is engaged preventing the firing pin from being hit even if the hammer falls. The M9 also has an ambidextrous external safety lever allowing both left and right handed people to engage or disengage the safety mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Drill rounds are inert {{versions}} of cartridges used {{for education and}} practice during military training. Other than the lack of propellant and primer, {{these are the same}} size as normal cartridges and will fit into the mechanism of a gun {{in the same way as}} a live cartridge does. Because dry-firing (releasing the firing pin with an empty chamber) a gun can sometimes lead to firing <b>pin</b> (<b>striker)</b> damage, dummy rounds termed snap caps are designed to protect centerfire guns from possible damage during [...] "dry-fire" [...] trigger control practices.|$|E
5000|$|The Reising entered {{military}} service {{primarily because of}} uncertainty of supply of sufficient quantities of the Thompson submachine gun. In the testing stage, it won out over some other competing designs. It was very light and quite accurate in aimed fire, and [...] "capable of intensive fire against personnel within a range of 300 yards." [...] This was attributed to its better stock fit and intricate closed bolt, delayed blowback design, though its firepower was somewhat limited due to the 20-round capacity of its largest magazine. Most submachine guns fire from the open bolt position, meaning {{the full weight of}} the bolt slams forward when the trigger is pulled; with the Reising, only a lightweight firing <b>pin</b> <b>striker</b> moves when the trigger is pulled.|$|E

50|$|Their high {{reliability}} and low cost make them very popular {{for use in}} weapons. A typical example is using shear pins in an explosive device. A shear pin can here hold a <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> in place, preventing the <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> from striking an initiator (primer) unless the correct force is applied. That force can be the acceleration of a rifle grenade being launched. The force would snap the shear <b>pin,</b> allowing the <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> to move backwards onto a primer, which in turn ignites a pyrotechnic delay composition for auto destruction. In this use shear <b>pins</b> prevent the <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> from hitting the primer during handling or if the grenade was dropped by accident. Additionally, shear-pins are frequently used in anti-tank mine fuzes, {{to prevent them from}} being triggered by much lighter, non-target vehicles such as motorcycles. Typically, the shear-pin in an anti-tank mine is designed to snap (and release the spring-loaded firing pin) when a weight in excess of 150 kilograms is applied to the pressure plate.|$|R
50|$|Typically, firing <b>pins</b> or <b>strikers</b> {{are made}} from steel, {{aluminum}} alloy or titanium. However, for specialist applications such as zero metal mines, non-metallic materials are used e.g. glass ceramic.|$|R
5000|$|Firing round {{by way of}} {{a firing}} <b>pin</b> or <b>striker</b> (except for {{aircraft}} medium caliber using electric ignition primers) hitting the primer that ignites the powder when bolt reaches locked position.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{match that}} aired was the tag team {{encounter}} between MNM and The Hardy Boyz. After a {{back and forth}} match, which lasted over 20 minutes, MNM performed a flapjack DDT on Jeff. During a pinfall attempt, Matt Hardy made the save and performed a double neckbreaker on both members of MNM. Jeff then Swanton bombed Nitro and made the winning pin. Next was Matt Striker versus Balls Mahoney in a [...] "Striker's Rules" [...] match, a match with [...] "no gouging of the eyes, no pulling of the hair, no maneuvers off the top rope and, most importantly, no foul language". Mahoney won the match after he performed a spinebuster and <b>pinned</b> <b>Striker</b> for the victory.|$|R
25|$|External trip indicator— similar {{function}} to <b>striker</b> <b>pin,</b> {{but can be}} externally attached (using clips) to a compatible fuse.|$|R
50|$|The firing <b>pin</b> or <b>striker</b> is {{generally}} {{located in the}} bolt of a repeating firearm. Firearms {{that do not have}} bolts, such as revolvers and many types of single-shot actions, generally have a very short firing pin in the frame, or else attached to the hammer itself. These types of firearms are almost never striker fired, as there is insufficient space to house a striker mechanism. Strikers are most commonly found in semi-automatic pistols and bolt-action firearms.|$|R
50|$|A semi or full-automatic firearm {{which is}} said to fire from a closed bolt is one where, when ready to fire, a round is in the chamber and the bolt and working parts are forward. When the trigger is pulled the firing <b>pin</b> or <b>striker</b> fires the round, the action is cycled by {{the energy of the}} shot sending the bolt to the rear which {{extracts}} and ejects the empty cartridge case, the bolt then goes forward feeding a fresh round from the magazine into the chamber, ready for the next shot.|$|R
50|$|A firing <b>pin</b> or <b>striker</b> {{is part of}} {{the firing}} {{mechanism}} used in a firearm or explosive device e.g. an M14 landmine or bomb fuze. Firing pins may take many forms, though the types used in fuzes for single-use devices (such as landmines, artillery shells, cluster munitions and grenades etc.) generally have a sharpened point. In contrast, firing pins used in firearms usually have a small, rounded portion designed to strike the primer of a cartridge, detonating the priming compound, which then ignites the propellant (inside) or fires the detonator and booster.|$|R
50|$|Strikers are {{basically}} spring-loaded firing pins, generally of a one- or two-piece construction. In the one-piece striker, the striker {{is turned on}} a lathe out of a round bar of metal, much larger in diameter than a firing pin, to provide the mass required to detonate the primer. Two-piece strikers generally consist of a firing pin attached to a heavier rear section—in essence a hammer attached {{to the base of}} a firing <b>pin.</b> Two-piece <b>strikers</b> are commonly found on bolt-action rifles, while single-piece strikers are found on pistols, such as the Glock.|$|R
50|$|Lock time is {{the time}} between {{the release of the}} sear and the {{ignition}} of the cartridge. A lengthy lock time gives time for the shooter to drift off target, and so it is advantageous to minimize the lock time and reduce the window for error. Reductions in lock time are generally performed by lightening parts that move as part of the firing operation, such as the hammer and firing <b>pin</b> or <b>striker,</b> shortening to distance parts that move as part of the firing operation have to cover, and using a more powerful spring. Further reductions in lock time, to near zero levels, can be achieved with electrical primers.|$|R
50|$|The bolt {{contained}} no firing <b>pin</b> or <b>striker,</b> just a ceramic cap that would electronically detonate the primer via the battery charge. The cartridge {{was designed by}} Hubert Usel and {{is known as the}} Usel Caseless Cartridge (UCC). The round was encased in a block of solid nitrocellulose and because it was not an automatic rifle it did not have the problems with cooking-off that plagued earlier military attempts such as the Heckler & Koch G11, in which the built up heat of sustained fire caused rounds to detonate immediately upon entering the chamber, releasing more heat, and often resulting in an uncontrollable burst of automatic fire until the magazine was emptied (although this is a risk in normal metallic cartridge firearms as well).|$|R
50|$|Pre-set {{triggers}} {{are only}} on autoloading pistols. In {{this case the}} pistol mechanism is always partially cocked while being carried and during firing. The partially cocked firing <b>pin</b> or <b>striker</b> is not cocked enough to cause an accidental release to discharge a cartridge, adding {{to the safety of}} the design, but is cocked enough to remove much of the trigger pull and weight of a purely double-action pistol. These types of pistols do not have external hammers and do not generally have a decock function. Common pistols in the category are the HS2000 (Springfield XD) and the various forms of the extremely popular Glock. The trigger pull of these guns is between double-action and single-action pistols. Pre-set triggers {{may or may not have}} a second-strike feature on a dud cartridge.|$|R
50|$|A {{study of}} the {{district}} located between the synagogue and the octagonal church showed that several families lived together in the patriarchal style, communally using the same courtyards and doorless internal passages. The houses had no hygienic facilities or drainage; the rooms were narrow. Most objects found were made of clay: pots, plates, amphoras, and lamps. Fish hooks, weights for fish nets, <b>striker</b> <b>pins,</b> weaving bobbins, and basalt mills for milling grain and pressing olives were also found (Loffreda, 1974).|$|R
25|$|The ECW Originals (Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, and The Sandman) took on The New Breed (Elijah Burke, Kevin Thorn, Marcus Cor Von, and Matt Striker) next. The match {{started off}} with Cor Von working over Sabu. That changed when Cor Von tagged Striker, who missed an elbow after {{whipping}} Sabu into the ropes, allowing The Sandman to get tagged. The Sandman dominated Striker, and eventually tagged Van Dam. Van Dam used also dominated Striker, but was poked in the eye, allowing Striker to tag in Burke. Burke had early success, but Van Dam regained the advantage and tagged The Sandman again. The Sandman worked on Burke until tagging Dreamer. Dreamer also beat down Burke until Cor Von received a blind tag and hit Dreamer from behind. Cor Von attacked Dreamer relentlessly and went over and punched Sabu, which distracted the referee and allowed Dreamer to be triple-teamed by Thorn, Burke, and Striker. Cor Von tagged in Burke who almost pinned Dreamer. Thorn entered next and almost performed his finishing move called the Original Sin. Dreamer managed to escape {{but was unable to}} tag his partners. Thorn tagged in Cor Von again who also almost pinned Dreamer. Cor Von tagged Thorn again, and Thorn resumed the beat down on Dreamer. Thorn tagged Striker next, and Striker attempted a suplex that Dreamer blocked and Dreamer suplexed Striker instead. Striker did not try to tag his partners and tried to stop Dreamer, but Dreamer tagged in Sabu. Sabu began to manhandle Striker and executed a leg drop from the top rope. Van Dam was then tagged in. Burke broke up Van Dam's pin attempt, which led to all competitors entering the ring. While the referee was distracted, Ariel gave Striker a chair. But Van Dam gave Striker an Van Daminator when he kicked the chair into Striker's face. Van Dam <b>pinned</b> <b>Striker</b> after a Five-Star Frog Splash to win the match for The Originals.|$|R
50|$|The fuze was {{worked by}} the user first {{unscrewing}} a plastic cap to expose a long, narrow cloth streamer with a curved lead weight attached to the end. Upon release from the hand or projector the weighted streamer would catch the air and quickly unwind {{from the top of}} the grenade, eventually withdrawing a loose safety pin from the fuze. With the <b>pin</b> removed the <b>striker</b> and detonator would be free to come into contact, which would happen due to the force of impact when the grenade struck a hard surface.|$|R
5000|$|The PT Mi-Ba (also {{known as}} the PT Mi-Ba-53) is a {{circular}} Bakelite cased Czechoslovakian minimum metal anti-tank blast mine. The mine entered service with the Czech and Slovakian armies in the 1950s and is now obsolete and no longer in service. The mine is conventional in layout with a central pressure plate, and doughnut shaped main charge around a booster charge and RO-7-II fuze. The mine's fuze is the only component that contains any metal, and this {{is limited to a}} spring, the <b>striker</b> <b>pin,</b> and the detonator capsule.|$|R
50|$|The Mk 4 mine or Mine G.S. Mk IV was a British {{anti-tank}} mine used during World War II. Externally the mine has a cylindrical main body filled with explosive either TNT or Baratol. The mine {{is covered by}} a pressure plate, which {{is attached to the}} mine body by four pins which sit in vertical slots in clips that fold up {{from the bottom of the}} mine. The mine uses the Shear-pin based Contact Mine Fuze No.3 Mk I. The fuze consists simply of a spring-loaded <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> restrained by a shear pin. Sufficient pressure on the pressure plate presses the plate down on the head of the fuze, breaking the shear wire and releasing the striker, which is driven into the detonator by the striker spring.|$|R
5000|$|Premature {{ignition}} {{of ammunition}} from {{heat in the}} chamber, known as cook-off, was a major problem with early prototypes of the G11 where synthetically bound nitrocellulose, formed into blocks, was used. Normally, when a bullet is fed into a chamber its case insulates the propellant from igniting until its impact-sensitive primer is struck by a firing <b>pin</b> or <b>striker.</b> The case aids in insulating the propellant from {{the heat of the}} chamber and it takes time for the temperature to rise sufficiently, inside a chambered round, to ignite the propellant. In addition, in a traditional rifle, extracting a hot case removes heat from the system. As a result of doing away with traditional cases, the G11 became a safety hazard and had to be withdrawn from the 1979 NATO trials. The high rate of fire and lack of cartridge cases made cooking-off a significant problem since the heat buildup in the G11 chamber was immense, due to the chamber having no provision for cooling, as with a reciprocating bolt system which allows hot air to leave the chamber when the bolt is retracted and the chamber is exposed to air. The vertically swivelling chamber furthermore made gas sealing at each end at such high pressures impractical, as opposed to a cross-sectional round-inside-round bolt-to-chamber fit with appropriate gas sealing [...]|$|R
50|$|The cave, {{because it}} had remains of the primary Cantabrian Solutrean and Magdalenian epochs, {{provided}} the basis for a chronological series for the 'wall' paintings. The excavations were old, most recently conducted by Dr. Jesus Carballo in 1951. There was a base level with ambiguous artefacts which, by their characteristics, seemed related to a possible Mousterian phase. Above that there rested a comparatively rich Solutrean level with very characteristic implements such as 'feuilles de laurier' (leaf-points) and notched points with the finest working produced by light pressure-flaking, like light javelin points. This level could be attributed accurately to the Upper Solutrean. The most recent layer was also relatively rich, with various burins (borers), <b>striker</b> <b>pins,</b> and perforated objects of bone and that could belong to the Lower Magdalenian. Certainly, compared with the stratigraphical significance of El Castillo, La Pasiega is an archeological sequence of less organization, so far as the materials yet found are concerned. However they should certainly not be less valued for this.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for the adjustment of mechanical assemblies, in particular {{for the production}} of a multi-mirror polygon, whereby the module comprises a rack (5) and at least one clamping device (3) linked to the rack (5) for attaching at least one component to be adjusted (mirror 1) with the necessary retaining force. At least one mechanical pulse encoder (4) connected to the rack acts on at least one component to be adjusted (mirror 1) {{in such a way that}} the planned final adjustment position is reachable. The mechanical pulse encoder (4) acts on a support (2) of the component to be adjusted (mirror 1) with pulses by means of a <b>striker</b> <b>pin</b> (10) similar to a moved hammer. The actual position of the component can be determined by means of a measuring instrument (7). The measuring instrument is connected to a positioning device (6) in which the actual position is comparable to the target position and the positioning device (6) is connected to at least one mechanical puls e encoder (4) so that at least one mechanical pulse can be generated so that the component (mirror 1) can be moved into the target position...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate the "Pilodyn Wood Tester" (which operates by measuring the penetration of a steel <b>striker</b> <b>pin)</b> for non-destructive assessment of wood density in living trees. Results were compared with those from the recently developed Torsiometer method as regards accuracy for predicting the wood density measured from increment cores. In the first trial, 10 -year-old radiata pine clones were tested (25 clones, 5 ramets/clone, 2 measurements/ramet). The Pilodyn {{was by far the}} most rapid method and the penetration data gave a correlation coefficient of — 0. 96 with wood density on a clone mean basis. The Torsiometer gave a correlation of 0. 78. The second study was in a 31 -year-old radiata pine plantation where 25 stems were assessed at four breast height sampling points by the three methods used in the first trial. Again the Pilodyn results were obtained more rapidly and were more closely related to mean tree outerwood density (r = — 0. 86 as compared to 0. 79 for the Torsiometer). The Pilodyn Wood Tester appears to have a high potential for the rapid measurement of wood density in large numbers of stems and would be particularly useful for ranking groups of trees such as clones or families by density classes...|$|R
