5000|$|When {{the film}} was first released, film critic Bosley Crowther panned the film, writing, [...] "Since our great {{national}} parks are open to virtually anyone who cares to visit them, there probably {{is no way of}} preventing their occasionally being exploited and abused. And that is most certainly what has happened to Glacier Park in the R. K. O. film, Dangerous Mission, which was <b>plopped</b> <b>down</b> flatly at the Holiday yesterday...a company of Hollywood people has the cheek to play a tale that hasn't the vitality or intelligence of a good comic-strip episode. It is a miserably dull and mixed-up fable about a hunt for a missing witness to a crime, with Vincent Price eventually emerging as some sort of villain, which is obvious all along." ...|$|E

Every single line from this song is a memory for me, and each line has been taken from my journal. Nate didn't have any idea I was writing this song. I never told him until the day I decided to let him hear it. I remember saying to Nate, “Hey, I have a demo I want you to hear!” He had just gotten back from a long day at work, and he <b>plopped</b> <b>down</b> on the couch. I said, “I wrote this for you.” Nate just started listening to this and by the first chorus he had alligator tears streaming down his face." ...|$|E

He quickly opens the can {{and out of the}} can pops a mouse who is <b>plopped</b> <b>down</b> onto a dinner plate. The cat is about to dig in with a fork but the mouse puts a quick stop to that. He says that the cat can't eat him because he has already seen the cartoon they are in and that he winds up saving the cat's life later. The feline understands but wants some food as he is starving. The mouse points into the other room and tells him that there is a huge, fat, tasty canary in there. The cat charges out into the other room and stuffs the unseen canary into a sack heading back to the kitchen.|$|E

The notion, and the liturgy that invokes the notion, show us believers that civil religion has a hold on us, {{and that we need}} a place where we can sit down together and think things out. 2 6 This argument of mine needs to get beneath simple contrasts between biblical faith and civil religion. We believers need to reason together, <b>plopped</b> <b>down</b> as we {{are in the middle of}} the present. We believers include naval officers and lawyers and teachers of children and employees of the Social Security Administration.

In aid of a more careful look, I will try to describe three positions taken and being taken by believers and teachers of believers who have tried and who try to be helpful.

5000|$|In {{a review}} of the Rockford album, The Columbia Journal of American Studies (CJAS) writer Tim W. Brown wrote [...] "Nielsen <b>plops</b> <b>down</b> heavy riffs everywhere, chords {{modulating}} chromatically upward in key, another Cheap Trick trademark, sounding like the swamp monster climbing stairs. He particularly shows off his gutsy grunge in [...] "Perfect Stranger." [...] This song reminds you that Nielsen practically invented grunge--the style's heavy guitar sound coupled with snappy melodies started with him. Hence, the Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan and others' long-standing interest in the band. Actually, I once saw Corgan get up onstage and play guitar on a couple of tunes with Cheap Trick. He couldn't keep up." ...|$|R

40|$|Section 7 of the United States’ National Labor Relations Act allows {{groups of}} American workers {{to engage in}} concerted {{activity}} {{for the purposes of}} collective bargaining or for “other mutual aid or protection. ” This latter protection has been extended in cases such as Lafayette Park Hotel to workers outside the union context. Starting in 2005, the National Labor Relations Board increasingly signaled to employers that concerted activity may take place on social media such as Facebook. However, the Board proper delivered its first written opinion articulating these rules in the 2012 case of Hispanics United of Buffalo, Inc. There, the Board found the employer in question to have committed multiple unfair labor practices when it fired five employees over a series of Facebook posts due to violating the employer’s zero-tolerance no bullying policy. This article argues that the majority opinion of the Board misapplied Lafayette Park Hotel’s test for whether employer conduct “would reasonably tend to chill employees” from legitimate, protected uses of their § 7 rights. This article explains the two largest errors in the Board’s decision: (1) a failure to identify a missing, important element for concerted activity protection under § 7, the nexus between employee discussion and contemplated group action, and (2) asserting an “inferred group intent” existed that was “implicitly manifest” which linked the employees’ Facebook posts to contemplated group action protected under § 7. Members of the entire Board, as well as other legal scholars writing on this topic, have been guilty at different times of simplifying social media to being like a “virtual water cooler” for the 21 st century. The facts in Hispanics United show why this analogy does not work: rather than a short face-to-face conversation with a finite, known audience in the space of minutes, it was a series of written messages <b>plopped</b> <b>down</b> in sequential order throughout an entire day, written for an audience of unknown size and make-up that may not even include the co-workers it ostensibly addressed. As Hispanics United helps illustrate, the proper handling of employer retaliation on social media remains the sensible application of the established nexus requirement for finding concerted activity...|$|E
40|$|Fallingwater, {{designed}} by Frank Lloyd Wright, {{has always been}} {{more than just a}} house. It has also functioned as a workplace, a tourist destination, 2 ̆ 2 the best all-time work of American architecture, 2 ̆ 2 and a cultural symbol. By talking to some of the people involved in its history and by examining 2 ̆ 2 autho-ethnographic 2 ̆ 2 texts found within the community, I attempt to use ethnographic methods to understand a complicated site. Nestled in the rural Appalachian foothills of southwestern Pennsylvania, Fallingwater is also isolated. It is tempting for visitors to view it as a work of art 2 ̆ 2 <b>plopped</b> <b>down</b> in the middle of nowhere. 2 ̆ 2 And yet Fallingwater is fundamentally related to its site, both in its use of local materials and the place it holds in local memory. An attempt is made to connect this one place to a broader cultural landscape, and to understand the social and historic currents that led to its construction and eventual elevation to tourist icon. For data, I rely primarily upon tape-recorded interviews conducted while working as an oral history intern at Fallingwater in the summer of 1997. Local perceptions of Fallingwater and the creative role local builders played in construction are examined, with the author concluding that at a site such as Fallingwater, sole responsibility for the creativity of the finished architectural form cannot be attributed to the mind of a lone creator. The author examines local manifestations of modern architecture in the vernacular landscape, and concludes that local builders struggled with the same forces of Modernity that influenced famous high-style modernist architects such as Wright. The project 2 ̆ 7 s scope reaches beyond the historical constraints of the initial oral history project, however, to include an ethnographic analysis of competing contemporary tourist landscapes at Fallingwater and at neighboring Ohiopyle State Park. While Ohiopyle offers an individualized, vernacular tourist experience, Fallingwater is experienced in a highly ritualized way. The ritual of experiencing Fallingwater is designed to effect change in the visitor and to spur the visitor on to environmental awareness and action. The author contends that an ethnographic analysis of Fallingwater allows for the humane consideration of a larger cultural phenomenon, Modernity. By examining local manifestations of broader cultural forces, the author contends that folklore has a contribution to make to cultural analysis. By closely examining the 2 ̆ 2 texts 2 ̆ 2 collected by folklorists—however broadly those texts are defined—a more contextual understanding of broader cultural phenomena may be obtained...|$|E

Before they could send humans into orbit, NASA?s scientists needed to know if spaceflight would badly slow a pilot?s reaction time. So they trained Number 65 : Every time he saw a blue flashing light, he was to push a lever. If he didn?t, they shocked his feet with electricity. If he did, he got a banana pellet. On January 31, 1961, technicians strapped chimpanzee Number 65 into an 83 -foot-tall Redstone rocket at Cape Canaveral and launched him into suborbital flight. The blue light flashed and the chimp pressed his lever. Sixteen minutes later, after he had ascended to an altitude of 157 miles, his pod <b>plopped</b> <b>down</b> in the Atlantic. Only then did the Air Force name him Ham, after the Holloman Aeromedical Field Lab, where he was housed. If he had died, they didn?t want the public grieving over a chimp with a lovable name.

Later, an aspirant ballerina, played by Lucas, also stuck in a fat suit hops along to an audition where a line of slender dancers give her sidelong glances.She hands over her portfolio to the people holding the audition and, because of her appearance, is immediately rejected. Hurt, she instead heads to the Venice Beach boardwalk in Los Angeles where, in spite of her large size, dances to her heart's content. Meanwhile, Martin's rotund character gets a menial job as janitor and is tossing trash into the dumpster before his 'boss' comes out in the alley and kicks him back to work. The ballerina's home is a trailer and she <b>plops</b> <b>down</b> into a chair to rest and daydream. Meanwhile, back at the theatre, the ballet dancers are rehearsing and Chris steps into the background with his bucket until the director shouts, 'Excuse me!'. A postal worker brings the girl an invite from the theatre, while Chris is shown watering the plants and dancing in his own makeshift stage that he's created outside on the roof of the landmark building. The marquee blazes 'Big Ballet Premiere' as the big girl tries to find a seat in the audience. Later, tears come to her eyes while watching the partners twirl on stage, but when the show is over she finds she can't get out of her little chair. Then, Chris waltzes onto the stage with his partner, and the girl is compelled to join him in a dance making theirs a perfect match.|$|R

As Adam fumbled down the stairs, almost tripping several times, he eventually entered into the kitchen. With backpack in hand, he motioned past his father, glancing only faintly into his face, knowing that was what his father was expecting. He <b>plopped</b> his backpack <b>down</b> on the kitchen floor and sat down in his chair at the ever familiar table, following the same routine he had grown accustomed to. It was comfortable to him, allowing a sense of calmness to radiate throughout his self. On the table laid the pop tarts he so enjoyed, the ones that didn’t have the icing on top, the ones with only cherry filling. He handled a pop tart, picking the crust off prior to placing a small portion into his mouth. He nibbled quietly to himself, often smiling between bites. And then slowly he began to hum a rendition of a song, as if there was a concert playing in his head. His fingers tapped lightly on the table’s edge as if to echo the beat that played in his head. His father sat quietly while watching his son begin to fully act out his part in the concert…guitar playing, drum rolls, facial grimaces of the band members he must of seen on the TV…all quite normal for a Monday morning. Breakfast was over and it was time to leave. Adam’s father said, “Adam, we have 5 minutes before we have to leave. ” Adam didn’t acknowledge his father, but instead continued his concert.
