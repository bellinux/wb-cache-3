40|$|Abstract: Carrying {{multiple}} {{brands and}} holding <b>periodic</b> <b>sales</b> are two common marketing strategies for sellers with market power. One puzzle is that sellers often employ diverse strategies {{in terms of}} using these two tools. This paper offers an explanation to this puzzle by providing a simple framework to analyze a monopoly seller’s optimal marketing strategy in terms of carrying multiple brands and holding <b>periodic</b> <b>sales.</b> Few prior studies have examined contemporaneous and intertemporal price discrimination together and none establish the inherent substitutability between quality and intertemporal instruments of price discrimination demonstrated in this paper. We also analyze the factors that affect a seller’s choice between contemporaneous and intertemporal price discrimination and show how different combinations of the two pricing instruments can be optimal under alternative market conditions. We show that selling strategies are more likely to involve carrying brands only when there is a narrow product quality range and/or limited consumer heterogeneity. Otherwise, the selling strategies are likely to involve both carrying brands and holding sales. We also find that a seller may, surprisingly, increase the total number of offers when it becomes more costly to carry brands or hold sales if there is decreasing marginal cost of the alternative selling tool...|$|R

40|$|The typical {{model of}} retail pricing for produce {{products}} assumes retailers set price {{equal to the}} farm price plus a certain markup. However, observations from scanner data indicate a large degree of price dispersion in the grocery retailing market. In addition to markup pricing behavior, we document three alternative leading pricing patterns: fixed (constant) pricing, <b>periodic</b> <b>sale,</b> and high-low pricing. Retail price variations under these alternative pricing regimes in general have little correlation with the farm price. How do retailers’ alternative pricing behaviors affect farmers’ welfare? Using markup pricing as the baseline case, we parameterize the model to reflect a prototypical fresh produce market and carry {{out a series of}} simulations under different pricing regimes. Our study shows that if harvest cost is sufficiently low, retail prices adjusting only partially, or not at all, to supply shocks tends to diminish farm income and exacerbate farm price volatility relative to the baseline case. However, we also find that if harvest cost is sufficiently large and the harvest-cost constraint places a lower bound on the farm price, increased farm price volatility induced by retailers’ alternative pricing strategies may result in higher farm income, compared to markup pricing. Our study is the first to evaluate the welfare implications for producers of the diversified pricing strategies that retailers utilize in practice and the resulting attenuation of the relationship between prices at retail and at the farm gate.

40|$|Naso lituratus (orangespine unicornfish) and Naso unicornis (bluespine unicornfish) are {{widespread}} {{species that}} are heavily targeted in many nearshore fisheries of Pacific Island countries. In addition to providing a critical food and income source, both species fulfil critical ecological functions in the top-down control of coral reef macroalgae; particularly fleshy brown algae (i. e. Sargassum spp.) which can out-compete and smother corals. Despite heavy long-term harvesting, there are currently very limited species-specific management measures. This review assesses the biology and ecology of both species, and combines this with {{the current status of}} the fisheries in the Pacific, and proposes realistic ecosystem-based species-specific fisheries policies. Although unicornfish populations have displayed continuing resilience to heavy fishing pressure, reports of declining stocks combined with a range of life-history traits (i. e. longevity, habitat-specificity, easily targeted aggregations), indicate that both species are vulnerable to overexploitation. Modern day common fishing practices such as scuba and night-time spearfishing are intensifying their exploitation. The most effective management measure would be fishing effort constraints, including banning modern and unsustainable methods. However, owing to enforcement limitations in Pacific Islands, the most practical approach to management would include a combination of management tools, including <b>periodic</b> <b>sales</b> bans around identified spawning times (i. e. Hawaii; May–June), and size/catch limits. Furthermore, home range data suggest that even with limited knowledge, small MPAs (10 km linear distance are recommended for N. lituratus. This comprehensive review confirms the pressing need for implementation of the aforementioned management practices to protect these species in regions where they are heavily targeted, and prevent the impairment of their critical ecological function and importance as a food and income source.

40|$|Abstract: The {{software}} development community {{is once again}} at an interesting inflection point. Distributed and interconnected systems have become the norm for new development efforts {{to the extent that}} the word "application " itself might have to be redefined. Independent variability and evolution of the interconnected components are enabled through loosely coupled solutions, such as Service-oriented Architectures (SOA). At the same time, Model-driven Architectures (MDA) aim to simplify development by abstracting and automating large portions of the coding effort. This leaves us wondering what it will mean to develop in a service-oriented world. Will business analysts wire together components in visual tools? Will developers program using meta-meta-models and domain specific languages? What new types of programming paradigms will developers use? How can we get ready? 1 Right-Click, Make Web Service There is no doubt that the advent of Web services standards has made previously tedious programming tasks significantly easier and more efficient. For example, I recently developed a simple application that retrieves the Amazon sales rank of my book and e-mails it to my mobile phone. Naturally, this application needs to retrieve data from an external organization over the Internet. Still, developing the application could not have been easier. I pointed my IDE to the WSDL provided by Amazon and without much ado the tool generated a client proxy class for me. I added a few lines of code, and my application was up and running. Not only is this application fully buzzword compliant – I used Web Services, XML, WSDL, SOAP, you name it [...] but it actually does something useful (bolster an author's ego). Exposing existing functions as Web services has become similarly simple. Most development tools are not far from allowing the developer to highlight a method and to select "Make Web Service " from the pop-up menu. It would be almost trivial to expose an enhanced version of my little program as a public Web service, for example allowing other users to submit a list of ISBNs and an e-mail address to receive <b>periodic</b> <b>sales</b> rank updates via e-mail...|$|R

We also formulate approximation models applicable for any lost-sales inventory system (cost objective, no lead time restrictions etc). For the capacity model, we develop a simple inventory rule to set the reorder levels and order quantities. Numerical results for this inventory rule show an average deviation of 1 % from the optimal service levels. We also embed the single-item models in a multi-item system. Furthermore, we compare the performance of fixed order size replenishment policies and (R, s, S) policies.

40|$|Price-matching {{guarantees}} {{are widely}} used in consumer and industrial markets. Previous studies argue {{that they are a}} marketing tactic that facilitates implicit price collusion. This is because once a store adopts this marketing tactic, its rivals can no longer steal its customers by undercutting its price, and hence they have little incentive to initiate price cuts. While a store with price-matching guarantees has no fear of losing customers to rivals' price cuts, it has every incentive to raise its own price to charge a higher price to its loyal consumers. A growing body of legal literature uses this argument today to justify calls for antitrust actions against stores employing this marketing tactic. However, this theoretical conclusion baffles practitioners and industry experts. In practice, sellers typically embrace this marketing tactic in response to heavier competition and a growing bargain consciousness among shoppers. The introduction of price-matching guarantees by a store is frequently interpreted by industry observers as the initiation of a price war rather than a signal of price collusion. This assertion is supported in many instances by the fact that stores that introduce price-matching guarantees also roll back their prices and typically suffer subsequent loss of profits. Most ironically, the favorite examples used by researchers to illustrate how price-matching guarantees can enforce price collusion, Crazy Eddie and “Nobody Beats the Wiz,” have subsequently either gone bankrupt or filed for federal bankruptcy protection. In this study we show that price-matching guarantees can indeed facilitate competition: The expected prices and profits can be strictly lower when all stores adopt price-matching guarantees than when they are not allowed to. This is because the adoption of price-matching guarantees generates not only a competition-dampening effect, which has been recognized in the literature, but also a competition-enhancing effect. This latter effect {{comes from the fact that}} price-matching guarantees encourage price search by those consumers who prefer to shop at a particular store but are mindful of saving opportunities. These consumers will have incentives to obtain the rival store's price when their favorite store offers price-matching guarantees to avail themselves of the lowest possible price at their favorite store. As a result, price-matching guarantees reduce the number of purchases at the store from those consumers who would have paid the full price and thus prompt a store to price more aggressively to bid for more incremental sales. This competition-enhancing effect can more than offset the competition-dampening effect in markets where consumers differ in their price search costs and store loyalty. Thus, our study casts doubt on the advisability of blanket prohibition on price-matching guarantees. Our argument relies only on consumer segmentation and on the phenomenon of <b>periodic</b> <b>sales,</b> both of which are common in retail markets. We arrive at our conclusion by incorporating and into the standard sales-promotion models. In contrast, the past literature on price-matching guarantees ignores the ubiquitous phenomenon of sales in retail markets and overlooks those consumers who prefer to shop at a particular store, but are alert to saving opportunities. As a result, it is troubled by two awkward conclusions. On the one hand, price-matching guarantees simply remove rivals' incentives to undercut in price and, hence, also their incentives to run sales. This implies that the adoption of price-matching guarantees in a market will eliminate the phenomenon of sales, which is obviously counterfactual. On the other hand, in equilibrium no consumer actually invokes price-matching guarantees, as each player has incentives to close any price gap in the market. This is obviously false, based on our casual observations and our conversations with store managers. Theoretical research on the subject thus far has been overwhelmingly one-sided, and empirical or experimental studies are conspicuously lacking. We hope that our conclusion will spark further research in both directions. A healthy debate will broaden our perspective on an issue of great importance in formulating public policies and in managerial decision making.

40|$|In this paper, we {{integrate}} {{inventory and}} handling {{into a single}} model for analysis and optimization of inventory replenishment decisions for a grocery retail store. We consider a retailer who periodically manages his inventory of a single item facing stochastic demand. The retailer may only order in multiples of a xed batch size, the lead time {{is less than the}} review period length and all unmet demand is lost, which is a realistic situation for {{a large part of the}} assortment of grocery retailers. The replenishment cost includes both xed and variable components, dependent on the number of batches and units in the order. This structure captures the shelf-stacking costs in retail stores. We investigate the optimal policy structure under the long-run average cost criterion. Our results show that it is worthwhile to explicitly take handling costs into account when making inventory decisions. We use parameter values typical for rocery retail environments. For an important subset of the retail assortment, we show that signicant cost reductions exist by explicitly considering handling in the inventory policy.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the value of}} accounting for demand seasonality in inventory control. Our problem is motivated by discussions with retailers who admitted to not taking perceived seasonality patterns into account in their replenishment systems. We consider a single-location, single-item <b>periodic</b> review lost <b>sales</b> inventory problem with seasonal demand in a retail environment. Customer demand has seasonality with a known season length, the lead time is shorter than the review period and orders are placed as multiples of a fixed batch size. The cost structure comprises of a fixed cost per order, a cost per batch, and a unit variable cost to model retail handling costs. We consider four different settings which differ {{in the degree of}} demand seasonality that is incorporated in the model: with or without within-review period variations and with or without across-review periods variations. In each case, we calculate the policy which minimizes the long-run average cost and compute the optimality gaps of the policies which ignore part or all demand seasonality. We find that not accounting for demand seasonality can lead to very significant optimality gaps, yet incorporating only some form of demand seasonality does not always lead to cost savings. We apply the problem to a real life setting, using Point-of-Sales data from a European retailer. We show that a simple distinction between weekday and weekend sales can lead to major cost reductions without significantly increasing the complexity of the retailer’s automatic store ordering system. Our analysis provides valuable insights on the tradeoff between the complexity of the automatic store ordering system and the benefits of incorporating demand seasonality...|$|R
