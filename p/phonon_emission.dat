5000|$|External energy pumping (e.g. a {{light beam}} or voltage) {{can help to}} the {{excitation}} of an electron. Relaxation of an electron {{from one of the}} upper states may occur by emission of either a photon or a phonon. This is determined by the density of states of phonons and photons. Density of states is the number of states per volume unit in an interval of energy (E, E+dE) that are available to be occupied by electrons. Both phonons and photons are bosons and thus, they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. This means that, since bosons with the same energy can occupy the same place in space, phonons and photons are force carrier particles and they have integer spins. There are more allowed states available for occupancy in a phonon field than in a photon field. Therefore, since the density of terminal states in the phonon field exceeds that in a photon field (by up to ~105), <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> is by far the more likely event. We could also imagine a concept where the excitation of an electron briefly leads to vibration of the lattice and thus to phonon generation. The vibration energy of the lattice can take discrete values for every excitation. Every one of this [...] "excitation packages" [...] is called phonon. An electron does not stay in an excited state for too long. It readily releases energy to return to its stable low energy state. The electrons release energy in any random direction and at any time (after their excitation). At some particular times, some electrons get excited while others lose energy {{in a way that the}} average energy of system is the lowest possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{amplification}} of coherent terahertz {{sound in}} a Wannier-Stark ladder superlattice {{has been achieved}} in 2009 according to a paper publication from the School of Physics and Astronomy in the University of Nottingham. Wannier-Stark effect, exists in superlattices. Electron states in quantum wells respond sensitively to moderate electric fields either by the quantum confined Stark effect {{in the case of}} wide barriers or by Wannier-Stark localization {{in the case of a}} superlattice. Both effects lead to large changes of the optical properties near the absorption edge, which are useful for intensity modulation and optical switching. Namely, in a mathematical point of view, if an electric field is applied to a superlattice the relevant Hamiltonian exhibits an additional scalar potential. If an eigenstate exists, then the states corresponding to wave functions are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian as well. These states are equally spaced both in energy and real space and form the so-called Wannier-Stark ladder. In the proposed scheme, an application of an electrical bias to a semiconductor superlattice is increasing the amplitude of coherent folded phonons generated by an optical pulse. This increase of the amplitude is observed for those biases in which the energy drop per period of the superlattice is greater than the phonon energy. If the superlattice is biased such that the energy drop per period of the superlattice exceeds the width of electronic minibands (Wannier-Stark regime), the electrons become localized in the quantum wells and vertical electron transport takes place via hopping between neighboring quantum wells, which may be phonon assisted. As it had been shown previously, under these conditions stimulated <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> can become the dominant phonon-assisted hoping process for phonons of an energy value close to the Stark splitting. Thus, coherent phonon amplification is theoretically possible in this type of system. Together with the increase in amplitude, the spectrum of the bias-induced oscillations is narrower than the spectrum of the coherent phonons at zero bias. This shows that coherent amplification of phonons due to stimulated emission takes place in the structure under electrical pumping.|$|E

The material structures of QWIPs are first characterized by the photoluminescence measurements (PL). By calculating the density of photogenerated carriers in the continuum above the energy barriers using the PL calibrated QWIP structures, we have demonstrated that due to the sample quality, the photocarriers can be either in miniband states (Bloch states in the multiple quantum wells), or they transport from one quantum well to the next {{in the form of}} running waves.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation into acoustic <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> from a quasi- 1 D electron gas. The theoretical investigation commences {{with a discussion}} of acoustic <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> from a truly ID electron gas in the single quantum limit. The effect of changing electron density and temperature has been considered, and the contributions from both phonon coupling mechanisms to transverse and longitudinal phonons calculated. As the number of occupied subbands is increased, the oscillation in the density of states at the Fermi energy produces a corresponding oscillation in the emitted phonon power. A detailed study into the angular distribution of phonon intensity found, at low temperatures, that the distribution of emission angle can be simply calculated from the conservation laws. Increasing the temperature or the number of occupied subbands changes the angular distribution to become perpendicular to the growth direction, similar to emission from a 2 DEG. There is a distinct difference in the angle of emission between intra and inter subband transitions because of the changing wavevector dependence of the form factor. Heat pulse experiments have been used to detect directly the phonons emitted due to energy relaxation in 2 DEG's and quasi- 1 D electron gases. In a 2 DEG a change in the nature of <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> is detected at about 0. 5 pW per electron. This occurs at lower power than previous studies suggest (2 - 7 pW per electron). We attribute this change in the <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> process to the onset of optic <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> and present evidence that the crossover measured previously is too large because of the analysis technique. In a wide wire array (> 150 nm) there is very little change from the <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> process in a 2 DEG. As the wire is narrowed the acoustic-optic crossover moves to lower electron power. The acoustic <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> process becomes less efficient because reducing the number of occupied subbands reduces the phase space available for <b>phonon</b> <b>emission.</b> However, in narrow wires there are few occupied subbands and the crossover rises to higher power. This is because the phase space that has been removed by the {{reduction in the number of}} subbands is partially returned by momentum non-conservation. The experimental results are found to agree well with the theory once consideration of the changing electron system has been taken into account.

40|$|At low {{temperatures}} the predominant energy loss mechanism for a Joule-heated two dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) {{in a metal}} oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) is by acoustic <b>phonon</b> <b>emission.</b> By very accurately measuring the temperature gradient developed along the silicon substrate the <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> has been investigated {{as a function of}} electron concentration, device power, magnetic field and temperature. In zero magnetic field the results show the cut-off predicted theoretically in the maximum phonon momentum that can be emitted in the plane of the 2 DEG for low electron concentrations. It is also found that the momentum of the emitted phonons perpendicular to the plane of the 2 DEG is restricted by the width of the 2 DEG for the high resistivity (1000 [omega]cm) substrates used. 	For carrier concentrations greater than 4. 9 x 1016 m- 2 <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> from an upper subband is seen. Electrical measurements indicate that the high mobility (1. 2 m 2 V- 1 S- 1) of the devices used leads to changes in the screening of scattering potentials by the electrons being important.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the electron-phonon interaction in two dimensional electron gases (2 DEGs), by measuring of the acoustic <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> from a sequence of n-type doped GaAs/(AIGa) As quantum wells. Previous studies of emission from 2 DEGs confined in GaAs heterojunctions (Chin et al., 1984) have shown a surprising absence of longitudinal acoustic (LA) mode <b>phonon</b> <b>emission,</b> in contrast with theoretical studies (Vass, 1987) which predict that deformation potential coupled LA mode emission should dominate the energy relaxation processes. This may be attributed to the finite width of the quasi- 2 D sheet, which imposes a restriction on the maximum emitted phonon wavevector component perpendicular to the 2 DEG, leading to a suppression of the emission (the ' 1 /a_ 0 cutoff') at smaller phonon wavevectors than predicted by the earlier theory. By using the quantum well width w as a means of modulating the thickness of the 2 DEG, the dependence of the 1 /a_ 0 cutoff on the <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> can be directly measured. In the present work, significant LA <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> from the quantum well samples is observed. To complement the experimental measurements, the theory of emission from a 2 DEG has been modelled in detail using computer simulation techniques. Calculations of the electron-phonon interaction, including matrix element anisotropy and dynamic screening, as well as phonon focusing effects, can be combined to produce accurate predictions of the experimentally detected <b>phonon</b> <b>emission</b> energy spectra.
