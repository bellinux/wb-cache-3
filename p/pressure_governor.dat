40|$|The paper {{depicts the}} main topics of the {{experimental}} investigation on alcohol engine development field, aiming at the engineering targets for the emission levels. The {{first part of this}} study was focused on engine design optimization for running on ethanol mexed with poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) as ignition improver. It was shown that some design changes in compression ratio, turbine casing, injector nozzle configuration and exhaust <b>pressure</b> <b>governor</b> (EPG) activation, lead to a better engine thermodynamics and thermochemistry. The second objective of this study was the investigation of engine performance and enmission levels, when the ignition improver diethyl ether (DEE) would be generated on board via catalyticallly dehydration of ethanol, and used directly as soluble mixture or separately fumigated. Both alternatives: ether fumigation technique and dissolved ether in alcohol fuel application were conceptually analyzed, and a stand up system based on DEE fumigation was used to determine the optimum DEE-ethanol ratio at any engine operating range. The heat release investigation, when the engine was run on neat ethanol and optimum fumigated DEE, has been indicated earlier combustion, and very short ignition delay. Verified possibilities for using DEE as ignition improver, would lead to a proper version of the on board ether reactor design, which would bring to another solution for ethanol fuelled engines...|$|E
40|$|A 1 cohols, (ethanol and methanol), as non soot and low NOx {{emission}} level fuels, are attractive candidates {{for use in}} diesel engine and therefore, they have inspired many engine researchers. However, having low cetane number, 9 respectively 3, they are not possible to use in diesel engines without engine modifications. ID order to take advantages of the a 1 cohol fuels and to avoid engine complexities, which might come along with such modifications, the use of ignition improver additives is a normal practice. Poly-ethylene glycol (PEG), which can ease the ignition and enhance initial combustion rate has been intensively used and investigated in two Volvo diesel engines: TD 73 for heavy duty trucks and AHIOA 245 for buses. Both engines are with direct injection using a torroidal bowl in the piston combustion chamber. The {{first phase of the}} development work was concerned on compression ratio, boosting pressure and injection timing. All these were optimized concerning design limits and desired {{emission level}}s according to the engineering target. However, the most fundamental effects on emission levels were observed with further engine design optimization in exhaust <b>pressure</b> <b>governor</b> activating pressure, intercooler performance, injector nozzle pattern, injector protrusion and intercooler performance. It was observed that each of them greatly affects emission levels. The EPG activation at light loads can intensively reduce HC and CO leveis, but the engine economy would deteriorate by means of bsfc increasing. An interesting investigation has been on optimal injector protrusion, which might prevent the fuel spray impingement, and by that CO and HC levels. Another promising solution for qualitative combustion in a 1 cohol diesel engines is to use an on-board reactor to generate ethers from the a 1 cohol fuel, i. e. from EtOH, diethyl ether (DEE) and from MeOH, dimethyl ether (DMM) may be dehydrated. Both these ethers have high cetane numbers, 90 respectively 60, and may be used as ignition improvers. Therefore, a research program was set up {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} ethers as ignition improvers and compare results with the conventional PEG. At the present stage, the tests have not inc 1 uded onboard manufactured ethers, instead purchased ether has been premixed with alcohol in the initial tests and injected into the engine air inlet during the fumigation tests. The main emphasis has been put on the fumigation technique, where a mixture of ether, alcohol and water has been used in order to simulate the output from a dehydration reactor. Verified possibilities for using ethers as ignition improvers would lead to a proper version of the onboard ether reactor design, which would bring to another solution for alcohol fuelled engines...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Ultramatic did not switch automatically {{between high}} and low gearing ratios; the driver selected high or low ratio through the column shift lever. The intention was that in normal driving, the high (1:1) ratio would be selected at all times, and the two stage, dual turbine torque converter (actually a total of four turbines were employed) used to reduce gearing for starting off. At a speed of 15 - 56 mph (depending on rear axle ratio which affected the rate of <b>governor</b> <b>pressure</b> rise), <b>governor</b> <b>pressure</b> overcame the opposing throttle pressure, as determined by carburetor linkage position, causing the Direct Shift Valve to apply the direct drive clutch. This [...] "locked" [...] the torque converter, giving direct mechanical drive from the engine to the rear wheels, eliminating the power-robbing slippage of the torque converter at cruising speeds. On the highway, the Ultramatic delivered the same economy and power as a manual transmission. With the exception of Borg-Warner, major automotive manufacturers did not generally employ a locking torque converter until nearly thirty years later.|$|R

50|$|Race {{relations}} in Hawaii {{took to the}} national spotlight on September 12, 1931 when Thalia Massie, a United States Navy officer's wife, got drunk and alleged that she was beaten and raped. That same night, the Honolulu Police Department stopped a car and detained five men, all plantation workers. Officers took the men to Massie's hospital bedroom where she identified them. Although evidence could not prove that the men were directly involved, national newspapers quickly ran stories about the brute locals on the prowl for white women in Hawaii. The jury in the initial trial failed to reach a verdict. One of the accused was afterwards severely beaten, while another, Joseph Kahahawai, was murdered. Police caught the Kahahawai killers: Massie's husband Thomas, mother Grace Fortescue, and two sailors. Famed criminal lawyer Clarence Darrow defended them. A jury of locals found them guilty and sentenced to hard labor for ten years. Outraged by the court's punishment, the territory's white leaders as well as 103 members of Congress signed a letter threatening to impose martial law over the territory. This <b>pressured</b> <b>Governor</b> Lawrence M. Judd to commute the sentences to an hour each in his executive chambers.
