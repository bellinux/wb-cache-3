5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is <b>pricked</b> with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} aetiological allergens identifiable by skin <b>prick</b> test alone in patients suffering from chronic rhinitis in Hong Kong, and also compare the clinical history and symptoms of skin <b>prick</b> test-positive versus skin <b>prick</b> test-negative patients. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Otorhinolaryngology clinic in Queen Mary Hospital of Hong Kong. PATIENTS: A total of 977 patients suffering from chronic rhinitis were recruited into the study. Skin <b>prick</b> test was performed with a panel of allergens including house dust mites, cockroach, cat, dog, moulds, and pollens. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Skin <b>prick</b> test results and their correlation with symptoms. RESULTS: Of the 977 patients, 651 (67 %) had positive skin <b>prick</b> test reactions. The commonest allergen was house dust mite which was positive in 63 % of the 977 patients and 95 % of those 651 skin <b>prick</b> test-positive patients. The other allergens were in order of cockroach (23 %), cat (14 %), dog (5 %), pollen (4 %), and mould (3 %). Compared with skin <b>prick</b> test-negative patients, skin <b>prick</b> test-positive patients {{were more likely to}} have earlier age of onset of the chronic rhinitis, association with asthma, more severe symptom in the morning, more severe symptoms of itchy nose, sneezing, nasal discharge, itchy eye, and watery eye. CONCLUSIONS: Identifiable aeroallergens could be detected in 67 % chronic rhinitis patients by skin <b>prick</b> test alone. House dust mites were the most prevalent causative allergen. There were significant differences of patterns of clinical history and symptoms severity between skin <b>prick</b> test-positive and skin <b>prick</b> test-negative patients. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Pricking,</b> {{classified}} as {{female genital cutting}} (FGC) type IV by the World Health Organization, is an under-researched area gaining momentum among diaspora communities. Our aim was to explore factors associated with being supportive of <b>pricking</b> among Somalis in Sweden. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, attitudes and knowledge regarding FGC, and measures of socioeconomic status, acculturation, and social capital, were assessed by a 49 -item questionnaire in four municipalities in Sweden. Data were collected in 2015 from 648 Somali men and women, >= 18 years old, of which 113 supported the continuation of <b>pricking.</b> Logistic regression {{was used for the}} analysis. Results: Those more likely to support the continuation of <b>pricking</b> were older, originally from rural areas, and newly arrived in Sweden. Further, those who reported that they thought <b>pricking</b> was: acceptable, according to their religion (aOR: 10. 59, 95 % CI: 5. 44 - 20. 62); not a violation of children's rights (aOR: 2. 86, 95 % CI: 1. 46 - 5. 61); and did not cause long-term health complications (aOR: 5. 52, 95 % CI: 2. 25 - 13. 52) had higher odds of supporting <b>pricking.</b> Religion was strongly associated with the support of <b>pricking</b> among both genders. However, for men, children's rights and the definition of <b>pricking</b> as FGC or not were important aspects in how they viewed <b>pricking,</b> while, for women, health complications and respectability were important. Conclusions: Values known to be associated with FGC in general are also related to <b>pricking.</b> Hence, {{there seems to be a}} change in what types of FGC are supported rather than in their perceived values...|$|R

30|$|The erect penis is {{likened to}} a weapon: weapon, sword, (vagina is Latin for “sheath, scabbard”), pistol, gun, rod, lance, bill, pike, dart, chopper, <b>prick.</b> 29 The very common <b>prick</b> {{in the sense}} “penis” is arguably a literal sense rather than a nonliteral one. The verb <b>prick</b> names {{the effect of a}} certain kind of event in which a sharp object penetrates a membrane; with little {{stretching}} of the imagination that describes the effect of inserting the penis into the vagina: intromission is an act in which the penis is the instrument of <b>pricking,</b> i.e. a <b>prick,</b> which makes this noun deverbal. According to the Oxford English Dictionary the noun and verb have co-existed since the earliest records in English. In addition to its current meaning, the verb <b>prick</b> has meant “to spur or urge a horse on” (OED 9 – 12) which links up with the copulation-as-riding metaphor, with the man as rider; “to thrust a stick (or pointed object) into something” (OED 25) which links up with the metaphor of the man as tailor stitching the woman—the man as tailor turns up in many bawdy folk songs, and in Grose et al. (1811); and <b>prick</b> up still means “to rise or stand erect with the point directed upward” (OED 28). It is hardly surprising, then, that the noun <b>prick</b> was used variously for (a) a thorn, a sting, and figuratively as a vexation or torment (OED 12); this could be partly responsible for some interpretations nonliteral prick; (b) a dagger or pointed sword (OED 15) links with the penis as weapon metaphor; (c) the upright pole of a tent (1497, OED 16); (d) it has long been a term for the penis. Although the earliest record for <b>prick</b> “penis” in the OED is 1592, there is the record of it being used as a term for a lover in 1540 (OED 17 b), which suggests at least a contemporary sense “penis”, too. In all probability, <b>prick</b> was used much earlier in this sense.|$|R
40|$|The yeast Malassezia furfur {{belongs to}} the normal {{cutaneous}} flora, but is also a triggering allergen that can contribute to atopic dermatitis. To illuminate the effect of circulating allergen-specific T cells in atopic dermatitis, the peripheral mononuclear cell response was correlated with the in vivo skin <b>prick</b> test and atopy patch test reactivity to M. furfur. None of 16 healthy controls showed any positive in vivo reaction. The 40 atopic dermatitis patients, of whom 18 had serum IgE reactivity to M. furfur, were subdivided according to their in vivo reaction to M. furfur extract into three groups: skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test positive (n[*]=[*] 12), skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test negative (n[*]=[*] 12), and skin <b>prick</b> test negative/atopy patch test negative (n[*]=[*] 16). The skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test positive and the skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test negative groups had a significantly higher peripheral mononuclear cell stimulation index than the healthy controls. Interestingly, the stimulation index values in the skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test positive group {{were significantly higher than}} in the skin <b>prick</b> test positive/atopy patch test negative group. In the M. furfur skin <b>prick</b> test positive atopic dermatitis patients (n[*]=[*] 24) a correlation was found between stimulation index and the M. furfur atopy patch test reactions, but not between stimulation index and M. furfur-specific serum IgE levels. Skin <b>prick</b> test positive and/or atopy patch test positive reactions to the recombinant M. furfur allergens rMal f 1, rMal f 5, and rMal f 6 were observed in 7, 14, and 16 of the 40 atopic dermatitis patients, respectively. Further, there was a correlation between production of the T helper 2 -related cytokines interleukins 4, 5, and 13 and stimulation index to M. furfur extract, but not between the T helper 1 -related interferon-γ and stimulation index to M. furfur extract. Our data strongly suggest a relationship between circulating specific T cells with a T helper 2 -like cytokine profile and positive atopy patch test reactions...|$|R
