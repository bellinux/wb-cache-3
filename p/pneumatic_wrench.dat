50|$|In 2008, Latvala joined Ford's factory team as {{a number}} two driver, partnering Mikko Hirvonen and {{replacing}} Marcus Grönholm who had announced his retirement from the WRC {{at the end of}} 2007. The opening round of the season wasn't lucky for the young Finn - he suffered a puncture after cutting a corner too deep on the very first stage and lost even more time because of a non-fully operative <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wrench.</b> Latvala continued to fight and was ninth overall before SS12, but he made another mistake there and heavily damaged the front left suspension in his Focus, forcing himself to retire for good. At the second rally of the season, 2008 Swedish Rally, he had good pace from the beginning - he won all regular special stages on day one, pulling away from the runner-up spot slowly, but consistently. He later had some problems and wasn't the fastest on any of the remaining stages, but managed to keep his position throughout the rally. The 22-year-old therefore took his first WRC win to become the youngest winner {{in the history of the}} World Rally Championship. The previous record was held by Henri Toivonen who was 24 years and 86 days old when he won the 1980 RAC Rally. For his performance during the Swedish rally Latvala was given the Abu Dhabi Spirit Of The Rally award.At the first gravel event of the season, the 2008 Rally México, despite officially claiming no intentions to win the event, he was the fastest driver on the first two stages and was leading the rally throughout the first day, pulling out from the current World Rally Champion, Sébastien Loeb. Unfortunately for the young Finn, the turbo in his Ford Focus was malfunctioning during the second day, making his car uncompetitive. This, along with having to be the opening driver on the stages 9-16, having to sweep the track of the loose gravel, cost him a substantial amount of time and Latvala finished the rally third.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pneumatic</b> torque <b>wrench</b> is {{sometimes}} confused {{with a standard}} impact wrench, due to their similar appearance. A <b>pneumatic</b> torque <b>wrench</b> is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the Hammers of an impacting <b>wrench.</b> A <b>pneumatic</b> torque <b>wrench</b> has very little vibration, and excellent repeatability and accuracy.|$|R

40|$|For many years, tool {{manufacturers}} have proposed disposable micro-knives {{as a solution}} to both the vulnerability and the frequent maintenance problems of standard full-size knives. The study compared disposable micro-knives and standard full size-knives for replacement time and management costs. It also quantified the cost of severe damage caused to conventional knife set-ups, following accidental introduction of metal contaminants inside the chipper. In this case, damage can amount to over 30, 000 €. Adoption of disposable micro-knives may avoid such severe damage and mitigate its consequences. The simpler replacement procedure also allows a 15 % reduction of knife replacement time, compared with the standard knife option. On the other hand, these same benefits are also obtained with other measures, such as the adoption of a swing-away counter-knife and the use of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wrench</b> for knife replacement. However, disposable micro-knives do offer a significant reduction of knife-related cost, due to an extended sharpness retention. Savings may amount to 30 % of the knife-related cost of a conventional knife set, or about 18 Euro cents per tonne. Further studies should investigate the reasons for the better performance of micro-knives, with a view in improving the durability of both knife types...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Two {{fractured}} pins {{of impact}} wrench {{were evaluated by}} fractography using scanning electron microscopy. This <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wrench</b> is used to the fabrication of automotive components being characterized by its power and tightening capacity. The {{important part of the}} wrench is the pin clutch impact mechanism used to generate high torque. An original pin manufactured with AISI E 52100 steel adjusted 2, 580 nuts before fracture and a substitute pin of E 52100 modified steel with S adjusted 7, 095 nuts before failure. Fractographic analysis in both fracture surfaces indicated a ductile-brittle mixed fracture mode. Original pin surface exhibited a granular appearance while substitute pin surface showed fibrous and rough morphology. Precipitation of nearly rounded, elliptical and elongate second – phase particles containing Cr, C and Mn measured as intergranular and transgranular particle density was observed, promoting some brittle failure zones and ductile fracture measured as the volume fraction of grain boundaries and microvoids, respectively. A larger amount of intergranular medium precipitates was found on the original pin which favored the brittle failure among the grain boundaries compared to that of the substitute pin. The ductile fracture by larger transgranular fine particle density which acted as nucleation sites of higher volume fraction of microvoids was found in the substitute pin...|$|E

40|$|In {{the steel}} {{industry}} musculoskeletal disorders are important determinants of sickness and absenteeism. Prevention of biomechanical risk is therefore important, both for industry and the workers themselves. In this research project, ergonomic guidelines {{have been developed to}} reduce high musculoskeletal work load for a number of maintenance tasks in {{the steel industry}}. The project was aimed at maintenance work because of the supposed high prevalence of complaints in this type of work. This report gives an overview of the magnitude and nature of musculoskeletal morbidity in various maintenance departments and maintenance tasks followed by useful recommendations on optimum working heights for oxy-gas cutting, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wrenching</b> and grinding. The work load is reduced by implementing these recommendations and improvements of worker's health are to be expected...|$|R
50|$|In high {{precision}} {{areas such as}} aerospace applications motor or <b>pneumatic</b> torque <b>wrenches</b> are set at a lower torque value after which the final torque is set with a manual mechanical torque wrench, they are calibrated before every use, if a wrench breaks or loses calibration every fastener done with that wrench is redone.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pneumatic</b> torque <b>wrench</b> is a {{planetary}} torque multiplier or a gearbox that is mated to a pneumatic air motor.

The torque output is adjusted by controlling the air pressure.|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{torque wrench}} is significantly quieter, lighter weight and {{more accurate than}} <b>pneumatic</b> impact <b>wrenches</b> capable of similar torque output, making it an appealing alternative for many users to the very loud and cumbersome impact wrenches or torque multipliers which were formerly the only viable option for working with very large nuts and bolts until the hydraulic torque wrench was introduced.|$|R

40|$|In {{the study}} {{maintenance}} workers {{were involved in}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wrenching,</b> oxy-gas cutting, and grinding at 5 different heights. Working posture and workers' perceptions were measured. Guidelines on working height were formulated {{in order to minimize}} the load on the musculoskeletal system. Data trom the present experiment as weIl as from literature were studied in depth in order to disclose generic mechanisms behind the adoption of working postures during visual-manual operations in relation to workstation adjustment. It was found, for instance, that the working posture was constrained by a strictly followed relationship between gaze inclination and head inclination for-/backwards. Also, the study provided insight into the role of visual interference, viewing distance, manipulation distance, hand grip of the tool, and body support for stability. Concerning evaluation criteria for working postures, it was concluded that neck flexion/extension (i. e., head inclination for-/backwards versus trunk inclination for-/backwards) seems to be the dominant determinant of neck load, as compared to head inclination for-/backwards. Furthermore, the position of the upper arm with respect to the trunk, that is, shoulder flexion/retroflexion in particular, seemed to be a dominant determinant of shoulder and shoulder girdle load, as compared to upper arm elevation...|$|R
40|$|In general {{manufacturing}} {{consists of a}} sequence of actions on different spots. Depending on the sequence, workers may have to approach a spot from varying angles. The {{purpose of the study}} conducted was to describe the whole-body orientation and position when approaching a spot for a manufacturing action from five different angles, starting several meters away. Eight subjects were instructed to perform three different actions (knob rotating, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>wrenching,</b> and button pressing) at six working height s (between ankle height and eye height). The actions were selected for their varying level of constraint at the subject-environment interface. Amongst others, it was disclosed that there is a linear relationship between the final whole-body orientation (while performing the action) and the initial approach angle (while being on the starting position, directed to the manufacturing spot). Furthermore, a translation effect was found, showing that, when approaching from the right side, right-handed subjects position themselves more {{to the left of the}} straight line between their initial position and the spot for the manufacturing action. The results of the study may be used for proactive ergonomic assessments of manufacturing environments, allowing the user of a digital human model to accurately and efficiently be able to simulate realistic human motions and action sequences...|$|R
50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the ratchet handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving socket <b>wrenches</b> include <b>pneumatic</b> impact <b>wrenches,</b> hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. In many occupations, {{exposure}} to hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) over {{a prolonged period}} causes various disorders involving the vascular, neural and musculoskeletal systems, collectively known as the hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). It is a complex and potentially disabling chronic disorder of the upper extremities, especially of the hands. Numbness, tingling, reduced tactile discrimination, and impaired manipulative dexterity are often reported by workers exposed to HTV. The precise pathophysiological mechanism responsible for vascular injuries in HAVS {{has not yet been}} fully clarified; it seems to be multifactorial and highly complex. Interaction of neural signals, hormones, mediators and changes in the blood vessel itself appear to {{contribute to the development of}} such vascular injuries. This study aims to assess the risk of the hand-transmitted vibration exposure during <b>pneumatic</b> impact <b>wrench</b> operation in a rock drill repair and maintenance workshop at a South African platinum mine. A total of 8 workers working on a day to day basis with impact wrenches were available for this study. For each of the workers a control (not exposed to vibration) was selected on the basis of gender, ethnic group, smoking habits, age and body mass index (BMI). Grip force, dexterity and hand-eye co-ordination were tested on the workers and control group before and after work. Finger systolic blood pressure (FSBP) was also measured after cold provocation of the worker and control groups. Results have shown astatistically significant difference between the two groups with respect coordination, dexterity and FSBP after cold provocation. Vibration measurements shows three workers had values above the suggested ELV of 5 m/s² for an eight hour A (8) workday. With regards to dexterity, workers were capable to manipulate small objects better with their dominant right (vibration exposed) hand after work than before work. In contrast, it seems that the number of pegs correctly inserted by the controls is not uniformly affected by their 8 hour workday. The worker group showed a greater grip force than that of the control group, both before and after work. There was a statistically significant difference between the control and worker group with respect to the number of mistakes during the mirror trace and the time to complete this test only for the right hand. The difference in FSBP after cold provocation between the control and worker group observed is of medium importance when compared with effect sizes, however, there was no statistical significant difference. In this study, it was very difficult to make valid conclusions due to the limitations of a small sample size. A longitudinal study should be conducted preferably using newly appointed workers with no prior {{exposure to}} vibration and a sufficient control group to eliminate the effect other confounding variables such as general working conditions.
