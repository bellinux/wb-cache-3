5|$|Silkies {{are also}} known for their <b>polydactyly,</b> usually manifesting as an {{additional}} 1-2 digits in the foot. The genetic cause of this extra digit formation {{has been shown to}} be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene, called the ZPA Regulatory Sequence (ZRS). This causes ectopic SHH expression in the anterior of the developing limb bud, leading to increased tissue growth and digits. Interestingly, while the feet of the Silkie display <b>polydactyly,</b> the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie <b>polydactyly</b> differs from those that cause <b>polydactyly</b> in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to ectopic FGF4 expression in the AER, with ectopic SHH a secondary effect.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, the unexplained death {{of a young girl}} with <b>polydactyly</b> (among other health problems) prompts Father McCue (Arnie Walters) to ask Scully for her help, but her {{investigation}} leads her to a mystery involving Nephilim—children of mortal women and angels. Scully soon learns that Aaron Starkey (Glenn Morshower), a department of social services worker and demon in disguise, is after the girls, in order that the Devil may control their power.|$|E
25|$|Other {{formations}} of {{the thumb}} include a triphalangeal thumb and <b>polydactyly.</b>|$|E
25|$|A limb anomaly {{is called}} a dysmelia. These include all forms of limbs anomalies, such as amelia, ectrodactyly, phocomelia, polymelia, <b>polydactyly,</b> syndactyly, polysyndactyly, oligodactyly, brachydactyly, achondroplasia, {{congenital}} aplasia or hypoplasia, amniotic band syndrome, and cleidocranial dysostosis.|$|E
25|$|Syndactyly / <b>Polydactyly</b> – The {{most common}} of {{congenital}} malformations affecting limbs. It {{is believed that}} Syndactyly, exhibits in variation, in which digits can be fused either partially or across its entire length, or as simple as only being connected superficially by skin. It affects 1 in every 2,000 – 3,000 live births. <b>Polydactyly</b> {{is the presence of}} extra fingers or toes at birth, and is believed to affect somewhere around 2 out of every 1,000 live births. However, it is believed that many cases are so minor that they are taken care of shortly after birth and not reported, so actual statistics may be higher.|$|E
25|$|One of Fish's {{personal}} {{projects is}} an ongoing attempt to breed domestic cats for intelligence and other traits, including <b>polydactyly.</b> She claims that her cats are about as intelligent as a six-year-old human child, except in regards to symbolic language.|$|E
25|$|Avicenna {{considered}} whether {{events like}} rare diseases or disorders have natural causes. He used {{the example of}} <b>polydactyly</b> to explain his perception that causal reasons exist for all medical events. This view of medical phenomena anticipated developments in the Enlightenment by seven centuries.|$|E
25|$|Children often face medical issues very {{different}} from the experiences of an adult patient. Many birth defects or syndromes present at birth are best treated in childhood, and pediatric plastic surgeons specialize in treating these conditions in children. Conditions commonly treated by pediatric plastic surgeons include craniofacial anomalies, Syndactyly (webbing of the fingers and toes), <b>Polydactyly</b> (excess fingers and toes at birth), cleft lip and palate, and congenital hand deformities.|$|E
25|$|Megalencephaly-capillary (MCAP) {{is one of}} the {{two major}} syndromes of megalencephaly. Typically, MCAP and MPPH can be {{distinguished}} by somatic features. MCAP includes many characteristics that are observed at birth including: cutaneous vascular malformations, especially capillary malformations of the face and cutis marmorata, <b>polydactyly,</b> connective tissue dysplasia, and focal or segmental body overgrowth. Furthermore, MCAP can occasionally be linked with asymmetric brain overgrowth (hemimegalencephaly) as well as segmental overgrowth of the body (hemihypertrophy).|$|E
25|$|Since 1959, {{a second}} enigmatic group of ancient sea {{reptiles}} is known, the Hupehsuchia. Like the Ichthyopterygia, the Hupehsuchia have a pointed snout and show <b>polydactyly,</b> {{the possession of}} more than five fingers or toes. Their limbs more resemble those of land animals, making them appear as a transitional form between these and ichthyosaurs. Initially, this possibility was largely neglected because the Hupehsuchia have a fundamentally different form of propulsion, with an extremely stiffened trunk. The similarities were explained as a case of convergent evolution. Furthermore, the descent of the Hupehsuchia is no less obscure, meaning a possible close relationship would hardly clarify the general evolutionary position of the ichthyosaurs.|$|E
500|$|Some {{mutations}} {{occur in}} [...] "toolkit" [...] or regulatory genes. Changes in these often have large {{effects on the}} phenotype of the individual because they regulate the function of many other genes. Most, but not all, mutations in regulatory genes result in non-viable embryos. Some nonlethal regulatory mutations occur in HOX genes in humans, which {{can result in a}} cervical rib or <b>polydactyly,</b> {{an increase in the number}} of fingers or toes. When such mutations result in a higher fitness, natural selection favours these phenotypes and the novel trait spreads in the population.|$|E
500|$|Like {{almost all}} members of the Felidae, cats have protractable and {{retractable}} claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The fifth front claw (the dewclaw) is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth [...] "finger". This special feature of the front paws, {{on the inside of the}} wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and dogs. It has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some breeds of cats are prone to <b>polydactyly</b> (extra toes and claws). These are particularly common along the northeast coast of North America.|$|E
2500|$|Grade 1 and Grade 4 {{are very}} rare. [...] Grade 2 is {{observed}} {{in children with}} Miller-Dieker syndrome (a combination of lissencephaly with dysmorphic facial features, visceral abnormalities, and <b>polydactyly).</b> [...] The most common lissencephaly observed, consisting of frontotemporal pachygyria and posterior agyria, is Grade 3.|$|E
2500|$|Diplopodia is a {{congenital}} anomaly in tetrapods that involves duplication of {{elements of the}} foot on the hind limb. [...] It comes from the Greek roots diplo = [...] "double" [...] and pod = [...] "foot". [...] Diplopodia is often found {{in conjunction with other}} structural abnormalities and can be lethal. It is more extreme than <b>polydactyly,</b> the presence of extra digits.|$|E
2500|$|A {{strongly}} derived condition {{show the}} phalanges, small disc-shaped elements positioned in long rows. Sometimes, {{the number of}} fingers is reduced, to as low as two. This is a rather common phenomenon within the Tetrapoda. Unique, however, for derived tetrapods, {{is the fact that}} some species show nonpathological <b>polydactyly,</b> the number of fingers being higher than five. Some species have ten fingers per hand. These fingers again, can have an increased number of phalanges, up to thirty, a phenomenon called hyperphalangy, also known from Plesiosauria, mosasaurs, and Cetacea. The high number of elements allows the flipper to be shaped as a hydrofoil. When a high number of fingers is present, their identity is difficult to determine. It is usually assumed that fingers were added at both the front and at the rear, perhaps to a core of four original fingers. If fingers are added, often the number of metacarpals and carpals is also increased; sometimes even an extra lower arm element is present. Earlier, it was common to divide ichthyosaurs into [...] "longipinnate" [...] and [...] "latipinnate" [...] forms, according to the long or wide shape of the front flippers, but recent research has shown that these are not natural groups, ichthyosaur clades often containing both species with and without elongated forelimbs.|$|E
5000|$|Ulnar <b>polydactyly</b> {{is often}} {{bilateral}} and associated with syndactyly and <b>polydactyly</b> of the feet. This {{can be a}} simple or complex <b>polydactyly.</b> Ulnar <b>polydactyly</b> occurs as an isolated congenital condition, but can also {{be part of a}} syndrome. The syndromes which occur with ulnar <b>polydactyly</b> are: Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, McKusick-Kaufman syndrome, Down syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ...|$|E
50|$|This is a {{less common}} situation, in which affects {{the side of the}} hand towards the thumb. Radial <b>polydactyly</b> refers to the {{presence}} of an extra digit (or extra digits) on the radial side of the hand. It is most frequent in Indian populations and it is the second most common congenital hand disorder. The incidence of radial <b>polydactyly</b> is reported as 1 in every 3,000 live births. The clinical features of radial <b>polydactyly</b> will depend upon the extent of duplication.Radial <b>polydactyly</b> varies from a barely visible radial skin tag to complete duplication. Thumb <b>polydactyly</b> varies from barely visible broadening of the distal phalanx to full duplication of the thumb including the first metacarpal.Radial <b>polydactyly</b> is frequently associated with several syndromes.|$|E
50|$|The syndromes {{associated}} with central <b>polydactyly</b> are:Bardet-Biedl syndrome,Meckel syndrome,Pallister-Hall syndrome,Legius syndrome,Holt-Oram syndrome,Also, central <b>polydactyly</b> can be {{associated with}} syndactyly and cleft hand.|$|E

50|$|Mutations of the GLI2 gene are {{associated}} with several phenotypes including Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, Pallister-Hall syndrome, preaxial <b>polydactyly</b> type IV, postaxial <b>polydactyly</b> types A1 and B.|$|E
50|$|Polydactyl (extra-toed) cats. There are {{probably}} many genes, both dominant and recessive, that cause <b>polydactyly</b> in cats. Most cases of <b>polydactyly</b> in cats are perfectly harmless.|$|E
50|$|Pd = Thumb-cat <b>polydactyly</b> gene. The Pd gene (dominant with {{incomplete}} penetrance) {{causes the}} benign, pre-axial form of <b>polydactyly</b> where {{one or more}} extra toes occur near the dew claw. Often, the dew claw is converted into a thumb. There are occasional problems, such as fused claws or claws facing in the wrong direction, but, generally, this form of <b>polydactyly</b> is harmless.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the study of}} genetic causes of <b>polydactyly</b> limb patterning models are used to simulate the congenital disorder at the limb, being able to explain the development paths of <b>polydactyly.</b>|$|E
50|$|Type VII of radial <b>polydactyly</b> is {{associated}} with several syndromes:Holt-Oram syndrome, Fanconi anemia (aplastic anemia {{by the age of}} 6), Townes-Brocks syndrome, and Greig cephalopolysyndactyly (also known to occur with ulnar <b>polydactyly).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Polydactyly</b> {{can occur}} by itself, or more commonly, as one feature of a {{syndrome}} of congenital anomalies. When it occurs by itself, it {{is associated with}} autosomal dominant mutations in single genes, i.e. {{it is not a}} multifactorial trait. But mutation in a variety of genes can give rise to <b>polydactyly.</b> Typically the mutated gene is involved in developmental patterning, and a syndrome of congenital anomalies results, of which <b>polydactyly</b> is one feature or two.|$|E
50|$|Other syndromes {{including}} <b>polydactyly</b> include acrocallosal syndrome, {{basal cell}} nevus syndrome, Biemond syndrome, ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasias-cleft lip/palate syndrome, mirror hand deformity, Mohr syndrome, oral-facial-digital syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, short rib <b>polydactyly,</b> and VATER association.It can also occur with a triphalangeal thumb.|$|E

50|$|Other {{names for}} acropectoral {{syndrome}} include ACRPS, Syndactyly, preaxial <b>polydactyly</b> and sternal deformity, and ACRP syndrome. This syndrome {{is characterized by}} syndactyly of all fingers/toes, pre axial <b>polydactyly</b> in the hands/feet, and upper sternum malformations. More specifically affected individuals show soft tissue syndactyly of all fingers and toes. 14 out of the 22 individuals had pre axial <b>polydactyly,</b> as well had a blind-ending U-shaped sinus in the chest wall or a prominent upper sternum. Other symptoms included an extra big toe and an extra thumb (6). Treatment of individuals affected with this syndrome include oral pathology, facial and limb plastic surgery, and pediatric otolaryngology (7). This syndrome is different than acropectorovertebral dysplasia because the vertebral anomalies seen in acropectorovertebral dysplasia were not observed in these patients. This syndrome also differed from acropectorovertebral dysplasia because of the carpal, tarsal, and metatarsal synostoses {{as well as the}} preaxial <b>polydactyly</b> that occurred in the feet {{as well as in the}} hands. Soft tissue syndactyly was more prominent that in acropectorovertebral dysplasia. The limb defects seen in acropectoral syndrome are also similar to those that occur in other dominantly inherited types of preaxial <b>polydactyly,</b> including preaxial <b>polydactyly</b> type II (PPD2), preaxial <b>polydactyly</b> type III (PPD3) and triphalangeal thumb- polysyndactyly (TPT-PS). Acropectoral syndrome is autosomal dominant and best described in 22 patients of a Turkish family spanning six generations. The prevalence of this disease is less than 1 in 1 million.|$|E
50|$|Surgical options {{depend on}} type of <b>polydactyly.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Polydactyly</b> was {{believed}} to be common in the earliest tetrapods, the number of digits settling to the common five on each foot in amniotes and four to the hand and five to the foot in amphibians in the early Carboniferous; for more information, see <b>Polydactyly</b> in early tetrapods.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} has an {{incidence of}} 1 in every 500 live births. Postaxial hand <b>polydactyly</b> {{is a common}} isolated disorder in African black children, and autosomal dominant transmission is suspected. Postaxial <b>polydactyly</b> is more frequent in native Africans living in the Eastern and Central than the Caucasians and Mongoloids and is more frequent in male children. In contrast, postaxial <b>polydactyly</b> seen in white children is usually syndromic and associated with an autosomal recessive transmission. One study by Finley et al. combined data from Jefferson County, Alabama, United States and Uppsala County, Sweden. This study showed incidence {{of all types of}} <b>polydactyly</b> to be 2.3 per 1000 in Caucasian males, 0.6 per 1000 in Caucasian females, 13.5 per 1000 in African males, and 11.1 per 1000 in African females.|$|E

50|$|Silkies {{are also}} known for their <b>polydactyly,</b> usually manifesting as an {{additional}} 1-2 digits in the foot.

Interestingly, while the feet of the Silkie display <b>polydactyly,</b> the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie <b>polydactyly</b> differs from those that cause <b>polydactyly</b> in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to ectopic FGF4 expression in the AER, with ectopic SHH a secondary effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polydactyly</b> {{in early}} {{tetrapods}} should here {{be understood as}} having more than five digits to the finger or foot, a condition that was the natural state of affairs {{in the very first}} tetrapods. The <b>polydactyly</b> in these largely aquatic animals is {{not to be confused with}} <b>polydactyly</b> in the medical sense, i.e. it was not an anomaly in the sense it was not a congenital condition of having more than the typical number of digits for a given taxon. Rather, it appears to be a result of the early evolution from a limb with a fin rather than digits.|$|E
