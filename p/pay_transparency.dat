40|$|Using a broad {{sample of}} the largest European companies, I examine whether the two {{governance}} mechanisms, namely (i) independent monitoring by {{a board of directors}} and (ii) grants and disclosures of incentive-based executive pay, are substitutes for one another. I find that companies with proportionately more executives on their boards of directors grant greater incentive-based pay to their executives, and improve the <b>transparency</b> of their <b>pay</b> disclosure. The findings are consistent with the efficient contracting argument, which predicts that greater incentive-based pay and <b>pay</b> disclosure <b>transparency</b> mitigate agency problems generated by boards dependent upon managemen...|$|R

40|$|Directors’ and executives’ remuneration, {{including}} {{levels of}} <b>pay,</b> accountability and <b>transparency,</b> is controversial. Section 250 R of the CLERP (Audit Reform & Disclosure) Act 2004 {{that was not}} greatly anticipated, requires the holding of a non-binding resolution on board remuneration at companies’ annual general meetings. The reform has been criticised on the basis that, inter alia, it blurs the respective roles of shareholders and directors. This article identifies possible motivations for the imposition of the non-binding resolution in Australia. These are evaluated with reference to sources of corporate governance policy and {{the current state of}} Australia’s relevant corporate governance structures. We speculate that the non-binding vote will not amount to a substantive addition to the corporate governance regime...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete {{solution to the}} H 2 and H ∞ problems for sampled-data systems. As opposed to previous work in the area, it is assumed here that all {{or some of the}} sampling function, the discrete-time controller and the hold function are available for design. The solution is obtained by transforming the problem to discrete-time using the wellknown lifting technique. It is then shown that the desired components of the sampled-data controller can be “peeled-off ” from the inherently infinite dimensional description in the lifted-domain. The procedure for doing this last step is central to the approach in the paper. Both new and revised solutions are presented in the paper. The solution to the H 2 problems is completely new. The solution to the H ∞ problems is presented in a unifying framework, and is more transparent than the previous existing in the literature. <b>Transparency</b> <b>pays</b> in the form of clearer results. In particular, a separation structure is established between the design of (sub) optimal hold and sampler. ...|$|R
40|$|The Equal Pay Act had a {{distinct}} market purpose. Congress made a policy choice to modify the existing compensation market so that employees who perform jobs requiring substantially “equal skill, effort, and responsibility” earn equal wages, regardless of sex. The Act aimed not simply to promote individual fairness, but to foster a more efficient, equitable wage market on a systemic level. Congress recognized that paying lower wages to women constituted “an unfair method of competition,” burdened “commerce and {{the free flow of}} goods in commerce,” and prevented the “maximum utilization of available labor resources. ” Over time, however, the “market” in equal pay cases has been transformed from the fundamental reason for the Act to an acceptable business defense for paying women less. At the same time, pay discrimination is conceptualized today in the rhetoric of “fairness,” which overshadows the core market purpose of the Act. This Article contends that equal pay laws have failed in their market purpose and will continue to fail so long as reform is centered solely on a litigation-enforcement model. The Article reframes pay discrimination as a market failure caused by insufficient and asymmetric information about the value of work, rather than an individual fairness concern. It explores lessons that can be learned from executive compensation scholarship, which offers more sophisticated analyses of the causes of abusive pay practices. Executive pay scholars have exposed: (1) the human dynamics and conditions that cause compensation markets to fail; (2) the ineffectiveness of litigation to fully address abusive pay because of court reluctance to interfere with “business judgments” about compensation; and (3) the crucial role of transparency as a market-based approach to reform abusive pay practices. Applying these lessons in modified form, the Article examines how pay secrecy distorts compensation markets and permits pay discrimination to flourish, {{even in the absence of}} intentional sex discrimination. Given the increasing ineffectiveness of equal pay litigation, it analyzes how <b>pay</b> disclosure and <b>transparency</b> can be used to promote a more efficient compensation market in which employees are appropriately valued and rewarded without the taint of discriminatory factors...|$|R

40|$|Reputational {{concerns}} are arguably {{the single most}} powerful incentive for board directors {{to act in the}} interest of shareholders. We propose a model to investigate the impact of boards' reputational concerns on the level and structure of executive compensation, the use of camou aged pay, and the relation between board independence and compensation decisions. We show that, in order to be perceived as independent, boards lower managers' pay, but may also pay managers in hidden ways or structure compensation ine ciently. Interestingly, independent boards, not manager-friendly boards, are more likely to make use of hidden compensation.

40|$|The Supreme Court’s {{decision}} in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes provides {{a unique opportunity}} to reflect on whether and how the legal system should address unjustified pay disparities between men and women who perform similar jobs. This Article describes the Court’s decision and analyzes the insights it offers about the legal quest for equal pay. First, Wal-Mart demonstrates the tension between Title VII’s focus on the employer’s intent and the economic realities of how pay discrimination happens in the modern workplace. As the women at Wal-Mart experienced and research confirms, pay disparities tend to be the greatest when employers delegate excessive, unchecked discretion to supervisors. Second, Wal-Mart exemplifies how litigation remedies tend to be ineffective for pay discrimination because of the intent requirement of Title VII, the prima facie standard of substantial equality under the Equal Pay Act, the broad “factor other than sex” defense, and procedural difficulties for group actions. This Article proposes a blueprint for a more effective remedy for pay discrimination that would: (1) provide incentives for self-regulation by employers, such as <b>pay</b> <b>transparency</b> and periodic compensation audits; (2) limit defenses to those that are job-related and consistent with business necessity; (3) incorporate a pragmatic interpretation of equal work; and (4) facilitate group actions for systemic pay discrimination...|$|E
