5|$|A report {{had been}} {{prepared}} for the <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood – 2,700 by that time, with 530 houses – compared with the largely rural character {{of the rest of}} Ruislip parish. At a meeting of the Ruislip <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> on 28 October 1903, the forthcoming extension of the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow on the Hill to Uxbridge was also discussed as it was known that a station would be opened in Ruislip on the new line. Councillors were also aware that King's College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish and lords of the manor, were planning to sell some for development. With this in mind, a vote was cast which went in favour of becoming an urban district. The new district was designed to better reflect to increase in development, as councillors felt a <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> would work slower than an urban district.|$|E
5|$|Chew Stoke {{has its own}} nine-member <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> with {{responsibility}} for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also {{the responsibility of the}} council.|$|E
5000|$|The {{role played}} by <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> varies. Smaller <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> have only limited {{resources}} and generally play only a minor role, while some larger <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> have a role {{similar to that of}} a small district <b>council.</b> <b>Parish</b> <b>councils</b> receive funding by levying a [...] "precept" [...] on the council tax paid by the residents of the parish.|$|R
50|$|In 1894 <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> were {{established}} for the civil parishes, replacing the previous parochial boards. The <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> were in turn replaced by district councils in 1930.|$|R
25|$|It had {{originally}} been envisaged that <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> should also be abolished, but the Secretary of the National Association of <b>Parish</b> <b>Councils</b> (NACP), Charles Arnold-Baker, convinced the Commission {{that they should be}} preserved.|$|R
5|$|Dormand {{had been}} a member of the Labour Party since the age of 18. He was elected to Haswell <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> at the age of 26, and at 30 to Easington rural {{district}} council.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{days after}} the storm, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies {{allocated}} CHF150,644 (US$156,221) to sustain the Jamaica Red Cross in distributing aid to about 500 familiesor 2,500 beneficiariesin need of life supplies. In late December 2010, the JamaicaCanadian Association in Toronto, Ontario raised a total of CDN$10,153.87 (US$10,221.33) in relief funds for flood victims. The Hanover <b>Parish</b> <b>Council</b> requested J$30million (US$351,000) to assist the Saint James <b>Parish</b> <b>Council</b> and other municipal authorities {{across the country in}} post-storm clean-up and beautification work. A grant of J$279million (US$3.26million) was approved for the reconstruction of a major roadway section in Westmoreland Parish.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 Thanet Council {{set up a}} <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> for the Westgate-on-Sea ward. The new council {{took office}} at its first meeting in May 2015 as Westgate-on-Sea Town Council. It meets in Westgate-on-Sea Town Hall.|$|E
50|$|Welsh {{community}} councils are {{a direct}} replacement for earlier <b>parish</b> <b>councils,</b> under the Local Government Act 1972, and are identical to English <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> {{in terms of}} their powers and the way they operate.|$|R
50|$|Per Arne Dahl became Bishop of the Diocese of Tunsberg in 2014. The Diocese of Tunsberg {{consists}} {{of a number of}} registered Joint <b>Parish</b> <b>Councils.</b> The <b>Parish</b> <b>Councils</b> have responsibility for a number of neighboring parishes within rural deaneries.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Parish</b> <b>councils</b> are {{sometimes}} mistakenly distinguished from <b>parish</b> pastoral <b>councils,</b> {{as if the}} two were separate parish entities. The first <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> were, properly speaking, [...] "apostolate" [...] councils of the type recommended in the Decree on Laity, par. 26. When the Code of Canon Law was revised, it did not refer to apostolate councils, but called for pastoral councils.|$|R
5|$|In the 21st century, {{only the}} {{earthworks}} {{of the castle}} remain. The western bailey is managed by the <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> and the inner bailey by English Heritage, while the eastern bailey remains under cultivation.

5|$|Kilham now forms part of Wooler electoral {{division}} of Northumberland County Council, represented by Anthony Murray of the Conservative Party, {{who was elected}} to the new council on its creation in 2008. The parish does not have a <b>parish</b> <b>council.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since 31 May 2009 Ditton {{has had an}} officially {{recognised}} nature reserve, Ditton Quarry off Kilnbarn Road.

50|$|Civil <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> {{were formed}} in England under the {{reforming}} Local Government Act 1894 {{to take over}} local oversight of civic duties in rural towns and villages. The act created two new types of local authority, <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> and district councils, to rationalise {{the large number of}} bodies which existed for a variety of activities such as public health, secular burials, water supply and drainage. It also finally removed secular duties from the local Vestry committees and gave them to the new <b>parish</b> <b>councils.</b>|$|R

5|$|The castle {{site was}} then {{sold by the}} Commissioners to Deddington's <b>parish</b> <b>council.</b> The <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> {{intended}} to build tennis courts in the inner bailey of the castle in 1947 but, when work began, medieval pottery and roof tiles began to be unearthed by the builders. Construction work was halted and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford sponsored an archaeological investigation by Edward Jope and Richard Threlfall that continued until 1953. The plans for the tennis courts were dropped {{in light of the}} findings, and the site was instead used as a park. A further phase of archaeological investigation of the castle was carried out between 1977 and 1979, sponsored by the Queen's University Belfast and led by Richard Ivens.|$|E

5000|$|The {{white paper}} {{proposed}} that the existing prohibition on <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> in Greater London would be abolished, and making new parishes easier to set up. <b>Parish</b> <b>councils</b> can currently be styled <b>parish</b> <b>councils,</b> town councils or city councils: the White Paper proposes that [...] "community council", [...] "neighbourhood council" [...] and [...] "village council" [...] {{may be used as}} well. The reforms strengthen the council executives, and provided an option between a directly elected mayor, a directly elected executive, or an indirectly elected leader - all with a fixed four-year term. These proposals were enacted under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.|$|R
5000|$|Since 13 February 2008 {{the power}} to create new <b>parishes</b> and <b>parish</b> <b>councils,</b> to alter <b>parish</b> boundaries, to {{dissolve}} <b>parish</b> <b>councils</b> and to abolish parishes has been devolved to district, unitary and London Borough councils (collectively known as [...] "principal councils"). This process {{is known as a}} [...] "community governance review".|$|R
5|$|Civil parishes do {{not cover}} {{the whole of}} England and mostly exist in rural areas. They are usually {{administered}} by parish councils which have various local responsibilities. Parish councillors, like city councillors, are elected to represent the views of local people. Ailsworth, Bainton, Barnack, Borough Fen, Bretton, Castor, Deeping Gate, Etton, Eye, Glinton, Helpston, Marholm, Maxey, Newborough, Northborough, Orton Longueville, Orton Waterville, Peakirk, St. Martin's Without (Parish Meeting), Southorpe, Sutton, Thorney, Thornhaugh, Ufford, Upton (Parish Meeting), Wansford, Wittering, and Wothorpe each have a <b>parish</b> <b>council.</b> Newborough and Borough Fen merged on 1 April 2012. The city council also works closely with Werrington neighbourhood association which operates on a similar basis to a <b>parish</b> <b>council.</b> Parish elections are held simultaneously on the ordinary day of election of councillors for the district.|$|E
5|$|Crook Peak {{has been}} {{important}} as a landmark and boundary from very early times, and {{the origins of the}} name are unclear. The local <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> state that 'Crook' comes from the Old English 'Cruc' meaning 'peak' or 'pointed hill'. 'Shute' is a contraction of schute which meant slope in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Hebden has a <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> {{with five}} {{independent}} members {{supported by a}} parish clerk. Elections are held every four years, the most recent in 2016. Council meetings are held every six weeks. The parish council's activities are largely funded by income from parish lands {{in the form of}} rent, grants, and easements.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Parish</b> <b>councils</b> {{are funded}} by levying a [...] "precept" [...] {{collected}} with the council tax {{paid by the}} residents of the <b>parish.</b> <b>Parish</b> <b>councils</b> have unpaid councillors who are elected to serve for four years, unless a casual vacancy arises which may be filled by a by-election or by co-option.|$|R

5|$|Ickenham had a <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> {{but came}} within the Uxbridge Rural District until 1925, {{when this was}} absorbed into the Municipal Borough of Uxbridge. This {{remained}} until 1965, when the borough {{was included in the}} newly established London Borough of Hillingdon. Within the borough of Hillingdon, Ickenham has its own ward, with Conservative Councillors John Hensley, Raymond Puddifoot and David Simmons representing it.|$|E
5|$|In the UK {{national}} parliament, Puddletown {{is within}} the West Dorset parliamentary constituency, which is currently represented by Oliver Letwin of the Conservative Party. In local government, Puddletown is governed by Dorset County Council at the highest tier, West Dorset District Council at the second tier, and Puddletown Area <b>Parish</b> <b>Council</b> at the lowest tier.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 1905, {{following}} lobbying by Ickenham <b>Parish</b> <b>Council,</b> the Metropolitan Railway {{opened a}} small halt on their line between Harrow and Uxbridge. The railway {{company had been}} reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of demand, and so a compromise was reached {{with the construction of}} the halt. The new stop brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Nearby villagers sold flowers from their gardens and served teas to the visitors. The <b>parish</b> <b>council</b> later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905, followed by a booking hut in 1910. The original platforms, too short to align with all train carriages, were extended in 1922. Ickenham Halt was rebuilt as a station in the 1970s.|$|E
