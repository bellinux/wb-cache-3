25|$|<b>Passenger</b> <b>fare</b> {{subsidies}} are unpopular outside Metro Manila, with subsidy opponents claiming that their taxes {{are being used}} to subsidize Metro Manila commuters without any benefit to the countryside, and that the fare subsidies should be used for infrastructure improvements {{in the rest of the}} country. In his 2013 State of the Nation Address, President Benigno Aquino III claimed that it would be unfair for non-Metro Manila residents to use their taxes to subsidize the LRT and MRT. However, supporters of the subsidies claimed that the rest of the country benefits economically from efficient transportation in Metro Manila.|$|E
25|$|As the Railway minister, he has {{advocated}} instituting a rail regulator to fix rail fares, {{a policy}} that is diametrically opposite to the one by earlier railway ministers. He has also advocated de-politicizing the Railways {{and would like to}} restructure the Indian Railway Board, which lacked synergy before he joined. Trivedi believes that the Indian Railways can add 2% to India's GDP and is willing to go against his party's line of not hiking the fares. However, he believes the government must modernize the railways, for which a fare hike {{would not be able to}} generate adequate funds, and has publicly criticized the Prime Minister for not providing funds.. Trivedi is pushing for a national policy on railways, that would continue irrespective of political changes in the government. He has also said that the ministry is also open to the idea of privatization, which would allow more funds to be allocated to help the system cope with capacity. He stepped down as the Railway Minister on 18 March 2012, a couple of days after presenting his first ever Railway Budget in which he increased <b>passenger</b> <b>fare.</b> This did not go down well with his political party, Trinamool Congress and in particular its head West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.|$|E
25|$|The BC Express began {{a weekly}} round trip service from Fort Gorge to Tête Jaune Cache, {{carrying}} capacity loads of freight and passengers. The <b>passenger</b> <b>fare</b> was $35, meals and berths extra, and the freight rate was $80 a ton. This latter seemed quite costly, until the shipper investigated the alternative shipping method, which was shipping his cargo by scow for $70 a ton, with {{no guarantee that}} the shipment would arrive intact, or at all. The risk to scows was mostly at the Grand Canyon, and the deadly whirlpool within it, which was responsible for the loss of at least eighty lives that summer alone, as well as the loss of approximately one in ten scows, and thousands of dollars of merchandise. Needless to say, the BC Express did a brisk business that season, often grossing $12,000 on a single trip. She was the only sternwheeler to offer freight and passenger service to the general public, as the Operator and Conveyor were strictly used for hauling their own workers and supplies needed for rail construction. The BC Express also had a very interesting season in 1913 and many stories of what occurred that summer were told and retold for years afterwards.|$|E

40|$|<b>Passenger</b> <b>fares</b> for {{flights to}} and from the United States {{recently}} experienced a strong recovery after recording large decreases during the recent global recession. For the United States, the recent recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. After a decade of steady increases, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Import and Export Air <b>Passenger</b> <b>Fares</b> Indexes declined sharply between the recession years 2008 and 2009. Following the recession, the industry has shown signs of recovery, with ticket prices increasing in the past 2 years. An analysis of the BLS international airfare indexes helps to shed some light on the factors that led to this rebound. BLS publishes price indexes that track general trends in international air travel {{to and from}} the United States. The BLS Import Air <b>Passenger</b> <b>Fares</b> Index tracks changes in the fares paid to foreign air carriers by U. S. residents, and the Export Air <b>Passenger</b> <b>Fares</b> Index tracks changes in the fares paid to U. S. carriers by foreign residents. These indexes were first published on a quarterly basis in the late 1980 s; since March 2001, BLS has published the air <b>passenger</b> <b>fares</b> indexes on a monthly basis. The indexes also track airfares by region, such as Europe, Latin America, and Asia...|$|R

2500|$|In 1990 {{the charge}} for a round trip was {{increased}} to 50 cents, provoking a backlash among Staten Islanders, and sparking calls for its complete abolition. Grievances over the fare partly contributed to Staten Island voting in 1993 {{to secede from}} New York City in a non-binding referendum. Rudy Giuliani's three-percent margin of victory in the concurrent mayoral elections was in considerable {{part due to the}} support of 80% of Staten Island voters, whose concerns he had pledged to address. The <b>passenger</b> <b>fare</b> was subsequently eliminated altogether in July 1997 as part of the implementation of the MTA's [...] "one-city, one-fare" [...] system, which allowed for more free transfers between different modes of transit in New York City. The separate $3 car fares were unaffected. The new MetroCard had been configured to allow one free transfer between buses and subways or other buses within 2 hours of the first payment, and eliminating the ferry fare was seen as an action to equalize Staten Islanders' MetroCard fares with those of commuters in other boroughs. Despite the fact that the ferry fare had netted $6 million in annual revenue for the city, its abolition only cost the city about $1 million, due to the savings from removing the turnstiles as well as the revenue from MetroCard fares. Some riders disliked the removal of the fares, as they felt that free service might result in lower-quality rides.|$|E
