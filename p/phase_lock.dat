40|$|Background Working memory (WM) deficits are a core {{feature of}} schizophrenia. Recent {{electrophysiological}} {{evidence indicates that}} the brain systems for visual encoding are especially impaired. However, patients still achieve performance levels clearly above chance, which indicates the existence of residual mechanisms supporting WM encoding. The present study presents evidence that alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> of the electroencephalogram is a marker for such residual cognitive mechanisms. Methods Alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> during encoding into WM was compared between 17 patients with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and 17 healthy control subjects. Results of <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> were correlated with accuracy. A median split based on alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> in patients {{was used to compare}} accuracy between control subjects and patients with high and low alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking.</b> Results Alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> increased with WM memory load in both EOS and control subjects, although alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> was generally reduced in EOS. Furthermore, for EOS, a positive correlation between alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> and performance was obtained. Additionally, patients exhibiting high <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> did not differ in performance from control subjects. Conclusions These results provide the first evidence for a relationship between alpha <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> and visual WM encoding. This neural mechanism seems to be preserved in some patients with schizophrenia and then allows them to attain normal performance levels...|$|R

50|$|Typically {{these are}} caused by poor design. Where there is mixed signal {{technology}} on a printed circuit board, e.g. analogue, digital and possibly RF, it is usually necessary for a highly skilled engineer to specify the layout of where the grounds are to be interconnected. Typically the digital section will have its own ground plane to obtain the necessary low inductance grounding and avoid ground bounce which can cause severe digital malfunction. But digital ground current must not pass through the analog grounding system, where voltage drop due to the finite ground impedance would cause noise to be injected into the analogue circuits. <b>Phase</b> <b>lock</b> loop circuits are particularly vulnerable because the VCO loop filter circuit is working with sub-microvolt signals when the loop is locked, and any disturbance will cause frequency jitter and possible loss of lock.|$|E
50|$|This scheme {{does not}} allow the {{addition}} of a stuffed bit as soon as it is required because the stuffable bit is in a fixed point in the frame so it is necessary to wait until the stuffable bit time slot. This wait results in “waiting time jitter” which can be arbitrarily low in frequency (i.e. down to zero) so cannot be entirely eliminated by the filtering effects of the <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> loop. The worst possible stuffing ratio would be 1 frame in 2 as this gives a theoretical 0.5 bit of jitter so the stuffing ratio is carefully chosen to give theoretical minimum jitter. In a practical system however, the actual decision to stuff or not may be made by comparing the read address and write address of the input buffer store so the position in the frame when the decision is made varies and adds a second variable dependent on the length of the store.|$|E
