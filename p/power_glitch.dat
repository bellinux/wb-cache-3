40|$|Abstract Measuring power {{consumption}} for side channel analysis typically uses an oscilloscope, which measures the data relative {{to an internal}} sample clock. By synchronizing the sampling clock to the clock of the target device, the sample rate requirements are considerably relaxed; the attack will succeed with a much lower sample rate. This work characterizes {{the performance of a}} synchronous sampling system attacking a modern microcontroller running a software AES implementation. This attack is characterized under four conditions: with a stable crystal-oscillator based clock, with a clock that is randomly varied between 3. 9 MHz– 13 MHz, with an internal oscillator that is randomly varied between 7. 2 MHz– 8. 1 MHz, and with an internal oscillator that has slight random variation due to natural ‘drift ’ in the oscillator. Traces captured with the synchronous sampling technique can be processed with a standard Differential Power Analysis (DPA) style attack in all four cases, whereas when an oscilloscope is used only the stable oscillator setup is successful. This work also develops the hardware to recover the internal clock of a device which does not have an externally available clock. It is possible to implement this scheme in software only, allowing it to work with existing oscilloscope-based test environments. Performing the recovery in hardware allows the use of fault injection with excellent temporal stability relative to a sensitive event.

While small {{low-cost}} tagging solutions for supply-chain management exist, security in the face of fault-injection [1] and side-channel attacks [2] remains a concern. <b>Power</b> <b>glitch</b> attacks [3] in particular attempt to leak key-bits by inducing fault conditions during cryptographic operation through the use of over-voltage and under-voltage conditions. This paper presents the design of a secure authentication tag with wireless power and data delivery optimized for compact size and near-field applications. Power-glitch attacks are mitigated through state backup on FeRAM based non-volatile flip-flops (NVDFFs) [4]. The tag uses Keccak [5] (the cryptographic core of SHA 3) to update the key before each protocol invocation, limiting side-channel leakage to a single trace per key. Fig. 1 shows the complete system including the tag, reader, and backend server implemented in this work. Tags are seeded at manufacture and this initial seed is stored in the server database before a tag is affixed to an item. A wireless power and data transfer (WPDT) frontend harvests energy from the reader (433 MHz inductive link) and powers the on-chip authentication engine (AE). On startup the AE updates its key using a PRNG (seeded with the old key) and increments the key index. The AE then responds to the subsequent challenge, by encrypting the challenge under the new key.

This research has focused on several hardware related attacks and potential threats. Namely, <b>power</b> <b>glitch</b> attack, power analysis, laser attack, the potential effect on security of memory power consumption reduction techniques and using a re-configurable instruction set as method to harden opcode interpretation. A semi-automated simulation environment to test designs against glitch attacks and power analysis has been developed. This simulation environment can be easily integrated within Atmel’s design flow to bring assurance of their designs’ behaviour and permeability to such attacks at an early development stage. Previous power analysis simulation work focused on testing the implementation of part of the cryptographic algorithm. This work focuses on targeting the whole algorithm, allowing the test of a wider range of countermeasures. A common glitch detection approach is monitoring the power supply for abnormal voltage values and fluctuations. This approach can fail to detect some fast glitches. The alternative approach used in this research monitors the effects of a glitch on a mono-stable circuit sensitive to fault injection by glitch attacks. This work has resulted in a patented glitch detector that improves the overall glitch detection range.

40|$|Glitches are an {{important}} source of power dissipation in static CMOS ICs that can contribute to as much as 70 % of total power dissipation in certain cases (e. g., arithmetic modules). Although research into various aspects of <b>glitch</b> <b>power</b> dissipation has been undertaken in the past, most approaches to addressing it are ad hoc and limited in their applicability. In this paper, we propose a new framework, gate triggering, for systematically minimizing <b>glitch</b> <b>power</b> dissipation in static CMOS ICs.

Private circuits II is a proven protection against a strong attacker, able {{to read and write}} on a finite number of chosen internal nodes. In practice, side-channel analyses and fault injections are less accurate: typically, classical injection techniques (clock and <b>power</b> <b>glitches,</b> electromagnetic pulses, etc.) can be reproducible, but they do not allow to choose the targeted nodes (the situation is different for software dual-rail with precharge logic, such as [1], [2], where (0, 1) ↔ (1, 0) bitflips are easier to achieve, since the computation is fully sequentialized [3]). So, a priori, private circuits II should be a secure protection against such classical fault injection attacks. In this paper, we provide the first implementation of private circuits II in FPGA, secure against read and/or reset of one internal wire chosen by the attacker. Our implementation is a manually coded netlist which instantiates LUT 6 2 (with dual outputs, as required for private circuits II). Our design is a SIMON block cipher programmed in a Spartan 6 Xilinx FPGA. It features a throughput of 142 Mbit/s. We perform a security analysis, and notice that some exploitable ciphertexts can be outputted despite the countermeasure. Our analysis reveals that correlated faults exist because LUT 6 2 outputs are produced almost simultaneously. In particular, the critical path actually consists in a dual-rail pair, which is consistently faulted together. If this pair is late with respect to the clock rising edge, then the previous value can be latched instead of the new one. Such fault behaves like a toggle ((01) 2 becomes (10) 2 or vice-versa) of licit values. They propagate to the ciphertext which becomes by the same token susceptible to a differential fault attack. Nonetheless, we emphasize that such faults require a steady fault injection setup: otherwise, multiple critical paths are violated, resulting in non-exploitable (fully zeroized) ciphertexts.
