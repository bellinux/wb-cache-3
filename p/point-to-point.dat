5|$|International {{airports}} have {{commercial relationships}} with and {{provide services to}} airlines and passengers from around the world. Many also serve as hubs, or places where non-direct flights may land and passengers may switch planes, while others serve primarily direct <b>point-to-point</b> flights. This affects airport design factors, including the number and placement of terminals {{as well as the}} flow of passengers and baggage between different areas of the airport. An airport specializing in <b>point-to-point</b> transit can have international and domestic terminals, each in their separate building equipped with separate baggage handling facilities. In a hub airport, however, spaces and services are shared.|$|E
5|$|A test {{fleet of}} 10 i-MiEVs was {{deployed}} in Masdar City in Abu Dhabi in 2011 {{as part of}} a one-year pilot to test a <b>point-to-point</b> transportation solution for the city as complement of its sustainable public transportation systems, the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) and the Freight Rapid Transit (FRT), both of which consist of automated electric-powered vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve road safety, traffic cameras were first {{introduced}} to Canberra by the Carnell Government in 1999. The traffic cameras installed in Canberra include fixed red-light and speed cameras and <b>point-to-point</b> speed cameras; together they bring in revenue of approximately $11million per year in fines.|$|E
5|$|Tele{{communication}} over fixed {{lines is}} called <b>point-to-point</b> communication {{because it is}} between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called broadcast communication because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but sensitive radio receivers.|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} {{global economy and}} ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of <b>point-to-point</b> flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as <b>point-to-point</b> travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional hub-and-spoke model.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the airline}} has focused its North American cargo {{operations}} solely on <b>point-to-point</b> routes. By 2004, EVA Air Cargo {{ranked among the}} world's top 10 largest air freight companies. Industry publication Air Cargo World ranked EVA Air Cargo 6th out of 50 in its 2008 Air Cargo Excellence Survey, a measure of cargo service customer service and performance. In 2008, EVA Air handled the transport of two Chinese pandas, donated {{as a gift to}} the Taipei Zoo.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, Aer Lingus voluntarily exited the {{alliance}} {{due to a}} fundamental change to its business strategy. The Irish carrier was repositioning itself as a low fares <b>point-to-point</b> carrier, while Oneworld's focus was on the multisector, premium, frequent international travellers' market. Although no longer a Oneworld member, Aer Lingus maintained frequent-flyer program partnerships {{with some of the}} alliance members and continued to participate in the alliance's Global Explorer round-the-world fare product.|$|E
5|$|Colin McRae Rally is a rally racing {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Codemasters. It was originally released for iOS mobile devices in June 2013, and then ported to Android devices and OS X and Windows personal computers (PCs) in 2014. Gameplay is similar to early iterations of the Colin McRae Rally series of racing games with content predominantly taken from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. Players can drive cars and participate in <b>point-to-point</b> rally events, competing against times recorded by computer drivers. Stages take place in several different locations with varied terrain like tarmac and gravel. The game features damage modelling and chassis deformation effects that can be sustained from collisions.|$|E
5|$|In its 2000 Global Market Forecast, Airbus {{estimated}} {{the demand for}} 1,235 passenger Very Large Aircraft (VLA), with more than 400 seats : 360 up to 2009 and 875 by 2019. The market is estimated for two decades at more than 1,700 by Airbus and 700 by Boeing since 1999-2000, including freighters. In 2006, industry analysts Philip Lawrence of the Aerospace Research Centre in Bristol anticipated 880 sales by 2025 with Airbus having conducted the most extensive and thorough market analysis of commercial aviation ever undertaken, justifying its VLA plans to design the A380 by the spoke-hub distribution paradigm while Richard Aboulafia of the consulting Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia anticipated 400 {{with the rise of}} mid-size aircraft and market fragmentation reducing them to niche markets, making such plans unjustified in a <b>point-to-point</b> transit model.|$|E
5|$|Colin McRae Rally is {{a racing}} video {{game in which}} players can drive cars in <b>point-to-point</b> rally events. The game can be played from a behind-the-car {{perspective}} or from a bonnet camera view. On mobile devices, cars can be steered using on-screen buttons which provide digital input or using tilt controls which provide analog input. The game's content and driving model are taken directly from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. The game features thirty rally stages from Colin McRae Rally 2.0, located in Australia, Corsica, and Greece. Terrain and surfaces vary between stages ranging from smooth tarmac roads to gravely off-road tracks. Track information is provided through verbal descriptions from the co-driver and icons that appear {{near the top of}} the screen. The icons display the severity and difficulty of turns using colour-coding. A progress indicator is also displayed on screen, so that the player can see how much of the course they have completed and compare their position to the computer drivers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Point-to-point</b> is {{run over}} {{farmland}} {{as opposed to}} on a racecourse. There are over 100 <b>point-to-point</b> meetings each year, mainly organised by local hunt committees with the oversight of the Turf Club. Many successful Irish National Hunt horses, including a number of Gold Cup and Grand National winners, began their careers over <b>point-to-point</b> courses.|$|E
25|$|PRT {{vehicles}} are sized for individual or small group travel, typically carrying {{no more than}} three to six passengers per vehicle. Guideways are arranged in a network topology, with all stations located on sidings, and with frequent merge/diverge points. This allows for nonstop, <b>point-to-point</b> travel, bypassing all intermediate stations. The <b>point-to-point</b> service has been compared to a taxi or a horizontal lift (elevator).|$|E
25|$|Approach {{spaces are}} a {{generalization}} of metric spaces, based on point-to-set distances, instead of <b>point-to-point</b> distances.|$|E
25|$|The I/O {{interface}}, also a Rambus design, {{is known}} as FlexIO. The FlexIO interface is organized into 12 lanes, each lane being a unidirectional 8-bit wide <b>point-to-point</b> path. Five 8-bit wide <b>point-to-point</b> paths are inbound lanes to Cell, while the remaining seven are outbound. This provides a theoretical peak bandwidth of 62.4GB/s (36.4GB/s outbound, 26GB/s inbound) at 2.6GHz. The FlexIO interface can be clocked independently, typ. at 3.2GHz. 4 inbound + 4 outbound lanes are supporting memory coherency.|$|E

25|$|One of Brodrick's matches against Richmond is {{believed}} to have been held at Peper Harow, the family seat of the Brodrick family, which is near Godalming. A local club still plays there and it is the location of a <b>point-to-point</b> racecourse.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the tracks, the main {{emphasis}} is on real-world permanent circuits which make up the majority of the courses in the game. These range from classics, such as Spa-Francorchamps, Brands Hatch, Mount Panorama and Indianapolis, to more modern facilities, like the Circuit of the Americas, Sepang, the Red Bull Ring and the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi. City locations with fictionally lined, but mostly real-world streets of San Francisco, Paris, Dubai etc., and - as DLCs - fictional <b>point-to-point</b> tracks in authentic settings complete the picture. In all, players are able to race on 15 real-world permanent circuits, 2 fictional permanent circuits, 7 street circuits, and 4 <b>point-to-point</b> tracks, including additional content, for a total of 28 locations with over 130 configurations.|$|E
25|$|Through-hole PCB {{technology}} {{almost completely}} replaced earlier electronics assembly {{techniques such as}} <b>point-to-point</b> construction. From the second generation of computers in the 1950s until surface-mount technology became popular in the late 1980s, every component on a typical PCB was a through-hole component.|$|E
25|$|<b>Point-to-point</b> {{teleportation}} at {{the speed}} of light is possible with transfer booths (on Earth) and stepping disks (on the Puppeteer homeworld); on Earth, people's sense of place and global position has been lost due to instantaneous travel; cities and cultures have blended together.|$|E
