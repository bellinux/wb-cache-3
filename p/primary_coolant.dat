5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E
5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> loop. The chamber is filled with xenon gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, {{it does not have}} to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They are shipped to the plant and bolted together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.|$|E

25|$|The coolant {{is pumped}} around the primary circuit by {{powerful}} pumps. After picking up heat as it passes through the reactor core, the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> transfers heat in a steam generator to water in a lower pressure secondary circuit, evaporating the secondary coolant to saturated steam — in most designs 6.2MPa (60atm, 900psia), 275°C (530°F) — {{for use in the}} steam turbine.

25|$|Two {{things are}} {{characteristic}} for the {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) when compared with other reactor types: coolant loop separation from the steam system and pressure inside the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> loop. In a PWR, there are two separate coolant loops (primary and secondary), which are both filled with demineralized/deionized water. A boiling water reactor, by contrast, has only one coolant loop, while more exotic designs such as breeder reactors use substances other than water for coolant and moderator (e.g. sodium in its liquid state as coolant or graphite as a moderator). The pressure in the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> loop is typically , which is notably higher than in other nuclear reactors, and nearly twice that of a boiling water reactor (BWR). As an effect of this, only localized boiling occurs and steam will recondense promptly in the bulk fluid. By contrast, in a boiling water reactor the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> is designed to boil.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear fuel in {{the reactor}} {{pressure}} vessel {{is engaged in a}} fission chain reaction, which produces heat, heating the water in the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> loop by thermal conduction through the fuel cladding. The hot <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> is pumped into a heat exchanger called the steam generator, where it flows through hundreds or thousands of small tubes. Heat is transferred through the walls of these tubes to the lower pressure secondary coolant located on the sheet side of the exchanger where the coolant evaporates to pressurized steam. The transfer of heat is accomplished without mixing the two fluids to prevent the secondary coolant from becoming radioactive. Some common steam generator arrangements are u-tubes or single pass heat exchangers.|$|E

25|$|Pressurized water {{reactors}} (PWRs) {{constitute the}} large majority of the world's nuclear power plants (notable exceptions being the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States and Canada) and are one of three types of light water reactor (LWR), the other types being boiling water reactors (BWRs) and supercritical water reactors (SCWRs). In a PWR, the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> (water) is pumped under high pressure to the reactor core where it is heated by the energy released by the fission of atoms. The heated water then flows to a steam generator where it transfers its thermal energy to a secondary system where steam is generated and flows to turbines which, in turn, spin an electric generator.

40|$|Abstract – In recent years, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest in reactors cooled with high temperature liquid salts. Transient thermal hydraulic analysis of these reactors will be needed both to confirm the designs for normal operation, and to prove their safety under accident conditions. The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is presently developing and supporting the reactor system safety analysis code TRAC/RELAP Advanced Computational Engine (TRACE). TRACE does not presently {{have the capability to}} model these salt-cooled reactor concepts since the thermophysical properties of the salts are not available in the code. In this work, four new liquid salt working fluids were added to TRACE. The salts LiF-BeF 2 and NaF-ZrF 4 are suitable for use as <b>primary</b> <b>coolants</b> in a fluoride salt cooled high temperature reactor (FHR), and the salts LiF-NaF-KF and KF-ZrF 4 are useful in FHR intermediate heat transfer loops.

25|$|The high {{temperature}} water coolant with boric acid dissolved in it is corrosive to carbon steel (but not stainless steel); this can cause radioactive corrosion products to circulate in the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> loop. This not only limits the lifetime of the reactor, but the systems that filter out the corrosion products and adjust the boric acid concentration add significantly to the overall cost of the reactor and to radiation exposure. In one instance, this has resulted in severe corrosion to control rod drive mechanisms when the boric acid solution leaked through the seal between the mechanism itself and the primary system.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} with the classic CANDU design, experimental variants were being developed. WR-1, located at the AECL's Whiteshell Laboratories in Pinawa, Manitoba, used vertical pressure tubes and organic oil as the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant.</b> The oil used has a higher boiling point than water, allowing the reactor to operate at higher temperatures and lower pressures than a conventional reactor. WR-1's outlet temperature was about 490C compared to the CANDU 6's nominal 310C, which means less cooling fluid is needed to remove {{the same amount of}} heat, resulting in a smaller and less expensive core. The higher temperatures also result in more efficient conversion to steam, and ultimately, electricity. WR-1 operated successfully for many years, and promised a significantly higher efficiency than water-cooled versions.|$|E
25|$|Pressure in {{the primary}} circuit is {{maintained}} by a pressurizer, a separate vessel that {{is connected to the}} primary circuit and partially filled with water which is heated to the saturation temperature (boiling point) for the desired pressure by submerged electrical heaters. To achieve a pressure of , the pressurizer temperature is maintained at 345°C (653°F), which gives a subcooling margin (the difference between the pressurizer temperature and the highest temperature in the reactor core) of 30°C (54°F). As 345°C is the boiling point of water at 155 bar, the liquid water is {{at the edge of a}} phase change. Thermal transients in the reactor coolant system result in large swings in pressurizer liquid/steam volume, and total pressurizer volume is designed around absorbing these transients without uncovering the heaters or emptying the pressurizer. Pressure transients in the <b>primary</b> <b>coolant</b> system manifest as temperature transients in the pressurizer and are controlled through the use of automatic heaters and water spray, which raise and lower pressurizer temperature, respectively.|$|E
