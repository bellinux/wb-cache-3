40|$|DOI: 10. 17014 /ijog. 3. 2. 77 - 94 Bayat Complex {{is usually}} {{used as a}} work field for {{students}} of geology and other geosciences. The study area {{is located in the}} southern part of the Bayat Complex. Administratively, it belongs to Central Java Province and Yogyakarta Special Province. The lithology of Bayat is very complex, composed of various kinds of igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, and volcanic rocks. Most of previous researchers interpreted Bayat as a melange complex constructed within a subduction zone. Kebo-Butak is one of formations that forms the Bayat field complex. The formation is composed of basalt, layers of <b>pumice,</b> <b>tuff,</b> shale, and carbonaceous tuff. Most of them are known as volcanic rocks. These imply that volcanic activities are more probable to construct the geology of Bayat rather than the subducted melange complex. The geological mapping, supported by geomorphology, petrology, stratigraphy, and geological structures, had been conducted in a comprehensive manner using the deduction-induction method. The research encounters basalt, black <b>pumice,</b> <b>tuff</b> with basaltic glasses fragments, zeolite, argilic clay, as well as feldspathic- and <b>pumice</b> <b>tuff.</b> Petrographically, the basalt is composed of labradorite, olivine, clinopyroxene, and volcanic glass. Black pumice and tuff contain prismatic clinopyroxene, granular olivine, and volcanic glasses. Feldspathic tuff and <b>pumice</b> <b>tuff</b> are crystal vitric tuff due to more abundant feldspar, quartz, and amphibole than volcanic glass. Zeolite comprises chlorite and altered glasses as deep sea altered volcanic rocks. The geologic structure is very complex, the major structures are normal faults with pyrite in it. There were two deep submarine paleovolcanoes namely Tegalrejo and Baturagung. The first paleovolcano erupted effusively producing basaltic sequence, while the second one erupted explosively ejecting feldspathic-rich pyroclastic material. The two paleovolcanoes erupted simultaneously and repeatedly. </p...|$|E

30|$|Three {{types of}} rock (Oya tuff, Aoshima sandstone, and Ubara sandstone) were used. Oya tuff is dacitic or rhyolitic marine <b>pumice</b> <b>tuff</b> of the Miocene age; it was quarried in Utsunomiya, central Japan. In Japan, {{a variety of}} {{buildings}} and stone statues are made from Oya tuff, which is often damaged by salt weathering (Oguchi and Yuasa 2010). Aoshima sandstone is a very fine-grained, well-cemented sandstone of the Pliocene age; it was collected in the Nichinan Coast, Miyazaki Prefecture, southwest Japan. Ubara sandstone is a fine-grained, weakly cemented, porous sandstone of the Miocene age. The sample was collected on the southeast coast of Chiba Prefecture, central Japan. Tafoni and honeycomb weathering features are well developed on type B shore platforms (Takahashi et al. 1994; Tsujimoto 1987) in these coastal areas and are often associated with salt weathering (Bradley, Hutton, and Twidale 1978; Mustoe 1982; Mottershead 1994; Mottershead and Pye 1994; Strini et al. 2008; Young 1987).|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{resistivity}} of tuff specimens {{are measured}} by a four-pole method and a bridge method. Simultaneous recordings {{of the change in}} the resistivity and the deformation of rock specimen make it clear that the rate of change in the resistivity of a <b>pumice</b> <b>tuff</b> specimen from Oya, Tochigi Prefecture, is of the same order as the strain and that the rate of a lapilli tuff specimen from Aburatsubo, Kanagawa Prefecture, is extremely larger, 102 ～ 103 times say, than the strain. The latter result supports Yokoyama's preliminary observation in situ. Yokoyama, who measured changes in the resistivity of the ground by tidal loading, reported an unusually large rate of change in the resistivity which approximately agrees with the rate as measured by the present laboratory experi- ment. Crude theories of electric conduction in such a material as tuff specimen are advanced. It is also pointed out that the electrical means as advanced here could possibly be applied to measuring extremely small changes in the earth's strain. 地殻に作用する歪力によつて,地殼を構成する物質の電気伝導度が変化するであろうという議論に対して一つの観測がある. それは横山泉により 1951 年から 52 年にわたり,神奈川県三浦市油壷附近でなされたものである. この観測によると,観測点近くの潮汐の変化により地殻の伸縮がおこり,この伸縮が 10 - 6 程度変るとき,地殼の電気伝導度,すなわち比抵抗が 10 - 3 の割合で変化することが観測された. つまり地殻の伸縮に対しての比抵抗変化率は 102 ～ 103 倍に達することとなる...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports and}} {{discusses}} {{the results of}} a field survey conducted by a joint scientific group from Japan and Indonesia to assess the geotechnical aspects of the Sumatra earthquake (Mw= 7. 6) of September 30, 2009. The studied area included the Padang and Pariaman cities, where a number of buildings collapsed as a result of strong shaking, and a mountainous part of the Pariaman district, a place where massive landslides buried several villages, claiming more than 400 human lives. The main objective of the survey was to investigate the causes and mechanisms of catastrophic landslides; however, other geotechnical problems such as lateral spread and liquefaction were also addressed. Field observations indicated that the catastrophic landslides occurred on relatively gentle slopes, then mobilized into debris flows, and traveled several hundred meters from their points of origin. The failure surfaces developed along the boundary of highly weathered <b>pumice</b> <b>tuff</b> with more intact and less weathered bedrock. Data from a portable cone penetration test showed that the sliding material was rather weak, having SPT N-values in the range of 5 - 10.

40|$|The area {{lies between}} the Kerio and Suguta Rivers in {{southern}} Turkana. Metamorphic basement rocks are exposed along {{the axis of}} an anticlinal arch which is overlain by a succession of volcanics and associated sediments, up to 2, 000 ft. (610 m.) in thickness west of it, and up to 11, 000 ft. (3, 400 m.) east of it. A basal grit formation passes up into basalts dating from 16. 6 m. y., which are then overlain uncomfortably by a thick succession of phonolites. The latter constitute the Tiati Hills east of the basement inlier. The phonolites are succeeded by basalts which are in turn overlain {{by a group of}} large trachyte central volcanoes, consisting of trachyte lavas and subordinate pyroclastics, including welded tuffs, erupted from multicentre source zones. Minor basalt eruptions are the last manifestation of volcanic activity older than the shield volcanoes of the axial zone. The latter are only represented in the present area by the distal portions of airfall tuff showers erupted from them. Structurally, the older eruptions are related to a monocline active at first {{to the west of the}} present watershed, but migrating steadily eastwards with time. In this manner, east of the basement arch, the volcanics become younger towards the centre of the developing rift valley. The younger volcanics are cut by normal faults trending generally north-northeastwards. A wide range of rock types is present, including basanitoids, basalts, mugearites, phonolites and trachytes among the lavas, and <b>pumice</b> <b>tuffs</b> and welded tuffs among the pyroclastics.

Regional {{extension}} was a fundamental control on caldera collapse, providing pathways for the siting, drainage and recharge of magma chambers. Caldera I collapse was associated with magmatic overpressure from volatile exsolution, magma-water interaction, influx of denser magma and magma drainage at depth. Trachybasalt ash, trachyte globular-ash ignimbrites, trachyte <b>pumice</b> lapilli air-fall <b>tuffs</b> and carbonate-trachyte ignimbrites characterize the initial subsidence.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Presentation date: 1984 - 06 - 07 The Bend <b>pumice</b> and Tumalo <b>tuff</b> are {{products}} of a plinian eruption which occurred sometime between 0. 89 and 2. 6 m. y. The Bend pumice is a poorly consolidated, air-fall vitric lapilli tuff, which overlies a zone of reworked tephra. Perlitic obsidian in the reworked zone probably represents {{the remains of a}} dome which filled the eruptive vent and is chemically related to the Bend pumice magma. Detailed grain size analysis of the air-fall part of the Bend pumice shows that the eruptive vent was located approximately 10 - 20 km west of Bend, Oregon. Grain size variations in vertical section are probably related to fluctuations in the diameter of the vent rather than interruptions in deposition of the Bend <b>pumice.</b> The Tumalo <b>tuff</b> is nonwelded to moderately welded ash-flow tuff which directly overlies the Bend pumice. Lack of discernable normal grading in the upper 50 cm of the Bend pumice indicates that the Tumalo tuff was emplaced before the Bend pumice was completely deposited and leads {{to the conclusion that the}} Tumalo tuff is the product of collapse of the Bend pumice eruption column. The Tumalo tuff was formed by one episode of flow and has a well developed basal 2 a layer. Variations in the distal character of layer 2 a are thought to represent complex flow conditions in the head of the Tumalo tuff ash flow. Mixed pumices also are found in proximal Tumalo tuff deposits. The Bend <b>pumice</b> and Tumalo <b>tuff</b> are peraluminous and rhyodacitic. Within analytical uncertainties, they have identical major, minor, and trace element abundances. Both contain fresh hornblende in the mineral assemblage Plg + Opx + Mgt + Zr + Ap. The hornblende appears to have been a liquidus phase and indicates that the rhyodacite evolved under high pressure, hydrous conditions. A hight La to Ce ratio and a strong negative Eu anomaly in the B-T rhyodacite further indicates that the Bend <b>pumice</b> and Tumalo <b>tuff</b> evolved under physical conditions quite distinct from other rhyodacites in the central Oregon High Cascades analysed by Hughes (1982). Mixed pumices in the Tumalo tuff represent the incomplete mixing between Bend-Tumalo rhyodacite and a dacitic magma. Trace element modeling fails to provide an unequivocally common path of crystal fractionation between these two magmas. The magmas can not be directly related through thermogravitational diffusion or assimilation. While mixed pumice formation is usually attributed to mixing of genetically related magmas, Tumalo tuff mixed pumices were produced through the mixing of genetically unrelated magmas...|$|R

Bottom samples were collected at 46 stations between New Zealand and Rarotonga (in the Cook Islands), using pipe dredges, gravity corers and free fall grabs. Manganese nodules were recovered at 9 stations southwest of Rarotonga, at distances of 130 to 1000 km from the island, and in depths of 4700 to 5700 meters. Dense concentrations, up to 100 % (as seen in bottom photographs), occur in a more restricted area, 220 to 745 km southwest of Rarotonga. A free fall grab yielded 20 kg/m^ of nodules at one station in this area. Most of the nodules are spheroidal, and {{range in size from}} 1 - 9 cm. Nodules were recovered at 15 stations in two areas south of Rarotonga, 45 to 1270 km and 1580 to 2090 km south of the island, and in depths of 3970 to 5590 meters. Compared to the nodules collected southwest of Rarotonga, nodules from the areas south of Rarotonga show a wider range of sizes (0. 5 - 11 cm) and shapes (discoidal, botryoidal, spheroidal with equatorial "skirts", and more irregular forms in addition to many spheroidal nodules). Considering the entire study area, where different nodule morphologies occur at a single station, the smaller nodules tend to be more spheroidal. Surface textures of the nodules are generally uniformly granular. Nodules from all areas in the basin occur on light brown to dark brown silty clay; the coarse fraction of the sediment invariably includes volcanic fragments (<b>pumice,</b> <b>tuff,</b> and basalt), and often sharks' teeth. Areas devoid of nodules have little coarse fraction in the sediment. Sedimentation rates and availability of nuclei are presumed to govern nodule distribution...|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of <b>pumice</b> flows, bedded <b>tuffs,</b> intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|R
40|$|Only one {{eruption}} {{of the island}} Una-Una (Gulf of Tomini, Northern Celebes), in 1898, has been recorded in historical time; it was described in 1902 by Wichmann (l. c.) after data gathered from different witnesses. No lava flowed out, it was an ash-eruption. During that eruption large mud streams, called lahars, descended along {{the slope of the}} volcano and some broad flat-bottomed valleys were eroded (Pl. 44, fig. 4) which are known so very well from some Javanese volcanoes, especially from Mount Kelut. With the latter Una-Una shows many points of resemblance, in shape, structure and in type of the latest eruption. Along one of the large typical lahar valleys we climbed the volcanoe starting near Kololio. Fig. 6 and 7 show the higher parts of our road, typical v-shaped valleys, a product of ordinary water erosion. When seeing such lahar valleys one may presume that the volcano must contain or at least must have contained either a huge crater lake or a filling of loose, sandy, brecciated material strongly impregnated with water. Up to this moment all lava’s, <b>pumice,</b> <b>tuffs</b> and ashes, collected in the island Una-Una are andesitic. The andesite and the andesitic tuffs often show inclusions of carbonated peridotite. It is not impossible that also sediments occur on the island — though on our single trip we did not find them — thus in general structure Una-Una shows some resemblance to the other Togian islands, where, however, the volcanism is now extinct. The crater of the volcano has a diameter of about two kilometers. The textfigure 2 shows a schematic section, a being the western craterrim; b the bottom, consisting of mud, ashes and brecciated volcanic materia] (h) deposited in the crater after the {{eruption of}} 1898, thus giving origin to the flat bottom of the caldera-shaped crater. In {{the central part of the}} crater is an elevation, c of the same material but strongly metamorphosed by the activity of many solfatara’s which break through it. The author thinks that the elevation and the solfatara’s both owe their origin to a lava plug (g) which after the eruption of 1898 and after the filling up of the crater has penetrated through the crater-pipe and tilted the central part of the crater-bottom, itself not reaching the surface, however, as shown in figure 2 (see also Pl. 44, fig. 5 and Pl. 46, fig. 8). Pl. 46, fig. 9 shows the same phenomenon, a detritus plug in the crater lake of the Kelut volcano, Java. Fig. 2, d is a small crater lake; e is a detritus cone; h is a schematic section through the strato-volcano. In 1901 Professor Molengraaff visited Una-Una and made a fine photograph of the crater, which he kindly gave me for publication (Pl. 46, fig. 8). The activity of solfatara’s was somewhat stronger at the time of his visit; within short intervals a little cloud of smoke escaped from Una-Una, as shown in his sketch (fig. 3). Corals are growing on the submarine slopes in separate colonies. However, no true massive coral reef has been developed, owing to the young erosion stage of this volcanic island; still too large quantities of boulders and smaller detritus material are deposited along the submarine slopes and prevent a more luxurious reef growth...|$|R
