5|$|The early republican {{constitution}} {{was dominated by}} the patricians, who monopolised all control of the magistracies, the Senate, and the voting blocs of the assemblies. Generally, it slowly developed with a tendency towards greater popular representation {{at the expense of}} the <b>patrician</b> <b>class.</b> The main historical sources for the origins of the Roman political system, Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, relied heavily on the Roman annalists, who supplemented what little written history existed with oral history. This lack of evidence poses problems for the reliability of the traditional account of the republic's origins.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{founding}} of the republic, most of the powers of the Curiate Assembly were transferred to the Centuriate Assembly and the Tribal Assembly. While it then fell into disuse, it did retain some theoretical powers, most importantly, the power to ratify elections of the top-ranking Roman Magistrates (Consuls and Praetors) by passing the statute that gave them their legal command authority, the lex curiata de imperio. In practice, however, they actually received this authority from the Centuriate Assembly (which formally elected them), and as such, this functioned as nothing more than a reminder of Rome's regal heritage. Other acts that the Curiate Assembly voted on were mostly symbolic and usually in the affirmative. At one point, possibly as early as 218 BC, the Curiate Assembly's thirty Curia were abolished, and replaced with thirty lictors, one from each of the original Patrician clans. Since the Curia had always been organized {{on the basis of the}} Roman family, the Curiate Assembly actually retained jurisdiction over clan matters even after the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC. Under the presidency of the Pontifex Maximus, it witnessed wills and ratified adoptions, inaugurated certain priests, and transferred citizens from <b>Patrician</b> <b>class</b> to Plebeian class (or vice versa). In 44 BC, for example, it ratified the will of Julius Caesar, and with it Caesar's adoption of his nephew Gaius Octavian (the future Roman emperor Augustus) as his son and heir. However, this might not have been the comitia curiata but instead the comitia calata.|$|E
25|$|In the Roman Republic, a proconsul was {{typically}} a former consul and thus an experienced commander-in-chief.

5000|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Empire it {{remained}} a high honorary title in the Byzantine Empire.

25|$|Often, when {{depicting}} {{the same subject}} as her sisters, Anne presents it in completely different light. Wildfell Hall, an old superannuated mansion, she pictures not as a ‘haunted’ house like Thornfield Hall or Wuthering Heights in her sisters' works, but as a decayed relic of an outworn <b>patrician</b> <b>class,</b> whose pretensions are mocked by the recrudescence of building into moor. Stevie Davies has argued that Anne’s ancient hall demystifies Gothic. Wildfell Hall is not haunted, it is simply dilapidated, damp and un-welcoming.|$|E
25|$|According to Livy, writing {{five hundred}} years after the fact, Menenius was chosen by the patricians during the secession of the plebs in 494 BC to persuade the plebs to end their secession. Livy says that Menenius told the {{soldiers}} a fable about {{the parts of the}} human body and how each has its own purpose in the greater function of the body. The rest of the body thought the stomach was getting a free ride so the body decided to stop nourishing the stomach. Soon, the other parts became fatigued and unable to function so they realized that the stomach did serve a purpose and they were nothing without it. In the story, the stomach represents the <b>patrician</b> <b>class</b> and the other body parts represent the plebs. Eventually, Livy says, an accord was reached between the patricians and the plebs, which included creating the office of tribune of the plebs.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the subject of}} social class in the British army during the Great War 1914 - 1918. The pre-war army closely mirrored the social stratification found in civilian British society. Army officers were exclusively drawn from the <b>patrician</b> <b>classes,</b> while soldiers were invariably from the poorer or working classes. Soon {{after the start of}} the Great War, it became apparent that {{there would have to be}} some relaxation of the strict social barriers governing the British army; huge battlefield losses necessitated both conscription and the commissioning of non-upper-class officers. Friendships cutting across class barriers were formed in the heat of battle. Nevertheless, the post-Armistice army immediately reverted to its pre-war standards. This thesis is concerned with the brief easement of strict social class standards in the British Army during World War I...|$|R
50|$|The first secessio plebis of 494 B.C. was {{an event}} in ancient Roman {{political}} and social history between 495 and 493 BC, involving a dispute between the <b>patrician</b> ruling <b>class</b> and the plebeian underclass, {{and was one of}} a number of secessions by the plebs and part of a broader political conflict known as the conflict of the orders.|$|R
500|$|Since the plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles {{were elected}} by the plebeians (commoners) in the Plebeian Council, rather than {{by all of the}} People of Rome (plebeians and the aristocratic <b>patrician</b> <b>class),</b> they were {{technically}} not magistrates. While the term [...] "plebeian magistrate" [...] (magistratus plebeii) has been used as an approximation, it is technically a contradiction. The plebeian aedile functioned as the tribune's assistant, and often performed similar duties as did the curule aediles (discussed above). In time, however, the differences between the plebeian aediles and the curule aediles disappeared.|$|E
500|$|What {{little is}} known of Selvo's past is based mostly on {{accounts}} of his reputation when he entered his Dogeship. [...] Details of his family origins and even the year of his birth are unknown, {{but it can be}} assumed that he was a Venetian noble because, with the rare exception of Domenico Flabanico, only members of this class were elected to the position of Doge {{at this point in the}} Republic's history. Selvo supposedly belonged to a family in the <b>patrician</b> <b>class</b> from the sestiere of Dorsoduro who were allegedly of ancient Roman origin, possibly from one of the tribunes. He had also apparently been an ambassador to Holy Roman Emperor Henry III and he was certainly ducal counselor to Domenico Contarini prior to his election as Doge. Being connected to the relatively popular Doge might have been one of the causes for his own apparent initial popularity.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages and early modern period patricians also {{acquired}} noble titles, sometimes simply by acquiring domains {{in the surrounding}} contado that carried a heritable fief. However, in practice the status and wealth of the patrician families of the great republics was {{higher than that of}} most nobles, as money economy spread and the profitability and prerogatives of land-holding eroded, and they were accepted as of similar status. The Republic of Genoa had a separate class, much smaller, of nobility, originating with rural magnates who joined their interests with the fledgling city-state. Some cities, such as Naples and Rome, which had never been republics in post-Classical times, also had <b>patrician</b> <b>classes,</b> though most holders also had noble titles. The Republic of Ragusa was ruled by a strict patriciate that was formally established in 1332, which was subsequently modified only once, following the 1667 Dubrovnik earthquake.|$|R

2500|$|After Napoleons defeats {{during the}} War of the Sixth Coalition the Valais was {{occupied}} by Austria {{at the end of}} December 1813.

[...] When the two councils combined, the number of Council members was set to 20. [...] Between 1815 and 1839, the <b>patrician</b> <b>class</b> gradually took {{more and more of the}} rights and duties of the citizenry back on themselves, gaining more and more power. [...] In response to this, Alexandre de Torrente founded a liberal party in 1830. [...] In the cantonal government, Sion agreed most often with the German-speaking Upper Valais. [...] Which gave the Upper Valais a majority of the Zenden in the council, to the detriment of the French-speaking Lower Valais. [...] However, after the vote on the constitution of 1839, the Upper Valais broke away from the rest of the canton. [...] Sion was chosen as the capital of the Valais, while the breakaway Upper Valais chose Sierre. [...] In 1840, the Upper and Lower Valais were reunited.

2500|$|In the High Middle Ages, the {{residents}} of Sion were homines episcopi or people of the bishop.

[...] Those who were unwilling or unable to purchase citizenship, which cost about 60 shillings in 1326, but wished to live in Sion were classed as permanent residents and their descendants held the same status until they could buy their citizenship. [...] The permanent residents were mainly workers, craftsmen (often [...] originating from the Swiss Confederation and the Germanies) and traders (mostly from Savoy and northern Italy). [...] An outbreak of the plague in 1348 wiped out many citizens. [...] In addition to the citizen's deaths, the restrictive attitude of the citizenry toward new members led to citizens becoming a minority in Sion. [...] In the first population census in 1610 the town had 1,835 inhabitants, of whom 412 were citizens and 1,423 were permanent residents. [...] In the 18th Century, a third category, the tollerati, was added. [...] On the eve of the revolution the city's population was 19% citizen, 30% permanent resident and 51% tollerati and other marginalized groups.

2500|$|Robert Gerwarth {{shows that}} the Bismarck myth, built up {{predominantly}} during his years of retirement and even more stridently after his death, proved a powerful rhetorical and ideological tool. [...] The myth made him {{out to be a}} dogmatic ideologue and ardent nationalist when, in fact, he was ideologically flexible. Gerwarth argues that the constructed memory of Bismarck played a central role as an antidemocratic myth in the highly ideological battle over the past, which raged between 1918 and 1933. This myth proved to be a weapon against the Weimar Republic and exercised a destructive influence on the political culture of the first German democracy. Frankel in Bismarck's Shadow (2005) shows the Bismarck cult fostered and legitimized a new style of right-wing politics. It made possible the post-Bismarckian crisis of leadership, both real and perceived, that had Germans seeking the strongest possible leader and asking, [...] "What Would Bismarck Do?" [...] For example, Hamburg's memorial, unveiled in 1906, {{is considered one of the}} greatest expressions of Imperial Germany's Bismarck cult and an important development in the history of German memorial art. It was a product of the desire of Hamburg's <b>patrician</b> <b>classes</b> to defend their political privileges in the face of dramatic social change and attendant demands for political reform. To those who presided over its construction, the monument was also a means of asserting Hamburg's cultural aspirations and of shrugging off a reputation as a city hostile to the arts. The memorial was greeted with widespread disapproval among the working classes and did not prevent their increasing support for the Social Democrats.|$|R

25|$|Jupiter's {{association}} with kingship and sovereignty was reinterpreted as Rome's {{form of government}} changed. Originally, Rome was ruled by kings; after the monarchy was abolished and the Republic established, religious prerogatives were transferred to the patres, the <b>patrician</b> ruling <b>class.</b> Nostalgia for the kingship (affectatio regni) was considered treasonous. Those suspected of harbouring monarchical ambitions were punished, regardless of their service to the state. In the 5th century BC, the triumphator Camillus was sent into exile after he drove a chariot {{with a team of}} four white horses (quadriga)—an honour reserved for Jupiter himself. When Marcus Manlius, whose defense of the Capitol against the invading Gauls had earned him the name Capitolinus, was accused of regal pretensions, he was executed as a traitor by being cast from the Tarpeian Rock. His house on the Capitoline Hill was razed, and it was decreed that no patrician should ever be allowed to live there. Capitoline Jupiter found himself in a delicate position: he represented a continuity of royal power from the Regal period, and conferred power on the magistrates who paid their respects to him; {{at the same time he}} embodied that which was now forbidden, abhorred, and scorned.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{earliest}} periods of Roman expansion in central Italy, the ager publicus {{was used for}} Roman and (after 338 BC) Latin colonies. Later tradition held that {{as far back as}} the 5th century BC, the <b>Patrician</b> and Plebeian <b>classes</b> disputed the rights of the rich to exploit the land, and in 367 BC two Plebeian Tribunes, Gaius Licinius Stolo and Lucius Sextius Sextinus Lateranus promulgated a law which limited the amount of the ager publicus to be held by any individual to 500 iugera, roughly 325 acre. In the half century following the Battle of Telamon (c. 225 BC), the Romans fully absorbed Cisalpine Gaul, adding huge swathes of land to the ager publicus, land which was more often than not given to new Latin colonies or to small freeholders. In the south of Italy, huge tracts of newly re-incorporated lands remained ager publicus, but tended to be leased out to wealthy citizens in return for rents (although these rents were usually not collected), often ignoring the Laws of 367. Other ager publicus remained with the Italian allies from whom it had been confiscated. Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus attempted to address some of these violations in 133 BC, by reimposing the limit of 500 iugera and distributing excess land to poor citizens. A similar move by his brother Gaius Sempronius Gracchus in 123 BC failed because of his death the following year. In 111 BC, a new law was passed which allowed individual smallholders to assume ownership of their part of the ager publicus.|$|R
