5|$|Each volcano type {{produced}} by the Anahim hotspot has its own unique life cycle of growth and erosion. Volcanic cones have their origins from tephra accumulating around vents during Strombolian eruptions. They are composed of trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt, <b>phonolite,</b> basanite {{and to a lesser}} extent phonotephrite. In contrast, lava domes are formed mainly by viscous trachytic magma that erupted effusively onto the surface and then piled up thick around vents. Most of these features were formed by a single volcanic eruption and are therefore monogenetic. However, in some cases several eruptions occurred at a single locus to create larger, polygenetic centres (e.g. Satah Mountain, Baldface Mountain, Nazko Cone). Once activity has declined, erosion reduces them into volcanic remnants such as lava plugs.|$|E
5|$|The felsic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of <b>phonolite,</b> trachyte, phonolitic trachyte, quartz-trachyte and rhyolite lava. Subsequent volcanism of the pre-explosive phase produced a basal sequence of aphyric trachyte lava flows and domes with minor altered flow-banded rhyolite, sulfide-bearing rhyolitic tuffs and a few thin hawaiite lava flows. This activity was concentrated at {{the summit of the}} volcano as shown by the increasing thickness of volcanic material towards the summit. A hydrothermally altered aphyric trachyte dike, which forms a narrow ridge linking Mount Downton and Itcha Mountain, might have been the source for these eruptions.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to most mountain ranges in British Columbia, the Itcha Range represents an inactive shield volcano. This highly dissected volcanic edifice {{consists of a}} variety of rock types, including basanite, hawaiite, trachyte, rhyolite, <b>phonolite</b> and alkali olivine basalt. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity. Two stages of eruptive activity have been identified at the volcano along with three sub-phases that are limited only to the first stage of development. The main body of the Itcha Range is between 3.8and 3.0million years old and thus over two million years ago it passed the most active shield stage of life. A period of dormancy lasting for almost a million years followed, which was interrupted by the post-shield stage of volcanism 2.2to 0.8million years ago. More recent volcanic activity in and around the Itcha Range might have occurred in the last 340,000years to produce cinder cones.|$|E

5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, <b>phonolites,</b> trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. <b>Phonolites</b> are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although <b>phonolites</b> with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby lava flows and domes.|$|R
5|$|Magma {{production}} of the Anahim hotspot has shifted from more felsic to more mafic compositions in the last 3.0million years. For instance, much of the magma created between 3.0and 0.33million years ago was igneous <b>phonolite,</b> trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt and basanite; the volcanoes built during this period are almost entirely made of these rock types. Other igneous rocks such as phonotephrite are present in smaller quantities; these occur in the Satah Mountain volcanic field. Volcanic eruptions in the last 0.33million years have been mainly basanitic and have occurred at the youngest eruptive centre, Nazko Cone. Basanites produced by these eruptions are significantly more undersaturated than basalts from older Anahim volcanoes {{in the west and}} may indicate an eastward shift toward a deeper or less depleted mantle source. It is also possible that as the North American Plate moves over the Anahim hotspot, it underlies thinner continental crust. The overall chemistry and mineralogy of the Anahim magmas are analogous to regions of incipient continental rifting above a mantle plume.|$|E

25|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province throughout its 20million year history has been mainly the production of alkaline lavas, including alkaline basalts. A range of alkaline rock types not commonly found in the Western Cordillera are regionally widespread in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. These include nephelinite, basanite and peralkaline <b>phonolite,</b> trachyte and comendite lavas. The trachyte and comendite lavas are understood to have been created by fractionation of mainly alkali basalt magma in crustal reservoirs. An area of continental rifting, such as the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, would aid the formation of high-level reservoirs of capable size and thermal activity to maintain long-lived fractionation.|$|E
25|$|Pumice is {{composed}} of highly microvesicular glass pyroclastic with very thin, translucent bubble walls of extrusive igneous rock. It is commonly, but not exclusively of silicic or felsic to intermediate in composition (e.g., rhyolitic, dacitic, andesite, pantellerite, <b>phonolite,</b> trachyte), but basaltic and other compositions are known. Pumice is commonly pale in color, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, to green-brown or black. It forms when volcanic gases exsolving from viscous magma form bubbles that remain within the viscous magma as it cools to glass. Pumice is a common product of explosive eruptions (plinian and ignimbrite-forming) and commonly forms zones in upper parts of silicic lavas. Pumice has an average porosity of 90%, and initially floats on water.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} more heavily {{alkaline}} rock types not {{commonly found in}} the Western Cordillera are regionally widespread in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. These include nephelinite, basanite and peralkaline <b>phonolite,</b> trachyte, and comendite lavas. The most magnesium oxide-rich nephelinites, basanites and alkaline basalts all through the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province display trace element abundances and isotopic compositions that are logical with an asthenospheric source like those for average oceanic island basalt and for alkaline basalts younger than five million years in the rift-related Basin and Range Province of southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. One hypothesized explanation for oceanic island basalt in the Earth's upper mantle under the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is {{the existence of a}} slab window. However, not much of a noticeable evidence linking the production of magma in the upper mantle to a possible tectonic system has been stated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Thirty-one plugs of {{alkaline}} volcanic {{rocks of}} Cenozoic age (37 Ma in mean) {{occur in the}} Upper Benue valley, northern Cameroon (Central Africa). The complete alkaline series (alkaline basalts, hawaiites, mugearites, <b>phonolites,</b> trachytes and rhyolites) is repre-sented.

40|$|The {{north-western}} {{sector of}} the Gharyan volcanic field (northern Libya) consists of trachytic-phonolitic domes emplaced between similar to 41 and 38 Ma, and small-volume mafic alkaline volcanic centres (basanites, tephrites. alkali basalts. hawaiites and rare benmoreites) of Middle Miocene-Pliocene age (similar to 12 - 2 Ma). Two types of trachytes and <b>phonolites</b> have been recognized {{on the basis of}} petrography, mineralogy and geochemistry. Type- 1 trachytes and <b>phonolites</b> display a smooth spoon-shaped REE pattern without negative Europium anomalies. Type- 2 trachytes and <b>phonolites</b> show a remarkable Eu negative anomaly, higher concentration in HFSE (Nb-Ta-Zr-Hf), REE and Ti than Type- 1 rocks. The origin of Type- 1 trachytes and <b>phonolites</b> is compatible with removal of clinopyroxene, plagioclase, alkali feldspar, amphibole. magnetite and titanite starting from benmoreitic magmas. found in the same outcrops. Type- 2 trachytes and <b>phonolites</b> could be the result of extensive fractional crystallization starting from mafic alkaline magma, without removal of titanite. In primitive mantle-normalized diagrams, the mafic rocks (Mg#= 62 - 68, Cr up to 514 ppm, Ni up to 425 ppm) show peaks at Nb and Ta and troughs at K. These characteristics, coupled with low Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 (i) (0. 7033 - 0. 7038) and positive epsilon(Nd) (from + 4. 2 to + 5. 3) features typical of the mafic anorogenic magmas of the northern African plate and of HIMU-OIB-like magma in general. The origin of the mafic rocks is compatible from a derivation from low degree partial melting (3 - 9 %) shallow mantle sources in the spinel/gamet facies. placed just below the rigid plate in the uppermost low-velocity zone. The origin of the igneous activity is considered linked to passive lithospheric thinning related to the development of continental rifts like those of Sicily Channel (e. g [...] Pantelleria and Linosa) and Sardinia (e. g., Campidano Graben) in the Central-Western Mediterranean Sea.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the first {{systematic}} mapping of Ua Pou, long known for its exceptionally abundant <b>phonolites,</b> we estimate that these rocks cover 65 % of the surface of the island whereas mafic lavas cover 27 % and intermediate ones 8 %. The silica-undersaturated suite was erupted in a restricted time span (29 ‚Äì 235 Myr), following the emplacement of tholeiites derived from a young HIMU-type source at c. 4 Ma. Primitive basanites, derived from a heterogeneous mantle source with a dominant EM II HIMU signature, represent likely parental magmas. The series is characterized by a Daly gap defined by a lack of phonotephrites. We consider that the most likely model for the origin of evolved lavas is partial melting at depth of primi-tive basanites, leaving an amphibole-rich residuum and producing tephriphonolitic magmas. These tephriphonolitic magmas may have evolved by closed-system fractional crystallization towards Group A <b>phonolites.</b> Three other groups of <b>phonolites</b> could have been derived from tephriphonolitic magmas by open-system fractional crystalliza-tion processes, characterized respectively by seawater contamina-tion (Group B), assimilation of nepheline syenite-type materials (Group C) and extreme fractionation coupled with assimilation of the underlying oceanic crust (Group D).

40|$|The {{island of}} Rarotonga in the {{southern}} Pacific is the emergent summit of a Pliocene - Pleistocene volcanic complex built by effusive and pyroclastic eruptions of mainly mafic magma. Petrographically the basaltic rock types are ankaramite and basalt, which range in chemical composition from alkali basalt to nephelinite. Phenocryst assemblages suggest two igneous series, one with a relatively simple equilibrium assemblage of olivine, titanian augite and magnetite, and one with olivine, diopside-augite and titanian augite in which the phenocrysts show disequilibrium textures.
