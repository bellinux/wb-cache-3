For example, while doing the repetitive movement, they should lift their limbs at the point of action at an elevated position to minimize their back injuries (as shown in the picture). Same method can be adopted for lifting and materials handling tasks (i.e., loading, carrying, unloading, etc.). Thus, activities that caused a twist of the upper trunk with a bent back could be corrected.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1960s, in {{anticipation}} of the flooding of their lands after the construction of the Aswan High Dam, 35,000 to 50,000 Nile Nubians resettled at Khashm al Qirbah on the Atbarah River in what was then Kassala Province. It is not clear how many Nubians remained in the Nile Valley. Even before the resettlement, many had left the valley for varying lengths of time to work in the towns, although most sought to maintain a link with their traditional homeland. In the 1955-56 census, more Nile Nubians were counted in Khartoum Province than in the Nubian country to the north. A similar <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in the towns was apparently followed by those resettled at Khashm al Qirbah. Many Nubians there retained their tenancies, having kin oversee the land and hiring non-Nubians to work it. The Nubians, often with their families, worked in Khartoum, the town of Kassala, and Port Sudan. Renowned for their prestigious history and their unique and ancient culture, Nubians have the highest degree of literacy and assumed control of vital governmental offices throughout the history of the Sudan. Despite their knowledge of Arabic and their devotion to Islam, Nubians retained a considerable self-consciousness and tended to maintain tightly knit communities of their own in the towns.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and retirement in Vietnam {{based on two}} recent surveys of the elderly. Vietnam provides a unique context for addressing elderly labor force participation due to its transition from a socialist to a market economy. As expected, elderly persons {{are less likely to}} be working to the extent that they are older or sick, although there is little variation by socioeconomic status. There are, however, distinct <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> stoppage across employment sectors (agricultural, state, and nonstate), due in part to the nature <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in these sectors. The data permit measure-ments across time, including job switches from one sector to another, or to retirement. Most notably, the data demonstrate the strong outflow of elderly employees from the state sector. We discuss explanations for these findings, paying particular attention to Vietnam’s recent history and social policies designed to facilitate the transition toward a market-based economy. Vietnam’s turbulent history provides an excellent backdrop for exam-ining individual decision-making amidst rapid social change. Among the most dramatic of recent changes has been the transition from a planned to a market-based economy. Vietnam had instituted a socialist planning system in the northern region in the 1950 s and then in th...|$|R
