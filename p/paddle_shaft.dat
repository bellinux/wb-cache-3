5000|$|It seems {{probable}} that the Scottish Engineer James Nasmyth (1808-1890) and his French counterpart François Bourdon (1797-1865) reinvented the steam hammer independently in 1839, {{both trying to}} solve the same problem of forging shafts and cranks for the increasingly large steam engines used in locomotives and paddle boats.In Nasmyth's 1883 [...] "autobiography", written by Samuel Smiles, he described how the need arose for a <b>paddle</b> <b>shaft</b> for Isambard Kingdom Brunel's new translatlantic steamer SS Great Britain, with a 30 in diameter shaft, larger than any that had been previously forged. He came up with his steam hammer design, making a sketch dated 24 November 1839, but the immediate need disappeared when the practicality of screw propellers was demonstrated and the Great Britain was converted to that design.Nasmyth showed his design to all visitors.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{compared}} EMG, stroke force and 2 D kinematics during on-ergometer and on-water kayaking. Male elite flatwater kayakers (n = 10) performed matched exercise protocols consisting of 3 min bouts at heart and stroke rates equivalent to 85 % of VO 2 peak (assessed by prior graded incremental test). EMG data were recorded from Anterior Deltoid (AD), Triceps Brachii (TB), Latissimus Dorsi (LD) and Vastus Lateralis (VL) via wireless telemetry. Video data recorded at 50 Hz with audio triggers pre- and post-exercise facilitated synchronisation of EMG and kinematic variables. Force data were recorded via strain gauge arrays on paddle and ergometer shafts. EMG data were root mean squared (20 ms window), temporally and amplitude normalised, and averaged over 10 consecutive cycles. In addition, overall muscle activity was quantified via iEMG and discrete stroke force and kinematic variables computed. Significantly greater TB and LD mean iEMG activity were recorded on-water (239 ± 15 vs. 179 ± 10 µV. s, p < 0. 01 and 158 ± 12 vs. 137 ± 14 µV. s, p < 0. 05, respectively), while significantly greater AD activity was recorded on-ergometer (494 ± 66 vs. 340 ± 35 µV. s, p < 0. 01). Time to vertical shaft position occurred significantly earlier on-ergometer (p < 0. 05). Analysis of stroke force data and EMG revealed that increased AD activity was concurrent with increased external forces {{applied to the}} <b>paddle</b> <b>shaft</b> at discrete phases of the on-ergometer stroke cycle.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the technical and}} tactical aspects of competitive canoe slalom {{with a view to}} provide information that could assist coaches and athletes in enhancing performance and designing training programs that are grounded in scientific research. To achieve these goals two methodology projects and five studies were undertaken. A customised competition analysis program (CAP) and standardised set of operational definitions were developed. Assessment of the intra-observer and inter-observer reliability (> 78 %) of data gathered using this system was within the limits considered acceptable in previous research. In addition to CAP, a paddle force analysis program was developed (absolute variance = 5. 1 N) which allowed analysis and comparison of paddle force data with CAP data. This thesis {{investigated the}} distribution and variability of paddlers in each category from historical information. Results demonstrated that athletes within the top ten in each category were grouped based on the category in which they paddled. Men‟s single canoe (C 1 M) paddlers were found to regularly complete courses within 105 % of the for men‟s single kayak (K 1 M) time. Competition performances K 1 M, C 1 M and women‟s single kayak (K 1 W) were analysed using the CAP. For a complex gate sequence paddlers using a spin rather than pivot manoeuvre had significantly (p = 0. 89) between boat trajectory and the total time. The boat trajectory of the fastest paddlers were found to be significantly closer (p < 0. 05) from the slowest paddlers. The effectiveness of combining paddle force data with CAP data was demonstrated through a case study of a C 1 M paddler. This amalgamation also showed how the paddler lost time around an upstream gate due to an error, demonstrating the link between the force applied to the paddle, the strategy the paddler used and the path they chose. <b>Paddle</b> <b>shaft</b> length was manipulated in a case study involving 12 repeat sprints on flatwater, to improve factors related to canoe slalom performance. Results showed that the shorter shaft allowed the paddler to accelerate the boat more rapidly, a key factor in canoe slalom performance. Dissemination of information to coaches and athletes is the critical link in any analysis process, which is required for beneficial gains to be made from the information. Presentation of an example report demonstrates how this process was facilitated in this thesis. The findings of these studies were related back to a model of critical variables for canoe slalom showing that this thesis was able to provide scientific information into key intrinsic variables which the paddler can influence including: run time, path taken, mean velocity, strokes used, technique, experience, variability and errors. The interactions of these variables and research findings are discussed, then improvements and future research directions presented...|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{manufacturing}} {{offers a}} number of operational and financial benefits to pharmaceutical companies. This research examines the critical blending step for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing and the characteristics of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing systems. Discrete element method (DEM) simulations were used to develop novel insights into the mechanism of mixing for continuous blending of cohesive pharmaceutical powders and {{to examine the effects}} of particle properties, blender design and operating conditions on blend homogeneity. To place continuous blending into the context of pharmaceutical manufacturing, the scope of the analysis was expanded to process system models of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing. DEM simulations were used to study the mechanisms of mixing in the continuous blending of pharmaceutical powders. Diffusive mixing from the avalanching particles appears to be the dominant mechanism of mixing in both the axial and radial direction for the double helical ribbon blender. This result can guide the development of future continuous pharmaceutical powder blenders by optimizing the mixing elements to increase the amount of particles transported to a position where they can avalanche/flow and diffusively mix. A range of particle properties, blender designs and operating conditions were examined for their effects on flow behavior and blend homogeneity. Three particle properties were examined: particle size, polydispersity and cohesive force. (cont.) Particle size was observed to be positively correlated to both flow rates and blend homogeneity. Polydispersity had no effect on flow rate and was negatively correlated to homogeneity. Cohesive force was negatively correlated to flow rate and had little to no effect on homogeneity. Two modifications of blender design were analyzed: changes in blender size and changes in shaft design. Blender size was observed to be positively correlated to flow rate and negatively correlated to homogeneity. The <b>paddle</b> <b>shaft</b> designs created a more homogeneous powder blend than the double helical ribbon shaft. Two operating parameters were also studied: rotation rate and fill fraction. Rotation rate was positively correlated to both flow rate and homogeneity. Fill fraction had the interesting result of being positively correlated to the absolute flow rate, but negatively correlated to the fill mass normalized flow rate. In addition, fill fraction has a clear negative correlation to homogeneity above fill fractions of 0. 55, but is inconsistent for fill fractions lower than this. This research on particle properties, blender designs and operating conditions will help to guide the operation of continuous pharmaceutical blenders and the design of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing systems. Process simulations comparing model batch and continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing systems have quantified some of the potential size, cost and performance benefits of continuous processes. The models showed significant reductions in process equipment sizes for continuous manufacturing particularly in the blending step. (cont.) This reduction in equipment size translates to capital cost (CAPEX) savings for both the continuous process equipment and manufacturing facilities. The steady state operation of continuous processing also reduces the labor requirements and gives the continuous processes an operating cost (OPEX) advantage over batch processes. This research has contributed to the understanding of continuous pharmaceutical powder blending and quantified some of the benefits of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing. This work is being continued by the Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing whose work is providing the foundation for future industrial scale pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing systems. by Matthew J.

40|$|Summary. The article {{describes}} validation {{and development of}} technology of vitamin, mineral and complex premixes {{with the introduction of}} vegetable oil and a set of equipment for its implementation. The two-component mixture was used for research. Crushed wheat was used as the main component, and the metal admixture with magnetic properties, vitamin B 2 and salt of micronutrients MnSO 4 as key components. Quality of the final mixture was determined by the homogeneity test. Trace components dosing accuracy was determined by dosing vitamins B 5, E, A, and trace-element salts MnSO 4, FeSO 4, CuSO 4. Also introduction of vegetable oil in the filler was researched. When the oil was entering the mixer in an amount of 2 % homogeneity of the filler and oil mixture was 94 %. The oil fine spray was provided by special nozzles design. A pilot mixer consisting of a body having a lower portion of the shape of the double trough and lid is developed for conducting research in mixing vitamins, salts of trace elements with the filler.

40|$|The {{orientation}} of the paddle during the outrigger canoe stroke {{is an important factor}} in maximising propulsive forces. In order to investigate the influence of paddle orientation on boat velocity, a mathematical model of the outrigger canoe paddling stroke was established. The model accounted for the movement of the paddler within the boat, the motions of the paddle blade through the water, generating fluid forces, and the resistive forces acting on the boat and paddler. The model was validated against on water data for an elite female paddler, with a difference of only 1. 3 % between model output and measured on water data being found. Simulations were carried out to determine the influence of the paddle blade offset angle relative to the shaft. Maximum velocity was achieved in the condition where the paddle's angle of attack was closest to zero when peak paddle velocity occurred. This was found to be at an offset angle of - 20 degrees between the shaft and blade of the paddle. For the paddler investigated here, the model outputs suggested that using a normal paddle with no offset angle between the <b>paddle</b> blade and <b>shaft</b> may not be optimal...|$|R
