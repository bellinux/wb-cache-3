40|$|A {{microfabrication}} {{process is}} proposed {{to produce a}} nanopore membrane for continuous passive drug release to maintain constant drug concentrations in the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> <b>blood</b> throughout the delivery period. Based on silicon microfabrication technology, {{the dimensions of the}} nanochannel area, as well as microchannel area, can be precisely controlled, thus providing a steady, constant drug release rate within an extended time period. The multilayered nanochannel structures extend the limit of release rate range of a single-layer nanochannel system, and allow a wide range of pre-defined porosity to achieve any arbitrary drug release rate using any preferred nanochannel size. This membrane system could also be applied to molecular filtration or isolation. In this case, the nanochannel length can be reduced to the nanofabrication limit, i. e., 10 s of nm. The nanochannel delivery system membrane is composed of a sandwich of a thin top layer, the horizontal nanochannels, and a thicker bottom wafer. The thin top layer houses an array of microchannels that offers the inlet port for diffusing molecules. It also works as a lid for the nanochannels by providing the channels a top surface. The nanochannels are fabricated by a sacrificial layer technique that obtains smooth surfaces and precisely controlled dimensions. The structure of this nanopore membrane is optimized to yield high mechanical strength and high throughput...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial {{disorders}} {{constitute a}} clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases that arise {{as a result}} of dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. They can be caused by mutations in either the nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. In this study, three patients with clinical suspicion of mitochondrial disease were investigated by whole exome sequencing (WES), identifying the homozygous splice site mutation SURF 1 c. 106 + 1 G>C in patient 1. This mutation, which was demonstrated to cause skipping of exon 2 in SURF 1, was concluded to be the genetic cause of the Leigh syndrome like phenotype in the patient. Patients 2 and 3 were further investigated by massively parallel sequencing (MSP) of mtDNA from fibroblasts using a PCR free protocol for the preparation of mtDNA enriched samples. Sequencing resulted in uniform and ultra-deep coverage (> 40, 000) of the entire mtDNA genome, demonstrating that the PCR free approach is the method of choice when analyzing mitochondrial DNA by MSP. In parallel, analysis of mtDNA from muscle from patient 3 revealed the novel and nearly homoplastic deletion m. 6211 _ 8681 del, which was concluded to be the cause of disease in the patient. This deletion was also identified in mtDNA from the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> <b>blood</b> and skin tissues, but it was present in too low levels of heteroplasmy to be detected by MSP...|$|E

Various experimental work exist in the literature concentrated on the synthesis of new hemodialysis membranes. However, optimization of membrane structure requires extensive and time consuming experimentations. Therefore, mathematical models are neccessary that can be used to predict the performance of hemodialysis operation. In this study, a predictive theoretical model was developed to predict the solute concentrations in <b>patient.</b> <b>s</b> <b>blood</b> and optimize the efficiency of hemodialysis operation. The model takes into account simultaneous mass and momentum transfer along with the adsorption of rejected protein molecules on the surface of the membrane. Model predictions show that blood and dialysate flowrates are effective for all sizes of molecules. The change in structural properties of the membrane makes no effect on the total removal of urea beacause of its high clearance. On the other hand, a considerable increment in the clearance of larger molecular weight solutes occurs as the pore size and porosity of the membrane increases. The most important design parameter for dialysis unit which influence the solute clearances significantly is found to be the effective diameter among the fibers in the dialyzer. The model is extended to investigate the use of urease immobilized membranes on the efficiency of the hemodialysis operation. The results have shown that urease immobilization enhances the removal of urea from the blood and decreases the protein adsorption capacity of the polysulfone membrane. Model predictions are compared with different sets of clearance data available in the literature. The agreement is found to be satisfactory which suggests that the model can be used as a tool to design or test the performance of dialysis units...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{report an}} {{unexpectedly}} {{high number of}} cases of septicemia with Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, and try to identify predisposing factors. Methods: All blood cultures obtained during 1991 – 93 from patients treated at the hematologic ward were bacteriologically identified. The medical records of <b>patients</b> with <b>S.</b> mucilaginosus-positive <b>blood</b> cultures were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of S. mucilaginosus were tested. Results: <b>S.</b> mucilaginosus <b>blood</b> isolates from patients with hematologic malignancies were found to be as common as isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Eleven patients with myelogenous leukemia and isolation of S. mucilaginosus from the blood are reported on. One patient had concomitant meningitis. All patients were neutropenic and most had oral mucositis and had been given ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. S. mucilaginosus isolates from these patients were resistant to ciprofloxacin in contrast to isolates from patients who had received other prophylactic regimens and seven isolates found in healthy individuals not recently treated with antibiotics. The resistant S. mucilaginosus were found to be of diverse genetic origin as determined by RFLP. Conclusions: The appearance of resistant strains during ciprofloxacin prophylaxis may be a predisposing factor for S. mucilaginosus septicemia. There was no evidence of a nosocomial spread of S. mucilaginosus strains...|$|R

The null HLA-A 2 allele was identified in an Asian individual originally typed by serology as an apparently homozygous HLA-A 3, B 51. Subsequent genotyping by PCR-SSP identified the genotype as HLA-A* 0201, * 0301, B* 51, Cw* 1402. The serological type and lack of detectable HLA-A 2 was confirmed using monoclonal antibody typing reagents.

Genotyping using a PCR-SSP set designed to detect null alleles revealed the mutation had not been previously described. Full-length sequencing of the allele identified an allele which was subsequently named HLA-A* 0232 N. This allele is identical to HLA-A* 0201 except for a novel point mutation (T for C) at position 493 which creates a premature stop codon.

40|$|Blood {{contains}} complex cascade {{systems and}} substances {{that can be}} activated during the processing of blood components and storage. Allogeneic blood, i. e. blood from someone else, is normally separated into components before storage and transfusion, while autologous <b>blood</b> (the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> own <b>blood)</b> often is used as whole blood. Allogeneic transfusions {{are associated with a}} variety of risks and preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD) has therefore become an established alternative. For patients with cancer, the immunosuppressive effect of allogeneic blood may be detrimental, but PABD is difficult because of the urgency of surgery. Normally, PABD begins 4 - 6 weeks before the scheduled operation and blood is tapped weekly. The additional use of recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO) therapy increases the volume of tapped autologous blood before surgery. However, other studies indicate that rHuEPO therapy suppresses postoperative endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) production and stimulates inflammatory mediator release. The aim of the present thesis was to investigate the effects on perioperative erythropoiesis, and the inflammatory mediator release during the predeposit and storage of autologous blood. In the present study, blood from healthy blood donors was collected and stored as whole blood or as separate components. Complement activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were followed during the storage time. In addition, the effect of prestorage leucocyte filtration on inflammatory mediators was studied. Women undergoing radical hysterectomy were scheduled to predeposit three units of autologous blood during two weeks before surgery, with or without rHuEPO therapy. Erythropoiesis and the immune response were investigated during the pre- and postoperative follow-up. The results demonstrate that complement is activated during storage of whole blood and plasma, and the cytokine IL- 8 is released during storage of whole blood. Prestorage filtration of plasma activates the complement cascade but does not influence cytokine generation. Clearly, it was possible for women to predeposit three units of blood in only two weeks prior to surgery. A haemoglobin level below the 100 g/l donation limit can be prevented in one patient out of seven, by treating women with rHuEPO. The use of rHuEPO increases the postoperative endogenous EPO response but does not influence the cytokine release. The present thesis suggests that PABD can be offered to female patients undergoing cancer surgery, and that autologous blood can be transfused as whole blood...|$|R

The aim of this prospective study was to compare the utility and cost-benefits of blood cultures in patients, hospitalized for moderate CAP, who had or had not received antibiotic therapy prior to admission. During 1 year, 53 patients were included and separated into two groups: group 1 patients had not received antibiotic treatment prior to admission (n= 30), whereas group 2 patients had been treated with antibiotics (n= 23). Within the first 48 hours, a set of blood cultures was collected if the body temperature was higher than 38 · 5 °C {{or in the case}} of shaking chills. A total of 136 blood cultures was collected; 74 in group 1 and 62 in group 2. Bacteraemia was significantly more frequent in group 1 than in group 2, 530 patients vs. 023, respectively (P< 0 · 05). The cost of negative blood cultures was valued at 13, 939. 2 FF in group 1 and 13, 164. 8 FF in group 2, respectively 464. 6 ± 244. 3 FF and 569. 3 ± 233. 4 FF per <b>patient</b> (n. <b>s.).</b> Moreover, <b>blood</b> cultures were the method of diagnosis in only one of the five patients with bacteraemia and in no case did a positive blood-culture result influence the initial therapeutic regime.

40|$|International audienceHuman face {{perception}} {{requires a}} network of brain regions distributed throughout the occipital and temporal lobes with a right hemisphere advantage. Present theories consider this network as either a processing hierarchy beginning with the inferior occipital gyrus (occipital face area; IOG-faces/OFA) or a multiple-route network with nonhierarchical components. The former predicts that removing IOG-faces/OFA will detrimentally affect downstream stages, whereas the latter does not. We tested this prediction in a human <b>patient</b> (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P.) requiring removal of the right inferior occipital cortex, including IOG-faces/OFA. We acquired multiple fMRI measurements in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before and after a preplanned surgery and multiple measurements in typical controls, enabling both within-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before resection vs <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after resection) and between-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. vs controls). We found that the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream ipsilateral face-selective regions were stable 1 and 8 month(s) after surgery. Additionally, the reliability of distributed patterns of face selectivity in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before versus after resection was not different from across-session reliability in controls. Nevertheless, postoperatively, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1 of the resected hemisphere. Diffusion weighted imaging in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. and controls identifies white matter tracts connecting retinotopic areas to downstream face-selective regions, which {{may contribute to the}} stable and plastic features of the face network in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after surgery. Together, our results support a multiple-route network of face processing with nonhierarchical components and shed light on stable and plastic features of high-level visual cortex following focal brain damage. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Brain networks consist of interconnected functional regions commonly organized in processing hierarchies. Prevailing theories predict that damage to the input of the hierarchy will detrimentally affect later stages. We tested this prediction with multiple brain measurements in a rare human patient requiring surgical removal of the putative input to a network processing faces. Surprisingly, the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream face-selective regions are stable after surgery. Nevertheless, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1. White matter connections from outside the face network may support these stable and plastic features. As processing hierarchies are ubiquitous in biological and nonbiological systems, our results have pervasive implications for understanding the construction of resilient networks...|$|R

Methods: Two <b>patients,</b> called as <b>S</b> and L, were diagnosed with active AS based on BASDAI and BASFI assessments, radiographic data and other clinical indices. They took methazolamide tablets at a dose of 25 mg twice every day. Results : <b>Patient</b> <b>S's</b> BASDAI score fell from 5. 4 to 4. 4, while patient L's BASDAI fell from 2. 4 to 2. <b>Patient</b> <b>S's</b> BASFI score change from 2. 7 to 2. 9, while patient L's BASFI score fell from 1. 2 to 0. 2. The ESR values of <b>patient</b> <b>S</b> were considerably reduced, while the ESR value of patient L remained unchanged and in the normal range. The calcium concentration of <b>patient</b> <b>S</b> decreased from 3. 05 mmol/L to 2. 39 mmol/L.
