After receiving charitable remuneration from the Stationers' Company, Barley moved, {{first to the}} parish of St Katherine Cree, and later to a house on Bishopsgate. Records from St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate indicate his burial on 11 July 1614. His widow, Mary, and their son, William, were legatees of the will of Pavier. Mary Barley, who later remarried, transferred five of her husband's patents to <b>printer</b> John Beale. Some of Barley's remaining copyrights may have also been passed to the <b>printer</b> Thomas Snodham.|$|E

The book—Science and Health by Mary Baker Glover, with eight chapters and 456 pages—finally appeared on October 30, 1875, published {{in the name of}} the Christian Science Publishing Company.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Evans (23 February 1826 – 21 August 1905) was a {{prominent}} English wood engraver and colour <b>printer</b> during the Victorian era. Evans specialized in full-colour printing, which, {{in part because of}} his work, became popular in the mid-19th century. He employed and collaborated with illustrators such as Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway and Richard Doyle to produce what are now considered to be classic children's books. Although little is known about his life, he wrote a short autobiography before his death in 1905 in which he described his life as a <b>printer</b> in Victorian London.|$|E

50|$|Compared {{to earlier}} consumer-oriented color <b>printers,</b> inkjet <b>printers</b> {{have a number}} of advantages.

5000|$|Often {{considered}} the [...] "backbone" [...] of many industrial and back-office systems, {{there are several}} types of line matrix <b>printers</b> used today across diverse enterprise production environments including: manufacturing, supply chain, distribution & logistics, transportation, finance and banking. Dot matrix <b>printers,</b> also known also as impact <b>printers,</b> represent the oldest printing technology, are still widely used today, due to its lowest 'cost per page' ratio. Dot matrix <b>printers</b> are divided on two main groups: serial dot matrix <b>printers</b> and line matrix [...] <b>printers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Letter-quality impact <b>printers,</b> however, were slow, noisy, {{incapable}} of printing graphics or images (unless the programmable microspacing and over-use of the dot were employed), sometimes limited to monochrome, and {{limited to a}} fixed set (usually one) of typefaces without operator intervention, though certain font effects like underlining and boldface could be achieved by overstriking. Soon, dot-matrix <b>printers</b> (such as the Oki Microline 84) would offer [...] "Near Letter Quality" [...] (NLQ) modes which were much faster than daisy-wheel <b>printers,</b> could produce graphics well, but were still very noticeably lower than [...] "letter quality". Nowadays, <b>printers</b> using non-impact printing (for example laser <b>printers,</b> inkjet <b>printers,</b> and other similar means) have replaced traditional letter-quality <b>printers</b> in most applications. The quality of inkjet <b>printers</b> can approach the old letter-quality impact <b>printers</b> (but can be limited by factors such as paper type).|$|R
5|$|Special {{consideration}} {{was given}} during filming {{to allow for}} integration of the planned special effects. Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their refresh rate {{did not result in}} banding on film. Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from rephotographing an element in an optical <b>printer,</b> live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate. When the larger prints were reduced through an anamorphic lens on the <b>printer,</b> the result was a Panavision composite.|$|E

5|$|During the 1880s, Evans printed two {{to three}} Greenaway books a year, {{including}} a run of 150,000 copies of Kate Greenaway's Birthday Book (1880), as well as Mother Goose (1881), The Language of Flowers (1884), Marigold Garden (1885), The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1887), and King Pepito (1889). From the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s Evans printed, and Greenaway illustrated, nine almanacs—one each year. Greenaway benefitted from her association with Evans. As the leading publisher of children's books, Routledge provided Greenaway with a commercial base she may not have achieved without Evans' influence. Children's literature scholar Anne Lundin claims the distinctive quality of Evans' printing, as wells as his popularity as a children's book <b>printer,</b> linked Greenaway's name with his, thereby increasing her commercial appeal. Greenaway often visited the Evans family, played with their three daughters and continued to visit Evans after his move to Ventnor. During her career as an illustrator, Greenaway used Evans as sole engraver and <b>printer.</b>|$|E
