In a retrospective study, steady-state plasma concentrations of (+) and (-) -perhexiline were obtained from 111 CYP 2 D 6 phenotyped patients receiving rac-perhexiline maleate. RESULTS: In the prospective study, comprising one poor and nine extensive/intermediate metabolizers, the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of both enantiomers increased {{with the number of}} functional CYP 2 D 6 genes. In the nine extensive/intermediate metabolizers receiving the 100 mg/day dose, the median CL/F of (+) -perhexiline was lower than that of (-) -perhexiline (352. 5 versus 440. 6 l/day, P< 0. 01). Following the dosage increase, the median CL/F of both enantiomers decreased by 45. 4 and 41. 4 %, respectively. In the retrospective study, the median (+) -/(-) -perhexiline plasma concentration ratio was lower (P< 0. 0001) in phenotypic extensive/intermediate (1. 41) versus poor metabolizers (2. 29). Median CL/F of (+) and (-) -perhexiline was 10. 6 and 24. 2 l/day (P< 0. 05), respectively, in poor metabolizers, and 184. 1 and 272. 0 l/day (P< 0. 001), respectively, in extensive/intermediate metabolizers.

We explored the relationship between plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations and its uptake into the myocardium. METHODS: Blood, right atrium ± left ventricle biopsies were obtained from patients treated with <b>perhexiline</b> for a median of 8. 5 days before undergoing coronary surgery in the <b>perhexiline</b> arm of a randomized controlled trial. <b>Perhexiline</b> concentrations in plasma and heart tissue were determined by HPLC. RESULTS: Atrial biopsies were obtained from 94 patients and ventricular biopsies from 28 patients. The median plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentration was within the therapeutic range at 0. 24 mg[*]l⁻¹ (IQR 0. 12 - 0. 44), the median atrial concentration was 6. 02 [*]mg[*]kg⁻¹ (IQR 2. 70 - 9. 06) and median ventricular concentration was 10. 0 mg[*]kg⁻¹ (IQR 5. 76 - 13. 1). Atrial (r² = 0. 76) and ventricular (r² = 0. 73) <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations were closely and directly correlated with plasma concentrations (both P < 0. 001). The median atrial[*]:[*]plasma ratio was 21. 5 (IQR 18. 1 - 27. 1), ventricular[*]:[*]plasma ratio was 34. 9 (IQR 24. 5 - 55. 2) and ventricular[*]:[*]atrial ratio was 1. 67 (IQR 1. 39 - 2. 22). Using multiple regression, the best model for predicting steady-state atrial concentration included plasma <b>perhexiline,</b> heart rate and age (r² = 0. 83).

Methods - Eight blood samples were taken over a 24 -h period from 12 adult patients already taking <b>perhexiline</b> for the treatment of angina pectoris. These patients were assumed to be at steady state, having taken the same dose of <b>perhexiline</b> for more than 4 weeks and having no changes made to other drug therapy that might have affected plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations (especially drugs that interfere with CYP 2 D 6). <b>Perhexiline</b> was assayed by HPLC/FL. The percentage increase over baseline concentration was determined for each patient for both <b>perhexiline</b> and hydroxyperhexiline. Results - Trough plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations from two patients were below the limit of quantification of the assay (0. 05 mg l - 1) and thus were excluded from the analysis. The greatest mean percentage increase in plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentration over the day was 21 % (95 %CI 9 %, 33 %, range - 19 % to 45 %) which occurred 6 h postdose. The greatest mean percentage increase in plasma hydroxyperhexiline concentration was 10. 8 % (95 %CI - 5. 3 %, 26. 9 %, range - 13 % to 60 %) which occurred 4 h postdose. However individual patients demonstrated > 60 % intraday variability in <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations which was not related to the concomitant use of drugs that affect CYP 2 D 6 activity. Changes in random plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentration which are attributed to changes in concomitant drug therapy should be suppor ted by additional kinetic data. Inter-day variability in plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentration as determined by the ratio of C 24 : C 0 was small (mean 0. 90, 95 %CI 0. 77, 1. 03) which supports C 0 as the best sampling time for <b>perhexiline</b> concentration monitoring. The variability in C 24 : C 0 for hydroxyperhexiline concentrations was smaller (mean 0. 96, 95 %CI 0. 81, 1. 11). Variability in the ratio of plasma concentrations of hydroxyperhexiline to <b>perhexiline</b> over the day was also small. The ratio of plasma hydroxyperhexiline to <b>perhexiline</b> concentration over the day fell within a narrow range for all subjects with 95 % confidence intervals being < 15 % for eight patients and < 25 % for the remaining patient. This suggests that formation of the metabolite occurs rapidly and may be presystemic. It also supports the calculation of the hydroxyperhexiline : <b>perhexiline</b> ratio (in patients at steady state) on blood samples taken at any time during the dosing interval. Conclusions - The within-day variability in plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations was small. While C 0 is probably the best time for therapeutic drug monitoring purposes, it is not unreasonable to use samples drawn at any time during the dosing interval. The therapeutic range used in this hospital (0. 15 – 0. 6 mg l - 1) was devised from earlier work using 4 h postdose blood sampling which is close to the ‘peak’ concentration and a mean of 16 % higher than C 0 in this study. This increase is probably clinically insignificant and a different C 0 range is therefore not warranted. Terry E. Jones, Raymond G. Morris & John D. Horowit...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether <b>perhexiline</b> produces clinically significant inhibition of CYP 2 D 6 -catalysed metabolism in angina patients. Methods - The effects of <b>perhexiline</b> on CYP 2 D 6 -catalysed metabolism were investigated by comparing urinary total dextrorphan/dextromethorphan metabolic ratios following a single dose of dextromethorphan (16. 4 mg) in eight matched control patients not taking <b>perhexiline</b> and 24 patients taking <b>perhexiline.</b> All of the patients taking <b>perhexiline</b> had blood drawn for CYP 2 D 6 genotyping as well as to measure plasma <b>perhexiline</b> and cis -OH-perhexiline concentrations. Results - Median (range) dextrorphan/dextromethorphan metabolic ratios were significantly higher (P < 0. 0001) in control patients, 271. 1 (40. 3 – 686. 1), compared with perhexiline- treated patients, 5. 0 (0. 3 – 107. 9). In the perhexiline-treated group 10 / 24 patients had metabolic ratios consistent with poor metabolizer phenotypes; however, none was a genotypic poor metabolizer.

There was a significant negative linear correlation between the log of the dextrorphan/dextromethorphan metabolic ratio and plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations (r 2 = 0. 69, P < 0. 0001).

Methods: Patients with systolic HF of nonischemic etiology (n= 50, 62 ± 1. 8 years of age, New York Heart Association functional class II to IV, LVEF: 27. 0 ± 1. 44 %) were randomized to receive <b>perhexiline</b> 200 mg or placebo for 1 month in a double-blind fashion. Clinical assessment, echocardiography, and P cardiac magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed at baseline and after 1 month. A substudy of 22 patients also underwent cross-heart blood sampling at completion of the study to quantify metabolite utilization. Results: <b>Perhexiline</b> therapy was associated with a 30 % increase in the phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratio (from 1. 16 ± 0. 39 to 1. 51 ± 0. 51; p< 0. 001) versus a 3 % decrease with placebo (from 1. 36 ± 0. 31 to 1. 34 ± 0. 31; p= 0. 37). <b>Perhexiline</b> therapy also led to an improvement in New York Heart Association functional class compared with placebo (p= 0. 036). Short-term <b>perhexiline</b> therapy did not change LVEF. Cross-heart measures of cardiac substrate uptake and respiratory exchange ratio (which reflects the ratio of substrates used) did not differ between patients who received <b>perhexiline</b> versus placebo. Conclusions: <b>Perhexiline</b> improves cardiac energetics and symptom status with no evidence of altered cardiac substrate utilization. No change in LVEF is seen at this early stage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{heart failure}} (CHF) {{is a major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality that requires a novel approach to therapy. <b>Perhexiline</b> is an antianginal drug that augments glucose metabolism by blocking muscle mitochondrial free fatty acid uptake, thereby increasing metabolic efficiency. We assessed the effects of <b>perhexiline</b> treatment in CHF patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a double-blind fashion, we randomly assigned patients with optimally medicated CHF to either <b>perhexiline</b> (n= 28) or placebo (n= 28). The primary end point was peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO 2 max), an important prognostic marker. In addition, the effect of <b>perhexiline</b> on myocardial function and quality of life was assessed. Quantitative stress echocardiography with tissue Doppler measurements was used to assess regional myocardial function in patients with ischemic CHF. 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess the effect of <b>perhexiline</b> on skeletal muscle energetics in patients with nonischemic CHF. Treatment with <b>perhexiline</b> led to significant improvements in VO 2 max (16. 1 +/- 0. 6 to 18. 8 +/- 1. 1 mL. kg(- 1). min(- 1); P< 0. 001), quality of life (Minnesota score reduction from 45 +/- 5 to 34 +/- 5; P= 0. 04), and left ventricular ejection fraction (24 +/- 1 % to 34 +/- 2 %; P< 0. 001). <b>Perhexiline</b> treatment also increased resting and peak dobutamine stress regional myocardial function (by 15 % and 24 %, respectively) and normalized skeletal muscle phosphocreatine recovery after exercise. There were no adverse effects during the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CHF, metabolic modulation with <b>perhexiline</b> improved VO 2 max, left ventricular ejection fraction, symptoms, resting and peak stress myocardial function, and skeletal muscle energetics. <b>Perhexiline</b> may therefore represent a novel treatment for CHF with a good safety profile, provided that the dosage is adjusted according to plasma levels...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prognosis}} {{of severe}} symptomatic aortic stenosis is poor without aortic valve replacement, with no previous reports of beneficial effects of any medical treatment on either symptoms or outcome. However, this condition is increasingly {{a disease of}} the elderly and cardiothoracic surgery is associated with significant mortality and morbidity in this group. AIMS: We postulated that <b>perhexiline,</b> a novel anti-ischaemic agent with an oxygen-sparing metabolic effect in the myocardium (via inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase- 1) and no adverse haemodynamic effects, may improve symptomatic status in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis. We report here our initial experience with <b>perhexiline</b> treatment in such patients. METHODS: Elderly patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, who were deemed unsuitable for aortic valve replacement, were treated with <b>perhexiline,</b> the drug dosage titrated according to steady state plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations. NYHA functional class was determined prior to and three months following commencement of <b>perhexiline,</b> and changes were analysed using McNemar's test. RESULTS: Fifteen patients, age range 73 - 87, were followed for up to 30 months (median 18 months). Symptomatic status improved in 13 of the 15 patients over {{the first three months}} of <b>perhexiline</b> therapy (p < 0. 01), five patients becoming asymptomatic. Twelve month actuarial survival was 80 % (95 % CI = 57, 100). <b>Perhexiline</b> was well tolerated, with no withdrawals due to toxicity or deteriorating clinical status.

40|$|Background: Concomitant {{treatment}} with amiodarone and perhsexiline {{has been considered}} to be relatively contraindicated because of the hypothetical risk of potentiated adverse effects mediated by additive inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1. Aim: To study the prevalence of adverse effects associated with the concomitant use of <b>perhexiline</b> and amiodarone. Methods: A retrospective analysis of a single hospital database of patients receiving <b>perhexiline</b> and amiodarone between July 2009 and April 2011. Files were reviewed for short- and long-term adverse effects requiring drug cessation. Glucose concentration, gamma glutamyl transferase activity. and <b>perhexiline</b> blood concentrations were recorded. Results: We identified 26 patients concomitantly treated with <b>perhexiline</b> and amiodarone, 20 on a long-term basis. In 6 cases, amiodarone was introduced on top of preceding <b>perhexiline.</b> In none of the cases were drugs stopped because of adverse effects. Although blood glucose concentrations fell significantly 48 hours postadmission to hospital, this seems to reflect the resolution of "admission hyperglycemia" rather than onset of hypoglycemia; the latter was rare (5 patients), mild, and clinically silent. In 4 patients, gamma glutamyl transferase approximately doubled. Conclusions: Traditionally, concomitant {{treatment with}} amiodarone and <b>perhexiline</b> has been considered to be relatively contraindicated {{on the basis of}} the theoretical potential for synergistic toxicity. This cohort of 26 patients received this concomitant treatment without any excess of major adverse reactions. Our findings suggest that concomitant treatment with <b>perhexiline</b> and amiodarone may be safe in the setting of (1) previous tolerance of either agent, and (2) titration of plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations to guide therapy.

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to report on our 5 -year collective experience on the use of <b>perhexiline</b> in the UK, in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and/or refractory angina with respect to ‘real-life’ drug side effects and toxicity, therapeutic drug level monitoring, 5 year mortality outcomes and predictors of response to <b>perhexiline</b> therapy. Methods and results: Data on clinical history, <b>perhexiline</b> monitoring, follow-up, and mortality were retrospectively collated from centralized <b>perhexiline</b> databases from two tertiary referral centres. A total of 151 patients were on <b>perhexiline</b> therapy at two UK tertiary referral centres. At 3 – 4 months, 68. 8 % of patients had drug level within the therapeutic range and 20. 8 % were above the therapeutic range. A total of 58. 9 % of patients reported to have felt better on the <b>perhexiline</b> (responders). The presence of refractory angina was an independent predictor of response to <b>perhexiline</b> therapy (odds ratio 2. 84, 95 % confidence interval 1. 28 – 6. 32, P = 0. 01). Five-year mortality was non-significantly different between patients with refractory angina, CHF, or both (20. 5, 31. 0, and 38. 4 %, P = 0. 20, respectively). Conclusion: <b>Perhexiline</b> therapy provides symptomatic relief in the majority of patients with minimal side effects or toxicity. Careful therapeutic level monitoring for dose titration is important to prevent acute and chronic toxicity. Patients with refractory angina were more likely to be responders.

40|$|<b>Perhexiline</b> is a {{prophylactic}} antianginal agent {{particularly useful}} in patients whose angina is poorly controlled or refractory to conventional drug regimens. Although <b>perhexiline</b> can cause serious hepatic and neurological toxicity, maintaining trough plasma concentrations between 0. 15 - 0. 60 mg/L minimizes {{the risk of}} toxicity while providing relief of angina symptoms in a majority of patients. All pathology laboratories are required to participate in interlaboratory proficiency testing (PT) programs. The authors therefore initiated a monthly PT program to assess the performance of Australian laboratories measuring <b>perhexiline</b> (n = 8).

40|$|In {{the past}} decade there has been growing {{interest}} and evidence that altered myocardial energy metabolism {{plays a major role}} in the onset and/or progression of ischaemic heart disease and heart failure. The anti-anginal agent <b>perhexiline,</b> marketed in Australia as 50 : 50 racemic mixture of (+) - and (-) -enantiomers, was one of the original metabolic agents introduced for clinical use in the 1970 ’s. Its mechanism of action is thought to involve manipulation of cellular energetics by inhibiting fatty acid metabolism through its interaction with the carnitine palmitoyltransferase system. This allows for a ‘switch’ in energy towards utilisation of carbohydrates, resulting in a greater net production of ATP per unit of oxygen used. However, <b>perhexiline</b> has a narrow therapeutic index. Hence clinical usage requires careful dosage individualisation using therapeutic drug monitoring in order to minimise adverse effects such as peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity associated with elevated plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations. There are currently no studies investigating the toxicity and efficacy of the individual enantiomers of <b>perhexiline</b> in vivo and my aim was to address this considerable gap in knowledge. Study 1 : This study investigated the effects of (+) and (-) -perhexiline on superoxide formation by NADPH oxidase in intact neutrophils from healthy subjects and patients with symptomatic stable angina pectoris. (-) -Perhexiline showed a greater inhibition of superoxide formation than (+) -perhexiline (P< 0. 05, Wilcoxon matched paired test) in neutrophils from 11 healthy volunteers, with median IC 50 values of 1. 19 and 1. 64 μM, respectively. In 6 patients with angina, neutrophil superoxide formation was also significantly inhibited by both (+) - and (-) -perhexiline with IC 50 values of 2. 07 μM (1. 04 - 2. 95 μM) and 1. 35 μM (1. 08 - 1. 86 μM) respectively; however there was no significant difference between the two enantiomers. This study demonstrates that both enantiomers dose dependently inhibit superoxide formation by neutrophil NADPH oxidase and are both likely to contribute to the beneficial anti-oxidant properties of <b>perhexiline.</b> Study 2 : This study compared female Dark Agouti (DA) and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, as models of CYP 2 D 6 metabolism and hepatotoxicity after administration of <b>perhexiline.</b> Median (range) <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations in liver and plasma of the SD strain (n= 4) were 5. 42 (0. 92 – 8. 22) μg/g and 0. 09 (0. 04 – 0. 13) mg/L, respectively. The DA strain (n= 4) showed higher plasma (0. 50 (0. 16 – 1. 13) mg/L, P< 0. 05) and liver (24. 47 (9. 40 – 54. 70) μg/g, P< 0. 05) <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations, and cis-OH-perhexiline concentrations in plasma and liver of DA rats were 2. 5 and 3. 7 fold higher compared to SD rats. In both strains the plasma concentration ratio of (+) :(-) enantiomers was approximately 2 : 1. When compared to their controls, DA rats treated with <b>perhexiline</b> had significantly higher plasma LDH concentrations (2 -fold, P< 0. 05), whilst there were no changes in biochemical liver function tests in the SD group. Study 3 : The aim of this study was to administer the enantiomers of <b>perhexiline</b> to the DA animal model. The hypothesis was that there is enantioselectivity in the toxic effects associated with <b>perhexiline</b> in a clinical setting. Racemic <b>perhexiline</b> did not affect hepatic lipid or glycogen content. However, (-) - <b>perhexiline</b> induced a concentration-dependent increase in glycogen content, while (+) - <b>perhexiline</b> induced concentration-dependent increases in lipid and decreases in glycogen content. Racemic (p< 0. 001) and (+) -perhexiline (p< 0. 05) induced peripheral nerve dysfunction, while (-) -perhexiline induced no change. Thus, (+) -perhexiline, but not (-) -perhexiline displayed the toxicity (hepatic steatosis and neuropathy) associated with clinical use. Mean (s. e. m.) plasma <b>perhexiline</b> concentrations in rats treated with racemate, (+) - or (-) - enantiomer were 0. 84 (0. 40), 0. 67 (0. 07) and 0. 29 (0. 04) mg/L, respectively, corresponding to the mid-upper clinical therapeutic range. To my knowledge the studies performed throughout this thesis are the first to test the anti-inflammatory as well as toxic effects of the individual enantiomers of <b>perhexiline.</b> The results suggest that the administration of racemic <b>perhexiline</b> is indeed the administration of two drugs with very different pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamics properties. This not only helps us breach the gap in the current knowledge on how racemic <b>perhexiline</b> may exert its toxic effects, but also introduces the realistic possibility that the use of an enantiomeric formulation of <b>perhexiline</b> may increase efficacy or decrease toxicity providing a safer alternative to racemic <b>perhexiline</b> use.

40|$|Background: <b>Perhexiline,</b> {{originally}} {{used as a}} first-line prophylactic antianginal agent, is now regarded {{primarily as}} a treatment for otherwise refractory myocardial ischemia. Recent studies have also demonstrated its short-term utility in heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and inoperable aortic stenosis. Its benefits on myocardial energetics state are potentially counter-balanced by risk of hepatotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy during long-term treatment if drug accumulation occurs. Since <b>perhexiline</b> exhibits complex pharmacokinetics with wide inter-individual variability, its long-term use requires regular plasma concentration monitoring. In this study, the risk of neuro- and hepato-toxicity during long-term <b>perhexiline</b> therapy in relation to the intensity of therapeutic drug monitoring was investigated. Furthermore, determinants of mortality during <b>perhexiline</b> treatment were evaluated. Methods: In 170 patients treated with <b>perhexiline</b> for a median of 50 months (interquartile range: 31 – 94 months), outcomes and relationship to plasma drug concentrations were documented. Results: Rationale for treatment with <b>perhexiline</b> included myocardial ischemia in 88 % and severe systolic heart failure in 38 %. Plasma concentrations were within the therapeutic range of 150 – 600 ng/mL on 65 % of assay occasions and toxic levels accounted for 8. 8 % of measurements. No patient developed hepatotoxicity attributable to <b>perhexiline</b> while 3 developed peripheral neuropathy possibly induced by treatment. Actuarial 5 -year survival rate was 83 % overall, and 76. 3 % in patients with associated systolic heart failure. Conclusions: This first audit of a large population treated long-term <b>perhexiline</b> demonstrates the following: (1) Although the frequency of monitoring is less than ideal, therapeutic drug monitoring effectively limits occurrence of toxic drug concentrations and virtually eliminates long-term hepato- and neuro-toxicity and (2) Mortality rates during long-term therapy, notably for patients with concomitant heart failure, are surprisingly low.
