50|$|Zincography was a <b>planographic</b> <b>printing</b> {{process that}} used zinc plates. Alois Senefelder first {{mentioned}} zinc's lithographic {{use as a}} substitute for Bavarian limestone in his 1801 English patent specifications. In 1834, Federico Lacelli patented a zincographic printing process, producing large maps called géoramas. In 1837-1842, Eugène-Florent Kaeppelin perfected the process to create a large polychrome geologic map.|$|E
50|$|From {{its first}} appearance, L'Assiette au Beurre {{registered}} as a departure in form from other French humor publications. Each issue {{was made up}} of chiefly two- or three-color-inked cartoons and caricatures, given full- or sometimes double-page placement (instead of the more common quarter page real estate granted to such content in related French publications), with each installment containing a minimum of 16 illustrated pages. Special editions held up to 48 pages. Images were published from original drawings using a zincography, <b>planographic</b> <b>printing</b> process.|$|E
40|$|Removing a varnish coating from an {{intaglio}} or <b>planographic</b> <b>print</b> is {{a potentially}} hazardous procedure. Difficulties are compounded if the ink contains additives and adulterants or the print has been hand-coloured with solvent sensitive media. In {{the case of}} seriously discoloured and damaged artefacts the risks involved in removing any varnish may be justified. Traditionally the paper conservator's choice of options has been rather limited which heightens the potential risks. Solvent poultices and gels may offer certain advantages over more traditional approaches and, although fears as to the long-term implications of residues {{have yet to be}} fully researched, current experiements look encouraging...|$|R

50|$|Problems {{with the}} {{printing}} of his play Mathilde von Altenstein {{caused him to}} fall into debt, and unable to afford to publish a new play he had written, Senefelder experimented with a novel etching technique using a greasy, acid resistant ink as a resist on a smooth fine-grained stone of Solnhofen limestone. He then discovered {{that this could be}} extended to allow printing from the flat surface of the stone alone, the first <b>planographic</b> process in <b>printing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Planographic</b> <b>{{printing}}</b> means printing from a flat surface, {{as opposed}} to a raised surface (as with relief printing) or incised surface (as with intaglio printing). Lithography and offset lithography are planographic processes that rely on the property that water will not mix with oil. The image is created by applying a tusche (greasy substance) to a plate or stone. (The term lithography comes from litho, for stone, and -graph to draw.) Certain parts of the semi-absorbent surface being printed on can be made receptive to ink while others (the blank parts) reject it.|$|E
40|$|Driography is a <b>planographic</b> <b>{{printing}}</b> process. A driographic {{printing plate}} differs from a conventional offset lithographic plate in that water {{is not required}} to keep the non-image area clean of ink during printing. Water, or fountain solution, is not required during printing because a silicone rubber coating which repels ink is used for the non-image area of a driographic plate. The first driographic plate was introduced in the early 19702 ̆ 7 s by the 3 M Company. The plate was a positive working printing plate and has since been discontinued. Driography has since been researched by a number of companies but only one is presently marketing a driographic plate. The Toray Company, a Japanese based firm, is producing a negative working driographic printing plate. The {{purpose of this study is}} to research Toray 2 ̆ 7 s negative working driographic printing plate. It is hypothesized that as ink tack decreases, toning in the non-image area will increase. In this experiment, ink tack was monitored at the point of impression using a thermocouple device. The thermocouple was used to measure ink temperature on an inking form roller. Temperature/tack curves were developed and used to convert ink temperatures to tack readings. The actual experiment was performed on a duplicator offset printing press. A second technique using ink tack-reducer to alter ink tack was performed as an alternative test to support the initial method results. During the course of the study a number of variables could have altered the test results. These variables were monitored and kept constant during testing. The variable which affected test results most dramatically was the oil content in the ink. It was concluded that the amount of oil content in an ink had more influence on the degree of toning than ink tack did as originally hypothesized...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} one of the newer <b>planographic</b> <b>printing</b> plates, specifically 3 M 2 ̆ 7 s Dry Plate. This plate is part of the system more popularly known as driography. As with many new processes, driography is beset with several problems. These include plate durability, substrate suitability, and toning. This study deals with the problem of toning and a. method for investigating it. In driography, toning is defined as the inking of the non-image background of the plate. Several factors are thought to {{have an effect on the}} amount of toning. Factors such as ink tack, ink temperature, room temperature, humidity, speed, and pressure are included. This investigation specifically researched the relationships between toning and ink tack, inking pressure, and printing speed. A parallel study of these relationships was made on both an IGT Printability Tester and on an ATF Chief 15 press. This was done in an attempt to show that the IGT Printability Tester could print driographically but, under the conditions used, it was a poor predictor of toning. Two methods of recording the effects of toning were used. One method was the recording of absolute densities taken in the non-image areas of the test sheets. The other method was the recording of a. ratio of the density of a solid patch to the density- of a tinted patch. It was hoped that the ratio would eliminate some of the extraneous variables that might affect the amount of toning. It was found, however, that the ratio result tended to record not only the pure toning, but also, the effects of some of the extraneous variables. Several statistical methods v/ere used to analyze the data accumulated. To compare one printing method with another and to compare one recording method with another, a correlation analysis was made and a graphical study done. To determine the reliability of the graphical analysis, a spot check was made using a paired comparison technique. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was made of the data from each printing and recording method to determine the significant factors in the experiment. This experiment showed that ink tack, inking pressure, printing speed, and their interactions all were significant factors in toning. Unfortunately it was impossible to include some other factors in the experiment which are known to have a significant effect on toning. These include such factors as ink temperature, room temperature, and humidity. More work needs to be done in the area of driography, especially in toning. The crucial question is whether this is a plate or an ink problem. As more control is obtained over toning, the use of driography should increase...|$|E
40|$|Most people {{conceive}} of lithography as a <b>planographic</b> method of <b>printing.</b> In point of fact, {{only some of}} the original lithographic plates had truly planographic surfaces. Most lithographic plates used in industry today {{do not have the same}} material in the image and non-image areas, so they are called double-phase plates. Because of light undercutting and the roughness of the grain structure of the carrier, the use of conventional double-phase plates for fine image reproduction, where resolution is the main concern, has been limited. The purpose of this study was to determine the image formation mechanism of single-phase plates (i. e. plates with image and non-image areas on the same plane and made of the same material.) by investigating the resolution performance of Association Product plates. There are good reasons to believe that Association Product plates give better resolution than conventional double-phase plates. A comparative study of the resolving power of Association Product plates and commonly used double phase plates provides information about the quantitative difference of resolution between these two types of plates. In choosing to study the image-forming mechanism from the coating variations point-of-view, it was hoped to arrive at a demonstrable independence of plate resolving power from plate coating thickness in the single-phase plate. Results of the experiment showed that coating thickness and grain structure of the plate base does not affect the resolving power of this type of plate. The main factor which directly affects the resolving power is the exposure time...|$|R
