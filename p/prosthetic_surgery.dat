40|$|Introduction: In {{severely}} affected haemophilic patiens arthophaty is {{a common}} problem {{which can lead to}} considerable pain and functional deficit. Surgical management, including total joint arthroplasty, can be undertaken if conservative management fails. A search of the literature showed a number of studies describing the use of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) but virtually nothing {{has been written about the}} use of computer-assisted <b>prosthetic</b> <b>surgery</b> in patiens with coagulation problems. Due to the early-onset severe arthropathy, haemophiliacs undergo prostethic surgery at a younger age than the general population; therefor ensuring a longer duration of implantations is a major objective to be reached in this setting. As several prospective randomized studies could show, computer navigation in <b>prosthetic</b> <b>surgery</b> improve precision concerning geometry of axes, resection planes and implant alignment, by the determination of joint centres (actual axes), amount of bone resection, sizes of prostheses and check of ligament balance. Material and methods: At our departement, since January 2006, we implanted 4 TKA in 4 patients (age range 45 - 52 years) affected by severe Haemophilia B; the same surgeon used a single system (Orthopilot system) in all cases. The quality of implantation was studied on postoperative standardized long leg coronal and lateral x-rays. Results: Our results showed that CAS had greater consistency and accuracy in implant placement. Complications influencing the clinical outcome did not occur. In our experience, drawbacks of the navigation systems are the additional costs and the addicional operation time between 15 and 25 mins. However, one of the most important advantages of using this technique in patients affected by coagulation disease, according to the international literature, is the reduction of less blood after operation. Conclusions: A long-term follow-up of these and of a larger samples of patients is needed for testing cost/risk-benefit ratio of Orthopilot in <b>prosthetic</b> <b>surgery</b> of haemophiliacs. Therefore, navigated total knee arthroplasty in haemophilic arthropaty is not yet a standard procedure, but this technique could become an important surgical choice in management of severe secondary osteoarthritis in the future...|$|E

30|$|Tissue-sparing surgery (TSS) is the “philosophy” of {{respecting}} {{soft tissue}} and bone whenever possible. We believe that obtaining good functional and clinical results in <b>prosthetic</b> hip <b>surgery</b> requires that a balance be struck between {{the need for}} correct implant positioning {{and the need to}} respect tissues. For this reason, we proposed a modification of the classical direct lateral access procedure that can be used with the patient lying in the supine or lateral position [1]. Our modification preserves the anatomical integrity of the gluteus medius, which facilitates “step-by-step” visualization of the surgical anatomy; we have used it to implant more than 2, 000 hip prostheses since 1990.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{our study}} was to report our {{experience}} with patients affected by Erectile Dysfunction (ED) and undergoing penile prosthetic implantation (PPI) in a single center by a single surgeon. Material and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical outcome of 500 patients (mean age: 51. 5 years, range: 20 - 86 years) affected by ED and referred to our private andrological center from January 1984 to December 2013 who underwent penile prosthesis implantation, including the reported level of patient satisfaction. Results: 182 silicone, 180 malleable, 18 monocomponent hydraulic and 120 multicomponents hydraulic prostheses were implanted by the same experienced surgeon. All patients were hospitalized for the procedure. All patients were evaluated immediately, 1 month (496 patients) and, for the great majority, every year after implantation. One hundred twenty five patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty two patients underwent revision surgery for complications in the postoperative period. The most serious postoperative complications were mechanical problems (45 patients, 9. 0 %) and infection (15 patients, 3 %). Forty two (8. 4 %) prostheses were explanted. Overall, 80 % (400 / 500) of patients were able to have sexual intercourse and were fully satisfied with the results.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionCapsular {{contraction}} (CC) occurring with inflatable {{penile prosthesis}} (IPP) reservoirs {{has been reported}} by urologists {{as a cause of}} autoinflation. The concept of CC occurring around IPP cylinders has not been studied. AimsHerein we report a case of CC occurring with nonlength‐expanding IPP cylinders, resulting in an S‐shaped deformity. Main Outcome MeasuresWe sought to report a novel cause of S‐shaped deformity in patients after IPP surgery. MethodsWe reviewed a recent clinical case and conducted a literature review on capsular scar formation in <b>prosthetic</b> <b>surgery.</b> We also conducted a literature review of the inflammatory cascade related with <b>prosthetic</b> <b>surgery.</b> ResultsCapsular contracture of nonlength‐expanding cylinders resulting in S‐shaped deformity has not been previously reported. The role of certain inflammatory markers seems to play a common role of capsular contracture in the penis and other prosthetic implantation sites. ConclusionsCapsular contractures around the cylinders of an IPP can cause deformity, even in patients who have appropriately sized, nonlength‐expanding cylinders. A better understanding is needed regarding the mechanical properties of the tunica albuginea and the inflammatory cascade associated with penile implant surgery. This case represents an argument for early and aggressive postoperative inflation of the IPP. Future studies should evaluate the role of inflammation modulators as adjuvant therapy after IPP surgery.

The development of these secondary infections is due to bacterial dissemination from the blood to sur-rounding tissues and is associated with significantly in-creased morbidity and mortality [1]. Even though all these secondary infections are severe, SA deserves spe-cial attention because it is a rapidly progressive and highly erosive disease of the joints that needs an imme-diate therapeutical intervention [2, 3]. The most import-ant risk factor for SA is pre-existing joint disease, especially rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and <b>prosthetic</b> joint <b>surgery</b> [2].
