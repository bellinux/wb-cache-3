5000|$|The {{increased}} number of deaths in patients with localized disease receiving bicalutamide was meticulously investigated and {{they appeared to be}} due to a number of small imbalances rather than a specific cause. In addition, no direct toxic effect on any organ system could be identified. From this it may be speculated that the excess deaths in patients who are at low risk from prostate cancer mortality reflect the impact of endocrine therapy (rather than bicalutamide in particular). ... The {{increased number}} of non-prostate cancer deaths in the early castration therapy arm (via orchiectomy or [...] monotherapy) in the Research Council study suggests that the trend towards an {{increased number of}} deaths in patients with localized disease in the <b>present</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> a reflection of early endocrine therapy as a concept rather than a bicalutamide-related phenomenon.|$|E

5000|$|This book {{undertakes}} {{a complete}} revaluation and reinterpretation of Ibsen’s methods and intentions as the dramatist {{of the twelve}} realistic plays from The Pillars of Society (1877) to When We Dead Awaken (1899). It follows Ibsen's description by seeing the plays as a single cycle [...] "with mutual connections between the plays" [...] and it demonstrates that this single cyclical structure {{is based upon the}} one great intellectual structure of reality available to Ibsen in the nineteenth century: the philosophical system of Hegel. The novelty does not lie in attributing to Hegel a strong influence upon Ibsen's thought and art, for, though by no means generally accepted by interpreters of Ibsen, this has, at least, been recognized by a number of scholars and critics from the time of C. Pearce's essay [...] "Hegelian Ideas in Three Tragedies by Ibsen." [...] What is new in the <b>present</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> the discovery that the realistic plays are structured directly upon Hegel’s major philosophical work, The Phenomenology of Mind, and that the sequence of dialectical dramas in Hegel’s account of human consciousness is paralleled in the sequence of dialectical dramas in Ibsen’s Cycle.|$|E
