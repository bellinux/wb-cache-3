The researches developed for the Walloon context on this topic confirm the literature concerning the importance of the costs of sprawl for infrastructure services (particularly for drinking water pipes and wastewater treatment). It also arises from the analysis that the costs of sprawl are massively collectivised, via taxation or invoicing which by no means consider the influence of the modes of settlement on the investment needs. urban sprawl, Wallonia, <b>collective</b> <b>services,</b> infrastructure costs, wastewater treatment, planning, land-use...|$|R

40|$|Co-housing {{is a type}} of {{cooperative}} living wherein residents retain private dwellings, but share some conunon facilities. Although it is frequently referred to as a "new " idea that "began " iu Denmark in the 1970 s (see McCamant & Durrett, 1988), socialized neighborhood design is anything but new, as Dolores Hayden's book, The Grand Domestic Revolution (1981), makes strikingly clear. In this highly readable chronicle, Hayden recounts the fascinating story of a two-generation movement of turn-of-the-century American feminists who strived to build neighborhoods with <b>collective</b> <b>services</b> such as conunon kitchens, dining rooms, laundries, day care centers, and the like. Their efforts, though similar to those of today's co-housing activists, were not motivated by the need to renew a sense of conununity or increase togetherness. Rather, these early feminists worked to create <b>collective</b> <b>services</b> in order to free women from the chains of domestic servitude. As Hayden takes us through the waxing and waning of this movement to socialize American neighborhoods, she carefully analyzes everything from the architectural blueprints of kitchenless houses to the philosophical underpinnings o...|$|R
40|$|Purpose and {{research}} questions - A lot of <b>services</b> offered, so-called <b>collective</b> <b>services,</b> {{are used by}} a group simultaneously. In restaurants, in theatres, while travelling with a train and {{in a lot of}} other cases customers usually interact - and therefore they can one another disturb and/or enhance the service quality perceived. The purpose of this dissertation is to open up customer-to-customer-interaction for marketing scientific and practical analysis. The main focus is on its "dark" side and, therefore, on answering the following two research questions: - What disturbs customers {{because of the presence of}} others? - What can a service provider do to minimize disturbances? Literature review {{and research}} gap - Marketing science deals with group consumption in services marketing, brand community management and group goods marketing. The "dark" side, though, is still under-researched - in particular conceptually. Conceptual background and theory - According to Buchanan’s (1965) economic theory of clubs customers usually cause - through their mere presence and/or (mis) behaviour - "crowding costs". These diminish the service quality perceived by an individual customer. A provider of <b>collective</b> <b>services</b> has - according to property rights theory - several possibilities to counteract crowding. One of them is "quasi-privatization", i. e. allowing one customer or a group of them to consume independent of others, e. g. by dividing them spatially. Research design and data analysis - The empirical study’s objective is to find out, if customers are, in general, willing-to-pay for quasi-privatization. As object for investigation I choose the visit of a Fußballbundesliga match, a <b>collective</b> <b>service</b> that on average 40, 000 customers consume simultaneously. I interviewed football fans in the region of the Fußballbundesligist I cooperated with (n = 735). The survey form included demographic information, questions about the respondent’s sport consumption and, the basis for measuring willingness-to-pay, the task to evaluate nine product-service offerings that allow for quasi-privatization. I analyzed the data by applying limit conjoint analysis. Findings - Consumers are willing-to-pay for quasi-privatization. If the Fußballbundesligist introduced product-service offerings that allow for quasi-privatization, it would be able to earn additionally 1. 7 m Euro p. a. Conclusion - By providing product-service offerings that allow customers to quasi-privatize consumption, providers of <b>collective</b> <b>services</b> can minimize disturbances, i. e. crowding costs, caused by other customers present at the same time...|$|R

Although the high-spin torus isomer is a unique quantum object characterized by the alignment of angular momenta of independent single-particle motions, {{we find that the}} obtained moment of inertia for rotations about an axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis is close to the rigid-body value. We also analyze the microscopic structure of the precession motion using the random-phase approximation (RPA) method for high-spin states. In the RPA calculation, the precession motion of the torus isomer is generated by coherent superposition of many one-particle-one-hole excitations across the sloping Fermi surface that strongly violates the time-reversal symmetry. By comparing results of the TDHF and the RPA calculations, we find that the precession motion obtained by the TDHF calculation is a <b>pure</b> <b>collective</b> motion well decoupled from other collective modes...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of military expenditure, inside alliances {{as well as}} outside, has gained much when the original Olson-Zeckhauser approach was generalized into the joint-product model of alliances as developed by Todd Sandier and others. This model allowed, as benefits to allies determining military expenditure, not only deterrence, a <b>pure</b> <b>collective</b> good, but partially collective goods like conventional fighting power and private (country-specific) benefits. The papers in this Special Issue explore the explanatory potential of also considering the demand for positional goods, in particular great-power status, as a determinant of military expenditure. The “exploitation of the strong by the weak” characterizing NATO until the early 1970 s and during the American defence buildup of 1980 - 1985 might also be explained by an informal leader-follower bargain between the United States and its allies who traded acceptance of American hegemony for military protection and “hegemonic stability” of the world economy.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} predicates that allow both {{collective}} and distributive construals {{when combined with}} a plural subject. I present evidence that even on the collective construal, these predicates entail downward from groups to their members, and use this result {{as the basis of}} an attempt to resurrect Harnish 's pragmatic analysis of exhaustiveness ([Harnish, 1976]).

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{collective}} correlations in nuclei is formulated for giant resonances interacting with surface vibrations. The giant dipole states are {{treated in the}} particle-hole framework, while the surface vibrations are described by the collective model. Consequently, this treatment of nuclear structure goes beyond both the common particle-hole model (including its various improvements which take ground-state correlations into account) and the <b>pure</b> <b>collective</b> model. The interaction between giant resonances and surface degrees of freedom as known from the dynamic collective theory is formulated in the particle-hole language. Therefore, the theory contains the particle-hole structures {{and the most important}} "collective intermediate" structures of giant resonances. Detailed calculations are performed for 12 C, 28 Si, and 60 Ni. A good detailed agreement between theory and experiment is obtained for all these nuclei, although only 60 Ni is in the region where one would expect the theory to work well (50 < A < 110) ...|$|R

The defining characteristic of collective annuities {{is that they do}} not depend on an individual’s survival probabilities. We show that such a system may be welfare improving (with a utilitarian social welfare function) even when private annuity markets are perfect and when life expectancy and earning abilities are positively correlated (i. e., in a setting that is a priori biased against collective annuities). We first concentrate on linear pension systems and contrast two schemes: a pure contributory (Bismarckian) pension and a flat rate (Beveridgean) pension. We show that the case for collective annuities is stronger when they are associated with a flat pension system. Then we analyze nonlinear pension schemes. We show that the solution can be implemented by a pension scheme associated with annuities that reflect some degree of “collectiveness. ” Unlike under <b>pure</b> <b>collective</b> annuities, benefits do depend on life expectancy but to a lesser degree than with actuarially fair private annuities. In other words, the impact of survival probabilities is mitigated rather than completely neutralized. Peer reviewe...|$|R
