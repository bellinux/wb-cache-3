40|$|Abstract We {{discuss the}} interplay between surface plas-mon polaritons (SPPs) and {{localized}} shape resonances (LSRs) in a plasmonic structure working as a <b>photo-coupler</b> for a GaAs quantum well photodetector. For a targeted electronic inter-subband transition inside the quantum well, maximum photon absorption is found by compromising two effects: the mode overlapping with incident light and the lifetime of the resonant photons. Under the optimal conditions, the LSR mediates the coupling between the incident light and plasmonic structure while the SPP provides long-lived resonance which is limited ultimately by metal loss. The present work provides insight {{to the design of}} plasmonic photo-couplers in semiconductor optoelectronic applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{dramatic}} fluctuation {{of gasoline}} price {{is a major}} concern for all. Hybrid electric vehicles with ~ 2 times higher fuel efficiency have drawn lots of attention in the last few years. In order to replace costly <b>photo-couplers</b> used in hybrid engine controller boards, silicon based solutions are utilized to suggest the feasibility to lower cost and increase data rate. This dissertation presents the design of an electronic isolator using inductive coupling fabricated in the UMC 130 -nm mixed mode CMOS process. It can achieve 70 -V DC isolation and around 160 -MHz data transmission rate while drawing ~ 22 mA. It only occupies 0. 52 mm^ 2, which is 3 times smaller, compared to the isolators using a capacitive coupling method. The electronic isolator is designed to provide sufficient isolation of high and low voltages coexisting in the same board. It can be used in RS- 232 and IEEE 1394 applications. The channel characteristics including antenna pair gain and delay spreads at 24 -GHz in a printed circuit board for controlling hybrid engines with and without a metal cover are characterized using a 3 -mm on-chip dipole antenna pair. At a 15 -cm separation, the antenna pair gain can be improved by ~ 10 dB with a metal cover ~ 3. 5 cm above the PCB and the maximum excess delay can be reduced to ~ 1. 1 ns from ~ 16. 5 ns, which is acceptable for recovery of clock and data for a 400 Mchip/sec system. It has been verified that on-chip dipole antennas can be used for wireless communication in the hybrid engine controller board. Wireless interconnection using two separate wireless transceivers can operate with two different ground potentials that have large difference. A fully-integrated CDMA transmitter with an on-chip dipole antenna operating at 16. 8 GHz fabricated in the UMC 130 -nm CMOS process is demonstrated. It supports 7 signal levels with a 16. 8 -GHz carrier and 400 -Mbps data rate. It includes a PLL, divider chains, a double balanced Gilbert cell up-conversion mixer, a power amplifier (PA), attenuators, a digital coder, a duplexer, and a 4 -mm on-chip dipole antenna. The PA used in the transmitter chain can achieve 10 -dBm saturated output power and ~ 22 -% maximum PAE. Most of the rise and fall times are around 200 ps. The worst case is 800 ps for the level 0 to level 2 transition. The CDMA transmitter occupies ~ 5. 2 mm^ 2 and consumes 198 mW. A bus interconnected with wireless links on a printed circuit board in which multiple sets of devices/chips can simultaneously communicate and control signals can be broadcasted to multiple devices has been presented in the dissertation. A gold bond wire with ~ 1 -mil diameter is co-optimized with a bond pad to resonate at ~ 60 GHz. With a metal cover representing an enclosure for an electronic system (2 -mm from a printed circuit board), the antenna pair gain at 10 -cm separation is ~ - 53 dB including the effects of two nearby bond wires located 300 ?m away. This is sufficient for building an inter-chip 1 -Gbps radio link with bit error rate of 10 ^- 12. The bond wire antennas should also be useful for general purpose over the air communication in the 60 -GHz unlicensed band...|$|R
