6000|$|Now, as it befell, {{just then}} that very big fellow, seeing a <b>parrot-fish</b> {{come out of}} a cleft of the coral, made at him from below, as did two or three more; the poor fish finding no other escape, leaped clean into the air, and almost aboard the boat; while just where he had come out of the water, three or four great brown shagreened noses clashed {{together}} within two yards of Jack as he sat, each showing its horrible rows of saw teeth, and then sank sulkily down again, to watch for a fresh bait. At which Jack said very softly, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine!" [...] and turning his eyes in board, had no lust to look at sharks any more.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was a nice}} {{friendly}} little chap at first, {{about the}} size of a small hen--very much like most other young birds, only bigger. His plumage was a dirty brown to begin with, with a sort of grey scab that fell off it very soon, and scarcely feathers--a kind of downy hair. I can hardly express how pleased I was to see him. I tell you, Robinson Crusoe don't make near enough of his loneliness. But here was interesting company. He looked at me and winked his eye from the front backwards, like a hen, and gave a chirp and began to peck about at once, as though being hatched three hundred years too late was just nothing. 'Glad to see you, Man Friday!' says I, for I had naturally settled he was to be called Man Friday if ever he was hatched, as soon as ever I found the egg in the canoe had developed. I was a bit anxious about his feed, so I gave him a lump of raw <b>parrot-fish</b> at once. He took it, and opened his beak for more. I was glad of that for, under the circumstances, if he'd been at all fanciful, I should have had to eat him after all.|$|E
60|$|These summer isles of Eden {{have this}} {{advantage}} over the scriptural Eden, that apparently it was not woman and her seed who were expelled, when once she set foot here, but the serpent and his seed: women now abound in the Summer Islands, {{and there is not}} a snake anywhere to be found. There are some tortoises and a great many frogs in their season, but no other reptiles. The frogs are fabled of a note so deep and hoarse that its vibration almost springs the environing mines of dynamite, though it has never yet done so; the tortoises grow to a great size and a patriarchal age, and are fond of Boston brown bread and baked beans, if their preferences may be judged from those of a colossal specimen in the care of an American family living on the islands. The observer who contributes this fact to science is able to report the case of a <b>parrot-fish,</b> on the same premises, so exactly like a large brown and purple cockatoo that, seeing such a cockatoo later on dry land, it was with a sense of something like cruelty in its exile from its native waters. The angel-fish he thinks not so much like angels; they are of a transparent purity of substance, and a cherubic innocence of expression, but they terminate in two tails, which somehow will not lend themselves to the resemblance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{came the}} atoll. Came {{out of the}} sunrise, as it were, suddenly, close up to me. I drifted {{straight}} towards it until I was {{about half a mile}} from shore, not more, and then the current took a turn, and I had to paddle as hard as I could with my hands and bits of the Aepyornis shell to make the place. However, I got there. It was just a common atoll about four miles round, with a few trees growing and a spring in one place, and the lagoon full of <b>parrot-fish.</b> I took the egg ashore {{and put it in a}} good place well above the tide lines and in the sun, to give it all the chance I could, and pulled the canoe up safe, and loafed about prospecting. It's rum how dull an atoll is. As soon as I had found a spring all the interest seemed to vanish. When I was a kid I thought nothing could be finer or more adventurous than the Robinson Crusoe business, but that place was as monotonous as a book of sermons. I went round finding eatable things and generally thinking; but I tell you I was bored to death before the first day was out. It shows my luck--the very day I landed the weather changed. A thunderstorm went by to the north and flicked its wing over the island, and in the night there came a drencher and a howling wind slap over us. It wouldn't have taken much, you know, to upset that canoe.|$|E

He followed me about from the very beginning. He used to stand by me and watch while I fished in the lagoon, and go shares in anything I caught. And he was sensible, too. There were nasty green warty things, like pickled gherkins, used to lie about on the beach, and he tried one of these and it upset him. He never even looked at any of them again.|$|E
6000|$|You find one: {{and in a}} moment, what a change! The deep has {{suddenly}} become shallow; the blue white, from the gleam of the white coral at the bottom. But the coral is not all white, only indeed a little of it; for as you look down through the clear water, you find that the coral is starred with innumerable live flowers, blue, crimson, grey, every conceivable hue; and {{that these are the}} coral polypes, each with its ring of arms thrust out of its cell, who are building up their common habitations of lime. If you want to understand, by a rough but correct description, what a coral polype is: all who have been to the sea-side know, or at least have heard of, sea-anemones. [...] Now coral polypes are sea-anemones, which make each a shell of lime, growing with its growth. As for their shapes, the variety of them, the beauty of them, no tongue can describe them. If you want to see them, go to the Coral Rooms of the British or Liverpool Museums, and judge for yourselves. Only remember that you must re-clothe each of those exquisite forms with a coating of live jelly of some delicate hue, and put back into every one of the thousand cells its living flower; and into the beds, or rather banks, of the salt-water flower garden, the gaudiest of shell-less sea-anemones, such as we have on our coasts, rooted in the cracks, and live shells and sea-slugs, as gaudy as they, crawling about, with fifty other forms of fantastic and exuberant life. You must not overlook, too, the fish, especially the <b>parrot-fish,</b> some of them of the gaudiest colours, who spend their lives in browsing on the live coral, with strong clipping and grinding teeth, just as a cow browses the grass, keeping the animal matter, and throwing away the lime {{in the form of an}} impalpable white mud, which fills up the interstices in the coral beds.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the Otways region some 276 Aboriginal {{archaeological sites}} had been {{identified}} by 1998, 73 in the Aire River valley alone. A site at Seal Point, dating back 1,500 years, some 400 metres long, 100 metres wide and with a depth of ca.1.5 metres, {{has been described by}} Harry Lourandos as 'the most complex and bountiful of all southwestern Victorian middens. Archaeological examinations of Aire River middens have uncovered both intertidal mollusc and freshwater mussel remains, together with <b>parrot-fish</b> residues and snails. At Seal Point, archaeologists have disinterred what looks like a warm weather camp, from spring to early summer, with pit huts, whose remains attest to a diet based on two species of marine animals-the elephant and brown fur seals- possums, wrasse, and bracken ferns, and to an industrial production of flake stone tools.|$|E
50|$|Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important reef-building corals in the Caribbean, although current populations have been decimated by white band disease and have yet to fully recover. This species is structurally complex with many large branches. The coral structure resembles that of elk antlers. These branches create habitats for many other reef species, such as lobsters, <b>parrot-fish,</b> snapper shrimps and other reef fish. Elkhorn coral colonies are incredibly fast-growing, with an average growth rate of 5 to 10 cm per year and can eventually grow up to 3.7 m in diameter. The color of this coral species ranges from brown to a yellowish-brown as a result of the symbiotic zooxanthellae living inside the tissue of this coral species. Zooxanthellae are a type of algae which photosynthesize to provide the coral with nutrients. The zooxanthellae are also capable of removing waste products from the coral. Historically, the majority of elkhorn coral reproduction has occurred asexually; this occurs when a branch of the coral breaks off and attaches to the substrate, forming a new colony, known as fragmentation. The degree to which local stands reproduce by fragmentation varies across the Caribbean, but on average, 50% of colonies are the result of fragmentation rather than sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction occurs once a year in August or September when coral colonies release millions of gametes by broadcast spawning.|$|E
5000|$|Since white band {{disease was}} first {{reported}} in the 1970s, the disease {{has led to the}} devastation of approximately 95% of the elkhorn and staghorn corals in the Caribbean region. [...] This resulted in both affected species being listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act and as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. [...] The decline in these corals has a lasting effect on both humans and the environment. [...] Coral reefs protect coastlines from ocean currents, waves, and storms, and the death of these corals only increases the loss of coastlines in affected regions. [...] Elkhorn and staghorn corals are two of the major reef-building corals, the foundation on which the rest of the coral reef is formed. [...] Its loss means the loss of a habitat for many coral reef dwelling species such as lobsters, <b>parrot-fish,</b> snapper shrimps, and many other reef species, causing a sharp decline in the biodiversity of an affected region. [...] Coral reefs are also home to more than twenty-five percent of all marine fish species, making them extremely biologically diverse. [...] The loss of this coral would be particularly damaging to people living on the coast in terms of the food supply, coastal protection, economic security and more. [...] Nearly 500 million people directly depend on coral reefs for food and income (through tourism or otherwise).|$|E
40|$|Beyond {{the loss}} of species {{richness}} [1 - 3], human activities may also deplete the breadth of evolutionary history (phylogenetic diversity) and the diversity of roles (functional diversity) carried out by species within communities, two overlooked components of biodiversity. Both are, however, essential to sustain ecosystem functioning and the associated provision of ecosystem services, particularly under fluctuating environmental conditions [1 - 7]. We quantified the effect of human activities on the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of fish communities in coral reefs, while teasing apart the influence of biogeography and habitat along a gradient of human pressure across the Pacific Ocean. We detected nonlinear relationships with significant breaking points in the impact of human population density on phylogenetic and functional diversity of parrot-fishes, at 25 and 15 inhabitants/km(2), respectively, while <b>parrot-fish</b> species richness decreased linearly along the same population gradient. Over the whole range, species richness decreased by 11. 7 %, while phylogenetic and functional diversity dropped by 35. 8 % and 46. 6 %, respectively. Our results call for caution when using species richness as a benchmark for measuring the status of ecosystems since {{it appears to be}} less responsive to variation in human population densities than its phylogenetic and functional counterparts, potentially imperiling the functioning of coral reef ecosystems...|$|E
