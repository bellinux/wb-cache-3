5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> {{beyond the}} bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} the series, whose name was never released, was an {{intersex}} person with a male build and stature, but who may have self-identified as female and/or been assigned female at birth. The subject had a small, probably hypospadic, penis, rudimentary scrotum, and male <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> pattern. The subject also had a retracted or rudimentary clitoral hood and vaginal opening. In most photographs the subject's face and chest are covered.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
50|$|In late 2007, an FBI lab report {{surfaced}} which {{concluded that}} Stano {{could not have}} been the source of unidentified Caucasian <b>pubic</b> <b>hairs</b> that were recovered from Scharf's body. The report was never presented as evidence by the public defender representing Stano. The source of the <b>pubic</b> <b>hairs</b> was not identified, and they were destroyed shortly after Stano's execution in the Florida electric chair in 1998.|$|R

The patient complained of hard brown nodules along the shafts of the <b>pubic</b> <b>hairs.</b> These were shown to be composed of transparent, greenish tinged, mycelial mass extending along the hair as a sheath and hyphae segmenting into round, oval or rectangular cells. Trichosporon beigelli was isolated in pure culture. The other cases previously reported from India are reviewed...|$|R

5|$|On January 8, 2009, an 18-year-old male {{member of}} Anonymous {{ran into the}} New York Scientology {{building}} shirtless and covered with Vaseline, <b>pubic</b> <b>hair,</b> and toenail clippings. He then proceeded to toss books around and smear the mixture on objects in the building. The man, identified by police as Mahoud Samed Almahadin, was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, and aggravated harassment as hate crimes. Two weeks later, 21-year-old film student and Anonymous member Jacob Speregen was charged with aggravated harassment and criminal mischief as hate crimes after he filmed Almahadin carrying out his prank. According {{to his mother and}} the video, Speregen was filming the event from behind the barricade. Scientology critics Mark Bunker and Jason Beghe disagreed with the individual's actions.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{the then}} 68-year-old Takechi {{decided to return}} to film with a series of {{theatrical}} hardcore films, beginning with a remake of his 1964 Daydream, also titled Daydream. Noticing actress Kyōko Aizome in one of her nude photo magazine appearances, Takechi chose her to star in the film. Japan's first theatrically released film featuring hardcore sex, Aizome added to the controversy surrounding the film by admitting to having performed actual sexual intercourse on camera. Though, as Japanese law required, sexual organs and <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> were fogged on screen, the Asahi Shimbun called it a breakthrough film, and Japan's first hardcore pornographic movie. Takechi took a novel, yet traditional approach to the fogging by covering the forbidden areas with floating images of topless female shamisen players. Unlike Takechi's earlier Dream of the Red Chamber, the full, uncensored version of Daydream 1981 did survive, and circulated underground in Japan. This uncensored version of the film was released on video at one time in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books were legal to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short <b>pubic</b> <b>hair,</b> and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that the description was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E

5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and <b>pubic</b> <b>hair.</b> Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E
5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail clippings, women's <b>pubic</b> <b>hair,</b> and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal and throw the contents down a latrine.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} of events of pubertal development can occasionally vary. For example, in about 15% of boys and girls, pubarche (the first <b>pubic</b> <b>hairs)</b> can precede, respectively, gonadarche and thelarche by a few months. Rarely, menarche can occur before other signs of puberty in a few girls. These variations deserve medical evaluation because they can occasionally signal a disease.|$|R

25|$|In ancient Egyptian art, female <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> is {{indicated}} {{in the form of}} painted triangles. In medieval and classical European art, <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> was very rarely depicted, and male <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> was often, but not always, omitted. Sometimes it was portrayed in stylized form, {{as was the case with}} Greek graphic art. The same was true in much of Indian art, and in other Eastern portrayals of the nude. In 16th century southern Europe, Michelangelo showed the male David with stylized <b>pubic</b> <b>hair,</b> but female bodies were depicted hairless below the head. Nevertheless, Michelangelo's male nudes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling display no <b>pubic</b> <b>hair.</b> In Renaissance northern Europe, <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> was more likely to be portrayed than in the south, more usually male, while occasionally on female figures.|$|E
25|$|Although fine vellus hair {{is present}} in the area in childhood, <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> is {{considered}} to be the heavier, longer and coarser hair that develops during puberty as an effect of rising levels of androgens in males and estrogens in females. <b>Pubic</b> <b>hair</b> is part of a person's body hair and a secondary sex characteristic. Many cultures regard <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> to be erotic, and in most cultures <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> is associated with genitalia, which both men and women are expected to keep covered at all times. In some cultures, it is the norm for <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> to be removed, especially of females, a practice which is regarded as part of personal hygiene. In other cultures, the exposure of <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> (for example, when wearing a swimsuit) may be regarded as unaesthetic or embarrassing, and is therefore trimmed or otherwise styled to avoid it being visible.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unusual}} for <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> to be dyed or painted, except {{incidentally}} to bodypainting. Concerns {{have been raised}} {{about the safety of}} using regular hair dye for this purpose, but dyes have been formulated for use on <b>pubic</b> <b>hair.</b> This is sometimes done to enable someone to match their <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> to the (dyed) hair on their head, or in whimsical colours.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century female <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> is openly portrayed in Japanese shunga (erotica), {{especially}} in the ukiyo-e tradition. Hokusai's picture The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife (1814), which depicts a woman having an erotic fantasy, is a well-known example. In Japanese drawings, such as hentai, <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> is often omitted, since {{for a long time}} the display of <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> was not legal.

25|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} {{in the house and}} grounds of 4315 Charlotte Street, investigators uncovered a human skull inside a closet {{on the second floor of}} his property, and a partially decomposed human head in the backyard. The search also uncovered several human vertebrae scarred by both hacksaw and knife marks stowed in a hallway, and several human teeth stowed in two envelopes. Both a hacksaw and a miter saw were discovered in the basement of the property, and a chainsaw was also found to be soiled with bloodstains, flesh, and <b>pubic</b> <b>hairs.</b> Luminol tests revealed that the floor of Berdella's basement, and two plastic trash barrels, were extensively bloodstained.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pubic</b> <b>hair</b> {{patterns}} {{can vary}} {{by race and}} ethnicity. Patterns of <b>pubic</b> <b>hair,</b> known as the escutcheon, vary between sexes. On most women, the pubic patch is triangular and lies over the vulva and mons pubis. On many men, the pubic patch tapers upwards to a line of hair pointing towards the navel (see abdominal hair), roughly a more upward-pointing triangle. As with axillary (armpit) hair, <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> {{is associated with a}} concentration of sebaceous glands in the area.|$|E
25|$|Francisco Goya's The Nude Maja (1797) {{has been}} {{considered}} as probably the first European painting to show a female subject's <b>pubic</b> <b>hair,</b> though paintings had hinted at it. The painting was considered quite pornographic at the time. Gustave Courbet's L'Origine du monde (The Origin of the World, 1866) was considered scandalous probably more because of the presentation of thick <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> than the exposed female genitals.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which mild 3β-HSD CAH can cause early {{appearance}} of <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> {{and other aspects of}} hyperandrogenism in later childhood or adolescence is unsettled. Early reports about 20 years ago suggesting that mild forms of 3β-HSD CAH comprised significant proportions of girls with premature <b>pubic</b> <b>hair</b> or older women with hirsutism have not been confirmed and it now appears that premature pubarche in childhood and hirsutism after adolescence are not common manifestations of 3β-HSD CAH.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the victims}} found had been sodomized and most victims found bore {{evidence}} of sexual torture: <b>pubic</b> <b>hairs</b> had been plucked out, genitals had been chewed, objects had been inserted into their rectums, and glass rods had been shoved into their urethrae and smashed. Cloth rags had also been inserted into the victims' mouths and adhesive tape wound around their faces to muffle their screams. The mouth of the third victim unearthed on August 8 was so agape that all upper and lower teeth were visible, leading investigators to theorize the youth had died with a scream on his lips. On August 8, 1973, eight corpses were uncovered at the boat shed.|$|R
40|$|Until now, Pthirus pubis {{infestation}} {{in ancient}} human populations {{had only been}} recorded in the Old World.
