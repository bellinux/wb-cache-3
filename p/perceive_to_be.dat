5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E

Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' {{basement}} to plot {{a series of}} bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at Columbine High and express rage at those they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|E

A School Hierarchies Scale and a Peer Perception of Aggression Scale <b>were</b> applied <b>to</b> 274 9 th grade students, both sexes, aged 14. 08 years (SD = 0. 81) old on average, attending four {{public schools in the}} state of São Paulo, Brazil. The students more frequently <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> popular, were among the best in physical education and/or among the worst in academic subjects were also more frequently <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bullies, while those more frequently <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unpopular and having the worst performance in physical education were also more frequently <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> victims. Therefore, teachers should reflect upon the issue and fight school violence that may arise from these hierarchies...|$|R

With many efforts, hospital must to make the patient feel comfortable with the services. The main objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> analyze the importance and performance services at R. W Mongisidi General Hospital in Manado. The type {{of this research is}} descriptive quantitative methods. By using Impotance Performance Analysis (IPA) as analytical tool. In this research the samples taken are as much as 60 respondent (patient). The result of this research is (1) the level of importance, competence factor <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important, for the level of performance <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> low. (2) the level of importance, access factor <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important, for the level of performance, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> low. (3) for the level of importance, courtesy factor <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important, for the level of performance access <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> high. (4) the level of importance, credibility factor <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too important, for the level of performance, access <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> high.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{perceived}} forms and drivers of sexual and gender based violence in post conflict settings with focus on Northern Uganda. It applied qualitative approaches primarily using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Study findings revealed that although {{all forms of}} violence <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prevalent, physical and emotional violence <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most occurring. Men <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the main perpetrators of violence. However, there were cases of men who reported to experience violence from women. Few men reported violence to authorities because it <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stigmatizing; such men would be perceived as weak in a patriarchal society that <b>perceives</b> ideal men <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong and less susceptible to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Early marriages are a major form of gender based violence which was perceived as normal {{in a number of}} communities despite the evidence that it contributes to negative social and reproductive health outcomes. Sexual violence cases in form of rape, defilement as well as incest <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the rise in the sub-region. The study identified several drivers of SGBV including poverty, power imbalances in access to and control over resources, insecurity, blaming HIV infection on female partners, HIV related stigma and discrimination, alcohol and substance abuse...|$|R

As many as 22% of Spanish citizens feel that a republic would be the better form of government for Spain, while separatists and independence supporters in the Basque Country and Catalonia routinely protest the monarchy as the living symbol of a united Spain. Part of the left criticize the institution of monarchy as anachronistic, while the far right criticize King Juan Carlos personally because he has given his royal assent and tacit approval to what they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a liberal agenda in Spain and a secularism of Spanish life.|$|E
25|$|Planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} {{water from}} Greater Irbid in the Jordan Valley. A major water reuse project is being planned to reuse water from three {{wastewater treatment plants}} {{in the area of}} Irbid in the North of Jordan through a project supported in the framework of Jordanian-German cooperation. As of 2006, only 14% of the wastewater from these plants was being reused. An explanation for this is that farmers in the Jordan Valley are reluctant to use the reclaimed water, which they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of poor quality, for irrigation. The wastewater thus flows into the Jordan River, unused. In the future, the treated effluent from the three plants will flow through a pipe into the Jordan Valley, generating hydropower from the elevation differential of more than 1,000m. It will then be mixed with freshwater and delivered to the farmers in a quality that is acceptable to them.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{instances}} showing {{that there is a}} form of aphasia among deaf individuals. Sign language is, after all, a form of communication that has been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal forms of communication. Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner. These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands. Broca's area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication. Facial communication is a significant portion of how animals interact with each other. Humans use facial movements to create, what other humans <b>perceive,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> faces of emotions. While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication. Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating. These facial movement forms of communication come from the same areas of the brain. When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal forms of communication are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia. Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community. Individuals can show a form of Wernicke's aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities in being able to produce any form of expressions. Broca's aphasia shows up in some patients, as well. These individuals find tremendous difficulty in being able to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express.|$|E

The Crows reinforce Scarecrow's subjection at their hands through a song whose refrain [...] "you can't win child, you can't get out of the game" [...] that aims to disabuse Scarecrow of any aspirations toward freedom... Their insistence that [...] "reading is stupid" [...] suggests that a Eurocentric education does not promise liberation from [...] "the game" [...] that race and racism create... The Crow's dismissal of education and western thought fails because they do not offer Scarecrow an alternative that will emancipate him. The Crow's attempt to discipline Scarecrow by displacing his hope with nihilism. For The Crow's so-called book of knowledge is less valuable than what they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> real knowledge-street smarts. Though they are not tethered to a pole, they are seemingly unable or as their commandments and anthem suggests, unwilling to find opportunities than their present location provides. The Crow's chorus to Scarecrow's song is revealing for what it says about their loss of hope... The Crow's are even more disadvantaged than Scarecrow because, unlike him, they are hopeless. The Crow's chorus, like The Crow Commandments, reflects their disillusionment with their inability to realize the promise of upward mobility.|$|E
500|$|Dirleton {{played a}} role in the story of the “ Gowrie Conspiracy” of 1600 in that there has long been {{suspicion}} that the castle was taken from the Ruthvens and given to Thomas Erskine as a reward for assisting [...] James VI in the murder of Patrick Ruthven’s sons: John, 3rd Earl of Gowrie, and his brother Alexander. [...] The official narrative of the Gowrie Conspiracy, provided afterwards by the king, was that he and fifteen retainers, Erskine among them, had arrived at Gowrie House one night in August 1600 because he had been invited there by Alexander. However, as the narrative goes, the two brothers attempted to assassinate James, and in the melee that followed, the two Ruthvens were killed. [...] While this was happening at Gowrie House, the other two Ruthven brothers, William and Patrick, were at Dirleton, apparently unaware of the plot afoot. [...] Finding much to doubt in the king’s account, many have argued that James went to Gowrie House with his retinue for the express purpose of murdering John and Alexander, partly because the king owed the Earl of Gowrie a large sum of money and partly because there had long been a rumor that Gowrie was the grandson of James IV, which, if true, would have put him in line for the throne ahead of James VI. After the killings, the king divided the Gowrie estates and bestowed them on the men who had been with him that night. [...] Erskine received the gift of Dirleton Castle, which some <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a form of “blood money.” [...] This perception is further substantiated by the fact that Erskine was created Baron Erskine of Dirletowne in 1604.|$|E
