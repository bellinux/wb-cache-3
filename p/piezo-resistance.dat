40|$|Industry {{demands on}} cheap, full scale tactile sensors, capable to be {{embedded}} into material or structure being monitored. Previous research reported polyisoprene-nanostructured carbon black composite (PNCBC) as a promising {{material for this}} use. PNCBC is made when certain concentration of high-structure nano-size extra conductive carbon, close {{to that of a}} percolation threshold, is well dispersed into a rubber matrix before vulcanizing. In such case reversible tenso-resistance effect as well as <b>piezo-resistance</b> effect with up to 4 orders of magnitude is observed. During previous research, it was concluded that technological parameters like mold pressure, vulcanizing time and filler distribution have a critical effect on final properties of PNCBC. In this work we have ascertained, how the mold pressure during vulcanizing have an effect on electric properties of PNCBC. Extra conductive carbon black was mixed into polyisoprene matrix by means of cold rolls for 20 minutes at room temperature. Afterwards the raw material was vulcanized using different mold pressures. Specific electric resistance and <b>piezo-resistance</b> effect were determined depending on filler concentration and mold pressure. By evaluating results, conclusions were made, that not always the best conductivity and <b>piezo-resistance</b> effect of PNCBC are gained using typical mold pressures, used in classic rubber industry. The mechanism of the effect of mold pressure on the final sensor properties and the percolative behavior of PNCBC is discussed...|$|E

40|$|This Thesis {{investigates the}} damage sensing {{capabilities}} of the electrical potential measurement technique in carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites. Impact damage was introduced in multidirectional laminates {{and its effect on}} potential distribution studied. It was found that delaminations and fibre breakages within the laminate can be detected and located by measuring potential changes on the external composite surface. The extent and size of potential changes were significantly affected by the position of the current electrodes in relation to the potential measurement probes. A numerical model was developed investigating the effect of different size delaminations, located in various positions within the lamina, on electrical potential distributions on the external ply, and a quantitative analysis of the numerical results is presented. The numerical simulations demonstrated that the measured potential changes on the external ply were in proportion to the delamination size. The numerical and experimental results were compared and the optimum configuration of current electrodes and potential probes for damage detection selected. The response of electrical potential to mechanical strain, in unidirectional and multidirectional samples was also investigated. It was found that the conductive medium, used for introducing the current, defines the <b>piezo-resistance</b> performance of the composite. A finite element model was developed able to predict the effect of inhomogeneous current introduction in unidirectional specimens on electrical potential and <b>piezo-resistance.</b> The effects of temperature and water absorption on potential measurements were also presented.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{developing}} simple and generic characterization tools to deform freestanding silicon beams {{down to the}} nanometre scale, sufficiently equipped to investigate both the mechanical properties and the carrier transport under large strains, has been met in this research through {{the design of a}} versatile lab-on-chip. The Young’s modulus was observed to unexpectedly decrease from a bulk value of 169 GPa down to 96 GPa when varying the thickness of silicon from 200 down to 30 nm. The fracture strain increases when decreasing the volume of the test specimen starting from 0. 2 % for a bulk silicon wafer, to reach 5 % in the smallest SiNWs. In order to proceed with characterizing its electro-mechanical properties, it is necessary to understand the influence of surface state charge distributions on SiNW transport characteristics. The removal of the oxide at the surface of SiNWs by a HF treatment results in a drop in conductance up to six orders of magnitude. This effect is from a surface depletion of holes in the SiNW induced by positive surface charges deposited from the HF treatment. However, it is observed that this charge density is transient and is dissipated with the re-growth of an oxide layer. Additionally, atomic layer deposited Al 203 can be used to control the surface potential of p-type SiNWs from depletion to accumulation. In summary, the SiNW conductance can be reproducibly controlled up to several orders of magnitude, while playing with four common surface conditions: with a native oxide, deposited Al 203, thermal oxide and HF induced H-terminations. Finally, the <b>piezo-resistance</b> of SiNWs has been investigated under large uniaxial tension up to fracture using an original on-chip tensile testing technique. The <b>piezo-resistance</b> coefficient (π) was found to increase by a factor of 6, when decreasing the dopant concentration from Na ~ 1 x 1019 cm- 3 down to ~ Na ~ 5 x 1017 cm- 3. Reduction of resistance up to a factor of 5. 8, higher than theoretical prediction of 4. 5 is reported for Na ~ 5 x 1017 cm- 3 under a stress of 1. 7 GPa, without any sign of saturation.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{characteristics of}} low dimensional semiconductors like silicon nano-wires (SiNWs) rarely conform to expectations from geometry and dopant density, exhibiting significant variations {{as a function}} of different surface terminations/conditions. The association of these mechanisms with surface states and their exact influence on practical SiNW devices still remains largely unclear. Herein, we report on the influence of surface state charge distributions on SiNW transport characteristics. For this study, p-type SiNW devices with widths of 50, 100, and 2000 nm are fabricated from 25, 50, and 200 nm-thick SOI wafers. A five order difference in effective carrier concentration was observed in the initial SiNWs characteristics, when comparing SiNWs fabricated with and without a thermal oxide. The removal of the surface oxide by a hydrogen fluoride (HF) treatment results in a SiNW conductance drop up to six orders of magnitude. This effect is from a surface depletion of holes in the SiNW induced by positive surface charges deposited {{as a result of the}} HF treatment. However, it is observed that this charge density is transient and is dissipated with the re-growth of an oxide layer. In summary, the SiNW conductance is shown to vary by several orders of magnitude, while comparing its characteristics for the three most studied surface conditions: with a native oxide, thermal oxide and HF induced H-terminations. These results emphasize the necessity to interpret the transport characteristics of SiNWs with respect to its surface condition, during future investigations pertaining to the physical properties of SiNWs, like its <b>piezo-resistance.</b> As a sequel, prospects for efficiently sensing an elementary reduction/oxidation chemical process by monitoring the variation of SiNW surface potential, or in practice the SiNW conductance, is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) {{produced}} to date include IR detectors, accelerometers, pressure sensors, micro lenses, actuators, chemical sensors, gear drives, RF devices, {{optical processor}} chips, micro robots and devices for biomedical analysis. The track for tomorrow {{has already been}} set and products like 3 D TV, physician on a chip, lab on a chip, micro aircraft and food safety sensors will be developed when the technology matures and the market is ready. Todays MEMS fabrication is typically based around a silicon substrate and borrow batch fabrication processes from the IC industry. Many of the developed MEMS products have never left a laboratory environment because they are fragile in the macro environment. The {{way to deal with}} this is to provide proper packaging {{so that they can be}} handled. This poses one of the major challenges in the MEMS industry. Not many packaging techniques have been commercially developed for MEMS and companies that have overcome the packaging problems very seldom reveal their packaging techniques. Functional problems that could be associated with a MEMS structure are often amplified by the package. The reason for this is often associated with packaging stress. Packaging stress related problems is what has kept many promising products from emerging on the market. Even the commercially available pressure sensors and accelerometers have packaging stress problems, but most of them have been overcome. A first step towards solving these challenges is to localise, quantify and understand the critical packaging stresses that act in a packaged MEMS device. The goal of this work was to understand how packaging stresses act in a plastic moulded MEMS chip. The work has been threefold; simulation of transfer moulding, static stress analysis of the plastic capsule after moulding and modelling of the piezo-resistive behaviour of a MEMS pressure sensor. This dissertation is divided into 9 chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of level- 0 and level- 1 packaging and looks at different techniques of obtaining the different packaging levels. It introduces the Small Outline Package (SOP) which is the package that has been simulated in this dissertation. Chapter 2 gives the background in the theory that has been used to complete this work. It starts by discussing the chemistry and mechanics of thermosetting polymers. Then the rheological behaviour of Epoxy Moulding Compounds (EMC) in a transfer moulding process is discussed. The experimental results from the thermomechanical material characterisation of the EMC are presented in Chapter 3. The material was found to have a Tg of 130 o C and coefficient of linear expansion of /oC and /oC below and above Tg respectively. It was further found that the material showed linear viscoelastic behaviour. Stress relaxation tests were run to obtain the relaxation coefficients needed for accurate modelling. The material was found to behave in a thermo rheologically simple manner and the WLF shift function was used to describe the time-temperature superposition principle. Chapter 4 addresses the applicability of the plastic processing simulation code, C-Mold, for simulations of MEMS packaging in a SOP. It was found that the 2. 5 D simulation technique used by the software was inadequate for simulating the polymer filling of the SOP in question. This conclusion was drawn because 3 D flow effect were observed in the moulding cavities. The cause for the 3 D flow effect was the height of the SOP which was relatively large in order to accommodate for the MEMS device. However, the software proved to be very useful for balancing the runner system. Chapter 5 starts with the development of a novel method for calculating the accurate piezoresistance for implanted silicon piezo-resistors. The method let each finite element in a piezoresistor region represent one resistor in a resistor network. The total resistance was then found by simple resistor summation. This method was then utilized on a silicon diaphragm pressure sensor, which had four piezo-resistors implanted into the top surface. The resistors on the diaphragm formed a Wheatstone bridge and the change in <b>piezo-resistance,</b> as a result of applied pressure and hence change in the stress field, was transformed into an electrical signal by proper post processing. The model was built from the design specifications of a commercially manufactured die. The results were compared to the production measurements and matched the data within one standard deviation. It was found that the level- 0 package had an effect on the output signal. This work is believed to be the first to report an estimation of the distortion effect that a level- 0 package has on a sensor signal with temperature. Chapter 6 presents the model of the complete MEMS pressure sensor component encapsulated by EMC in a SOP. The EMC was treated as being elastic and temperature dependent. The method that was developed and calibrated in Chapter 5 was used as an indirect measure of the accuracy of the FEM model. It was evident that the package had a profound effect on the sensor signal. This was consistent with the actual measured data. The match of the signal data was not satisfactory. The signal values for two of the four service temperatures lay outside 3 standard deviations of the experimentally measured results. The estimated sensitivity of the die also fell outside 3 standard deviations for three of the four service temperatures. A special vector plot was developed to understand how the pressure, or packaging stress, from the EMC effected the signal and sensitivity of the sensor die. The numerical simulations were done assuming a stress free temperature of 175 o C, the moulding temperature. The packaging stress was found to increase with decreasing temperature. This was the effect of the subsequent increase in ΔT as the service temperature decreased. The signal at zero pressure was found to shift as a function of temperature. This was caused by the packaging stress and a corresponding stress-field-shift on the diaphragm. The origin for this shift was an uneven packaging stress between the front and the back side of the sensor die. At - 7 o C, the pressure on the front and the back was 30 and 20 MPa respectively. This caused an uneven bending moment on the membrane long sides and resulted in a shift in the stress field. Chapter 7 elaborated the model one step further by treating the EMC as a viscoelastic material. The result of using the viscoelastic material model showed a reduction in the packaging stress due to stress relaxation. Viscoelastic materials are temperature and strain-history dependent. It was therefore necessary to run the model through the same processes posed by the manufacturing of the MEMS and SOPs. These included a set of thermocycles between - 40 o C and 125 o C before the signals as a function of temperature and pressure were taken. The thermocycles were found to have a positive effect on signal shifting. Less signal distortion was seen with more cycles. The estimated and measured signal- vs. temperature-values matched within two standard deviations. The estimated sensitivities did not match the experimental measurements any better than those obtained for the elastic case. It was also found that sensitivity was nearly independent on packaging stress, but significantly dependent on pressure loading conditions. The use of the viscoelastic model gave an improvement in simulated signal accuracy over the elastic model. It became clear that the EMC had to be treated as a viscoelastic material. Chapter 8 concerned the change in material properties of the EMC and the impact this had on the FEM results. It was found that the behaviour of the MEMS pressure sensor was greatly affected by such changes. Chapter 9 present the concluding remarks of this study. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
