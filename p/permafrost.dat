5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above <b>permafrost,</b> each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the <b>permafrost</b> below {{the pipeline}} warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E
5|$|In <b>permafrost</b> soils with {{an active}} upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, {{patterned}} ground can form, creating circles, nets, ice wedge polygons, steps, and stripes. Thermal contraction causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Department {{responded by}} sending {{personnel}} {{to analyze the}} proposed route and plan. Max Brewer, an arctic expert {{in charge of the}} Naval Arctic Research Laboratory at Barrow, concluded that the plan to bury most of the pipeline was completely unfeasible because of the abundance of <b>permafrost</b> along the route. In a report, Brewer said the hot oil conveyed by the pipeline would melt the underlying <b>permafrost,</b> causing the pipeline to fail as its support turned to mud. This report was passed along to the appropriate committees of the U.S. House and Senate, which had to approve the right-of-way proposal because it asked for more land than authorized in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and because it would break a development freeze imposed in 1966 by former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.|$|E
5|$|The tundra is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is low. Soil a meter {{below ground}} and deeper is {{permanently}} frozen (<b>permafrost),</b> {{which does not}} allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the <b>permafrost.</b> Low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on the tundra are the barren-ground caribou, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, lemmings, and voles. Occasional sightings of muskoxen have been made near Cape Chidley, Labrador's most northerly point. The polar bear is the dominant carnivore of the tundra, but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the common eider, harlequin duck, Common redpoll and American pipit. The Labrador tundra is also permanent home to ptarmigan.|$|E
5|$|An {{effort to}} {{recreate}} the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the USDA ARS Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory and Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. The effort resulted in the announcement (on 5 October 2005) that the group had successfully determined the virus's genetic sequence, using historic tissue samples recovered by pathologist Johan Hultin from a female flu victim buried in the Alaskan <b>permafrost</b> and samples preserved from American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Beattie and {{his team}} had noticed that someone else had {{attempted}} to exhume Hartnell. In the effort, a pickaxe had damaged the wooden lid of his coffin, and the coffin plaque was missing. Research in Edmonton later showed that Sir Edward Belcher, commander {{of one of the}} Franklin rescue expeditions, had ordered the exhumation of Hartnell in October 1852, but was thwarted by the <b>permafrost.</b> A month later, Edward A. Inglefield, commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the exhumation and removed the coffin plaque.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1879-1880, {{extended}} periods of extreme cold affected the Netherlands. <b>Permafrost</b> and temperatures down to minus 16 degrees Celsius led to distress among the citizens of Delft. In response, Matthes founded the Vereeniging voor Armenzorg (Association {{to care for the}} poor), helping regardless of religious or political beliefs. She prompted her husband to launch a Wintersnood-Commissie, which was led by him, his brother-in-law Arnold Kerdijk, and CEO-to-be Gerard Knuttel.|$|E
5|$|Gore's book of {{the same}} title was {{published}} concurrently with the theatrical release of the documentary. The book contains additional information, scientific analysis, and Gore's commentary on the issues presented in the documentary. A 2007 documentary entitled An Update with Former Vice President Al Gore features Gore discussing additional information that came to light after the film was completed, such as Hurricane Katrina, coral reef depletion, glacial earthquake activity on the Greenland ice sheet, wildfires, and trapped methane gas release associated with <b>permafrost</b> melting.|$|E
5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to deal with problems caused by <b>permafrost,</b> and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard has <b>permafrost</b> and tundra, {{with both}} low, {{middle and high}} Arctic vegetation. 165 species of plants have been found on the archipelago. Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, which {{accounts}} for about 10% of the archipelago. Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving the archipelago a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{peninsula}} {{is covered}} by taiga {{in the south and}} tundra in the north. In the tundra, cold and windy conditions and <b>permafrost</b> limit the growth of the trees, resulting in a landscape dominated by grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs such as dwarf birch and cloudberry. In northern coastal areas, stony and shrub lichens are common. The taiga in the southern areas is composed mostly of pine trees and firs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and <b>permafrost</b> in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|An oceanic (or maritime) {{climate is}} {{typically}} found {{along the west}} coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. A steppe is a dry grassland. Subarctic climates are cold with continuous <b>permafrost</b> and little precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on <b>permafrost.</b> The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of <b>permafrost,</b> soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Mining was {{challenging}} as the ore {{was distributed}} in an uneven manner and digging was made slow by <b>permafrost.</b> As a result, some miners chose {{to buy and}} sell claims, building up huge investments and letting others do the work. To accommodate the prospectors, boom towns sprang up along the routes and at their end Dawson City was founded at the confluence of the Klondike and the Yukon River. From a population of 500 in 1896, the town grew to house around 30,000 people by summer 1898. Built of wood, isolated and unsanitary, Dawson suffered from fires, high prices, and epidemics. Despite this, the wealthiest prospectors spent extravagantly gambling and drinking in the saloons. The Native Hän people, on the other hand, suffered from the rush, being moved into a reserve {{to make way for the}} stampeders, and many died.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard Satellite Station {{was built}} because of Longyearbyen's {{excellent}} location to download data from satellites in polar orbit. Located at Platåberget above Hotellneset, {{it was built}} as a cooperation between NASA and the Norwegian Space Centre, but has since 2001 been operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services. EISCAT operates an incoherent scatter radar to study the northern lights. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, administered by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, is a secure underground facility capable of storing millions of crop seeds. The facility {{has been designed to}} protect against natural and human disasters, including global warming, floods and fires and nuclear holocaust. The site was chosen for a number of factors including its remoteness, sound geology and the ambient temperature of the <b>permafrost.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tourist {{facilities}} in Sisimiut include several youth hostels and hotels, such as Hotel Sisimiut with Restaurant Nasaasaaq, and Seaman's Home, and a conference center. The other restaurant of note is the Misigisaq Restaurant, {{located at the}} harbor. It is the only Chinese restaurant {{in the country and}} it uses Greenlandic ingredients cooked in the Chinese style. The town has a heated open-air swimming pool, which is supported on stilts so that the heat does not melt the <b>permafrost.</b> Several camping sites are located in Sisimiut valley and near the Kangerluarsunnguaq bay. During winter, a ski lift operates {{at the foot of the}} Alanngorsuaq mountain, at the base of the northern slopes of Nasaasaaq.|$|E
5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and <b>permafrost</b> to melt rapidly and {{allowing}} {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent <b>permafrost</b> melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|Two {{primarily}} terrestrial mammalian species {{inhabit the}} archipelago: the Arctic fox and the Svalbard reindeer. There are 15 to 20 types of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, walruses, and polar bears. About 30 types of bird are found on Svalbard, {{most of which}} are migratory. The Barents Sea is among the areas in the world with most seabirds, with about 20 million individuals during late summer. Sixteen bird species are on the IUCN Red List. In particular, Bjørnøya, Storfjorden, Nordvest-Spitsbergen and Hopen are important breeding grounds for seabirds. Svalbard has <b>permafrost</b> and tundra, with both low, middle and high Arctic vegetation. There have been found 165 species of plants on the archipelago, although vegetation only covers 10% of the island group. Low precipitation gives the archipelago a steppe climate; however plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only for a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|In the Oligocene, from twenty-five to thirty-two {{million years}} ago, {{there was another}} {{significant}} restructuring of the global carbon cycle as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved {{in response to the}} drop in atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 550 ppm. The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, biodiversity loss, agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of <b>permafrost</b> are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH4) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane {{in the context of the}} global carbon cycle, because methane is a greenhouse gas that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO2 on a 100-year time scale. Hence, there is a relationship between global warming, decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the <b>permafrost,</b> Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Permafrost</b> is common. The {{northern}} part of Yukon has continuous <b>permafrost,</b> while it is widespread in the central part. Even the southern Yukon has scattered patches of <b>permafrost.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of ground <b>permafrost</b> {{is important to}} the persistence of some lakes. According to research published in the journal Science ("Disappearing Arctic Lakes", June 2005), thawing <b>permafrost</b> may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia. The idea here is that rising air and soil temperatures thaw <b>permafrost,</b> allowing the lakes to drain away into the ground.|$|E
25|$|A severe {{threat to}} tundra is global warming, which causes <b>permafrost</b> to melt. The melting of the <b>permafrost</b> {{in a given}} area on human time scales (decades or centuries) could radically change which species can survive there.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{technical}} difficulties {{for such a}} railway. About half of the second section was built on barely permanent <b>permafrost.</b> In the summer, the uppermost layer thaws, and the ground becomes muddy. The heat from the trains passing above is able to melt the <b>permafrost</b> even with a small change in temperature. The main engineering challenge, aside from oxygen shortages, is {{the weakness of the}} <b>permafrost.</b> For areas of <b>permafrost</b> that are not very fragile, an embankment of large rocks is sufficient. Meanwhile, in the most fragile areas, the rail bed must be elevated like a bridge. The engineers dealt with this problem in the areas of weakest <b>permafrost</b> by building elevated tracks with pile-driven foundations sunk deep into the ground. Similar to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, portions of the track are also passively cooled with ammonia-based heat exchangers.|$|E

25|$|Only a {{fraction}} of the <b>permafrost</b> zone consists of actual ground ice. The remainder (dry <b>permafrost)</b> is simply soil or rock at subfreezing temperatures. The ice volume is generally greatest in the uppermost <b>permafrost</b> layers and mainly comprises pore and segregated ice in Earth material. Measurements of bore-hole temperatures in <b>permafrost</b> can be used as indicators of net changes in temperature regime. Gold and Lachenbruch (1973) infer a 2-4nbsp&°C warming over 75 to 100 years at Cape Thompson, Alaska, where the upper 25% of the 400-m thick <b>permafrost</b> is unstable with respect to an equilibrium profile of temperature with depth (for the present mean annual surface temperature of -5nbsp&°C). Maritime influences may have biased this estimate, however. At Prudhoe Bay similar data imply a 1.8nbsp&°C warming over the last 100 years (Lachenbruch et al. 1982). Further complications may be introduced by changes in snow-cover depths and the natural or artificial disturbance of the surface vegetation.|$|E
25|$|The current Arctic {{warming is}} leading to fears of ancient carbon being {{released}} from thawing <b>permafrost,</b> leading to methane and carbon dioxide production by micro-organisms. Release of methane and carbon dioxide stored in <b>permafrost</b> could cause abrupt and severe global warming, as they are potent greenhouse gases.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic {{region is}} one of the many natural sources of the {{greenhouse}} gas methane. Global warming accelerates its release, due to both release of methane from existing stores, and from methanogenesis in rotting biomass. Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, <b>permafrost,</b> and as undersea clathrates. <b>Permafrost</b> and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming. Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine <b>permafrost</b> and decaying gas hydrate deposits.|$|E
25|$|Continuous <b>permafrost</b> is {{typically}} {{found in the}} Tian Shan starting at the elevation of about 3,500-3,700 m above sea level. Discontinuous alpine <b>permafrost</b> usually occurs down to 2,700-3,300 m, but in certain locations, due to the peculiarity of the aspect and the microclimate, {{it can be found}} at elevations as low as 2,000 m.|$|E
