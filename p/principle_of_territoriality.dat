40|$|Abstract__ The {{purpose of}} this {{contribution}} {{is to provide a}} very modest comparison of judicial language protection in South Africa and in Belgium. First of all, the authors sketch briefly the historical context and the constitutional status of languages in both countries. It is difficult to argue that one always has a right to use his or her own language. However, the use of language has clear links to constitutional rights such as the right to a fair trial. The authors then consider the rules on the use of languages in court generally and in criminal proceedings particularly. Belgium has strict rules on the use of language, and these rules are based on strong <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>territoriality</b> and monolingualism. South Africa, on the other hand, has 11 official languages, not linked to territories, but in practice these languages do not all enjoy the same protection. The pragmatic approach by the South African courts is indicated with reference to the case law...|$|R

In {{the latter half of the}} 20th century, there has been a vigorous and sometimes contentious debate among the Orthodox concerning the problem of the Diaspora, specifically the organization of the Orthodox Church in countries to which Orthodox have emigrated, particularly since the Russian Revolution. The problem is that Orthodox dioceses (officially called [...] "jurisdictions") in the Diaspora are superimposed on each other.

40|$|The present work has, as its {{principal}} aim, {{the analysis of}} the possible implications, within the set of rules, provisions and principles that is commonly known as “European tax law”, <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> fiscal <b>territoriality,</b> especially in the design of a hypothetical theory of allocation of (direct) taxation powers amongst EU Member States with a scope extended to the entire Internal Market. In other words, what the present work ultimately aims at achieving is considering a possible interpretation of “territoriality” which can fit “the Internal Market territory” through the lens of European Union law. The result could be useful in order to attempt to transpose the concept of “territoriality” from its more “traditional” interpretation given from the perspective of international law and/or domestic law to a more authentically European interpretation and application. The research will, therefore, mainly focus on the taxation of items of income which are characterised by a “foreign” element, that is to say income of a transnational nature or income accrued by non-resident subjects.

40|$|States are on {{the brink}} of {{entering}} an age of total cyber-warfare without due regard to its legal ramifications. In particular, there has been no express agreement on which <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> international law are applicable, which legal methods should be used in approaching cyber-attacks, which previous state practice (if any) is relevant, what institutions are responsible for handling this threat and how they are going to coordinate action amongst each other. While members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (led by the Russian Federation) have repeatedly suggested developing and agreeing upon special written norms that would govern the conduct of cyber-hostilities, the United States and some of its allies continue to reject these proposals, arguing that the existing international law already provides a comprehensive framework necessary to tackle cyber-warfare. The present thesis does not contest (and, in fact, supports) the idea that contemporary jus ad bellum and jus in bello, in general, can accommodate cyberattacks. Instead, it argues that existing international law features a large amount of significant imperfections that can be exploited in cyber-warfare. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the jus ad bellum and jus in bello regimes as they apply to cyber-attacks with a view of mapping out exploitable gaps, deficiencies and uncertainties and offering further remedies that could eliminate them. Therefore, the research focus lies on revealing elements of existing international law that do not perfectly fit the threat of cyber-attacks. For this purpose, the general politico-legal framework of and norms pertaining to the use of force and humanitarian law are analyzed. The study is supplemented by looking into inter-related rules, which bear secondary importance {{for the purposes of this}} thesis, that is those surrounding conventional terrorism, United Nations law, international criminal law, <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>territoriality,</b> sovereignty, jurisdiction and so on. At the same time, in addressing technical matters, an attempt is made to present the danger of cyber-attacks realistically. As a theoretical foundation, the current thesis recognizes the central role of states in cyber-warfare, run by governments, who interpret and want others to interpret international law in a way that best suits their interests. Furthermore, it acknowledges that their behavior is somewhat tampered with by the strongest elements of natural law and that, while, legal norms may be treated as irrelevant, their violation has negative political consequences...|$|R
40|$|In a {{communication}} to the Parliament and the Council entitled “Towards a modern, more European copyright framework” and dated 9 December 2015, 1 the European Commission confirmed {{its intention to}} progressively remove the main obstacles to {{the functioning of the}} Digital Single Market for copyrighted works.

On the one hand, this legislative proposal has the full potential to resolve the (limited) issue of portability, which stems from the national dimension of copyright and the persisting territorial licensing and distribution of copyright content. 5 On the other hand, as this commentary shows, the ambiguity of certain important provisions in the proposed regulation might affect its scope and effectiveness and contribute to the erosion <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> copyright <b>territoriality...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} {{insolvency law}} {{is based on}} two main principles – the principle of universality and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>territoriality.</b> Under the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>territoriality,</b> the insolvency proceedings shall {{be limited to the}} assets located in the state in which the proceedings were opened. In light of the principle of universality, there is one single insolvency proceeding which shall affect all assets of the debtor and shall be governed by one national law. The universalism ensures efficiency and economy of the insolvency proceedings. On the other hand, due to widely differing national insolvency laws the application of universality without exception may cause difficulties. Therefore, European insolvency law is based on the modified universality which is a compromise between these two main principles. The article aims to outline the theoretical basis of these principles and analyze their concrete manifestations within cross-border insolvency proceedings...|$|E
40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>territoriality</b> is a truism in {{intellectual}} property (IP) law. A premise underlying {{the principle is}} the right of each state {{to determine the extent}} to which IP rights exist and are protected within its own territory to fulfil its own economic, social and cultural policy goals. This is done by giving a right to prevent others from doing within the protected territory any of the acts that are exclusively reserved to the right holder under the IP statute that granted or protects the IP right. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>territoriality</b> informs that IP rights granted or protected by a state are independent from those granted or protected by other states, and that the rights conferred under each state’s IP law are limited to the territory of that state. As the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>territoriality</b> neatly allocated jurisdiction among states on a territorial basis, it purportedly obviated the need for private international law. Each state exercised jurisdiction over the infringement of its own rights and applied its own domestic IP law, which served the interests of the states and of the parties. With the increase in the protection and exploitation of IP rights across national borders, infringements do not remain within hermetically sealed national territories. Acts taken in one state can have effects in other states and impair the policies that the rights were designed to fulfil. This raises questions concerning the territorial scope of application of the domestic IP law, that is, whether it is interpreted with respect to a domestic tangible act, effects on a domestic policy goal or both. In addition, the transborder exploitation of IP rights raises questions of private international law with respect to whether states exercise jurisdiction and apply national law to disputes concerning infringements of their domestic rights or whether states exercise jurisdiction and apply national law to disputes arising from acts committed in their territories (or both). These determinations may depend on different factors such as the different interests taken into consideration (e. g. state or party interests), the different legal traditions upon which the legal systems are based and the characteristics and functions of the IP rights themselves. This dissertation compares the interpretation and operation of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>territoriality</b> of IP law in the private law resolution of transborder IP infringement disputes in the legal systems of the European Union and the United States, two distinctly different legal systems that have significant trade and investment relations with each other. The comparison shows that while the systems are functionally similar, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>territoriality</b> is interpreted and operates somewhat differently in the two legal systems...|$|E
40|$|Territorial {{arrangements}} for managing inter-ethnic relations within states {{are far from}} consensual. Although self-governance for minorities is commonly advocated, international documents are ambiguously formulated. Conflicting pairs <b>of</b> <b>principles,</b> <b>territoriality</b> vs. personality, and self-determination vs. territorial integrity, along with diverging state interests account for this gap.

40|$|According to the “Waffle" {{model of}} the Belgian Linguistic Conflict (Klein et al. 2012), this {{conflict}} centres around two main dimensions: One concerns the use of language across the territory and the second concerns the distribution of resources between the two main linguistic communities, Dutch-speakers and French-speakers. The model suggests that the two groups adhere to different justice principles regarding these issues and that these disagreements are {{a function of the}} intensity of the conflict. With respect to the first dimension, Dutch-speakers are expected to adhere more to a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> linguistic <b>territoriality</b> than French-speakers who should be more in favor of a free choice of one's idiom across the territory. With respect to the second dimension, the model posits that Dutch-speakers will adhere more to an equity principle whereas French-speakers should adhere more to a need principle. We tested these hypotheses {{in the context of a}} large-scale survey involving two waves: in May 2011 in the middle of a political crisis, and in June 2014, when the conflict was appeased. The pattern of "disagreements" in a subsample that participated in both waves of the survey (N = 378) is consistent with the Waffle model and, as expected, more severe at the heart of the conflict (in 2011) than after pacification (in 2014). However, differences were driven mostly by supporters of the Flemish nationalist party N-VA. Moreover, endorsement <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> on both dimensions are predictive of separatist attitudes in the Dutch-speaking sample whereas only the first dimension plays a role for the French speaking sample. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

While the spatial aspects of social movement mobilization have received increased attention over the last decade, the specifically territorial aspects of mobilization remain undertheorized. This article elaborates on Sack’s (1986) characterization <b>of</b> <b>territoriality</b> as a means to exert power by delimiting area.

Our intent in introducing the concept <b>of</b> <b>territoriality</b> is threefold: first, to help explain how mobilization is interwoven, through agency, with local context; second, to emphasize the utility of spatial concepts in the social movement literature; and third, to broaden the comparative range of case studies in the field of collective action by considering societies where boundaries are actively contested (weakly 'naturalized'). We conclude with a discussion of how the concept <b>of</b> <b>territoriality</b> enhances a new reading of our empirical case and an analysis of the study’s theoretical implications for {{our understanding of}} the relationship between mobilization and boundaries...|$|R
