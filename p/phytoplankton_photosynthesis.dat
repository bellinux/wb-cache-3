Although the LSZ is a sink for high concentrations of nutrients from urban and agricultural sources, phytoplankton production rates are quite low. Nitrate is optimally used by phytoplankton for growth, but ammonium (largely derived from sewage outfalls) has a suppressive effect on growth rate. Thus, while not nutrient limited, phytoplankton tend to grow more slowly due to the kinds of nitrogen present. Another suppressive factor on growth rate is the high turbidity of the estuary, which limits the ability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to penetrate beyond the top few centimeters of the water column.

The in-situ experiments were conducted in Da Ya Bay, which is a semi-enclosed area in the subtropical South China. The results showed a significant reduction of photosynthetic rates and quantum yield in the presence of UVB. Maximum photosynthetic rates (P max) and maximum quantum yield (F max) were 11 %- 22 % and 17 %- 49 % less under solar radiation with UVB than without UVB. A simplified model was developed to describe the UVB biologically effective fluence rate (E inh *) as an exponential decay function of depth. Light-shift experiments, in which water samples from the surface and at depth of 4 m were divided into several subsamples, and each subsamples were then incubated at different depths with and without UVB in the water column, showed that phytoplankton from the deeper water (4 m) had more inhibitive rates by UVB than that from the surface when exposed to the same light condition.

40|$|During May 2002 {{we carried}} out studies with {{tropical}} phytoplankton assemblages from coastal waters off SE China {{to assess the}} combined effects of solar UV radiation (UVR, 280 to 400 nm) and mixing rates. Water samples were taken daily and incubated using in situ and simulated in situ conditions under 3 radiation regimes (photosynthetically active radiation [PAR] + UVR, PAR + UV-A and PAR only). Variable radiation regimes, to simulate the irradiance field in the upper mixed layer (UML), were obtained by using a device consisting of 1 fixed (static samples) and 1 rotating system (moving samples). Solar UVR inhibited <b>phytoplankton</b> <b>photosynthesis</b> {{in the water column}} (i. e. during in situ experiments), and this inhibition (mean value at surface = 24 %) decreased with depth, so that at 1. 2 m {{there were no significant differences}} between radiation treatments.

Simulated in situ experiments showed that solar UVR stimulated <b>phytoplankton</b> <b>photosynthesis</b> under fast mixing conditions (i. e. when the irradiance levels changed from 100 to 6 % and back in less than 30 min). With slower circulation periods, solar UVR reduced carbon fixation and consequently the integrated inhibition within the UML approached the values from the static samples.

We found that <b>phytoplankton</b> <b>photosynthesis</b> {{in the ocean}} does not scale as the L-power of cell size, but scales approximately isometrically with cell size, indicating that a single model cannot predict the metabolism–size relationship in all photosynthetic organisms. The scaling relationship between cellular chlorophyll a content and cell size is also isometric.

The size scaling exponent for photosynthesis is significantly higher (1. 14) in coastal productive waters than in the oligotrophic open ocean (0. 96), which provides a physiological basis to explain the dominance of larger cells in nutrient-rich environments. The size scaling exponent for phytoplankton abundance is significantly less negative in coastal productive waters (- 0. 90) than in the oligotrophic open ocean (- 1. 25). The observed size scaling relationships imply that carbon fixation per unit volume decreases with cell size in oligotrophic waters, whereas the opposite occurs in productive ones.
