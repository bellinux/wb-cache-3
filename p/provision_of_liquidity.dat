As a result, The Federation of European Securities Exchange (FESE) has long been concerned with finding an optimal tick size regime to implement across exchanges in Europe. From 2009 - 2010, The FESE and the Stockholm Stock Exchange (SSE) implemented the FESE tick size table 2 for 81 Large Cap stocks in a collaborative effort to enhance the overall market quality {{for all of its}} participants.  This study investigates the FESE tick size table 2 that was implemented in October 2009 and June 2010 on the SSE and its impact on Large Cap stocks in term <b>of</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Through the measurement and analysis of the three commonly used features <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> (bid-ask spread, depth, and trade volume), the study suggests that the <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> increased due to the implementation of the FESE tick size table 2 overall, improving market quality and encouraging trade amongst its participants...|$|R
40|$|The Millennium Date Change (often {{referred}} to as Y 2 K) was anticipated {{to be a major}} liquidity event by many financial and corporate institutions as well as the central banks around the world.

S. central bank in the period surrounding Y 2 K. We demonstrate that in the presence of this potential aggregate liquidity shock, (1) the cost of private loans and insurance increased significantly, (2) government securities commanded a liquidity premium, and most importantly, (3) the Fed successfully provided liquidity insurance and reduced liquidity premium prior to Y 2 K by taking various actions and especially by issuing Y 2 K options.

40|$|I {{analyze the}} role that asset markets play in the {{performance}} and stability of the run-prone banking sector. Banks insure consumers against privately observed liquidity shocks. Asset market investments insure consumers against losses from bank runs. If {{the probability of a}} run is small, then banks specialize fully into the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> insurance: They provide a higher degree of liquidity insurance when compared to the economy with banks alone. If the probability of a run is high, consumers prefer to invest solely through the asset market. Insurance against runs provided by the market investment reduces consumers' incentives to run.

We also find institutional traders use more limit orders than market orders and that their relative use of limit to market orders is higher than retail traders. The use of limit orders by institutional traders has increased substantially in 2009 and reflects the growth in algorithmic and high frequency trading. When studying the price impact of market orders, we find institutional traders are better informed than retail traders.

40|$|Pricing {{central bank}} {{liquidity}} through product-mix auctions – {{the first anniversary}} of the Bank of England’s indexed long-term repo operations Paul Fisher, (1) Tarkus Frost (2) and Olaf Weeken (3) The objectives of central banks ’ operating frameworks typically involve implementing monetary policy and supporting financial stability via the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> insurance to the banking system. Prior to the crisis, many central banks aimed to provide liquidity insurance through facilities that had primarily been designed for the implementation of monetary policy. One lesson the Bank has learnt from the crisis is that there are advantages to separating the implementation of monetary policy from the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> insurance. This approach has been incorporated in new developments in the Bank’s permanent operating framework – the Sterling Monetary Framework (SMF). One manifestation of this is the evolution of the Bank’s long-term repo operations from a facility primarily designed to aid monetary policy implementation to one with the primary objective of providing liquidity insurance without distorting commercial banks ’ incentives for prudent liquidity management, and while minimising the risks being taken by the Bank. In designing these indexed long-term repo operations (ILTRs) the Bank has drawn on the lessons from auction theory. A feature of the ILTRs – which we believe to be a first in central bank auction design – is that the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> insurance adjusts automatically to increases in demand caused by liquidity stresses in the banking system. This paper describes the design of the ILTRs and reports on the Bank’s experience with the new auction design during its first year of operation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} three essential {{functions of}} global financial market management that currently are not properly met, and could best {{be met by}} new institutional developments: 1. prudential regulation; 2. <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> official <b>liquidity</b> to countries or markets in crises; and 3. emergency orderly work-out procedures. The paper reviews progress achieved regarding needed reform of the international financial architecture since 1998. It concludes that, although important progress has been made, it is urgent for further necessary measures to be taken. This is because recent crises have had an unacceptably high cost, especially for developing countries, and have discouraged future private investment, both by national and foreign investors. ...|$|R

We show that the relationship between jumps and market liquidity depends on the respective dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity.</b> First, the increase in ex-ante and ex-post trading costs is statistically significant but the economic impact remains limited. Second, jumps are driven by a sharp rise in the demand for immediacy, rather than by weak liquidity supply. As such, jumps {{do not seem to be}} due to an endogenous deficient <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> market <b>liquidity.</b> Third, there is rather strong evidence of resilience, whatever the liquidity measures under consideration. We also find that liquidity shocks in the effective spread and the number of trades contribute the most to the likelihood of jumps. Finally, examining post-jump price discovery process, we conclude that liquidity is more informative immediately after jumps compared to the case where there is no jump...|$|R

50|$|The Amsterdam banking {{crisis of}} 1763 in the Netherlands {{followed}} {{the end of}} the Seven Years' War. At this time prices of grain and other commodities were falling sharply, and the supply of credit dried up due to the decreased value of collateral goods. Many of the banks based in Amsterdam were over-leveraged and were interlinked by complex financial instruments, making them vulnerable to a sudden tightening of credit availability. The crisis was marked by the failure of one large bank - that of De Neufville - and many smaller financial enterprises. The extent of the crisis was mitigated by the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> extra <b>liquidity</b> by the Bank of Amsterdam, the Dutch central bank. Similarities have been identified between these events and the financial crisis of 2007-2008.|$|R

40|$|Large value {{payment and}} {{securities}} settlement systems are important components of an economy's financial system. Many such systems are operated by central banks and are liquidity intensive. Central banks often provide inexpensive liquidity to facilitate settlement. This {{leads to a}} number of policy questions about the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> such <b>liquidity.</b> To answer these questions, central banks need to understand what factors influence the timing of settlement. This paper offers a model to better understand intraday patterns of settlement and identifies three factors that influence the timing of settlement: the cost <b>of</b> intraday <b>liquidity,</b> a participant's exposure to settlement risk, and system design. Incorporating all three factors enables our model to explain a number of stylized facts concerning behavior within the Federal Reserve's Fedwire fund and securities systems around a major policy change. In particular, the model captures the different responses of the two systems in both the pattern of settlement and the use <b>of</b> intraday <b>liquidity.</b> The results map out how policy interacts with participants' incentives to influence the use <b>of</b> intraday <b>liquidity</b> and the resultant credit exposure of a central bank. The model, therefore, can inform decision-making at central banks. Banks and banking, Central; Interbank market; Clearing of securities...|$|R
