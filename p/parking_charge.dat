Most of the park is a National Nature Reserve; large parts are also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is often locally called [...] "the largest urban park in Europe", however {{this is not true}} as this title belongs to Serra de Collserola.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Parking</b> <b>charges</b> is {{a widely}} used and {{effective}} means to improve parking demand management. Based on the structural equation theory, the model about the influence factors related to the acceptability of <b>parking</b> <b>charges</b> was established. Eight factors were selected for the modeling, including problem perception, willingness, perceived effectiveness, perceived benefits, perceived freedom, perceived fairness, social norms and accountability. And a survey of two charging schemes was undertaken in Nanjing concerning influence factors of the acceptability. Model verification and path coefficient test were conducted based on the established structural equation model by AMOS. It is indicated that the most significant factors affecting the acceptability of <b>parking</b> <b>charges</b> measure are perceived effectiveness and willingness. Finally, according to the conclusions, the suggestions of improving acceptability of <b>parking</b> <b>charges</b> were presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{optimization}} of <b>parking</b> <b>charges</b> and <b>parking</b> supply {{over the}} time of a day is an important problem {{in the design of}} transportation networks. This paper presents a bilevel model to determine the optimal time-varying <b>parking</b> <b>charges</b> and <b>parking</b> supply in road networks with multiple user classes and different types of parking facilities. The upper level of the model aims to maximize the network net benefit in response to the <b>parking</b> <b>charges</b> and <b>parking</b> supply, whereas the lower level is a time-dependent network equilibrium problem with elastic demand. A descent-gradient-based solution algorithm is adapted to solve the model. The numerical results show that the implementation of time-varying <b>parking</b> <b>charges</b> and <b>parking</b> supply is useful to effectively cater to the time-varying demand with different parking needs. The model provides a powerful tool for strategically designing parking locations and evaluating various parking policies. © 2007 Tsinghua University Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
