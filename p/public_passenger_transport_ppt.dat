40|$|Modern {{approach}} to transportation system research {{is based on}} the system theory. System analysis is relevant. Constant transportation technique and technology devel-opment caused by the need of conformation to the new market conditions is the basis for such an approach. The model approach for resolving the problems of public pas-senger transport is provided in a scientific report. The model of quality of passenger transport comprises the submodels which define relevant measures for the provi-sion of passenger transport quality. The synthesis of sub-model for adoption of quality standards, submodel of pas-senger demands, submodel of operation safety and securi-ty and economic submodel construct the model of quality of <b>public</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> (<b>PPT).</b> Its evaluation has been carried out using SWOT analysis.

The paper shows how DEA {{can be applied to the}} quality control of <b>public</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> (<b>PPT)</b> networks. A PPT line in the network is seen as a Decision Making Unit (DMU) which achieves a certain level of efficiency, where quality is viewed from the perspective of users. DEA is used to determine optimal quality parameters, thus helping to define the total cost of PPT lines, or the total shortfall in funds and the subsidies needed for the normal operation of the public transport network...|$|E
40|$|The European {{standard}} (EN 13816), {{is one of}} {{the widely}} accepted standards for measuring the quality of <b>public</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> (<b>PPT)</b> service. EN 13816 indicates 8 measurement criteria, 29 sub-criteria and 193 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to be used to measure the performance of railway operators. Nowadays, there are other addition criteria beyond EN 13816, developed by various organisations. This research firstly aims to explore the service performance measurement of railway operators used by actual railway operators at international level and in Thailand. After an intensive review of performance measurement standards, 9 standards are compiled and compared in terms of criteria, sub-criteria and KPIs using a cluster analysis methodology. The result found additional performance measurement aspects at 2 sub-criteria and 91 KPIs in addition to EN 13816.

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>Passenger</b> <b>Transport</b> (<b>PPT)</b> is {{very often}} {{associated}} with subsidies in almost all countries in the world”. When consider Sri Lanka, as a developing country, this statement is true with the PPT for Rural communities. Rural Passenger Services are making loss due to different reasons. As {{a result of this}} fact private bus owners are reluctant to operate bus services in uneconomic rural routes. But as an agricultural base country, over 70 % of Sri Lanka’s population lives in rural areas. Therefore rural passenger transport services are very important for the commercial, industrial, social and educational activities in rural communities and such services can provide several benefits to the rural societies. The National Transport Commission (NTC) is implementing the project called “Gamisariya” to subsidize the identified uneconomic rural routes. Under this project transport services are provided for more than 1014 rural villages and for more than 77000 rural passengers. The objective of the study was “To find out social & economical benefits created by “Gamisariya” project to the rural communities and to find out whether operators get sufficient subsidy amount to provide a reliable service to the villages. ” To achieve the objective following methods were used to collect data;  Interview with bus passengers/villagers and operators in selected routes  Interview with village committees who investigate the service.  Discussion with the officers in NTC who are involving with Gamisariya Project. According to the results of analysis, the Gamisariya Rural Bus service (GRBS) Programme has increased the number of social and economical trips of the rural people. Further, the villagers are gaining more income for their production due to less transportation cost and higher volume of production. The project has higher economic benefit level to the society and road development and increasing land value are some indirect benefits that have been taken place due to the project. Although several advantages are gained through this project the operators are not provided subsidies on time and some operators are not provided enough subsidy amounts to maintain their services. G. R. B. S has a significant impact on school trips of the children in selected villages and employment trips of the people. Further, to provide more useful service the time table of GRBS is needed to be coordinated with the timetables of buses, trains which have a grater demand from the passengers...|$|E

The CO 2 emissions of <b>public</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> in Tianjin from 1995 to 2010 are estimated with IPCC CO 2 counting method, which shows that the total CO 2 emissions of Tianjin <b>public</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> have gradually become stable at 1, 425. 1 thousand tons. And then the CO 2 emissions of the buses, taxies, and rail transits are calculated respectively. A CO 2 emission of 829. 9 thousand tons makes taxies become the largest CO 2 emissions source among the <b>public</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> in Tianjin. Combining with passenger volume, this paper analyzes the CO 2 emissions proportion of the buses, taxies, and rail transits compare the <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> rate with the proportion of CO 2 emissions, as well as the CO 2 emissions change of per 10, 000 people. The passenger volume proportion of bus among the three public means of transport is 72. 62 % which is much higher than its CO 2 emissions proportion of 36. 01 %, with the minimum number of CO 2 emissions per 10, 000 people of 4. 90 tons. The countermeasures to reduce CO 2 emissions of <b>public</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>transport</b> in Tianjin are to develop rail transit, update vehicles and use alternative fuel vehicles...|$|R
