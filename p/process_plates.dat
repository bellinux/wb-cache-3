40|$|Abstract. Two {{series of}} {{bioactive}} and biodegradable composite materials consisting of particulate β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and its copolymer polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) were produced and investigated for bone tissue repair.

In the <b>process,</b> <b>plates</b> of composites containing 10 %, 20 %, 30 % or 40 % by volume of micro-sized TCP particles were successfully injection moulded for both TCP/PHB and TCP/PHBV composites.

Such systems combine continuous operation with strongly coupled features of heat transfer, hydrodynamics, mixing, mass transfer and reaction that makes the choice of the optimal solution a difficult one. The present paper offers a comparison and a characterisation of heat exchanger-reactors manufactured in different materials: stainless steel and silicon carbide for the <b>process</b> <b>plates,</b> aluminium, stainless steel and silicon carbide for the utility plates.

Next, osteotomy was performed from the sigmoid notch to the posterior border of the mandible. After resection of the condyle segment, the crystal mass was carefully dissected from the surrounding structure including the internal maxillary artery, pterygoid muscles, and mandibular nerve (Fig.  2). After excision of the mass, the segmented condyle was anatomically repositioned with the pre-drilled plate and screws (Fig.  3). After the operation, the condyle segment was successfully repositioned and the patient showed normal jaw movement and mouth opening. The patient showed transient weakness of the facial nerve.

40|$|The use of heat exchanger/reactors (HEX/reactors) is a {{promising}} way {{to overcome the}} barrier of poor heat transfer in batch reactors. However to reach residence time long enough to complete the chemistry,low Reynolds number has to be combined with both a plug flow behaviour and the intensification of heat and mass transfers. This work concerns the experimental approach used to characterize an innovative HEX/reactor. The pilot is made of three <b>process</b> <b>plates</b> sandwiched between five utility plates. The process stream flows in a 2 mm corrugated channel. Pressure drop and residence time distribution characterizations aim at studying the flow hydrodynamics. Identified Darcy correlations point out the transition between laminar and turbulent flow around a Reynolds number equal to 200. Moreover the flow behaves like a quasi-plug flow (Pe > 185). The heat transfer and mixing time have also been investigated. The ratio between the reaction kinetics and the mixing time is over 100 and the intensification factor ranges from 5000 to 8000 kW m− 3 K− 1. As a consequence, no limitations were identified which allows the implementation of an exothermic reaction. It has been successfully performed under severe temperature and concentration conditions, batchwise unreachable. Thus, it highlights the interest of using this continuous HEX/reactor...|$|E

In 2007 Tingleff and Britton {{were part of a}} much larger exhibition END, which had ben coordinated over some years between 7 British and Scandinavian artists. It was shown first in Copenhagen at the Kunstindustrimuseet and then at Bomuldsfabriken Kunsthall, Arendal,Norway. For Unforeseen Events, working out of sight of each other’s researches (hence the title) both were engaged with material risks in making fresh discoveries in form and surface, and an investigation of the breadth of expression achievable with a limited palette of pigment and glaze. Allusions to tableware were common to both, beyond the context of function. Tingleff’s six huge rectangular plates, e. g. 170 x 92 cm, painted with slips and glaze, were wall mounted on shelves. Britton’s fifteen pieces were smaller in scale and greater in formal variety, occupying two expansive tables/plinths. The significance and innovation of this series of pots in the commitment she shows to stretching the idea of the container, was rooted in the following: Ongoing glaze experiments, fluidity, transparency, altering slips underneath.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is {{concerned}} with growth of low dimensional materials {{in a variety of}} morphologies which have potential renewable energy generation applications. The work described within demonstrates synthesis methods for the production of materials with thermoelectric applications and materials for photovoltaic purposes. Products are characterised using a range of techniques including: scanning and transmission electron microscopy; energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. Presented here is an investigation into the growth of bismuth telluride on silicon surfaces via chemical vapour deposition (CVD). Resultant particle morphology is reported in relation to experimental conditions such as surface conditions (silicon, gold/palladium on silicon and disordered silicon surfaces), temperature and reagent concentration. Successful synthesis of Bi 2 Te 3 plates is presented starting from elemental precursors via a closed vessel CVD <b>process.</b> <b>Plates</b> with sub-micron thickness (but up to 40 μm diameter) are produced template free on a silicon surface and without the need for transport gases or expensive precursors. Using modification of silicon surfaces the growth of 2 - 4 μm tetragonal pyramids of Bi 2 Te 3 are demonstrated. CVD is also used to produce bismuth rich nanowires up to 40 μm but < 100 nm in diameter, these were produced by increasing the bismuth concentration in comparison to other methods. This thesis also details an investigation into the suitability of a range of substrates for CVD. Alumina is demonstrated to be a suitable surface for Bi 2 Te 3 CVD with nanostructured Bi 2 Te 3 spheres of 5 - 20 μm diameter presented. Additionally vertically aligned arrays of copper telluride are presented using a single step CVD process. Arrays consist of hexagonal plates < 500 nm in thickness but up to 25 μm in diameter. Due to preferential reaction with tellurium GaAs is demonstrated to be a poor facilitator for Bi 2 Te 3 growth as is cobalt. The production of nanostructured sphere of TiO 2 is also presented. Spheres with tuneable diameter are produced in < 60 s in multi-mode microwave reactors using a hydrothermal process. The spheres are comprised of radially aligned nanorods producing spheres of 1 - 3 μm. Spheres are demonstrated to be a single rutile TiO 2 phase. Spheres are characterised with phase, band gap and morphology presented and influence of experimental parameters such as time and reagent concentration is discussed. 2 Finally this work investigates the doping and conversion of TiO 2 structures to TiN and TiO 2 -xNx structures. Using ammonolysis TiO 2 is converted to a TiN structure while retaining its original its original spherical morphology. Using the same ammonolysis process TiO 2 is doped and the demonstrational shift in band gap to the visible region is presented...|$|E
