40|$|Color {{printing}} {{is traditionally}} achieved by separating an input image into four channels (CMYK) and binarizing them using halftoning algorithms, {{in order to}} designate the locations of ink droplet placement. Multi-channel printing means a reproduction that employs additional inks other than these four in order to augment the color gamut (scope of reproducible colors) and reduce undesirable ink droplet visibility, so-called graininess. One aim of this dissertation has been to characterize a <b>print</b> <b>setup</b> in which both the primary inks CMYK and their light versions are used. The presented approach groups the inks, forming subsets, each representing a channel that is reproduced with multiple inks. To halftone the separated channels in the present methodology, a specific multilevel halftoning algorithm is employed, halftoning each channel to multiple levels. This algorithm performs the binarization from the ink subsets to each separate colorant. Consequently, the print characterization complexity remains unaltered when employing the light inks, avoiding the normal increase in computational complexity, the one-to-many mapping problem {{and the increase in}} the number of training samples. The results show that the reproduction is visually improved in terms of graininess and detail enhancement. The secondary color inks RGB are added in multi-channel printing to increase the color gamut. Utilizing them, however, potentially increases the perceived graininess. Moreover, employing the primary, secondary and light inks means a color separation from a three-channel CIELAB space into a multi-channel colorant space, resulting in colorimetric redundancy in which multiple ink combinations can reproduce the same target color. To address this, a proposed cost function is incorporated in the color separation approach, weighting selected factors that influence the reproduced image quality, i. e. graininess and color accuracy, in order to select the optimal ink combination. The perceived graininess is modeled by employing S-CIELAB, a spatial low-pass filtering mimicking the human visual system. By applying the filtering to a large dataset, a generalized prediction that quantifies the perceived graininess is carried out and incorporated as a criterion in the color separation. Consequently, the presented research increases the understanding of color reproduction and image quality in multi-channel printing, provides concrete solutions to challenges in the practical implementation, and rises the possibilities to fully utilize the potential in multi-channel printing for superior image quality...|$|E

30|$|The general {{procedure}} for preparing a printing sample is as follows. First, the 3 D numerical model was transited to the STL files. Second, the STL files {{were put into}} the Objet Studio software to create a 3 D model. To distinguish different components of the heterogeneous model, each component, such as matrix and gravel, was put in independent STL files. From this, the Objet Studio software automatically assembled the whole model {{in accordance with the}} location coordinates of the parts. Third, the material properties were accordingly assigned to the matrix and particles in line. Using the Objet Studio, we were able to set the additional printing parameters, such as the material properties of contact surfaces and the thickness of supporting materials, in order to finalize the <b>printing</b> <b>setup.</b> In this study, we adopted the transparent photopolymer Vero Clear to print the matrix, and white RGD to print the gravel. In the hydrofracturing experiment, an open hole was required to inject water that would fracture the sample. Therefore, the light type lattice supporting material Fullcure 705 was employed to form the open hole without fillings. The supporting material features low-transparency, loose structure, low intensity, and can be physically removed or washed through high-pressure water easily after the sample is prepared. In the end, all the data of the model were transmitted to the 3 D printer. Consequently, two types of cylindroid samples were printed, which are shown in Fig.  2 c and denoted as type (i) and (ii). The samples were 54  mm in diameter and 108  mm in length. A 4 -mm-diameter vertical hole was left {{at the center of the}} sample with a length of 54  mm. In addition, all the surfaces of the samples were polished to make the inner structure available for observation.|$|R

50|$|Artists {{generally}} use {{inkjet printing}} to make reproductions {{of their original}} two-dimensional artwork, photographs, or computer-generated art. Professionally produced inkjet prints are much more expensive on a per-print basis than the four-color offset lithography process traditionally used for such reproductions. (A large-format inkjet print can cost more than $50, not including scanning and color correction, compared to $5 for a four-color offset litho print of the same image in a run of 1,000.) Four-color offset lithographic presses have the disadvantage of the full job having {{to be set up}} and produced all at once in a mass edition. With inkjet printing the artist does not {{have to pay for the}} expensive <b>printing</b> plate <b>setup</b> or the marketing and storage needed for large four-color offset print runs. This allows the artist to follow a just-in-time business model in which inkjet printing can be an economical option, since art can be printed and sold individually in accordance with demand. Inkjet printing has the added advantage of allowing artists to take total control of the production of their images, including the final color correction and the substrates being used, and it is even feasible for individual artists to own and operate their own printers.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Point-of-care testing (POCT) is an emerging technology {{which can lead to}} an eruptive change of lifestyle and medication of population against the traditional medical laboratory. Since living organisms are intrinsically flexible and malleable, the flexible substrate is a necessity for successful integration of electronics in biological systems that do not cause discomfort during prolonged use. Isotropic conductive adhesives (ICAs) are attractive to wearable POCT devices because ICAs are environmentally friendly and allow a lower processing temperature than soldering which protects heat-sensitive components. Vertical interconnections and optical interconnections are considered as the technologies to realise the miniaturised high-performance devices for the future applications. This thesis focused on the multifunctional integration to enable both electrical and optical vertical interconnections through one via hole that can be fabricated in flexible substrates. The functional properties of the via and their response to the external loadings which are likely encountered in the POCT devices are the primary concerns of this PhD project. In this thesis, the research of curing effect on via performance was first conducted by studying the relationship between curing conditions and material properties. Based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis results, two-parameter autocatalytic model (Sestak-Berggren model) was established as the most suitable curing process description of our typical ICA composed of epoxy-based binders and Ag filler particles. A link between curing conditions and the mechanical properties of ICAs was established based on the DMA experiments. A series of test vehicles containing vias filled with ICAs were cured under varying conditions. The electrical resistance of the ICA filled vias were measured before testing and in real time during thermal cycling tests, damp heat tests and bending tests. A simplified model was derived to represent rivet-shaped vias in the flexible printed circuit boards (FPCBs) based on the assumption of homogenous ICAs. An equation was thus proposed to evaluate the resistance of the model. Vias with different cap sizes were also tested, and the equation was validated. Those samples were divided into three groups for thermal cycling test, damp heat ageing test and bending test. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to aid better understanding of the electrical conduction mechanisms. Based on theoretical equation and simulation model, the fistula-shape ICA via was fabricated in flexible PCB. Its hollow nature provides the space for integrations of optical or fluidic circuits. Resistance measurements and reliability tests proved that carefully designed and manufactured small bores in vias did not comprise the performance. Test vehicles with optoelectrical vias were made through two different approaches to prove the feasibility of multifunctional vertical interconnections in flexible substrates. A case study was carried out on reflection Photoplethysmography (rPPG) sensors manufacturing, using a specially designed optoelectronic system. ICA-based low-temperature manufacture processes were developed to enable the integration of these flexible but delicate substrates and components. In the manufacturing routes, a modified stencil <b>printing</b> <b>setup,</b> which merges two printing-curing steps (vias forming and components bonding) into one step, was developed to save both time and energy. The assembled probes showed the outstanding performance in functional and physiological tests. The results from this thesis are anticipated to facilitate the understanding of ICA via conduction mechanism and provide an applicable tool to optimise the design and manufacturing of optoelectrical vias...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} scheduling production activities in a real-life printing industry. The problem is modeled as a two-stage flexible flow shop problem with minimization of the makespan {{and the number of}} tardy jobs as the objective. Discrete event simulation has been performed using Extend simulation software to depict the real time model of the <b>print</b> industry. The <b>setup</b> time, processing time and completion time of the prioritized customers were obtained and validated with the real time industry inputs. After validation, the output of simulation data has been used to perform preliminary scheduling experiments. This paper deals with the comparison of three scheduling algorithms such as earliest completion time first (ECT), Earliest start time first (EST) and PCmax algorithm for the calculation of maximum occupancy time of various printing jobs. The results obtained using PC max shows the reduced make span of the printing jobs compared to other two algorithms with approximately 12 % improvement in minimizing the makespan. Hence the P||Cmax scheduling method can be implemented in the industry to minimize the maximum occupancy time of a particular printing machine.

40|$|Italy has {{possibly}} the most respected design community worldwide. "Made In Italy" products {{are known for their}} quality, functionality and elegance. But as a country, Italy is not as competitive in the large scale manufacturing of these products compared to oversea economies. 3 D printers are bound to change all of that, shifting the manufacturing landscape from the production of many copies of identical objects to a market for unique, personalized designs. 3 D <b>printing</b> requires no <b>setup</b> for producing different objects, so personalization comes at no cost. More importantly, printing time and cost are not related to surface complexity, allowing the production of highly detailed objects, with details within the 0. 1 millimeter range. Multimaterial printers and hydrographics can combine materials of different optical and mechanical properties on the same object, allowing the fabrication of objects whose properties change at each surface location. While printing hardware is evolving rapidly, design software is not taking advantage of these new capabilities, in particular the ability to mix materials at a sub-millimeter scale. Throughout this project, we will investigate scalable algorithms to design surfaces with patterns of predictable appearance and mechanical properties.

40|$|For a robot manipulator, an {{accurate}} reference tracking capability {{is one of}} the most important performance factor. This is especially the case for a robot which is deployed for an industrial use such as welding and laser cutting. Recently, an emerging application of 3 D printing also attracts researchers to use robotic manipulators in hope of gaining a higher dimension in the printing process as well as a larger workspace. The conventional method for controlling robot manipulator involves a model based feed-forward controller to eliminate the nonlinearities such as gravity and the coriolis term, combined with a feedback controller to compensate the residual error. This method, however, has a drawback in obtaining a good model of the robot. Furthermore, a robot's physical properties are subject to change over time due to, for instance, degraded gearboxes, etc. Such a problem will require the robot to re-perform a system identification which is often unacceptable due to the time it takes and the possibly dangerous movement the robot must execute. Therefore, this class of controller may not be the best option for such condition. This thesis addresses the aforementioned problem from the point of view of model-free, learning controller which improves the tracking performance safely in an online fashion. The thesis exploits the reinforcement learning (RL) technique which uses the nature of trial and errors to correct the tracking error. Improvement to the control performance is done by feeding an additive compensation signal given by a learned policy function to the robot's nominal controller. Two different compensation methods are proposed in the thesis. Both methods are realized by the so called actor-critic (AC) algorithm in order to cope with the continuous state of a robot arm. The first method compensates the control input of the nominal controller while the second method modifies the reference trajectory. The methods are implemented on a real 6 DoFs 3 D <b>printing</b> robotic <b>setup.</b> For the test, three different reference tracking tasks are designed and executed. Furthermore, to provide a comparative study, two conventional control methods namely model predictive control (MPC) and iterative learning control (ILC) are implemented as well. Their results are then analysed and compared to that of the proposed RL-based controllers. The experimental result shows that the RL-based controllers improve the performance of the nominal control significantly. It is also shown that the performance of the learning controller is close to that of the model-based control method. For a circular, smooth trajectory, the experiment even shows that the RL-based controller is able to outmatch both MPC and ILC performance.
