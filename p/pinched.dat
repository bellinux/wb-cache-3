In serious cases, the <b>pinched</b> nostrils make breathing even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog could pass out from blocked airways. If this happens, one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not surgery is needed to modify the breathing passages.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the race. This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he <b>pinched</b> the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E
5|$|By 1977, Greene was {{the captain}} of the Steelers defense, {{although}} his reduced effectiveness over the previous two seasons due to injuries led to rumors that he was washed up. He was never again able to attain the same success as a pass rusher after his <b>pinched</b> nerve in 1975. Spurred by the rumors, he returned in 1978 to lead all Pittsburgh linemen in tackles, and he had four sacks and a career-high five fumble recoveries. The Steelers defense allowed a league-low 195 points during the season, en route to a 35–31 victory over the Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII. In that contest, Greene had one of Pittsburgh's five sacks of Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} intra-rater, inter-rater, and inter-instrumental {{reliability}} of the digitalized <b>pinch</b> muscle strength dynamometer. Method Th irty normal subjects were examined for <b>pinch</b> strength, using both the Preston <b>pinch</b> gauge and the digitalized <b>pinch</b> dynamometer. The participants performed all <b>pinch</b> strength tests in the seated position as recommended by the American Society of Hand Th erapists (ASHT). Th ree successive measurements were taken for each hand. Th e mean of the three trials was used for data analysis. Th e <b>pinch</b> strength tests performed used a repeated measure design and measurements were taken by each rater. Results The relationship between the Preston <b>pinch</b> gauge and the digitalized <b>pinch</b> dynamometer in <b>pinch</b> strength was reliable (the ICC were 0. 821 and 0. 785 in rater 1 and rater 2 respectively). Th e relationship between the fi rst session and second session in <b>pinch</b> strength using the digitalized <b>pinch</b> dynamometer was reliable (the ICC were 0. 872 and 0. 886 in rater A and rater B respectively). Th e relationship between rater A and rater B in <b>pinch</b> strength using the digitalized <b>pinch</b> dynamometer was reliable (the ICC was 0. 754). Conclusion The <b>pinch</b> strength measurement using the digitalized <b>pinch</b> dynamometer is reliable within the rater and between raters. Th us, the Preston <b>pinch</b> gauge and the digitalized dynamometer measure grip strength equivalently, {{and can be used}} interchangeably...|$|R
40|$|<b>PINCH</b> is a five LIM domain protein {{involved}} in the regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. It {{has been shown that}} <b>PINCH</b> interacts with integrin-linked kinase and Nck 2. Here we describe a new isoform of <b>PINCH,</b> which we call <b>PINCH</b> 2. Therefore, we rename <b>PINCH</b> to <b>PINCH</b> 1. <b>PINCH</b> 2 has an overall similarity of 92 % to <b>PINCH</b> I and contains five LIM domains like <b>PINCH</b> I. While protein and gene structure of the <b>PINCH</b> homologues are very similar and well conserved during evolution, we observed differential expression pattern of the mRNAs. Based on northern hybridization of mouse embryo RNA, <b>PINCH</b> I is already detectable at E 8. 5. It is highly expressed during later stages of development and in all adult mouse tissues analyzed, with the highest levels in heart, lung, bladder, skin, and uterus. In contrast, significant <b>PINCH</b> 2 expression starts at E 14. 5. In adult mice it is widely expressed, similar to <b>PINCH</b> I, but absent from spleen and thymus. In situ hybridization confirmed the Northern data and showed differential expression of <b>PINCH</b> 1 and <b>PINCH</b> 2 in embryonic intestine. Finally, we demonstrate that <b>PINCH</b> 2 localizes to focal adhesions in NIH 3 T 3 cells and to Z-disks in primary rat cardiomyocytes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Tyrannosaurids walked {{exclusively}} on their hindlimbs, so their leg bones were massive. In {{contrast to the}} forelimbs, the hindlimbs were longer compared to body size {{than almost any other}} theropods. Juveniles and even some smaller adults, like more basal tyrannosauroids, had longer tibiae than femora, a characteristic of fast-running dinosaurs like ornithomimids. Larger adults had leg proportions characteristic of slower-moving animals, but not to the extent seen in other large theropods like abelisaurids or carnosaurs. The third metatarsals of tyrannosaurids were <b>pinched</b> between the second and fourth metatarsals, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Bickford {{was sold}} to the Baltimore Orioles for an {{undisclosed}} amount of cash and catcher Charlie White. The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox were both interested in Bickford's services, but general manager John Quinn decided to go with Baltimore's offer. He only played one game, a start against the Chicago White Sox on April 24. He gave up five runs, four of them earned, in four innings before being credited with the 14–4 loss. A <b>pinched</b> nerve in his throwing arm and eventual elbow surgery shortened his career. In 1955, he unsuccessfully tried a brief comeback with the Triple-A Richmond Virginians in the International League. He pitched in nine games before retiring due to complications of his arm injuries.|$|E
40|$|Individuals often <b>pinch</b> with {{preferred}} <b>pinch</b> techniques {{based on}} their experience and familiarity. However, researchers believe that <b>pinch</b> force exertions are not comparable across different <b>pinch</b> techniques. Hence, {{it is possible to}} <b>pinch</b> objects with incompatible <b>pinch</b> techniques during manual handling. This increases risks of developing musculoskeletal disorders. The preceding problem substantiates the need for a comprehensive understanding of definitions, categorisations and capacities of different <b>pinch</b> techniques. Nevertheless, the knowledge on <b>pinch</b> techniques appears to be highly dispersed and not compiled to a level systematic enough for further research. Thus, this review aims to develop a consolidated theoretical groundwork on <b>pinch</b> techniques. It presents an anthology of terminologies, previous findings and concepts underpinning different <b>pinch</b> techniques. While much research is still required, it is believed that an improved understanding on <b>pinch</b> techniques is now within sight, due to, in part, a structured review of their definitions, classifications and capacities...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how the posture of the thumb while performing common <b>pinch</b> movements and {{the levels of}} <b>pinch</b> force applied by the thumb affect the arthrokinematics of the trapeziometacarpal joint in vivo. Fifteen subjects performed the <b>pinch</b> tasks at the distal phalange (DP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, and metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint of the index finger with 0 %, 50 %, and 80 % of maximal <b>pinch</b> forces by a single-axis load cell. 3 D images of the thumb were obtained using the computed tomography. The {{results show that the}} reference points moved from the central region to the dorsal-radial region when changing from <b>pinching</b> the DP to the MP joint without <b>pinching</b> force being applied. <b>Pinching</b> with 80 % of the maximum <b>pinching</b> force resulted in reference points being the closest to the volar-ulnar direction. Significant differences were seen between 0 % and 50 % of maximum <b>pinch</b> force, as well as between 0 % and 80 %, when <b>pinching</b> the MP joint in the distal-proximal direction. The effects of posture of the thumb and applied <b>pinch</b> force on the arthrokinematics of the joint were investigated with a 3 D model of the trapeziometacarpal joint. <b>Pinching</b> with more than 50 % of maximum <b>pinch</b> force might subject this joint to extreme displacement...|$|R

The following day Morton noticed a bucket filled with water and burning coal outside Laing's house; he thought it was there to cast a spell on him. Laing had a reputation as a witch having already appeared before the Kirk session in 1696 for charming. Morton immediately felt weak and had difficulty standing or walking. His health deteriorated; he began to have fits and convulsions, his stomach became distended and his body was rigid and twisted. People claimed they could see marks left on his skin by fingernails where Morton said he had been <b>pinched.</b> He refused food and his breathing was laboured.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{participated in}} a five-man {{gauntlet}} match for the number one contender's spot for the WWE Championship on April 11 episode of Raw, but was eliminated by R-Truth.

Truth accepted, and lost the match, making Morrison the new number one contender. At Extreme Rules, R-Truth interfered in the match, attacking Morrison and preventing him from winning the match. The next night on Raw, Morrison was attacked by Truth again, prior to a scheduled match between the two which did not happen as a result. Morrison then underwent surgery to correct a legitimately <b>pinched</b> nerve in his neck.|$|E
5|$|Similar figurines {{of women}} with phallus heads from the Neolithic period have been found across Greece, Macedonia and parts of old Yugoslavia. The vast {{majority}} of the figurines of the Hamangia culture have cylindrical phallus-shaped heads without facial features, although some, particularly of the Aegean culture, had phallic sculptural pieces with phallic heads with a <b>pinched</b> nose and slitty eyes. In these parts of the ancient world, obelisk like structures resembling the human penis were built, often with phallic symbols, representing human fertility and asserting male sexuality and orgasm. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architecture of ancient Babylonia, and in Khametian iconography, the obelisk was considered to be symbolic of the phallus of the masculine earth. The obelisks of ancient Egypt themselves had several functions, existing both as a reference to the cultus of the sun and of the phallus, representing fertility and power.|$|E
40|$|Repetitive, high-force <b>pinch</b> grip exertions {{are common}} in many {{occupational}} activities. The goal {{of the current study}} was to quantify the relationship between lateral <b>pinch</b> grip span (distance between thumb and index finger) and lateral <b>pinch</b> grip strength. An experiment was conducted in which 40 participants performed maximal lateral <b>pinch</b> grip exertions at 11 levels of grip span distances (0, 10 %, [...] . 100 % of maximum functional lateral <b>pinch</b> grip span distance). The results show a significant effect of lateral <b>pinch</b> grip span, with strength at the maximum functional lateral <b>pinch</b> grip span 40 % higher than that found at the smallest lateral <b>pinch</b> grip span considered. Between these two endpoints, strength increased monotonically with increasing <b>pinch</b> grip span. The application of these results in <b>pinch</b> grip design criteria for both high-force and long-duration exertions is discussed.

5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is <b>pinched</b> open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E
5|$|Greene missed {{four games}} in 1975 {{due to a}} <b>pinched</b> nerve, {{snapping}} a streak of 91 straight games started since he entered the league. In December 1975, {{he and the other}} members of the Steel Curtain appeared on the cover of Time magazine. After leading the Steelers to another Super Bowl win after the 1975 season over the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl X, Greene missed the first several games of the 1976 season with a back injury. The Steelers started off the season 1–4 and looked like they would not make the playoffs. Quarterback Terry Bradshaw was also injured and was replaced by rookie Mike Kruczek. Greene returned and the Steelers defense carried the team to nine-straight wins and the playoffs. With a defense considered one of the best in NFL history, the 1976 Steelers held opponents to an average of less than 10 points per game (138 points over 14 games). During their nine-game winning streak, the Steelers defense recorded five shutouts, including three straight, and surrendered a total of 28 points (roughly 3 points per game). The defense allowed only two touchdowns over nine games. The Steelers were defeated by the Raiders in that year's AFC championship game.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{resulting}} properties of memristors and memristive systems is {{the existence of a}} <b>pinched</b> hysteresis effect. For a current-controlled memristive system, the input u(t) is the current i(t), the output y(t) is the voltage v(t), and the slope of the curve represents the electrical resistance. The change in slope of the <b>pinched</b> hysteresis curves demonstrates switching between different resistance states which is a phenomenon central to ReRAM and other forms of two-terminal resistance memory. At high frequencies, memristive theory predicts the <b>pinched</b> hysteresis effect will degenerate, resulting in a straight line representative of a linear resistor. It has been proven that some types of non-crossing <b>pinched</b> hysteresis curves (denoted Type-II) cannot be described by memristors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hands are {{important}} tools for manual work. Although researchers have identified {{factors that influence}} the grip efforts of an entire hand, {{there appears to be}} limited research concerning the use of different <b>pinch</b> techniques and how they affect the performance of <b>pinch</b> effort. Therefore, the aim for this pilot study is {{to determine the effects of}} different <b>pinch</b> techniques on <b>pinch</b> effort. A total of 110 manual workers from a wooden pallet manufacturing firm participated in this study, which involved an experiment and survey to investigate the most preferred <b>pinch</b> technique applied on screw knobs. The techniques used were the 3 -jaw chuck, pulp- 2 and lateral <b>pinch.</b> A total of 6 screw knobs of different shapes and sizes were used. After the data were collected, descriptive and Cronbach's alpha reliability analyses were carried out. The results show that the preferred <b>pinch</b> technique for the small cylindrical knob, small sphere knob and all large knobs is the lateral <b>pinch.</b> However, the 3 -jaw chuck <b>pinch</b> is preferred for the small 5 -lobes knob. This study provides preliminary information for further research on <b>pinch</b> techniques and their influences on the <b>pinching</b> outcomes of individuals...|$|R
40|$|Background: Data on the {{physical}} strength capabilities are essential for design-ing safe and usable products and are useful {{in a wide range}} of clinical settings especially during treatment of disease affecting the function of the hand. The purpose of this study was to determine peak lateral <b>pinch</b> strength, key <b>pinch</b> strength, tip-to-tip <b>pinch</b> strength and three-jaw <b>pinch</b> strength exertions in a healthy Iranian children and young adult population. Methods: The study was conducted among 511 participants (242 males and 269 females) aged 7 - 30 years. Measurements were carried out with both dominant and non-dominant hands in standard sitting posture using a B&L <b>pinch</b> gauge. Two repetitions of each strength measurement were recorded for each condition and the average value of the two trials was used in the subsequent analysis. Results: The results showed significant differences in the <b>pinch</b> strength data in terms of the age, gender and hand dominance. The lateral <b>pinch</b> strength, key <b>pinch</b> strength, tip-to-tip <b>pinch</b> strength and three-jaw <b>pinch</b> strength exertions by females were 68. 4 %, 68. 8 %, 78. 8 % and 81. 8 % of those exerted by males, respectively. Strength exertions with the non-dominant hand were 6. 4 %, 5. 2 %, 6. 6 % and 5. 1 % lower than strength exertions of the dominant hand for the lat-eral <b>pinch</b> strength, key <b>pinch</b> strength, tip-to-tip <b>pinch</b> strength and three-jaw <b>pinch</b> strength exertions, respectively. Conclusion: These findings can be used to fill the gaps in strength data for Iranian population...|$|R

Recently, interest has developed in the accuracy of integrin-associated <b>PINCH</b> protein expression in human cancers as a predictive marker of tumour status. The goal {{of this study was}} to define the expression of <b>PINCH</b> protein in PDA. MethodsHuman PDA samples and orthotopic tumours from a murine model were analysed by immunohistochemistry for <b>PINCH</b> expression. In the animal model, <b>PINCH</b> expression was compared between primary and metastatic tumours. In the human samples, <b>PINCH</b> expression was correlated with stage, nodal involvement, margin status and overall survival. ResultsIn the murine model, there was greater <b>PINCH</b> expression in metastatic tumours than in primary tumours. In the human PDA samples, greater staining for <b>PINCH</b> in the tumour cells was correlated with higher T status. Additionally, high <b>PINCH</b> expression in the stroma was associated with decreased overall survival. ConclusionsFindings of increased <b>PINCH</b> protein in more advanced stages of human PDA, as well as in metastatic tumours in the animal model, support the hypothesis that <b>PINCH</b> is an important controller of cell survival and migration. Additionally, the importance of the differential expression of <b>PINCH</b> in the human tumour and stroma warrants further evaluation...|$|R
