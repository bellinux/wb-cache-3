Members of this genus {{are known for}} their overwhelming repertoire of natural products, which has been exploited for almost a century as a source of medicines and agrochemicals. Notwithstanding intense scientific and commercial interest in Streptomyces natural products, surprisingly little is known of the intra- and/or inter-species ecological roles played by these metabolites. In this report we describe the chemical structures, biological properties, and biosynthetic relationships between natural products produced by Streptomyces isolated from internal tissues of predatory Conus snails, collected from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Using chromatographic, spectroscopic and bioassays methodology, we demonstrate that Streptomyces isolated from five different Conus species produce identical chemical and antifungal profiles – comprising a suite of <b>polycyclic</b> tetramic <b>acid</b> macrolactams (PTMs). To investigate possible ecological (and evolutionary) relationships we used genome analyses to reveal a close taxonomic relationship with other sponge-derived and free-living PTM producing Streptomyces (i. e., Streptomyces albus). In-depth phylogenomic analysis of PTM biosynthetic gene clusters indicated PTM structure diversity was governed by a small repertoire of genetic elements, including discrete gene acquisition events involving dehydrogenases. Overall, our study shows a Streptomyces-Conus ecological relationship that is concomitant with specific PTM chemical profiles. We provide an evolutionary framework to explain this relationship, driven by anti-fungal properties that protect Conus snails from fungal pathogens...|$|R

In this study we describe the bactericidal mode of action of salivaricin B against susceptible Gram-positive bacteria. The killing action of salivaricin B required micro-molar concentrations of lantibiotic whereas the prototype lantibiotic nisin A was shown to be potent at nano-molar levels. Unlike nisin A, salivaricin B did not induce pore formation or dissipate the membrane potential in susceptible cells. This was established by measuring the fluorescence of the tryptophan residue at position 17 when salivaricin B interacted with bacterial membrane vesicles. The absence of a fluorescence blue shift indicates a failure of salivaricin B to penetrate the membranes. On the other hand, salivaricin B interfered with cell wall biosynthesis, {{as shown by the}} accumulation of the final soluble cell wall precursor UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide which is the backbone of the bacterial peptidoglycan.

40|$|Naphthenic acids are {{a diverse}} group of {{saturated}} mono- and <b>polycyclic</b> carboxylic <b>acids</b> that may account for as much as 10 - 12 weight % of crude oil. During production at several newer oil fields, there have been discoveries of oil that have very high acid and calcium content. This indicates that there are some naphthenic acids bound to calcium as calcium naphthenates present in the oil, and that these are oil-soluble. Oil-soluble calcium naphthenates can cause problems during refinery, as the calcium present can lead to fouling and catalytic deactivation. The coke and fuel quality will also be affected. The removal of calcium in the refinery can be an expensive and comprehensive process, which results in the suppliers getting a lower price on their crude oil. In this master thesis, naphthenic acids from non-soluble calcium naphthenates have been isolated by using an ion exchanger method and a Solid Phase Extraction-method. The work also consisted of neutral and acidic washing of the samples, measurements of water-content, Ca-content and total acid numbers. The different phases from the isolations have also been analyzed by using FT-IR Spectroscopy, APPI-MS and ESI-MS for characterization to see if the naphthenic acids bound to calcium differ from other acids. The naphthenic acids that are bound to calcium in the crude oil have a higher average molecular weight than the other naphthenic acids, at 875 and 580 g/mole respectively. This result was confirmed by TAN-measurements and APPI-MS of samples after isolation with the Acid-IER method. The correlation between the TAN-measurements and the results from APPI-MS suggest that the acids can be characterized as monoacids. They do not have a particular molecular weight, but have a broad distribution between 150 and 2000 g/mole. It seems that the calcium naphthenate formation is controlled by the total amount of acids in the oil, their molecular weight and pH, and not as much on structure as first were presumed...|$|R

A total of 20 quartz filter samples were collected on a 12 h basis using a high-volume sampler and were analyzed using a GC/MS technique. Levoglucosan was the major most abundant single component with an average value of 306 ng. m - 3, followed by saturated and unsaturated carboxylic acids and sugars with average values of 234 and 118 ng. m- 3, respectively. Reported values for other carboxylic <b>acids,</b> <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons, and biogenic secondary organic aerosols (BSOA) were 87, 33 and 21 ng. m- 3, respectively. Compared to a similar field campaign conducted in summer 2011, levoglucosan concentrations were lower in summer by a factor of 6, due to the use of wood burning for residential heating in winter. Concentrations of saturated and unsaturated carboxylic acids, other carboxylic acids, and BSOA were higher in summer by a factor of 3, 2, and 7, respectively. Higher concentrations observed for BSOA and other dicarboxylic acids during summer are due to higher biogenic emissions and greater photochemical activity in summer.

40|$|The organic {{fraction}} of black crusts from Saint Denis Basilica, France, {{is composed of}} a complex mixture of aliphatic and aromatic compounds. These compounds were studied by two different analytical approaches: tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) thermochemolysis in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and solvent extraction, fractionation by silica column, and identification of the fraction components by GC-MS. The first approach, feasible at the microscale level, is able to supply fairly general information {{on a wide range}} of compounds. Using the second approach, we were able to separate the complex mixture of compounds into four fractions, enabling a better identification of the extractable compounds.

The daily reconstructed dust levels were correlated with levels of particulate matter ≤ 2. 5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 2. 5; r = 0. 68) or PM 10 (r = 0. 73 – 0. 93) reported from 26 September through 8 October 2001 at four of six sites near the WTC whose data we examined.

The transition of these compounds between gas and particulate phase may significantly change the aerosol particles radiative properties, the heterogeneous chemical properties, and, naturally, the total particulate mass concentration. To better assess these time-dependent effects, three intensive field experiments were conducted in 2008 – 2009 at the Central European EMEP research station Melpitz (Germany) using an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS). Data coverage from all seasons highlighted organic matter as being the most important particulate fraction during summertime, while the nitrate fraction was more prevalent in winter. The variation in particulate nitrate was inherently linked to the gas-to-particle-phase equilibrium of ammonium nitrate, which depends on ambient temperature and relative humidity. During short episodes immediately after dawn, the particulate nitrate seems to disobey this dependency so that additional local nitrate formation, such as from HONO photolysis is needed as an explanation. During the summer 2008 's experiment, a remarkable diurnal evolution in the oxidation state of the organic matter became evident, which could be correlated to hydroxyl radical (OH) and ozone concentrations indicating photochemical transformation process. In summer, the organic particulate matter seems to be heavily influenced by regional secondary formation and transformation processes, facilitated by photochemical production processes {{as well as a}} diurnal cycling of the substances between the gas and particulate phase. In winter, these processes were obviously much weaker, so that organic matter apparently originated mainly from aged particles and long range transport...|$|R

Different analytical techniques were applied to characterize the mineralogical composition of the damage layers, investigate the deposition of atmospheric particles, measure the anion concentrations, and identify and quantify the carbon components. The results showed that the black deposits on the surfaces of the Iranian monuments considered are mainly microbiotic crusts produced by cyanobacterial growth.

However, {{little is known about}} the concentrations, seasonal patterns, ambient chemical formation/destruction and source/receptor relationships that govern the individual compounds present in this complex organic mixture. The objective of the present research is to characterize the particulate organic compounds present in source emissions and in ambient air and to use those data to evaluate methods for computing source contributions to ambient pollutant concentrations. Airborne fine particulate matter samples collected at 4 urban sites within the Los Angeles basin during 1982 were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. More than 100 individual organic compounds were identified. Primary organic aerosol constituents including n-alkanes, n-alkanoic <b>acids,</b> <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons, hopanes, and steranes reveal a seasonal pattern with high winter and low summer concentrations. Aliphatic dicarboxylic acids possibly formed by atmospheric reactions show a reverse pattern, with high concentrations in late spring/early summer. Next, fine particulate emissions from major urban sources were characterized. The sources tested were responsible for more than 80 % of the fine carbonaceous aerosol emitted to the Los Angeles atmosphere. The identification of organic compounds that act as markers for the presence of effluents from particular source types was emphasized. It was found that fossil petroleum compounds such as hopanes and steranes can be used to trace vehicular fine particulate emissions in the urban atmosphere, iso- and anteiso-alkanes are useful tracers for cigarette smoke, cholesterol is a likely tracer for meat smoke aerosol, C 29 - C 33 odd carbon number n-alkanes can be used to estimate airborne vegetative detritus concentrations, and certain resin acids can be used to track wood smoke aerosols. The source emission data have been used along with an atmospheric transport model to calculate primary source contributions to the concentrations of single particle-phase organic compounds in the Los Angeles atmosphere. The predicted and measured concentrations of stable primary organic compounds agree well. This indicates that a nearly complete knowledge of source/receptor relationships for many particle-phase primary organic compounds has been achieved for the first time. The model predictions indicate that aliphatic dicarboxylic and aromatic polycarboxylic acids measured in the urban atmosphere are indeed the products of atmospheric chemical reactions...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{numerous}} studies demonstrate the increasing relevance of biomass combustion emissions {{as a source}} of atmospheric particles in urban environments in Europe, especially during winter, when the domestic burning of wood logs, briquettes, chips and pellet represents an important renewable energy source. Biomass burning activities are significant emission sources for particulate matter (PM), contributing for a relevant share to the total PM 2. 5 and PM 10 emitted, which may contain numerous toxic/carcinogenic components with a potentially high impact on human health. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the contributions from biomass burning (BB) to fine organic aerosol is essential for the planning of efficient PM abatement strategies. This work investigates the contribution of residential wood combustion in urban and rural sites in Emilia Romagna (Northern Italy) during five intensive experimental campaigns held in fall/winter through the 2011 - 2014 years, {{as a part of the}} of the “Supersito” project. A comprehensive study was conducted on daily samples to investigate the concentrations of several individual polar and apolar organic compounds related to emissions from wood combustion. Of these individual compounds, levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan were found to be the dominant species as the most specific tracers. Other abundant compounds included low-molecular-weight carboxylic <b>acids,</b> <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons and methoxylated phenols.

In spite of strongly changing meteorological conditions and absolute concentration levels of particulate matter (3 ? 13 ?g m ? 3 PM 1), OM 1 was closely correlated with PM 1 (r 2 = 0. 9) indicating a near-constant ratio of non-refractory organics and inorganics. In contrast, the ratio of nitrate to sulfate was highly dependent on temperature (14 ? 32 °C) and relative humidity (20 ? 100 %), which {{could be explained by}} thermodynamic model calculations of NH 3 /HNO 3 /NH 4 NO 3 gas-particle partitioning. From the combination of optical and other sizing techniques (OPC, AMS, SMPS), an average refractive index of 1. 40 ? 1. 45 was inferred for the measured rural aerosol particles. The average ratio of OM 1 to OC 2. 5 was 2, indicating a high proportion of heteroelements in the organic fraction of the sampled rural aerosol. This is consistent with the high ratio of oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) over hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) inferred from the AMS results (4 : 1), and also with the high abundance of proteins (~ 3 %) indicating a high proportion of primary biological material (~ 30 %) in PM 2. 5. Moreover, the low abundance of PAHs (? 3) and EC (? 3) in PM 2. 5 confirm a low contribution of combustion emissions, which are usually also major sources for HOA. Slightly enhanced HOA concentrations indicating fresh anthropogenic emissions were observed during a period when air masses were advected from the densely populated Po Valley, Italy. Detection of several secondary organic aerosol compounds (dicarboxylic acids) and their precursors (monoterpenes) confirmed the finding that secondary aerosol from natural sources was an important aerosol constituent. A sharp decrease of the short lived monoterpenes indicated that during night-time the measurement station was isolated from ground emission sources by a stable inversion layer. Nighttime values can therefore be regarded to represent regional or long range transport. New particle formation was observed almost every day with particle number concentrations exceeding 10 4 cm ? 3 (nighttime background level 1000 ? 2000 cm ? 3). Closer inspection of two major events indicated that ternary H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O/NH 3 nucleation triggered particle formation and that condensation of both organic and inorganic species contributed to particle growth...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} of the chemical and microphysical properties of rural continental aerosols were performed during the HAZE 2002 experiment, which was conducted in May 2002 at the Meteorological Observatory Hohenpeissenberg (DWD) in Southern Germany. The online measurement data and techniques included: size-resolved chemical composition of submicron particles by aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS); total particle number concentrations and size distributions over the diameter range of 3 nm to 9 &mu;m (CPC, SMPS, OPC); monoterpenes determined by gas chromatography- ion trap mass spectrometry; OH and H 2 SO 4 determined by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). Filter sampling and offline analytical techniques were used to determine: fine particle mass (PM 2. 5), organic, elemental and total carbon in PM 2. 5 (OC 2. 5, EC 2. 5, TC 2. 5), and selected organic compounds (dicarboxylic <b>acids,</b> <b>polycyclic</b> aromatic hydrocarbons, proteins).
