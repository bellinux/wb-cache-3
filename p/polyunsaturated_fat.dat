5|$|Poultry {{meat and}} eggs provide nutritionally {{beneficial}} food containing protein of high quality. This {{is accompanied by}} low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about {{two to three times}} as much <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> as most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out {{on the effects of}} <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> on lipid {{metabolism}} in 11 patients with hypertriglyceridemia. During cholesterol balance studies performed in eight patients, the feeding of <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fats,</b> as compared with saturated fats, caused an increased excretion of endogenous neutral steroids, acidic steroids, or both in most patients. Increases in steroid excretions were marked in some patients and generally exceeded the decrement of cholesterol in the plasma compartment. The finding of a greater excretion of fecal steroids on <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> in hypertriglyceridemic patients contrasts to the lack of change in sterol balance previously reported for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia; however, other workers have found that <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> also enhance steroid excretion in normal subjects. In most of the patients, simultaneous studies {{were carried out}} on biliary lipid composition, hourly outputs of biliary lipids, and pool sizes of bile acids. In several but not all patients, fasting gallbladder bile became more lithogenic after institution of <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fats.</b> This increased lithogenicity was not due to a decrease in bile acid pools; in no case was the pool decreased by <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fats.</b> On the other hand, two patients showed an increased output of biliary cholesterol, and frequently there was an increase in fecal neutral steroids that were derived from cholesterol; thus, <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> may increase bile lithogenicity in some patients through mobilization of cholesterol into bile. Reductions in plasma cholesterol during the feeding of <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> was seen in most patients, and these changes were usually associated with a decrease in concentration of plasma triglycerides. In fact, the degree of cholesterol lowering was closely correlated with the extent of triglyceride reduction. Therefore, in hypertriglyceridimec patients <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> may contribute to cholesterol reduction by changing the metabolism of triglycerides or very low density lipoproteins. The findings of changes in the metabolism of cholesterol, bile acids, and triglycerides in the patients of this study suggests that <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> may cause a lowering of cholesterol through multiple mechanisms, and it seems unlikely that a single action can explain all the effects of these fats on the plasma lipids...|$|R

Another 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found no association between saturated fat consumption and all-cause mortality, CHD, CHD mortality, ischaemic stroke or type 2 diabetes in healthy adults. It also found no benefit from reduced fat, including saturated fat, on myocardial infarction, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.
