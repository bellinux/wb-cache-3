40|$|BACKGROUND: Management of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> is {{associated}} with considerable morbidity (15 - 25 %). Traditionally, <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> have been drained because of the perceived risks of complications including infection, rupture or haemorrhage. We have adopted a more conservative approach with drainage only for uncontrolled pain or gastric outlet obstruction. This study reports our experience. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 36 patients with <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> were treated over an 11 -year period in one district general hospital serving a population of 310, 000. This study group comprised of 19 men and 17 women with a median age of 55 years (range, 10 - 88 years). Twenty-two patients had a preceding attack of acute pancreatitis whilst 12 patients had clinical and radiological evidence of chronic pancreatitis. The aetiology comprised of gallstones (16), alcohol (5), trauma (2), tumour (2), hyperlipidaemia (1) and idiopathic (10). RESULTS: All patients were initially managed conservatively and intervention, either by radiological-assisted external drainage or cyst-enteric drainage (by surgery or endoscopy), was only performed for persisting symptoms or complications. Patients treated conservatively had 6 monthly follow-up abdominal ultrasound scans (USS) for 1 year. Fourteen of the 36 patients (39 %) were successfully managed conservatively, whilst 22 patients required intervention either by percutaneous radiological drainage (12), by endoscopic cystogastrostomy (1) or by open surgical cyst-enteric anastomosis (9). Median size of the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> in the 14 patients managed conservatively (7 cm) was nearly {{similar to that of}} the 22 patients requiring intervention (8 cm). The most common indications for invasive intervention in the 22 patients were persistent pain (16), gastric outlet obstruction (4), jaundice (1) and dyspepsia with weight loss (1). Although one patient required surgery for persistent pain, no other patients required urgent or scheduled surgery for complications of untreated <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts.</b> Two of the 12 patients treated by percutaneous radiological drainage had recurrence of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> requiring surgery. Two patients developed an intra-abdominal abscess following cyst-enteric drainage of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> and one patient had a pulmonary embolism. On the mean follow-up of 37. 3 months, one patient with alcoholic pancreatitis died 5 months after surgical cyst-enteric bypass. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that many patients with <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> can be managed conservatively if presenting symptoms can be controlled...|$|R

Surgery Gynecology & Obstetrics 173, 111 m 174. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> (PP) that fail to resolve spontaneously are optimally treated by internal drainage to a viscus. Pseudocysts adherent to the stomach are usually drained by way of cystgastrostomy. Recent experience with giant pseudocysts> 15 centimeters), however, challenges this approach. Fifty-two patients with <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> of various sizes were treated from 1982 to 1986 at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Twenty-eight PP were suitable for internal drainage. The postoperative complication rate was directly proportional {{to the size of the}} pseudocyst. Four patients had giant PP, three of which occurred after an attack of acute pancreatitis. All four were treated by cystgastrostomy. Three of four patients with giant pseudocysts had life-threatening postoperative complications as a result of incomplete emptying of the cyst, and two patients died. No evidence of anastomotic leakage could be demonstrated by upper gastrointestinal series or computed tomographic scans. Transgastric drainage tubes in these three instances were not protective. We conclude that cystgastrostomy may not be appropriate for the treatment of giant <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> because it fails to provide dependent drainage of a large cyst cavity. If internal drainage is performed, the cyst should be anastomosed to a defunctionalized loop of jejunum in a dependent position.

40|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> {{may appear}} as sequellae of acute or chronic {{pancreatitis}} or pancreatic trauma. Endoscopic drainage of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> {{was introduced in}} the nineteen eighties. Three different types of drainage can be performed: transpapillary, transmural, and rendezvous techniques. Classic transgastric or transduodenal drainage of pseudocysts can be performed only when a bulging lesion is seen on endoscopy. Endosonography (EUS) provides essential information prior to endoscopic drainage of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts,</b> leading to a change in therapy in one third of patients. With diagnostic EUS, interposed vessels, too large distance between pseudocyst and digestive lumen, and suspicion of neoplasic lesions can be identified, leading to a change in management. To increase the success rate of endoscopic drainage of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts,</b> interventional EUS seems to be very helpful. Interventional EUS offers the possibility to drain non-bulging pseudocysts and abscesses. Various methods to drain <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts</b> by using EUS guidance {{have been reported in the}} literature. The first generation of interventional echo endoscopes provided only a 2 mm working channel and required reintroduction of a therapeutic duodenoscope over the guide wire to place the catheter. Today, several echo-endoscopes with working channels of at least 2. 8 mm allow one step cyst drainage procedures with placement of 8. 5 and 10 French stents or nose-cystic catheters. Endoscopic ultrasound guided pseudocyst drainage can have complications such as bleeding, perforation, infection, and stent migration. Haemorrhage, which is the main complication of endoscopic drainage of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts,</b> occurs in 6 - 15 % of cases. The use of colour Doppler ultrasonography and balloon dilation of the drainage site may minimize the risk of vascular perforation during puncture. Bleeding at the puncture site is usually mild and rarely requires surgical intervention. Perforation of the peritoneal cavity is uncommon and usually responds well to conservative treatment. The placement of multiple stents and routine use of prophylactic antibiotics minimize the risk of infection. Difficulty in obtaining a specimen of the cyst wall is a limitation of the endoscopic procedure...|$|R
5000|$|Pancreatic pseudocysts {{are often}} caused by acute or chronic pancreatitis. They {{may also be}} caused by trauma to the abdomen, with a higher {{frequency}} in children. Pseudocysts are more often present in chronic pancreatitis patients than acute pancreatitis patients. Also, if the pancreatitis is alcohol induced, there is {{a higher incidence of}} pseudocysts. These alcohol-related pseudocysts account for 59%-78% of all pancreatic pseudocysts. Actual <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocyst</b> incidence is small, at around 1.6%-4.5%, or [...]5-1 per 100,000 adults per year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocyst</b> {{treatment}} {{should be}} aimed at avoiding any complication (1 in 10 cases become infected). They also tend to rupture, and have shown that larger cysts have a higher likelihood to become more symptomatic, even needing surgery. If no signs of infection are present, initial treatment can include conservative measures such as bowel rest (NPO), parenteral nutrition (TPN), and observation. Serum amylase levels can be trended. If symptoms do not improve by 6 weeks, surgical intervention may be appropriate.|$|E
5000|$|Symptomatic {{pancreatic}} pseudocysts are {{an indication}} a cystogastrostomy {{needs to be}} performed. Pancreatic pseudocysts are chronic collections of pancreatic fluid encased by a wall of nonepithelialized granulation tissue and fibrosis. They {{can be caused by}} leakage of the pancreatic duct, or as a result of inflammatory pancreatitis. Symptoms of this include abdominal bloating, difficulty eating and digesting food, and constant pain or deep ache in the abdomen. A lump can be felt in the middle or left upper abdomen if a pseudocyst is present. To further diagnose a <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocyst</b> an abdominal CT scan, MRI or ultrasound can be used. [...] Emergency surgery may need to be performed if there is a rupture of the pseudocyst. This can be detected from symptoms of bleeding, shock, fainting, fever and chills, rapid heartbeat, or severe abdominal pain.|$|E
40|$|Haemorrhage {{is a rare}} but {{frequently}} fatal {{complication of}} <b>pancreatic</b> <b>pseudocysts.</b> The high mortality associated with pancreatic haemorrhage makes prompt and aggressive management essential.
