40|$|<b>Prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> {{tackling}} health-compromising behaviours {{have the}} potential {{to play a major role}} in reducing the burden of noncommunicable diseases in Europe and other areas of the world. However, in Europe, no prior evaluation is required for the implementation of <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions,</b> thus leading to widespread dissemination of potentially ineffective or harmful interventions. A central, transparent, evidence-based, context-aware, and research-oriented approval process for behavioural <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> is likely to foster the implementation and dissemination of effective interventions in Europe. Similarly to medicine approval systems, such a new approval process could be based on four consequential phases evaluating the effect of the following: single components (phase 1); combinations of components (phase 2); the final intervention—comprising only components found effective in the previous phases—via large, multicentre, randomized trials whenever possible (phase 3); and the long-term effects as well as the effects in different contexts (phase 4). Once phase 3 shows convincing results, the intervention would be approved for delivery to its target population. An approval process for behavioural <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> is likely to lead to positive consequences both for practice, by strengthening the role and impact of prevention in times of limited economic resources, and for research, by promoting the robust evaluation of all promising <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions...</b>|$|R

Objective: to explore older people's perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to participation in fall <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> in the UK. Methods: we undertook a qualitative study with older people who had taken part in or declined to participate in fall <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> using semi-structured interviews (n = 65), and 17 focus groups (n = 122) with older people (including 32 Asian and 30 Chinese older people).

40|$|Abstract Background Injuries are a {{major cause}} of {{mortality}} and morbidity which together result in avoidable societal costs. Due to limited resources, injury <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> need to demonstrate cost-effectiveness to justify their implementation. However, the existing knowledge in this area is limited. Consequently, a systematic review is needed to support decision-making and to assist in the targeting of future research. The aim of this review is to critically appraise the published economic evidence of injury <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> at the municipal level. Methods A search strategy was developed to focus a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and NHS EED. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were economic evaluations of injury <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> that could be implemented by municipalities; had a relevant comparison group; did not include any form of medication or drug use; and were assessed as having at least an acceptable quality from an economic point of view. Articles were screened in three steps. In the final step, studies were critically appraised using a check-list based on Drummond's check-list for assessing economic evaluations. Results Of 791 potential articles 20 were accepted for inclusion. Seven studies showed net savings; four showed a cost per health score gained; six showed both savings and a cost per health score gained but for different time horizons and populations; and three showed no effect. The interventions targeted a range of areas such as traffic safety, fire safety, hip fractures, and sport injuries. One studied a multi-targeted community-based program. Only six articles used effectiveness data generated within the study. Conclusions The results indicate that there are injury <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> that offer good use of societal resources. However, {{there is a lack of}} economic evidence surrounding injury <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions.</b> This lack of evidence needs to be met by further research about the economic aspects of injury <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> to improve the information available for decision-making. </p...|$|R

40|$|Substance {{use among}} {{adolescents}} {{is a major}} cause of concern as it can compromise adolescents‘ health, defined in 1948 by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ―a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being‖ and may hinder adolescents from achieving the developmental transitions they are supposed to accomplish. Further, when individuals initiate substance use as adolescents, addiction is established more easily and quickly (Crews, He, & Hodge, 2007; Prokhorov et al., 2006) and individuals remain at greater risk for negative outcomes in the future even if they successfully stop using (Georgiades & Boyle, 2007; Meier et al., 2012; von Sydow, Lieb, Pfister, Höfler, &Wittchen, 2002). With substance use being a preventable behaviour, <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> have been implemented worldwide, mostly focused on demand reduction (Kulis, Nieri, Yabiku, Stromwall, & Marsiglia, 2007) and aimed at achieving some form of abstinence (Midford, 2009). Over recent years, efforts to determine whether <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> are effective have increased due to the growing demand for accountability of interventions in public health (Hillebrand & Burkhart, 2009). Programme evaluation, besides considering the positive and desirable effects from <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions,</b> should also taken into consideration its negative and undesirable effects (i. e. iatrogenic effects) (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA, 2012 a). Programme evaluation is the mechanism through which this judgment on efficacy can be made (Midford, 2000), and isan essential tool to enable policy makers and practitioners to decide which projects to fund and whether a particular intervention is worth continuing, adapting, or discarding (EMCDDA, 2012 a). However, in Europe, despite <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> now being systematically monitored by the majority of Member States (EMCDDA, 2009 a), prevention effectiveness remains poorly researched (EMCDDA, 2010) and very few <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> have actually been evaluated (EMCDDA, 2012 b). Thus, evaluation of <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> is urgently required to increase knowledge about how to enhance their intended effects and decrease the unintended, which in turn will contribute to future prevention interventions‘ success in reducing the prevalence of substance use among adolescents...|$|R

Many obesity <b>prevention</b> <b>interventions</b> belong to the agento-structural types of interventions, and account for {{the environment in which}} health behaviors occur, but they require a level of individual agency for behavioral change, including workplace design to encourage exercise and fiscal regulation of unhealthy foods or beverages.
