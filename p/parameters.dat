5|$|The <b>parameters</b> of {{this planet}} was {{initially}} very weakly constrained, with a period in excess of 8 years with a high eccentricity and a minimum mass of approximately two times the mass of Jupiter.

5|$|There {{are certain}} distributions, {{especially}} those with three or more <b>parameters,</b> whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space. Using maximum likelihood to estimate these <b>parameters</b> often breaks down, with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite, rendering the other <b>parameters</b> inconsistent. The method of maximum spacings, however, being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual likelihood points, does not have this issue, and will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions.|$|E

25|$|When declaring a function, a {{programmer}} can specify {{for one or}} more <b>parameters</b> a default value. Doing so allows the <b>parameters</b> with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, {{in which case the}} default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared <b>parameters,</b> explicit arguments are matched to <b>parameters</b> in left-to-right order, with any unmatched <b>parameters</b> {{at the end of the}} parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of <b>parameters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{the model}} must be time {{reversible}} and must approach the equilibrium nucleotide (base) frequencies at long times, each rate below the diagonal equals the reciprocal rate above the diagonal {{multiplied by the}} equilibrium ratio of the two bases. As such, the nucleotide GTR requires 6 substitution rate <b>parameters</b> and 4 equilibrium base frequency <b>parameters.</b> Since the 4 frequency <b>parameters</b> must sum to 1, there are only 3 free frequency <b>parameters.</b> The total of 9 free <b>parameters</b> is often further reduced to 8 <b>parameters</b> plus , {{the overall number of}} substitutions per unit time. When measuring time in substitutions (=1) only 8 free <b>parameters</b> remain.|$|E
50|$|Specifically, a shape <b>parameter</b> is any <b>parameter</b> of a {{probability}} distribution that {{is neither a}} location <b>parameter</b> nor a scale <b>parameter</b> (nor a function of either or both of these only, such as a rate <b>parameter).</b> Such a <b>parameter</b> must affect {{the shape of a}} distribution rather than simply shifting it (as a location <b>parameter</b> does) or stretching/shrinking it (as a scale <b>parameter</b> does).|$|R

25|$|Positional <b>parameters</b> are {{the typical}} ordered list of <b>parameters</b> that most {{programming}} languages use. All <b>parameters</b> {{may also be}} passed by using their name in an unordered way. A named-only parameter can only be passed by specifying its name (that is, it never captures a positional argument), and are indicated with a leading : character. Slurpy <b>parameters</b> (indicated by an * before the parameter name) are Perl 6's tool for creating variadic functions. A slurpy hash will capture remaining passed-by-name <b>parameters,</b> whereas a slurpy array will capture remaining passed-by-position <b>parameters.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{unconstrained}} MSSM {{has more}} than 100 <b>parameters</b> {{in addition to the}} Standard Model <b>parameters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Therefore, GTR (for four characters, as {{is often}} the case in phylogenetics) {{requires}} 6 substitution rate <b>parameters,</b> as well as 4 equilibrium base frequency <b>parameters.</b> However, this is usually eliminated down to 9 <b>parameters</b> plus , the overall number of substitutions per unit time.

40|$|The {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) {{boundary layer}} flow of a nanofluid past a stretching/shrinking sheet with velocity, thermal, and solutal slip boundary conditions is studied. Numerical {{solutions to the}} governing equations were obtained using a shooting method. The skin friction coefficient and the local Sherwood number increase as the stretching/shrinking <b>parameter</b> increases. However, the local Nusselt number decreases with increasing the stretching/shrinking <b>parameter.</b> The range of the stretching/shrinking <b>parameter</b> for which the solution exists increases as the velocity slip <b>parameter</b> and the magnetic <b>parameter</b> increase. For the shrinking sheet, the skin friction coefficient increases as the velocity slip <b>parameter</b> and the magnetic <b>parameter</b> increase. For the stretching sheet, it decreases when the velocity slip <b>parameter</b> and the magnetic <b>parameter</b> increase. The local Nusselt number diminishes as the thermal slip <b>parameter</b> increases while the local Sherwood number decreases with increasing the solutal slip <b>parameter.</b> The local Nusselt number is lower for higher values of Lewis number, Brownian motion <b>parameter,</b> and thermophoresis <b>parameter...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{this example}} the actual <b>parameter</b> for the formal <b>parameter</b> o is always p. As p {{is a free}} {{variable}} in the whole expression, the <b>parameter</b> may be dropped.

25|$|Here the Xi are the {{generalized}} forces {{corresponding to the}} external variables xi. The <b>parameters</b> Xi are independent {{of the size of}} the system and are called intensive <b>parameters</b> and the xi are proportional to the size and called extensive <b>parameters.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{coherency}} matrix is {{not easy}} to visualize, and it is therefore common to describe incoherent or partially polarized radiation in terms of its total intensity (I), (fractional) degree of polarization (p), and the shape <b>parameters</b> of the polarization ellipse. An alternative and mathematically convenient description is given by the Stokes <b>parameters,</b> introduced by George Gabriel Stokes in 1852. The relationship of the Stokes <b>parameters</b> to intensity and polarization ellipse <b>parameters</b> is shown in the equations and figure below.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} paragraph {{shows how}} melting temperature and thermodynamic <b>parameters</b> (ΔG° or ΔH° & ΔS°) {{are related to}} each other. From the observation of melting temperatures one can experimentally determine the thermodynamic <b>parameters.</b> Vice versa, and important for applications, when the thermodynamic <b>parameters</b> of a given nucleic acid sequence are known, the melting temperature can be predicted. It turns out that for oligonucleotides, these <b>parameters</b> can be well approximated by the nearest-neighbor model.|$|E

30|$|Concerning {{the error}} of the A <b>parameter,</b> the {{precision}} is not as demanding as the B <b>parameter</b> from the speech production point of view, and the estimation of the A <b>parameter</b> is less precise in practice.
