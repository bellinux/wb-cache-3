The Ludhiana Aerotropolis at Machhiwara is the country's second after the one at Durgapur. The Ludhiana Aerotropolis would be spread over 3500 acres, and about 2500 acres of this area would be developed in the first phase at a cost of Rs 2,000 crore. This would also include the process of land acquisition and construction of the airport. Bengal Aerotropolis had earlier signed a MoU with PSIDC for setting up an airport in Punjab, which also acted as the <b>project</b> <b>facilitator</b> for them.

This L-shaped 1100 sq ft garden is located by the mansion’s tennis courts {{and can be}} seen from E street. [...] The plot provides more than 55 varieties of vegetables along with fruits that are incorporated into meals made for the Obama family as well as invited guests. Another portion of the yields are donated to the local soup kitchen and the Food Bank Organization. There are 55 varieties of vegetables grown, including: arugula (rocket), cilantro (coriander), tomatillo, hot peppers, spinach, chard, collards, black kale, berries and lettuce. In addition to the seeds selected to be planted are twenty five heirloom seeds and ten different herbs such as anise hyssop and Thai basil. Former presidents' favorite produce will also be sown such as President Thomas Jefferson’s preferred vegetables “Brown Dutch and Tennis Ball lettuce, Prickly Seed spinach and Savoy cabbage” but beets will not be grown as President Obama does not like them. Along with the vegetable garden a beehive was added near the chef’s kitchen that is overseen by Charlie Brandts, a beekeeper and White House carpenter. Honey collected from the beehives has been used to brew White House Honey Ale. The contributing gardeners responsible for {{the early stages of the}} garden include the First Lady herself, White House Horticulturist Dale Haney, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, a team of chefs, and fifth graders from Bancroft Elementary School in Washington. These twenty-three fifth grader advocates, who have grown a garden at their school, helped with digging up the soil, planting, harvesting, and cooking the crops produced. <b>Project</b> <b>facilitator</b> Michelle Obama has made the vegetable garden a priority by requiring hands on assistance from all the family members. In May 2012, the First Lady published American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America, a book detailing her experiences with the Kitchen Garden and promoting healthy eating.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} human {{resource}} (HR) strategic business partnering {{has begun to}} gain acceptance as a practice for improving business performance. To add value to organizations, HR as a strategic business partner is expected to acquire and demonstrate the knowledge of requisite critical competencies. Literature review reveals that the studies addressing jointly the conceptual relationship between HR competencies and strategic partner role are limited. Therefore, this study investigated the HR strategic partner role as mediator by examining the mediating effect of {{its role in the}} relationship between HR competencies and organizational performance by adapting the Ulrich HR Role Model. The study also examined HR competencies such as strategic positioner, credible activist, credibility builder, change champion, HR innovator/integrator, technology proponent and <b>project</b> <b>facilitator</b> by adapting the Ulrich Human Resource Competency Survey (HRCS). The mediating effects and competencies were examined based on 215 HR professionals from 20 consolidated banks located in South-West Nigeria. A quantitative approach employing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 software was used for the analysis. The findings revealed that strategic partner role mediates six out of the seven HR competencies investigated, with <b>project</b> <b>facilitator</b> as an exception. There were 24 factors in the seven HR competencies studied. The top ten factors that emerged from the findings are from the domains of technology proponent, strategic positioner, credible activist and <b>project</b> <b>facilitator.</b> The findings also showed that from the seven HR competencies, only technology proponent and strategic positioner have contributed the most to the organizational performance. In the study, competencies have significant correlation with organizational performance. Besides that, the study has shown that top management should encourage HR professionals to demonstrate more of their technology proponent skills and continue to acquire skills to leverage social media tools to improve HR operations...|$|E

Collaboration {{addresses}} the ???knottiest??? {{of problems that}} society faces, and collaboration addressing natural resource management issues becomes as complex as the ecosystems collaborative groups affect. While collaborative processes have received more scholarly attention in recent years, relatively little work has investigated the nature of two key roles {{and the relationship between}} them: <b>project</b> managers and <b>facilitators.</b> My study focused on these topics and how they may influence outcomes in collaborative processes involving natural resource management issues. A data set that investigates all possible factors controlled by <b>project</b> managers and <b>facilitators</b> does not exist. Additionally, individual research methods carried risks and weaknesses that were unacceptable. Accordingly, I relied on multiple research methods. I utilized observation of collaborative meetings and interviews with <b>project</b> managers and <b>facilitators</b> to identify components of the collaborative process that improve outcomes in natural resource management. Observation of collaborative meetings provided opportunities to understand and witness various collaborative processes and the relationship between individuals in the <b>project</b> manager and <b>facilitator</b> roles. Interviews provided depth to individual reasoning and an opportunity to understand the intricacies of the relationship between <b>project</b> managers and <b>facilitators.</b> Through my research it became apparent that both <b>project</b> managers and <b>facilitators</b> view themselves as central to the collaborative process, which can cause tension between the individuals in each role.

The topological taxonomy, along with a study of its reliability, was described in an earlier article. The complementary semantic component is presented in this paper. In view of the greater subjectivity involved in the assessment of map content as compared to structure, this tool was expected to be significantly less reliable.

The major source of information {{comes in the form of}} anecdotal evidence from teachers, <b>project</b> <b>facilitators</b> and organisations (Gragert 2000, Carr 2001, Tate 1998, Robertson 1999). Other literature reviews and research that focus on the use of ICT in education have significant gaps in this area and yet it is increasingly promoted in educational policy and supported and promoted by education systems. This paper identifies and explores the extent and impact of educational technology in the context of collaborative online projects in a global educational community. A general identification of a wide range of local and international collaborative online projects and the groups/communities in which they operate, is followed by a closer look at a selection of case study projects. The case study projects have been selected for their potential to provide new perspectives on the role of technology in education and its potential impact on teaching and learning in a global context.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{test the}} impact of {{physician}} education and facilitator assisted office system interventions on cancer early detection and preventive services. DESIGN [...] A randomised trial of two interventions alone and in combination. SETTING AND SUBJECTS [...] Physicians in 98 ambulatory care practices in the United States. INTERVENTIONS [...] The education intervention consisted of a day long physician meeting directed at improving knowledge, attitudes, and skills relevant to cancer prevention and early detection. The office system intervention consisted of assistance from a <b>project</b> <b>facilitator</b> in establishing routines for providing needed services. These routines included division of responsibilities for providing services among physicians and their staff {{and the use of}} medical record flow sheets. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The proportions of patients provided the cancer prevention and early detection services indicated annually according to the US National Cancer Institute. RESULTS [...] Based on cross sectional patient surveys, the office system intervention was associated with an increase in mammography, the recommendation to do breast self examination, clinical breast examination, faecal occult blood testing, advice to quit smoking, and the recommendation to decrease dietary fat. Education was associated only with an increase in mammography. Record review for a patient cohort confirmed cross sectional survey findings regarding the office system for mammography and faecal occult blood testing.

The objective of this evidence-based practice (EBP) project was to answer the question: In school-aged children, how does school-based, structured, family-oriented physical activity education affect body mass index (BMI) compared to usual education over an eight week time period? The Stetler Model of EBP and the health belief model were used to guide this project in a rural, Northwest Indiana elementary school. For eight weeks, fourth and fifth grade students received an additional 30 minutes of classroom education per week about the importance of physical activity and suggestions for increasing daily physical activity using the“Wellness, Academics, and You” (WAY) program as well as other evidence-based materials. Students also participated in brief exercises led by the <b>project</b> <b>facilitator</b> in the classroom each week. Pre- and post-intervention BMIs were measured and compared.

40|$|Abstract. The {{conceptual}} card deck is a {{game for}} the collaborative construction of concept maps. It was developed at the Conéctate al Conocimiento Project of Panama as {{an easy way to}} introduce novice mappers to concept maps and propositional structure, with very little prior explanation of these notions. Though it has been used by some of the <b>Project’s</b> <b>facilitators</b> in teacher training workshops, as well as in follow-up visits to schools, this is the first attempt to methodically explore the benefits of its application. The present study’s results show that apprentice mappers were able, using the card game, to produce a complex concept map topologically, and of good semantic quality. Aside from providing a practical way to introduce concept mapping, results suggest it may have other benefits as well such as: 1) breaking away from the typical tree structures and one-root concept maps thus leading to a greater variety of map topologies; 2) stimulating the formation of cross-links in a natural manner; and 3) simultaneously promoting competitiveness and collaboration. ...|$|R
