5|$|Chadwick {{was still}} in Germany {{at the start of}} the First World War, and was interned in the Ruhleben {{internment}} camp near Berlin, where he was allowed to set up a laboratory in the stables and conduct scientific experiments using improvised materials such as radioactive toothpaste. With the help of Charles Drummond Ellis, he worked on the ionisation of phosphorus, and the <b>photochemical</b> <b>reaction</b> of carbon monoxide and chlorine. He was released after the Armistice with Germany came into effect in November 1918, and returned to his parents' home in Manchester, where he wrote up his findings over the previous four years for the 1851 Exhibition commissioners.|$|E

25|$|Many {{important}} processes involve photochemistry. The premier {{example is}} photosynthesis, {{in which most}} plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, disposing of oxygen as a side-product.

In fireflies, an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence. Many significant photochemical reactions, such as ozone formation, occur in the Earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry.|$|E

25|$|MOFs {{might prove}} useful for both {{photochemical}} and polymerization reactions {{due to the}} tuneability of {{the size and shape}} of their pores. A 3D MOF { • 4DMF • H2O} (bpdc: biphenyldicarboxylate, bpy: 4,4′-bipyridine) was synthesized by Li and coworkers. Using this MOF photochemistry of o-methyl dibenzyl ketone (o-MeDBK) was extensively studied. This molecule was found to have a variety of <b>photochemical</b> <b>reaction</b> properties including the production of cyclopentanol. MOFs have been used to study polymerization in the confined space of MOF channels. Polymerization reactions in confined space might have different properties than polymerization in open space. Styrene, divinylbenzene, substituted acetylenes, methyl methacrylate, and vinyl acetate have all been studied by Kitagawa and coworkers as possible activated monomers for radical polymerization. Due to the different linker size the MOF channel size could be tunable on the order of roughly 25 and 100 Å2. The channels were shown to stabilize propagating radicals and suppress termination reactions when used as radical polymerization sites.|$|E

The aim of this review is to illustrate this very fruitful interdisciplinary approach and cooperation. A profound understanding of the <b>photochemical</b> reactivity and <b>reaction</b> mechanisms is particularly helpful for optimization and application of these reactions. Some typical reactions and particular aspects are reported such as the Norrish-Type II reaction and the Yang cyclization and related transformations, the [2 + 2] photocycloadditions, particularly the Paternò–Büchi <b>reaction,</b> <b>photochemical</b> electron transfer induced transformations, different kinds of catalytic reactions such as photoredox catalysis for organic synthesis and photooxygenation are discussed.

5000|$|Photochromism {{does not}} have a {{rigorous}} definition, but is usually used to describe compounds that undergo a reversible <b>photochemical</b> <b>reaction</b> where an absorption band in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum changes dramatically in strength or wavelength. In many cases, an absorbance band is present in only one form. The degree of change required for a <b>photochemical</b> <b>reaction</b> to be dubbed [...] "photochromic" [...] is that which appears dramatic by eye, but in essence there is no dividing line between photochromic reactions and other photochemistry. Therefore, while the trans-cis isomerization of azobenzene is considered a photochromic reaction, the analogous reaction of stilbene is not. Since photochromism is just a special case of a <b>photochemical</b> <b>reaction,</b> almost any <b>photochemical</b> <b>reaction</b> type may be used to produce photochromism with appropriate molecular design. Some of the most common processes involved in photochromism are pericyclic reactions, cis-trans isomerizations, intramolecular hydrogen transfer, intramolecular group transfers, dissociation processes and electron transfers (oxidation-reduction).|$|E
