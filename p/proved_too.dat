5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even trying to take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the Eugene Guard {{became a}} daily newspaper. Charles H. Fisher {{took over the}} paper in 1907 and {{published}} it until 1912 when E. J. Finneran purchased the paper. Finneran bankrupted the newspaper in 1916, {{partly due to the}} purchase of a perfecting press that <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> expensive for such a small newspaper. The University of Oregon's journalism school briefly ran the paper during the receivership under the guidance of Eric W. Allen.|$|E

5|$|The Pigsty, a small gardeners shed {{located on}} The Orchard, has been {{preserved}} {{as the first}} campsite at Gilwell Park. The first group of Rover Scouts who arrived to prepare the site when it was purchased in 1919 slept here when the weather <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> bad to pitch their tents.|$|E
5|$|The club's first {{experience}} of Europe came in 1966–67 season when, {{helped by a}} clutch of Scandinavian players, United defeated Inter-Cities Fairs Cup holders FC Barcelona both home and away. Although Juventus <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> strong in the next round with a 3–1 aggregate victory, United made headlines {{and were asked to}} compete as Dallas Tornado in the United Soccer Association league in North America during the summer of 1967.|$|E
5|$|Viewers {{of early}} footage {{encouraged}} DiDuro to separate it further from Sonic, so he replaced rings with red leaves and altered the characters' abilities. Ziyo had drawn Lilac as a hedgehog, but DiDuro redesigned the character to be a dragon. Lilac's wall-jump ability {{was based on}} a similar game mechanic from Ristar. Originally, her level of energy was to be dependent on her speed, but this <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> difficult to control.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, {{in which}} pre-dreadnoughts <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> {{vulnerable}} against more modern battleships, Deutschland {{and her three}} surviving sisters were assigned to coastal defense duties. By 1917, they had been withdrawn from combat service completely, disarmed, and tasked with auxiliary roles. Deutschland {{was used as a}} barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven {{until the end of the}} war. She was struck from the naval register on 25 January 1920, sold to ship breakers that year, and broken up for scrap by 1922.|$|E
5|$|After the indecisive {{results of}} the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, Fidel Castro claimed that the {{increased}} cost of continuing to fight for South Africa had placed Cuba in its most aggressive combat position of the war, arguing that he was preparing to leave Angola with his opponents on the defensive. According to Cuba, the political, economical and technical cost to South Africa of maintaining its presence in Angola <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> much. Conversely, the South Africans believe that they indicated their resolve to the superpowers by preparing a nuclear test that ultimately forced the Cubans into a settlement.|$|E
5|$|As {{the program}} (and PAVN air defences) evolved, {{so did the}} relay aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> {{vulnerable}} and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which were to be remotely piloted, and which had undergone primary mission equipment and PME flight tests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during an operational mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.|$|E

5|$|Both Edmundston and Rimouski were {{fitted with}} about 60 light projectors: {{those on the}} hull were on {{retractable}} supports; those on the superstructure were on fixed supports. Each ship's diffused lighting system was tested systematically in St Margaret's Bay, and then trialled when actually escorting Atlantic convoys in 1943. Experimentally, the diffused lighting reduced the ships' visibility by up to 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> delicate, and frequently malfunctioned. Worse, the system was slow to respond to changes in background lighting, and the Canadian Navy considered the lighting too green.|$|E
5|$|Dial Square {{played their}} first match on 11 December 1886 against Eastern Wanderers {{on an open}} field on the Isle of Dogs, which they won 6–0. The club were renamed Royal Arsenal soon after, {{reportedly}} on Christmas Day. Initially the club played on Plumstead Common, but soon sought alternative homes, firstly the Sportsman Ground in Plumstead {{before moving to the}} adjacent Manor Ground in 1888. Unhappy with the Manor Ground's poor facilities, the club moved to the nearby Invicta Ground in 1890, before returning to the Manor Ground three years later as the Invicta Ground's rent <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> expensive.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, VAT {{had started}} to seek a {{stronger}} partner when it negotiated with AB Scania-Vabis. The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> expensive for VAT. This may have led the major owners of VAT to start discussions about merging VAT and SAT. The chairman of VAT held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in VAT and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was interested in co-operation with, or acquisition of, VAT. Valmet is also rumoured to {{have been interested in}} VAT but {{there is no evidence of}} concrete negotiations.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, German {{experiments}} with gold at a current of only 10µA demonstrated a relative uncertainty of 1.5%. Follow-on experiments using bismuth ions and a current of 30mA {{were expected to}} accumulate a mass of 30g in six days {{and to have a}} relative uncertainty of better than 1ppm. Ultimately, ionaccumulation approaches proved to be unsuitable. Measurements required months and the data <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> erratic for the technique to be considered a viable future replacement to the IPK.|$|E
5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} the {{headwaters}} of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the return route that they had chosen <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Bush's twelve-man {{military}} police unit {{arrived at the}} site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> great for the horses, so they resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. The horses were used for playing polo. Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects was a challenge. Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation, and to provide organized games and nightly movies.|$|E

5|$|On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, {{with four}} nuclear bombs aboard {{as part of}} Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while {{attempting}} an emergency landing at Thule Air Base, Greenland. The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination, the cleanup (Project Crested Ice) lasting until September of that year. Following closely on the Palomares incident, the cleanup costs and political consequences <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> high to risk again, so SAC ended the airborne alert program the following day.|$|E
5|$|The First Ostend Raid on 23 April 1918 {{was largely}} a failure, the blockships {{grounded}} {{too far from the}} channels to obstruct them. The second attempt also failed, due to heavy German resistance and British navigational difficulties in poor weather. In anticipation of a raid, the Germans had removed the navigation buoys and without them the British had difficulty finding the narrow channel into the harbour in poor weather. When they did discover the entrance, German resistance <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> strong for the operation to be completed as originally planned: the obsolete cruiser HMS Vindictive was sunk, but only partially blocked the channel.|$|E
5|$|The Muntz Street ground, then {{situated}} on Birmingham's eastern edge and bordered {{on two sides}} by farmland, opened in 1877. It was a field with terracing round it which provided standing accommodation for roughly 10,000 spectators. A wooden stand was built and the terracing raised to expand the capacity to around 30,000, but eventually it <b>proved</b> <b>too</b> small for the football club's needs. They built a new stadium nearer the city centre, St Andrew's, which hosted its first game in December 1906. Muntz Street, by then in a heavily built-up area, was demolished in 1907 and the land used for housing. The street {{of the same name}} remains.|$|E
