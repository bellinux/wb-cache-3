In early 2014, when asked whether Sasuke was good or evil, Kishimoto referred to him as a [...] "very pure person," [...] adding that while some of his actions, such as following his clan's ideals, are positive, his self-centered nature tends to cause problems for others. Before the series finale, Sasuke decides to leave on a solo journey. Kishimoto later explained that besides self-atonement, Sasuke also wanted to discover the origins of the series' final antagonist. However, Kishimoto decided not to explain this in the manga. For the spin-off focused on Sarada Uchiha, Sasuke and Sakura's daughter, Kishimoto wanted to explain how the couple was connected despite not being close as a result of Sasuke's mission which made him leave his village. The author also wanted to <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> the final scene of Uchiha family as for him that was the most important area of the spin-off.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the Confucian Academy {{can be divided into}} three phases. The first is the founding period (1930-1942). Chen Huanzhang (陳煥章), founded the Confucian Academy which focuses on preaching and sharing of the Confucian teachings. Followed by a period of consolidation (1942-1992), when Lu Xiangfu (盧湘父)and Huang Yuntian (黃允畋) have significant achievements in the educational aspects. Confucianism was also included as one of the Hong Kong's six major religions during that time. Then it is the expansion period (1992 - today). The academy <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> building Confucius statues and temples around the world, sponsoring and encouraging Confucius studies and organizing major seminars.|$|E
5000|$|Helena's {{situation}} became {{further complicated}} when John I Albert died in June 1501 and Alexander was elected {{as the new}} King of Poland in October 1501. The Polish nobility did not want an Orthodox queen and pressured her to convert. Polish nobles, including Bishop Erazm Ciołek and Cardinal Fryderyk Jagiellończyk, discussed the issue of royal divorce. From Pope Alexander VI they obtained Alexander's absolution from his marital oath and duties to Helena {{as well as from}} the promise to Ivan III not to force Helena to convert. The pope went further and ordered Alexander to <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> convincing Helena to convert. Despite their efforts, Helena did not convert and the royal couple remained close. When Kraków priests insulted Helena when she had an Orthodox service in one of the chapels of the Wawel Cathedral, Alexander wrote to his brother Fryderyk Jagiellończyk asking to discipline the priests. Alexander even gifted land near Minsk and Mogilev to Helena to assure her financial independence. Alexander was crowned as King of Poland in December 1501; as an adherent to the Eastern Orthodox beliefs, Helena was ineligible to become Queen of Poland and was never crowned. Officially she was only [...] "wife of Grand Duke of Lithuania" [...] but she referred to herself as queen. Alexander obtained a rescission of Pope Alexander's orders to convert her to Catholicism from Pope Julius II in August 1505.|$|E

Heckman and Kautz (2012) mention that dropout and study success are {{simultaneously}} influenced by cognitive and personality drivers and Borghans et al. (2006) indicate that the relationship between personality traits and cognitive skills can exist for two reasons. First, a positive attitude towards work and performance might cause people to do their best at tests (irrespective of the rewards offered) and therefore might partly makes that cognitive skill outcomes are upward biased. Second, people might have an attitude to <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> a task only when there are sufficient rewards but also have favorable behavioral or labor-market outcomes.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of innovation growing rapidly {{and having a}} shorter lifespan is a structural change due {{to the development of}} ICT (Information and Communications Technology), diverse investment methods, and reduced pattern of innovation adoption. For ICT companies to survive and maintain their success in this ever-changing environment, they need to succeed in fulfilling both productivity and accuracy of innovation. To sustain their innovative success, ICT companies should consistently maintain the direction of innovation towards consumers. The present study analyzes various cases of ICT companies which succeeded or failed to maintain their prior innovative success, and suggests consumer-centric innovation as a solution. To create consumer-centric innovations, companies have to (1) predict the dynamically evolving demand of consumers and continuously transform; (2) proactively employ observation method and big data analysis to discover hidden demands; and (3) identify hassles such as wastes, inconveniences, and anxieties, and <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> solving these hassles...|$|E

We find that, for religious parents, the higher is the fraction of religious peers, the more parents <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> transmitting their religiosity, indicating cultural complementarity.

40|$|The menisci fulfill key biomechanical {{functions}} in the tibiofemoral (knee) joint. Unfortunately meniscal injuries are quite common and most often treated by (partial) meniscectomy. However, some patients experience enduring symptoms, and, more importantly, it leads to an increased risk for symptomatic osteoarthritis. Over the past decades, researchers have <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> developing a meniscal substitute able to prevent osteoarthritis and treat enduring clinical symptoms. Grossly, two categories of substitutes are observed: First, a resorbable scaffold mimicking biomechanical function which slowly degrades while tissue regeneration and organization is promoted. Second, a non resorbable, permanent implant which mimics the biomechanical function of the native meniscus. Numerous biomaterials with different (material) properties {{have been used in}} order to provide such a substitute. Nevertheless, a clinically applicable cartilage protecting material is not yet emerged. In the current review we provide an overview, and discuss, these different materials and extract recommendations regarding material properties for future developmental research.
