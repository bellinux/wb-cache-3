25|$|Parque Vidal is <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> typical {{places in}} Cuba. During the afternoons, people (especially singles) visit {{the park to}} meet others. Although not widely practiced in recent times, the custom was to walk the park around and around. The women walk the inner part of the park, while the men walk the outer side. Another lost custom was for the locals {{to set up a}} {{platform}} and offer improvisations with their guitars on late Sunday afternoons. For that day they dressed with their Guayaberas and highly polished shoes.|$|E

25|$|St James Park, {{most likely}} named after its road frontage, is {{predominantly}} used for croquet, cricket and soccer. It is <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> beautiful {{parks in the}} city with tree lined walkways and gardens. The park {{in the heart of}} Papanui is probably the best location to see over-wintering monarch butterflies. On a warm sunny late autumn or early winter's day head to the children's play ground and look into the largely leafless old trees. There you will see monarchs clustering together often holding on to the remaining leaves for support. It ís a great spot for a picnic beneath the trees with monarchs fluttering in the air above.|$|E
25|$|There is {{not much}} known of Confucius's disciples, and a little over half of them had their {{surnames}} recorded in the Zuo Zhuan. The Analects records 22 names that are most likely Confucius's disciples, while the Mencius records 24 names, although it is quite certain {{that there have been}} many more disciples whose name were not recorded. Most of Confucius's disciples were from the Lu state, while others were from neighboring states. For example, Zigong was from the Wey state, and Sima Niu was from the Song state. Confucius's favorite disciple was Yan Hui, most <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> impoverished of them all. Sima Niu, in contrast to Yan Hui, was from a hereditary noble family hailing from the Song state. Under Confucius's teachings, the disciples became well-learned in the principles and methods of government. He often engaged in discussion and debate with his students and gave high importance to their studies in history, poetry, and ritual. Confucius advocated loyalty to principle rather than to individual acumen, in which reform was to be achieved by persuasion rather than violence. Even though Confucius denounced them for their practices, the aristocracy was likely attracted to the idea of having trustworthy officials who were studied in morals as the circumstances of the time made it desirable. In fact, the disciple Zilu even died defending his ruler in Wei.|$|E
500|$|Mn-SOD is {{the type}} of SOD present in {{eukaryotic}} mitochondria, and also in most bacteria (this fact is in keeping with the bacterial-origin theory of mitochondria). The Mn-SOD enzyme is <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide (...) , formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. The exceptions, which are all bacteria, include Lactobacillus plantarum and related lactobacilli, which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism with manganese (Mn2+) ions complexed with polyphosphate, suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life.|$|E

In the original recording sessions, [...] "Tonight, Tonight" [...] was initially written in the key of C instead of G. However, since Corgan was unable to sing the song in C, he wrote a version during the Mellon Collie recording sessions to suit his range. The strings for the song were arranged by Billy Corgan & Audrey Riley, and recorded with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Corgan said that recording with a 30-piece string-section for the song [...] "was <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> exciting recording experiences I have ever had." ...|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{maintains}} that {{the core of the}} strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. [...] "I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis," [...] she told a 1993 conference on acoustic ecology, [...] "you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, someone will speak about something that had just entered your mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence is <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful spiritual forces." [...] Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.|$|E

They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And {{so that was}} a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That was <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> fun things we ever did.

Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy.

Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it.

[...] 1UP editor Kat Bailey {{expressed}} concern about which Pokémon could follow the player in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, stating [...] "allowing popular favorites like Charizard would go over quite well". The Daily Cardinal editor Kyle Sparks called Charizard [...] "the most dominant Pokémon in the whole universe, a force of sheer strength".

500|$|During the 380L development, TSA had regular {{discussions with}} Toyota Japan on how its Avalon {{replacement}} would eventually turn out. Because TSA were an unknown quantity, having never designed a production vehicle, {{it took the}} division some time to convince Japan that they could indeed design a car themselves. When the 380L was consigned to a presentation with Japanese Toyota officials, TSA's lead designer Nick Hogios was requested to tender a proposal for the next-generation [...] "042L" [...] Camry design competition. While his submission was not chosen, Hogios was summoned to work on {{what would become the}} Aurion, then exclusively referred to as the [...] "Asian" [...] or [...] "prestige" [...] Camry, and codenamed [...] "043L". Due to the success of TSA's earlier concepts and the 380L, Toyota Australia was given the authorisation to manufacture both the regular 042L and 043L Camrys and sell them side-by-side. In Australia however, the regular Camry was to be limited to the four-cylinder engine, and the prestige Camry (later to become the Aurion) to the six. Hogios worked in Japan for nine months during 2004 designing the prestige Camry, and his final design was a collaborative effort between Japanese and Taiwanese designers, but the car's front-end styling is largely Hogios's own work. While the work in Japan was being undertaken, TSA began to make changes for the Australian Aurion variants. After the design stage was completed, Toyota Australia then commenced work {{on the development of the}} car, concurrently developing both the Australian car and the version for Asia. Beranger proclaims that the entire engineering undertaking, [...] "is <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> significant jobs that any subsidiary of Toyota Japan has done anywhere in the world." [...] The Australian variant of the car was codenamed [...] "323L". Despite both cars being essentially identical, Australia was given a different code due to the car occupying a broader range in that market—from a fleet vehicle to a sports-oriented model. In Asia, the car's role is much narrower, being a high-end luxury car.|$|E
