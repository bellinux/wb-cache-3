40|$|International audienceInformation on the {{exposure}} of individual persons to radiofrequency (RF) fields is scarce, although such data are crucial {{in order to develop}} a suitable exposure assessment method, and frame the hypothesis and design of future epidemiological studies. The main goal of this survey is to assess individual RF exposure on a population basis, while clarifying the relative contribution of different sources to the total exposure. A total of 377 randomly selected people were analyzed. Each participant was supplied with a <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> for 24 -hour measurements (weekday), and kept a time-location-activity diary. Electric field strengths were recorded in 12 different RF bands every 13 s. Summary statistics were calculated with the robust regression on order statistics method. Most of the time, recorded field strengths were not detectable with {{the exposure}} meter. Total field, cordless phones, WiFi-microwave, and FM transmitters stood apart with a proportion above the detection threshold of 46. 6 %, 17. 2 %, 14. 1 %, and 11. 0 %, respectively. The total field mean value was 0. 201 V/m, higher in urban areas, during daytime, among adults, and when moving. When focusing on specific channels, the highest mean exposure resulted from FM sources (0. 044 V/m), followed by WiFi-microwaves (0. 038 V/m), cordless phones (0. 037 V/m), and mobile phones (UMTS: 0. 036 V/m, UMTS: 0. 037 V/m). Various factors, however, contributed to a high variability in RF exposure assessment. These population-based estimates should therefore be confirmed by further surveys to better characterize the exposure situation in different microenvironments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Both {{the public}} perceptions, and most {{published}} epidemiologic studies, {{rely on the}} assumption that the distance of a particular residence from a base station or a broadcast transmitter is an appropriate surrogate for exposure to radiofrequency fields, although complex propagation characteristics affect the beams from antennas. The main goal of this study was to characterise the distribution of residential exposure from antennas using personal exposure meters. METHODS: A total of 200 randomly selected people was enrolled. Each participant was supplied with a <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> for 24 hour measurements, and kept a time-location-activity diary. Two exposure metrics for each radiofrequency were then calculated: the proportion of measurements above the detection limit (0. 05 V/m), and the maximum electric field strength. Residential address was geocoded, and distance from each antenna was calculated. RESULTS: Much of the time the recorded field strength was below the detection level (0. 05 V/m), the FM band standing apart with a proportion above the detection threshold of 12. 3 %. The maximum electric field strength was always lower than 1. 5 V/m. Exposure to GSM and DCS waves peaked around 280 m and 1000 m from the antennas. A downward trend was found within a 10 km range for FM. Conversely, UMTS, TV 3, and TV 4 & 5 signals did not vary with distance. CONCLUSIONS: Despite numerous limiting factors entailing a high variability in RF exposure assessment, but owing to a sound statistical technique, we found that exposures from GSM and DCS base stations increase with distance in the near source zone, to a maximum where the main beam intersects the ground. We believe these results will contribute to the on-going public debate over the siting of base stations and their associated emissions...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} prenatal {{exposure to}} radiofrequency radiation (RFR) from telecommunication using a mobile phone questionnaire, operator data logs of mobile phone use and a <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> (PEM). Material and Methods: The study included 1228 mother–infants pairs from the Mothers and Children’s Environmental Health (MOCEH) study – a multicenter prospective cohort study ongoing since 2006, {{in which participants}} were enrolled at ≤ 20 weeks of pregnancy, with a follow-up of a child birth and growth to assess the association between prenatal environmental exposure and children’s health. The questionnaire included the average calling frequency per day and the average calling time per day. An EME Spy 100 PEM {{was used to measure}} RFR among 269 pregnant women from November 2007 to August 2010. The operators’ log data were obtained from 21 participants. The Spearman’s correlation test was performed to evaluate correlation coefficient and 95 % confidence intervals between the mobile phone use information from the questionnaire, operators’ log data, and data recorded by the PEM. Results: The operators’ log data and information from the self-reported questionnaire showed significantly high correlations in the average calling frequency per day (ρ = 0. 6, p = 0. 004) and average calling time per day (ρ = 0. 5, p = 0. 02). The correlation between information on the mobile phone use in the self-reported questionnaire and exposure index recorded by the PEM was poor. But correlation between the information of the operators’ log data and exposure index for transmission of mobile communication was significantly high: correlation coefficient (p-value) was 0. 44 (0. 07) for calling frequency per day, and it was 0. 49 (0. 04) for calling time per day. Conclusions: The questionnaire information on the mobile phone use showed moderate to high quality. Using multiple methods for exposure assessment might be better than using only one method.

40|$|A {{multi-band}} Body-Worn Distributed <b>exposure</b> <b>Meter</b> (BWDM) calibrated for simultaneous {{measurement of}} the incident power density in 11 telecommunication frequency bands, is proposed. The BDWM consists of 22 textile antennas integrated in a garment and is calibrated on six human subjects in an anechoic chamber to assess its measurement uncertainty in terms of 68 % confidence interval of the on-body antenna aperture. It is shown that by using multiple antennas in each frequency band, {{the uncertainty of the}} BWDM is 22 dB improved with respect to single nodes on the front and back of the torso and variations are decreased to maximum 8. 8 dB. Moreover, deploying single antennas for different body morphologies results in a variation up to 9. 3 dB, which is reduced to 3. 6 dB using multiple antennas for six subjects with various body mass index values. The designed BWDM, has an improved uncertainty of up to 9. 6 dB in comparison to commercially available <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> calibrated on body. As an application, an average incident power density in the range of 26. 7 – 90. 8 μW·m − 2 is measured in Ghent, Belgium.

40|$|Radio-frequency {{electromagnetic}} fields are emitted by many applications, such as radio broadcasting and mobile com-munication. A {{part of the}} general public is increasingly concerned about the long-term effects of electromagnetic ra-diation on human health. However, the accurate exposure assessment in people’s everyday life remains a formidable challenge. State-of-the-art <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> are ex-pensive and tedious to use. Epidemiological large-scale stud-ies are rare and governmental compliance measurements can only cover a small number of locations of high interest (e. g., schools). In this paper, we demonstrate that accurate, spa-tially resolved electromagnetic field measurements are fea-sible with commodity sensor nodes. We show the design, implementation, and evaluation on mobile air quality sensor nodes, which traverse a large urban area on top of public transport vehicles in Zurich, Switzerland. We collect a data set with over 4 million measurements and use it to develop the first exposure map of Zurich with a spatial resolution of 100 m. Further, we compare the found exposure levels to measurements from different urban cities across Europe...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> (exposimeters) {{has been}} {{recommended}} for measuring <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> to radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) from environmental far-field sources in everyday life. However, {{it is unclear}} to what extent exposimeter readings are affected by measurements taken when personal mobile and cordless phones are used. In addition, the use of exposimeters in large epidemiological studies is limited due to high costs and large effort for study participants. In the current analysis we aimed to investigate the impact of personal phone use on exposimeter readings and to evaluate different exposure assessment methods potentially useful in epidemiological studies. We collected personal exposimeter measurements during one week and diary data from 166 study participants. Moreover, we collected spot measurements in the participants' bedrooms and data on self-estimated exposure, assessed residential exposure to fixed site transmitters by calculating the geo-coded distance and mean RF-EMF from a geospatial propagation model, and developed an exposure prediction model based on the propagation model and exposure relevant behavior. The mean <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> was 0. 13 mW/m(2), when measurements during personal phone calls were excluded and 0. 15 mW/m(2), when such measurements were included. The Spearman correlation with <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> (without <b>personal</b> phone calls) was 0. 42 (95 %-CI: 0. 29 to 0. 55) for the spot measurements, - 0. 03 (95 %-CI: - 0. 18 to 0. 12) for the geo-coded distance, 0. 28 (95 %-CI: 0. 14 to 0. 42) for the geospatial propagation model, 0. 50 (95 %-CI: 0. 37 to 0. 61) for the full exposure prediction model and 0. 06 (95 %-CI: - 0. 10 to 0. 21) for self-estimated <b>exposure.</b> In conclusion, <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> measured with exposimeters correlated best with the full exposure prediction model and spot measurements.

40|$|A {{framework}} for the combination of near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) radio frequency electromagnetic exposure sources to the average organ and whole-body specific absorption rates (SARs) is presented. As a reference case, values based on numerically derived SARs for whole-body and individual organs and tissues are combined with realistic exposure data, which have been collected using <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> during the Swiss Qualifex study. The framework presented {{can be applied to}} any study region where exposure data is collected by appropriate measurement equipment. Based on results derived from the data for the region of Basel, Switzerland, the relative importance of NF and FF sources to the <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> is examined for three different study groups. The results show that a 24 -h whole-body averaged exposure of a typical mobile phone user is dominated by the use {{of his or her own}} mobile phone when a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) 900 or GSM 1800 phone is used. If only Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) phones are used, the user would experience a lower exposure level on average caused by the lower average output power of UMTS phones. Data presented clearly indicate the necessity of collecting band-selective exposure data in epidemiological studies related to electromagnetic fields.

40|$|A {{suppression}} in melatonin secretion {{is one of}} {{the mechanisms}} proposed to explain the possible adverse effects of extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF), but the results of research are inconclusive. This study investigated the effect of occupational ELF-MF exposure on 6 -sulfatoximelatonin (6 -OHMS). Exposure was monitored for three complete work shifts in 59 workers using <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters.</b> Environmental <b>exposure</b> was also evaluated. Urinary 6 -OHMS in morning samples, an indicator of night-time melatonin production, was measured. Urine was collected twice on Friday and the following Monday. Workers were classified according to ELF exposure as low exposed (≤ 0. 2 μT) or higher exposed (> 0. 2 μT) : 6 -OHMS did not differ between groups (P >. 05) in either Friday or Monday urine samples. In addition, 6 -OHMS was not related to exposure under multivariate analysis. The ratio between 6 -OHMS in Monday versus Friday samples was also calculated to test the hypothesis of a possible variation in pineal function after 2 days, interruption of occupational ELF-MF exposure: again no exposure-related difference was observed. Our results do not support the hypothesis that occupational exposure to ELF-MF significantly influences melatonin secretion...|$|R
40|$|Body-worn {{radiofrequency}} {{electromagnetic field}} (RF-EMF) <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> (PEMs) have been increasingly used for exposure assessment in epidemiological research. However, little {{research on the}} measurement accuracy of these devices is available. In this article a novel measurement setup and a measurement protocol are presented for characterizing and testing PEMs. The whole setup and procedure is tested using two EME SPY 120 devices. The performance of the PEM was analyzed for absolute measurements in an anechoic chamber. Modulated signals representing the different services as real signals generated by appropriate testers were used. Measurement results were evaluated {{with respect to a}} root mean square detector. We found that measurement accuracy depends strongly on the carrier frequency and also on the number of occupied time slots for Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) -based services. Thus, correction factors can only be derived if the distribution of the network configuration over the measurement time for all measurement points is available. As a result of the simplicity of the measurement setup and the straightforward measurement protocol, the possibility of fast validation leads to a higher accuracy in the characterization and testing of PEMs. Bioelectromagnetics.

40|$|International audienceOnly limited {{data are}} {{available}} on personal radio frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure in everyday life. Several European countries performed measurement studies {{in this area of}} research. However, a comparison between countries regarding typical exposure levels is lacking. To compare for the first time mean exposure levels and contributions of different sources in specific environments between different European countries. In five countries (Belgium, Switzerland, Slovenia, Hungary, and the Netherlands), measurement studies were performed using the same <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters.</b> The pooled data were analyzed using the robust regression on order statistics (ROS) method in order to allow for data below the detection limit. Mean exposure levels were compared between different microenvironments such as homes, public transports, or outdoor. Exposure levels were of the same order of magnitude in all countries and well below the international exposure limits. In all countries except for the Netherlands, the highest total exposure was measured in transport vehicles (trains, car, and busses), mainly due to radiation from mobile phone handsets (up to 97 %). Exposure levels were in general lower in private houses or flats than in offices and outdoors. At home, contributions from various sources were quite different between countries. Highest total <b>personal</b> RF-EMF <b>exposure</b> was measured inside transport vehicles and was well below international exposure limits. This is mainly due to mobile phone handsets.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the population's {{exposure}} to radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) in industrialized countries. OBJECTIVES: To examine levels of exposure and the importance of different RF-EMF sources and settings in a sample of volunteers living in a Swiss city. METHODS: RF-EMF exposure of 166 volunteers from Basel, Switzerland, was measured with <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> (exposimeters). Participants carried an exposimeter for 1 week (two separate weeks in 32 participants) and completed an activity diary. Mean values were calculated using the robust regression on order statistics (ROS) method. RESULTS: Mean weekly exposure to all RF-EMF sources was 0. 13 mW/m(2) (0. 22 V/m) (range of individual means 0. 014 - 0. 881 mW/m(2)). Exposure was mainly due to mobile phone base stations (32. 0 %), mobile phone handsets (29. 1 %) and digital enhanced cordless telecommunications (DECT) phones (22. 7 %). Persons owning a DECT phone (total mean 0. 15 mW/m(2)) or mobile phone (0. 14 mW/m(2)) were exposed more than those not owning a DECT or mobile phone (0. 10 mW/m(2)). Mean values were highest in trains (1. 16 mW/m(2)), airports (0. 74 mW/m(2)) and tramways or buses (0. 36 mW/m(2)), and higher during daytime (0. 16 mW/m(2)) than nighttime (0. 08 mW/m(2)). The Spearman correlation coefficient between mean exposure in the first and second week was 0. 61. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to RF-EMF varied considerably between persons and locations but was fairly consistent within persons. Mobile phone handsets, mobile phone base stations and cordless phones were important sources of exposure in urban Switzerland...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields on markers of human fertility. METHODS: A follow up study of time to pregnancy, semen quality, and reproductive hormones was conducted among couples planning first pregnancies (36 males were welders and 21 were non-welders). The male and the female partner were monitored for exposure to ELF magnetic field by <b>personal</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters.</b> As summary measures of exposure the median value was calculated together with the 75 percentile value {{and the proportion of}} measurements exceeding 0. 2 and 1. 0 microT, respectively. Each summary measure was divided in three categories: low, medium, and high. RESULTS: Couples in which the man had a medium or a high proportion of measurements > 1. 0 microT had a reduced probability of conception per menstrual cycle compared with the men with low exposure, but the result was only significant for the men with medium exposure. This finding was partly attributable to a high probability of conception per menstrual cycle among the men with low exposure compared with non-welders in the original cohort of 430 couples. Other summary measures were not related to probability of conception or other markers of fertility. A possible negative association was found between high probability of conception and female exposure measures based on the median, the 75 percentile, and the proportion of measurements > 0. 2 microT, but no association was found with the proportion of measurements > 1. 0 microT. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide no consistent support for a hypothesis of a deleterious effect of low level ELF magnetic fields on markers of human fertility. However, due to the relatively small size of the studied population only large associations would be detected...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} whether individuals can subjectively estimate: (1) the loudness of events with respect to the objectively measured noise level; and (2) the overall loudness of their daily noise exposure level. Design: Participants wore <b>personal</b> noise <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> for up to five days. During this time, participants kept diaries of daily events and estimated the loudness of these events and their overall noise exposure using 1 -to- 10 rating scales. Study sample: A group of 45 volunteers aged between 18 and 35 years participated in the study. Results: 86 % of participants’ subjective estimates were significantly correlated with the objective noise measurements. Multiple regression showed that age, overall lifestyle noise, and diary quality were predictors of the strength of correlation observed. In addition participants’ subjective estimates of their overall noise exposure were significantly correlated with their actual average daily noise exposure. Conclusions: Results suggest that individuals can make a reasonable estimate of the loudness of events they experience and the overall level of noise they experience. These results may have significant influence for those interested in producing effective hearing health awareness programs in that individuals may be capable of assessing their own degree of hazard exposure. 6 page(s...|$|R
