40|$|An {{universal}} exact {{description of}} kinetics of open quantum systems {{in terms of}} random wave functions and stochastic Schr√∂dinger equation is suggested. It is shown that evolution of random quantum states of an open system is unitary on average, and this implies validity of the optical theorem for any inelastic scattering.
