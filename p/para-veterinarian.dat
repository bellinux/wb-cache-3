40|$|The long-standing <b>para-veterinarian</b> {{service that}} {{provides}} institutional support to herders on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has undergone major challenges in recent years, following {{the changes in}} central governmental policies. As a result of governmental disengagement and public resources downscaling, the service currently focuses almost exclusively on the vaccination campaigns. This leaves ample room for integration to as well as improvement of the delivery of animal health service on the plateau. This case study from Chengduo county of Yushu Autonomous Prefecture illustrates the strategy the Italian NGO ASIA is undertaking to comply with this challenge, which involves supporting local herding communities without relieving the government from its role and responsibilities (Nori 2003) ...|$|E

According to our knowledge, This is the first review that highlight {{on the role of}} <b>para-veterinarians</b> in the Egypt as a co-aid for veterinary doctors...|$|R
30|$|During FGD and KIIs, the {{respondents}} cited several barriers to availability and appropriate prescription of veterinary drugs by agro-veterinary outlets. These include unavailability of veterinary drugs, price competition among agro-veterinary outlets, economic constraints and limited pastoralists’ knowledge {{on drug use}} and camel diseases. The veterinary officers expressed mistrust towards competency of non-professional practitioners. The agro-veterinary drug outlets reported that professional veterinarians and <b>para-veterinarians</b> were important players in promoting the pastoralists’ management of camel and other livestock health.|$|R
50|$|The project trained local Afghan youths as <b>para-veterinarians</b> {{to operate}} a subscription-based Mobile Veterinary Unit. The subscribing sheep owners provide payment for the {{veterinary}} services {{in the form of}} livestock, which is then used in a sheep-loan system, or A4 Sheep Bank. The Sheep Bank lends sheep to economically vulnerable farmers, with the goal of reducing poverty and deterring them from illicit activities like opium poppy cultivation. The farmers repay the loans with the sheep’s offspring, which can then be loaned to other farmers, creating a revolving fund.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in southern peninsular State of India, the Tamil Nadu State, (i) {{to ascertain the}} time costs of animal health care and bovine breeding services, and (ii) to comprehend the perceptions of farmers on the livestock services rendered by different service providers. The districts of the state were categorized as 'Livestock Developed' (LD) and 'Livestock Under Developed' (LUD) based on initial base line developed. Travel, waiting and service time were among the primary non-price factors that affected service quality. Average travel time was highest for visiting the public veterinary centre in both LUD (23. 05 min.) and LD (21. 32 min.) districts. Waiting time with regard to veterinarians providing home services in LUD districts was highest (23. 01 min.), followed by public veterinary centre services at LUD districts (22. 35 min.), home services by <b>para-veterinarians</b> (22. 01 min.) and public veterinary centre services at LD districts (20. 10 min.). Both travel and waiting time were much higher in case of breeding services compared to curative services, which {{could be due to}} the fact that the farmers preferred Artificial Insemination (AI) over its close substitute, the natural service. However, the service time was relatively less in case of insemination services vis-&# 224;-vis curative services both in LUD and LD districts. The quality perceptions of farmers on livestock services revealed that the home services rendered by veterinarians as the best one (0. 83), followed by private veterinary clinics (0. 75), home services by <b>para-veterinarians</b> (0. 74), public veterinary centres (0. 64) and co-operative veterinary centres (0. 48).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the seroprevalence of brucellosis among high-risk group individuals, consisting of veterinarians and <b>para-veterinarians,</b> shepherds, butchers and animal owners. Methods: The present work was carried out at Project Directorate on Animal Disease Monitoring and Surveillance, Bangalore, by using the recently developed indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to Brucella abortus. Results: The results were compared with the conventional serological tests, Rose Bengal plate test and standard tube agglutination test. The result showed that the indirect ELISA was more sensitive than the conventional tests. Of 618 tested, the disease of prevalence was at 41. 23 &#x 0025; in veterinary inspectors, 30. 92 &#x 0025; in veterinary assistants, 12. 37 &#x 0025; in veterinary officers, 6. 18 &#x 0025; in veterinary supervisors, 6. 18 &#x 0025; in Group D workers, 2. 06 &#x 0025; in shepherds and 1. 03 &#x 0025; in butchers. Conclusions: This study results highlight the immediate necessity to institute control measures to control Brucellosis...|$|R
