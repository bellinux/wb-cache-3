40|$|Here {{we report}} new and {{previously}} published Re-Os and trace elemental data on gold {{as well as}} coeval sulfides and oxides from various Archean to Alphanumeric gold deposits. When possible, measured concentrations and isotopic ratios {{were used to determine}} geochronology as well as the likely source reservoir of the gold mineralization. Rhenium-osmium ages of some gold and related minerals are consistent with existing geochronology and in some cases better constrain genetic models of mineralization. The initial Os isotopic composition is also preserved within some ore minerals and reflects the importance of both crustal and mantle material in the generation of specific deposits. However, many of the gold deposits show evidence of post-crystallization Re-Os disturbance, and so age and source information are not preserved. In these cases, it is likely that hydrothermal fluids added or removed Re or Os subsequent to primary mineralization. Preservation of age favors minerals with high Re and Os concentrations and/or minerals from monocyclic gold deposits without multiple influxes of fluids. More specifically, gold and pyrite from the 2890 [...] 2710 Ma Witwatersrand basin, typically form ca. 3000 Ma isochrons with chondritic initial 187 Os/ 188 Os values. The Os concentrations of the gold range from approximately 2 to over 4000 ppb and are significantly elevated compared to other gold deposits. The older age, mantle source and high concentration of the gold support modified <b>paleo-placer</b> models with minor hydrothermal modification but not significant deposition of gold via hydrothermal fluids of any age. Other gold deposits have low average Os concentrations ranging from approximately 20 ppt to 1 ppb and Re/Os ratios generally similar to average continental crust. The initial 187 Os/ 188 Os of these deposits vary but seem to have more crustal signatures than the Witwatersrand deposits. Data support gold deposition from leaching of gold and Os via hydrothermal fluids from crustal lithologies. Os concentration and Re/Os data of gold show systematic variation with the age of the deposit. These trends may result from a decrease in the efficiency of partial melts to extract juvenile gold and Os from the cooling mantle and the increasing importance of recycling gold from pre-existing continental crust...|$|E
40|$|The Navachab Gold mine, an orogenic lode gold deposit, {{is located}} in the Karibib region of the Pan-African (ca. 550 - 500) Damara belt of central Namibia. Gold {{mineralisation}} is developed within the steeply NW dipping limb of the Karibib dome. Here, ore envelopes trend along three main orientations: a) trends shallowly towards the NE (the down plunge extent), b) trends sub-vertically in and along the down plunge extent and c) trends sub-horizontally across the down plunge extent. The down plunge extent represents the bulk of the gold mineralisation, hosting the only high grade ores mined at Navachab. As such, past work primarily focused on establishing the controls to the mineralisation observed here. The sub-vertical and subâ€“horizontal ore trends are seen as secondary, lower grade, being hosted in the footwall. By cutting pushbacks into the footwall, in an effort to regain access to high grade pit bottom, future gold production almost exclusively relies upon optimally mining these ores. This underlines the importance to investigate and outline the mineralising controls to the secondary ore trends. This study identified the following prevailing quartz vein sets developed within the footwall, set (1) dips shallowly towards the NE (conjugate vein set), (2) steeply towards the NW (bedding parallel veins) and (3) steeply towards the SE (S 2 foliation parallel). The NW and SE dipping sets contain high average gold grades, occurring at an infrequent vein density. The NE dipping veins, as a result of occurrence density alone, was highlighted as the dominant gold hosting set. Veining occurred during the late stages of the NW-SE directed, sub-horizontal shortening (D 2) event and is associated with top-to-the-NW thrusting and NW-verging folds. Re-Os molybdenite dating from auriferous quartz veins indicates mineralisation occurred at 525 - 520 Ma. As crustal shortening amplified the Karibib dome, flexural flow developed fractures along bedding planes, providing the control to bedding parallel veins (NW dipping). With continued crustal compression the dome later experienced fold lock up associated with reduced mean rock stress and sub-horizontal extension occurred along the steeply NW dipping limb. Horizontal extensional gashes sucked in fluids to form the shallowly NE dipping conjugate vein set. These features suggest the regional D 2 strain as the first-order control to quartz vein development, down plunge and within the footwall ores. To further define the secondary ores, lithological and structural controls were evaluated on a more detailed local scale. With equal amounts of biotite schist and calc-silicate host rock (bulk of the footwall lithology) material analysed, the biotite schist units were found to contain a larger volume amount of quartz veins. The mineralisation incurred is also developed at higher average gold grades compared to that of the calc-silicates, demonstrating biotite schist having the optimal rheology for quartz vein emplacement. Normal faulting and thrusting occurs widespread, at all scale levels, across the footwall. These were primarily observed along bedding foliations and secondly at higher angles cutting across foliation. The study did not constrain the extent of these, but can conclude faulting plays a very prominent role in re-distributing the secondary ores parallel to bedding along sub-vertical trend planes. Great care should be placed in properly modelling these with 3 D software such as Leapfrog. The Navachab gold mineralisation came about as a result of convergent and collisional tectonics activating metamorphic dehydration of the crustal metapelites. As these fluids ascended they absorbed gold from the crust, emplaced by either a magmatic or <b>paleo-placer</b> source. The gold enriched hydrothermal fluids amalgamated in large scale 1 ste order structures (shearing of the steep NW limb of the Karibib Dome, the Mon Repos Thrust Zone) that acted as primary active fluid path ways. In the case of Navachab the gold enriched fluid fluxed along these pathways while interacting with fluid sinks related to a physical throttle (brittle schist, folding, bedding parallel shears) and/or a chemical trap (marbles). By summarising and detailing the fluid sinks and active fluid pathways identified by this and previous works, it is strongly recommended that a mineral approach system be designed and implemented as targeting model to lead future exploration endeavours...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the similar {{chemical}} properties of gold (Au) and platinum (Pt), Au is highly mobile in surface environments, whereas Pt appears to be far less so. In this study we assess if geomicrobial processes are likely to cause these differences, as the mobility of Pt and Au should differ little based on thermodynamic solubility alone. To achieve an accurate comparison {{it is important that}} both metals occur in the same environment. Mineral- and groundwater samples were obtained from the Fifield Pt Au field in New South Wales, Australia, where Pt and Au nuggets occur in a series of Tertiary eluvial and alluvial <b>paleo-placers.</b> In particular, we studied the pm-scale dispersion of Au and Pt within an extraordinary 10 mm-sized fragment of ferruginous paleochannel material, which contained abundant native Au- and isoferroplatinum grains. Gold grains displayed complex secondary morphologies indicative of biogeochemical transformations, whereas isoferroplatinum grains appeared smooth and well-rounded and showed no signs of supergene transformation. Gold grains were surrounded by a dusting of highly pure metallic Au particles ( 10 mu m in diameter), whereas no metallic Pt particles were detected. A search for ionic Pt was also unsuccessful. A series of biotic and abiotic incubation experiments was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that these differences in mobility are driven by interactions with microbiota. Biofilms consisting of metallophilic bacteria formed on ultraflat Au surfaces and caused significant surface transformations. In contrast, only subtle changes were observed on Pt surfaces incubated under similar conditions. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for Au complexes are more than an order of magnitude lower than those measured for Pt complexes in Cupriavidus metallidurans cells...|$|R
40|$|Integration of {{regional}} geophysical datasets and detailed field observations provide {{new insights into}} the paleoproterozoic structural evolution of southwestern Ghana. The study area is dominated by three metavolcanic and metasedimentary packages known as the Sefwi Group, the Kumasi Group (Birimian) and the Tarkwa Group (Tarkwaian) that were intruded by abundant TTG granitoids during the Eoeburnean and Eburnean phases of an event termed the "Eburnean Orogeny". This study identifies an Eoeburnean (pre-Tarkwaian) deformation event (D 1) that produced significant deformation in the Sefwi Group metavolcanics. D 1 is associated with N-S shortening manifested as regional scale folding in the southern Ashanti Belt. D 1 synorogenic granitoids were intruded between 2187 Ma and 2158 Ma under greenschist metamorphic condition. Syn-D 1 gold mineralisation associated with quartz veining could be the original source of Tarkwaian <b>paleo-placers</b> and/or remobilised gold concentrations along major shear zones. D 2 represents an extensional phase associated with the Kumasi Group sedimentation (2154 - 2125 Ma) which could be related to activation of major structures such as the Ashanti Fault as low angle detachments that controlled the deposition of the Kumasi Group and the opening of the Kumasi and Akyem Basin. The Tarkwa Group (2107 - 2097 Ma) unconformably overlies the Birimian Supergroups and was deposited in response to D 3 shortening. D 3 resulted in the inversion of syn-D 2 detachments faults within the Ashanti Belt. NW-SE D 3 shortening produced regional scale folding within the Birimian and the Tarkwaian metasediments. D 4 deformation corresponds with sinistral reactivation of D 3 thrust faults, and is locally associated with macro-scale folding at Obuasi and Wassa gold mines. By the end of D 4, the regional scale architecture was built and was only slightly modified by the two last events. D 5 postdates the Eburnean metamorphic peak and corresponds to open recumbent folds associated with a subhorizontal crenulation cleavage. D 6 is present as a subvertical crenulation cleavage and reverse faults associated with NE-SW shortening...|$|R
