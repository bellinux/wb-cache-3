It is a five-span continuous treated timber stringer bridge which is 95 ft long and 20 ft wide with roadway width of 19 ft. Its ends are supported by timber abutments and wingwalls braced with wood pilings. The spans are between four sets of treated timber <b>pile</b> <b>bents</b> made of Douglas fir.|$|R
5000|$|The Cunningham Bridge is a {{historic}} structure located northwest of Bevington, Iowa, United States. It spans the North River for 143 ft. The Madison County Board of Supervisors contracted with the George E. King Bridge Company of Des Moines to replace an existing span {{that was to be}} moved to another site. The wrought iron Pratt pony truss bridge was shipped to the county and erected by June 1886 for $820. [...] The approaches are timber stringer spans, and it is supported by timber <b>pile</b> <b>bents.</b> The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.|$|R
50|$|During 2008 {{the bridge}} {{underwent}} a major refurbishment {{with the aim}} of extending its life for a further 30 years. The bridge has now been designated a bridleway and is a popular local landmark used by both leisure and commuter traffic on foot, bicycle and horseback. It is also a popular spot for local fisherman. The refurbishment completely replaced the pilehead crossbeams, deck support longitudinal beams and handrails with selective replacement and reinforcement of components of each of the 27 <b>pile</b> <b>bents.</b> The project was managed and partly funded by West Sussex County Council. The rest of the funding came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, landfill tax credits and the Old Shoreham Tollbridge Community Trust.|$|R
5000|$|The Morgan Bridge is a {{historic}} structure, originally located southeast of Old Peru, Iowa, United States. It spanned a branch of Clanton Creek for 60 ft. [...] The wrought iron or steel Pratt pony truss was manufactured by the King Iron Bridge & Manufacturing Company of Cleveland. Benton Jones of Winterset, Iowa assembled it for $376.39. [...] The approaches are timber stringer spans, and it is supported by timber <b>pile</b> <b>bents.</b> The bridge has not been operational for years. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. [...] The span originally served a remote crossing, but has subsequently been relocated and is now owned by the Madison County Historical Society.|$|R
50|$|The current {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} in 1970 as a plate girder bridge, consisting of nine steel through plate girder sections supported on eight steel <b>pile</b> <b>bents.</b> The western end of the east approach for the steel through plate girder structure {{is supported by a}} concrete pier on wooden piles built in 1919. The end of the eastern pier is made of concrete. Between 1843 and 1964, three railway bridges were constructed at the site and a navigation channel was dredged, all of which disturbed the Mnjikaning Fish Weirs. The swing bridge was deemed unsafe in a 2010 inspection by the railway. Reports to local police and the railway in 2011 declared that the wooden timber cribbing {{at the base of the}} swing bridge was decaying and shedding material into the water below.|$|R
30|$|Structural {{concrete}} prefabricated {{systems have}} been successfully used with the well-known advantages of construction time reduction {{and the number of}} operations to be performed in situ, improved quality control, work zone safety improvement and lower environmental impact. Unlu [1] proposed various precast concrete systems for the construction of abutments and bent caps. Billington et al. [2] proposed concrete precast systems for the construction of single- and double-column inverted T hammerhead pier caps with connection details. Matsumoto et al. [3] developed a precast concrete system for <b>pile</b> <b>bent</b> caps for non-seismic regions with several connection details. Other {{systems have been}} applied successfully. For example, precast post-tensioned supported bent caps with an inverted T-section with spans up to 17.68  m were used for the U-section bridges in the project mentioned herein. However, there is a practical limit for the span lengths due to the self-weight that can impact safe lifting and placement.|$|R
30|$|The {{evolution}} of pier cap design {{is a consequence}} of the intensive use of bridges caused by the changes in the transportation infrastructures [4]. In general, abutment design has been extensively analyzed [4], particularly for integral abutments. Barr et al. [5] investigated the spalling of an integral abutment bridge in Salt Lake City, UT, through monitoring and finite element modeling. Nikravan [6] studied the behavior of integral bridges subjected to temperature variations using 3 D finite element models. However, pier choices are generally limited to CIP concrete supported either by one hammerhead bent cap or more than one column and <b>pile</b> <b>bent</b> cap [7]. Some special types (straddle bent caps) are briefly addressed elsewhere [8]. Public agencies have guidelines on the design of the most common bent cap types, such as rectangular column bent caps [9, 10], inverted T column bent caps [9, 10] and hammerhead bent caps [11]. However, comparative design/construction guidance for alternates is lacking.|$|R
50|$|Test holes 60 to 75 ft. deep to {{determine}} the character of foundation for the concrete piers disclosed compact sand, gravel and large boulders in layers of varying thicknesses, suitable for carrying pier loading without foundation piles.Pier construction started in May, 1920, when the head of track was 22 {{miles south of the}} bridge site. Supplies were freighted by sleds on the ice until the river broke and then by boats and wagons. Transportation difficulties were practically overcome when the track reached the river in September, 1920. At that time excavation for the south pier was complete and that for the north pier had been begun. A temporary trestle 100 ft. downstream from the bridge site permitted tracklaying to proceed and facilitated erection of the bridge without interference to traffic and to other construction work north of the river. Piles for the trestle <b>bents,</b> <b>piers</b> and abutments had been driven and the falsework for the steel span had been started from the north end before the track reached the site.|$|R
40|$|The {{direct costs}} of bridge construction, such as materials, labor, and {{equipment}} are all well known. Recently however the indirect costs {{such as the}} cost of traffic disruptions, and construction safety are beginning to be factored into design decisions. These new considerations have led the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to explore Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC), which is also known as a ?get in, get out, stay out? approach to bridge construction and replacement. Accelerated Bridge Construction is defined as replacement, or new bridge construction that uses design and construction methods to minimize impacts to the traveling public, river traffic, railroads, and the environment ? all while maintaining high levels of quality and safety. In other words, make bridge construction faster, and safer, while also making bridges last longer by using modern technology. This project focuses on one approach to ABC construction, using more precast elements, in an attempt to move towards an all precast bridge. Precast elements are fabricated offsite, in a controlled environment, and shipped to the project, where a crane is used to place them. Systems being examined in this project include precast stay?inplace forms for short to medium span bridges, and precast <b>pile</b> <b>bent</b> caps. Both of these systems can be used to dramatically reduce the amount of cast?in?place concrete on a typical bridge project. For the precast stay?in?place formwork system, this report first examines current practices of using precast concrete and bridges, and then identifies possible precast sections for further study in the proposed system. Double?T beam sections are identified for further study, next a series of analyses are run to identify a group of characteristics that would make a newly designed section more efficient. Using these characteristics, a new Channel section is designed, and analyzed against the Double?T section, the new section is found to offer a broader span range, and is designed to reduce several key 12 maintenance issues prevalent in adjacent member bridges. A list of recommendations for further study and discussion on this topic is included. Also included in this report is a construction study done on a bridge near Reynolds Wisconsin which used precast <b>pile</b> <b>bent</b> caps. The report follows the project from the precasting of the pile caps at County Materials in Roberts Wisconsin, to the placement and connection of caps to the piles, in Reynolds Wisconsin. Several problems were experienced with the construction process, and from these a list of recommendations for improvement was generated, and is included with the report...|$|R
40|$|Infrastructure {{spending}} {{is such a}} large component of a railroad budget {{that it must be}} prioritized to meet the concurrent safety and line capacity requirements. Current bridge inspection and rating practices recommend observing bridge movements under a live load to help assess bridge conditions. However, measuring bridge movements under trains in the field is a challenging task. Even when they are measured, the relationships between bridge displacements and different loads/speeds are generally unknown. The research reported herein shows the effects of known train loadings, speeds, and traffic directions on the magnitude and frequency of displacements as measured on timber <b>pile</b> <b>bents</b> of a Class I railroad bridge. Researchers collected both vertical and transverse (lateral) displacements under revenue service traffic and work trains using LVDTs with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. To investigate the effect of traffic on timber railroad bridges, displacements were measured under crossing events at different speeds and directions of a test train of known speed and weight provided by the railroad for the field experiment. The results indicate that bridge transverse displacements could help to capture critical changes in timber railroad bridge serviceability (i. e., ability to safely carry out railroad operations) as a function of railroad loading, speed, and direction.

40|$|Deterioration {{of aging}} bridges can be {{attributed}} to an assortment of mechanisms throughout the structure, with remediation policies also varying. This study focused on assessing the validity of the Nebraska Department of Roads’ (NDOR) reinforced concrete encasement retrofit for corroded steel HP piles. Experiments were designed and conducted to test the capacity of the NDOR retrofit and evaluate failure limit states. Two pile locations were considered: abutment and <b>pile</b> <b>bent.</b> For each location there was a non-deteriorated, deteriorated, and retrofitted case. These cases represented the pile at key stages during its life. NDOR’s concrete encasement retrofit provided the required stability and composite action to return the pile to full capacity. The key finding of the experimental study was a greater than anticipated steel-concrete bond stress. The bond stress observed was three times greater than the nominal recommended by AISC. A computational study was also conducted to investigate sensitivities and alternative configurations, such as geometric alterations, material properties, and reinforcement. The computational study emphasized the load transfer mechanism’s dependence on the type of load applied. Piles governed by axial compression with relatively minor moment were observed to be more sensitive to bond. The moment dominated loads required more surface to surface pressure transfer or bearing. Further investigation is recommended to determine the bond characteristics of steel fully encased by concrete. Advisor: Joshua Steelma...|$|R
60|$|The savages {{now knew}} that conquest was sure. Yells and whoopings proclaimed the fierce delight {{with which they}} {{witnessed}} the certainty of their victory. Still there was something portentous in the death-like silence with which the victims within the block awaited their fate. The whole exterior of the building was already wrapped in flames, and yet no show of further resistance, no petition for mercy, issued from its bosom. The unnatural and frightful stillness, that reigned within, was gradually communicated to those without. The cries and shouts of triumph ceased, and the crackling of the flames, or the falling of timber in the adjoining buildings, alone disturbed the awful calm. At length a solitary voice was heard in the block. Its tones were deep, solemn, and imploring. The fierce beings who surrounded the glowing <b>pile</b> <b>bent</b> forward to listen, for their quick faculties caught the first sounds that were audible. It was Mark Heathcote pouring out his spirit in prayer. The petition was fervent, but steady, and though uttered in words that were unintelligible to those without, they knew enough of the practices of the Colonists, {{to be aware that}} it was the chief of the Pale-faces holding communion with his God. Partly in awe, and partly in doubt of what might be the consequences of so mysterious an asking, the dark crowd with drew to a little distance, and silently watched the progress of the destruction. They had heard strange sayings {{of the power of the}} Deity of their invaders, and as their victims appeared suddenly to cease using any of the known means of safety, they appeared to expect, perhaps they did expect, some unequivocal manifestation of the power of the Great Spirit of the stranger.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project concerns the construction, testing, and remote health {{monitoring of the}} first smart bridge structure in Florida, the East Bay bridge in Gibsonton, Hillsborough County. The East Bay Bridge is a four span, continuous, deck-type structure with a total length of 1202 ̆ 7 and width of 552 ̆ 7. The superstructure consists of an 182 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 cast-in-place reinforced concrete slab, and is supported on pre-stressed <b>pile</b> <b>bents,</b> each consisting of 5 piles. The smart sensors used for remote health monitoring are the newly emerged Fabry [...] Perot (FP) Fiber Optic Sensors, and are both surface-mounted and embedded in the concrete deck. Static and Dynamic testing of the bridge were performed using loaded SU- 4 trucks, and a finite element model for the bridge was developed for the test cases using commercial software packages. In addition, the smart sensors were connected to a data acquisition system permanently installed on-site. This system could be accessed through regular phone lin es, which permits {{the evaluation of the}} bridge behavior under live traffic loads. Currently, these live structural data under traffic loading are transmitted to Hillsborough County 2 ̆ 7 s bridge maintenance office to assist in the health evaluation and maintenance of the bridge. AASHTO LRFD Design Code has been investigated using analytical and laboratory test but no attempt has been made to verify its relative outlook with respect to Allowable Strength Design (ASD) and AASHTO Standard Specifications (LFD) in a real field test. The likely reason for could have been the lack of accurate and reliable sensing systems. The data collected as well as the analytical studies through out this research, suggest that current LRFD design specifications for deck-type bridges are conservative. The technology developed under this work will enable practical, cost-effective, and reliable systematic maintenance of bridge structures, and the study will provide a unique opportunity for future growth of this tech nology in the state of Florida and in other states and finally, long term collected data can be used to keep the design codes in check...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{treats the}} {{buckling}} of slender piles completely embedded in soft cohesive soils. Usually these soilswere assumed to behave elastically and were theoretically replaced by horizontal springs supporting the piles. However, soft soils deform as plastic materials. Therefore, {{it is suggested}} to assume a lateral supportindependent {{of the amount of}} the lateral displacement and accordingly to calculate a model; hereby the safetyagainst buckling of the piles is computed. It is shown that an ideally straight, centrally loaded pile does notbuckle until the stresses in the pile material exceed the elastic range. The shape of the pile axis, however, is mostimportant. Only a very little deviation from a straight line, because the <b>pile</b> is <b>bent</b> elastically or stressles, causesa rapid decrease of the maximum pile-load in dependency of the shear resistance of the soils with the increase ofthe deviation.

40|$|Severe {{corrosion}} of epoxy coated rebar in the substructure of 5 major marine bridges in the Florida Keys {{was detected}} {{after only a}} few years of construction. Corrosion occurred underneath the coating and was preceded by loss of adherence between the steel and the coating. Damage surveys of the bridges, which were built around 1980, were conducted from 1986 to 2000. Corrosion resulted in delaminated areas (spalls) typically about 0. 3 m 2 each. After Initial detection, damage has been steadily accumulating at a rate of approximately 0. 1 spall per bridge <b>pier</b> (<b>bent)</b> per year. An initiation-propagation model for corrosion development reproduced the observed trends. The exploratory model assumes distribution of chloride diffusivity, rebar cover, chloride surface concentration, and propagation time. Interpretation of the results suggests that much of the early damage stemmed from rebar with high levels of coating distress, and that damage development depends mainly on the propagation stage of corrosion...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} failure {{potential of}} U. S. highway bridges from aging and {{susceptibility to damage}} in extreme events, such as earthquakes, necessitates the development of efficient assessment tools to help infrastructure owners prioritize maintenance and rehabilitation interventions. Particularly, seismic fragility curves are useful tools because they state the failure probability of structures conditioned on earthquake intensity levels. This study focuses on computationally efficient coupled bridge-soil-foundation (CBSF) analyses and develops fragility curves for multi-span continuous steel bridges (MSCS) typical of the central and eastern U.

The resulting fragility curves show {{an increase in the}} vulnerability of rocker bearings and <b>bent</b> <b>piles.</b> Moreover, {{depending on the type of}} soil layer overlying the liquefiable sand, liquefaction either decreases or increases the fragility of columns, whereas the probability of unseating at the abutments increases when liquefaction is explicitly modeled.

40|$|A compatibility-based strut-and-tie model C-STM is {{proposed}} for analyzing deep beams and disturbed regions with {{particular emphasis on}} reinforced concrete bridge piers. In addition to the normal strut-and-tie force equilibrium requirements the model accounts for non-linear behavior through displacement compatibility using inelastic constitutive laws of cracked reinforced concrete. The model is implemented into widely used commercial structural analysis software and validated against results from previously conducted large scale experiments. A near full-scale experiment on a reinforced concrete sub-assemblage that represents cantilevered and straddle <b>pier</b> <b>bents</b> is conducted to investigate the shear-flexure performance of deep (disturbed) regions. Insights into the development of nonlinear behavior and the final collapse failure mechanism are then evaluated and accurately modeled using the C-STM. It is concluded that the proposed C-STM serves as an advanced method of analysis that can predict with suitable accuracy the force-deformation response of both D- and B- regions, deep beams, and beam-columns. This provides engineers with a supplementary analysis tool {{that can be used}} to assess the nonlinear behavior of bridge piers with stocky members and/or large disturbed regions...|$|R
40|$|The $ 900 million Rt. 295 Direct Connect Project in New Jersey, USA is a {{major highway}} and bridge {{construction}} project currently under design. This project is {{to be built in}} several stages and in four separate contracts in one of the busiest corridors in the country where three major highways meet. It has numerous long span bridges that weave through the interchange at four separate levels. For the I- 295 Direct Connect Project, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) required the use of precast post tensioned segmental piers where appropriate to expedite construction and to relieve motorists from construction related delays. In precast concrete construction, much of the pier fabrication can be done in an off-site pre-casting plant. This shortens the on-site labor and construction time, thereby reducing traffic delays and detours during construction. A pre-casting plant allows for both the efficiency of mass production and a high level of quality control. Consequently, the cost of the precast substructure will be reduced. With the high level of quality control attainable in a precast plant, high performance concrete can be used. This results in more durable substructure units with higher quality and better finish. The higher strength of high performance concrete allows the use of hollow sections. Hollow sections result in material savings, lower hauling and erection weights, and decreased foundation costs. In this paper, the design of post tensioned segmental straddle <b>bent</b> type <b>piers</b> is presented. An Excel Spreadsheet was developed for the design. The features of the spreadsheet discussed also describe the design procedure adopted. The efficient use of the spreadsheet shows that these piers can be routinely designed without complicated and expensive computer programs. The sequence of pier construction is also provided...|$|R

In this study effectiveness of partially concrete-filled steel tubes (CFST) in rigid-frame bridge <b>pier</b> <b>bents</b> is examined {{in terms of their}} ultimate strength and ductility performances. The columns and beam of frames consist of an un-stiffened rectangular-shaped steel section. Pushover analyses of single columns and rigid-frames were carried out using beam-column elements associated with nonlinear stress-strain relations for both concrete and steel. The effect of filled-in height of single columns was first examined by comparing the ultimate displacement and the ultimate strength determined using an available failure criterion established for cantilever type concrete-filled steel columns. The optimum concrete-filled height of the single columns was found to be around 0. 30 times the column height. The pushover analyses were carried out for three rigid-frames having different filled-in heights. The ultimate displacement and the ultimate strength of concrete-filled rigid-frame were significantly higher than those of the hollow section frame. The optimum filled-in height of rigid-frames was found to be around 0. 15 times the total height of the frame...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} ASR/DEF on the D-regions of {{structures}} are investigated {{by means of}} a dual experimental and analytical modeling program. Four near full scale specimens that represent cantilever and straddle <b>pier</b> <b>bents,</b> that are representative of typical bridges in Texas, are constructed, conditioned over time, and tested to failure. The undamaged first specimen serves as the control specimen, while the next two are tested after eight months and two years of field conditioning through the Texas heat along with supplemental water aimed at promoting ASR/DEF. The fourth remains to be tested within the next three years. In the two specimens subjected to deterioration, early formation of ASR gel is observed, and with time load-induced cracks along with other additional cracks are observed. These additional cracks are a result of the continued formation of ASR gel, which causes the concrete to swell, and in turn puts the reinforcing steel into a state of active prestress. It is observed that the failure mechanism in all the specimens is a brittle shear failure through the beam-column joint. Specimens with ASR/DEF deterioration show greater stiffness and strength, and slightly greater ductility...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A seismic {{vulnerability}} {{evaluation method}} based on structural analysis for RC bridges with simple <b>pier</b> <b>bents</b> is {{proposed in the}} paper. The proposed method {{is based on the}} hypothesis of the flexible pier-rigid deck behavior of the structure subjected to transversal seismic loads. A flexible pier-rigid deck simplified model was therefore developed. This model has been chosen after verifying the correlation between the responses of the proposed model and of the real structure which was presented by Egyptian General Authority of Roads and Bridges. The damage produced by the earthquake load is centered on the piers of the bridge, while the dynamic study of the deck can be performed after the structural analysis of the piers in an uncoupled way. The maximum damage of the piers under seismic actions is the principal aim of the proposed structural evaluation methodology. A damage index is used for this purpose, which describes the state of the material at each point of the structure. The study success to present the fragility curves which show that the peak ground acceleration for 50 % probability of exceeding slight, moderate and sever damage ranges from approximately 0. 15 to 0. 4 g for this typical and repeated RC bridge in Egypt...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the influence of temperature changes on integral abutment bridge movements, thirty-two Sokkia RS 30 N reflective targets were strategically attached to a bridge along its length. These targets were surveyed every month for twelve consecutive months. These changes in length coincided with restraint conditions between purely fixed and simply supported. Movement of expansion joints was also recorded. The movements of the expansion gaps at opposite corners appear to exhibit similar movements. This behavior indicates a type of twisting motion occurring within the bridge {{as a result of}} unequal movements at the east and west sides of each abutment. This motion suggests that the bridge abutments experience forces that incite weak axis bending in the abutments, especially in the north abutment. These quantitative bridge movements were compared to predicted behavior from a finite-element model. A detailed finite-element model of the bridge was created using SAP 2000 (Computers and Structures, Inc.) software. The detailed model was developed using solid elements for all components of the bridge except <b>piles</b> and <b>bents.</b> Longitudinal surface springs were placed at the abutment elements in order to simulate the soil-abutment interaction. A typical temperature load was assigned to the bridge deck and girder elements to compare the calculated stress concentrations in the model with the observed cracking on the abutment. The model produced high stress concentrations in the abutment adjacent to the bottom girder flange. This corresponded to the same location of observed cracking. The finite-element model also showed lateral movement of the north abutment. This lateral abutment contributed to the unequal movements of the bridge spans. Once the comparison between the measured bridge behavior of the survey and the findings of the detailed finite element model was completed, a simplified model was used to evaluate the bending moment and stresses in the abutment of the 400 South Street Bridge. The simplified model was also used to perform a parametric study on the influence of skew, span length, and temperature gradient on weak-axis abutment moments...|$|R
5000|$|The {{unofficial}} {{start of}} the series was in 1973 in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. A group of drivers began racing on a road course owned by former NASCAR Cup owner Bill Ellis. Ellis decided not to continue after a few races. The drivers decided to format an association called the Baby Grand National Racing Association, Inc. (BGNRA), and appointed Charlie Triplett as president. Triplett says the name stemmed from the cars' resemblance to the Grand National (now Sprint Cup) cars of the era, as paint schemes and numbers often matched those from Grand National cars. The series was originally a touring series of 4-cylinder compact sedan cars. The slogan for the series was [...] "The Poor Man's Way to Race." [...] The founder turned to NASCAR to begin sanctioning the series in 1975. The series flourished with the relatively inexpensive cars and motors. It was not uncommon for forty drivers to enter an event. Five-time champion Dean Combs used a Datsun 200 SX in the 1980 season, {{and became the first}} NASCAR driver to 'regularly' compete in a foreign-made car. Contrary to popular belief, foreign cars had competed in NASCAR competition {{in the early days of}} the sanctioning body; indeed, a Jaguar won a NASCAR-sanctioned race in the Grand National division (predecessor to the modern Sprint Cup Series) at a road course in Linden, New Jersey in 1954, according to commentator Mike Joy, and the last foreign-made car to compete in a NASCAR-sanctioned event was an MG at one Grand National race in 1963 (before Toyota entered the Nextel Cup Series at the beginning of the 2007 season.) Now called ISCARS DASH Touring, the series is still a great place for young drivers to gain valuable experience competing against seasoned veterans like Danny Bagwell, Geoff Bodine, Johnny Chapman, Jake and Justin Hobgood all of which have experience at the top levels of NASCAR. 1986 Daytona 500 Champion Geoffrey Bodine joined the circuit in 2008 to compete in the final four events. ISCARS plans to highlight Bodine's involvement as part of an extensive driver development program. Bagwell is well known for a destructive accident in '99 at Daytona when the vehicle hit the wall and tumbled repeatedly. It ended up upside down, the engine was gone, all the wheels were out, the windshield, and the sheetmetal distinagrated. All that was left was a <b>pile</b> of <b>bent</b> safety bars. Also in this series was the only car ever to careen into Lake Lloyd, Dave Stacey in 1994.|$|R
40|$|Local scour around bridge {{foundations}} {{has been}} {{recognized as one of}} the main causes of bridge failures. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationships among field, laboratory, and numerical data for the purpose of improving scour prediction methods for complex bridge piers. In this study, three field sites in Georgia were selected for continuous monitoring and associated laboratory models were fabricated with physical scale ratios that modeled the full river and bridge cross sections to consider the effect of river bathymetry and bridge geometry. Three different sizes of sediment and several geometric scales of the bridge pier models were used in this study to investigate the scaling effect of relative sediment size, which is defined as the ratio of the pier width to the median sediment size. The velocity field for each bridge model was measured by the acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) to explain the complicated hydrodynamics of the flow field around bridge piers as guided by the results from a numerical model. In each physical model with river bathymetry, the comparison between the results of laboratory experiments and the measurements of prototype bridge pier scour showed good agreement for the maximum pier scour depth at the nose of the pier as well as for the velocity distribution upstream of each bridge <b>pier</b> <b>bent.</b> Accepted scour prediction formulae were evaluated by comparison with extensive laboratory and field data. The effect of relative sediment size on the local pier scour depth was examined and a modified relationship between the local pier scour depth and the relative sediment size was presented.

40|$|Simplified {{methods of}} seismic verification, using {{equivalent}} single {{degree of freedom}} systems for the response prediction, {{have been the subject}} of great emphasis on research in the field of earthquake engineering particularly since the mid- 1990 s. This interest is justified still today by the great uncertainty characterizing the prediction of the seismic response: the variability of the parameters influencing the structural capacity and the seismic input definition, makes the use of sophisticated models not always effective and warranted. Furthermore, the extensive use of Non Linear Time-History (NLTH) analyses requires a calibration of the hysteretic model parameters and ground motions that seems still to date hardly applicable to day to day engineering practice. At the same time in last decade the design for earthquake resistance has undergone a critical review, triggered by the concept of Performance-Based Design. Performance objectives represent the attainment of certain damage levels for a given seismic intensity, and it has been widely recognized that the damage measure for a structure is directly related to deformations: displacements are the fundamental index of structural damage in seismic events and the achievement of the target displacement in relation to the different limit states should be the main objective of the verification procedure. Displacement-Based methods for seismic verification of structures hold together the two aspects evidenced so far, being simplified procedures which rely on a substitute SDOF structure and use as reference control parameter the target limit displacement for the system under exam. At present Displacement-Based Design (DBD) methods for new structures have reached a degree of formalization almost complete, with the recent publication of a Model Code for their adoption into seismic codes (Calvi and Sullivan, 2009). However, several aspects related to the method calibration are still matter of research, being the representativeness of the substitute linear structure a critical issue, in particular the formulation of equivalent viscous damping and the definition of the target displacement profile for a given structural system. With regard to the appraisal of existing structures, the development of Displacement-Based Assessment (DBA) approach represents the state of the art of research in this field, since so far the calibration of the methods dealt essentially with new structures only. The specific problems of the development of DBA methodologies include the prediction of the possible collapse mechanisms due to brittle rupture of members (which may be substantially different from those of the new ductile structures, designed following capacity design criteria), and the inclusion of local damage effects caused by nodes not adequately confined. In this context the research activity focuses on the evaluation, calibration and development of simplified Displacement-Based approaches for seismic verification of bridge structures, with particular reference to their use in a probabilistic framework, represented by vulnerability analyses and risk calculation on a large scale. In the first part the thesis addresses the methodological aspects of the DBD procedures focusing on the error sources of the simplified methods. In particular the current design methods for new structures with flexural ductile behaviour are evaluated, with reference to the formulations of the equivalent viscous damping and target displacement profile to be adopted in the analysis. A first study investigates the accuracy of the current Direct Displacement-Based Design (DDBD) procedure applied to simple SDOF systems (with specific reference to multi-span simply supported rc bridge piers), the main error sources being the approximation of the substitute linear structure characterized by the equivalent viscous damping, and the scaling of the displacement elastic spectrum through the modification damping factor. Using different formulations proposed in literature for equivalent viscous damping and spectrum reduction factor, a parametric study is carried out on an ample set of SDOF systems (previously designed with the DDBD method and subsequently verified with NLTH analyses), and an average error chart is obtained, allowing the prediction of the expected error for the design cases of multi-span simply supported bridge piers. A second work investigates the representativeness of the equivalent SDOF structure related to the estimation of the design displacement profile within a displacement-based framework. In the case of transverse response prediction for continuous rc girder bridges, the accuracy of the current iterative Direct Displacement-Based method (called DBD-IT in this work) is evaluated, and compared to an alternative direct design method (named DBD-DEM) herein proposed. The alternative methods combine in a non-iterative procedure the DBD framework with a Response Spectrum Analysis carried out with effective stiffness. In the second part the methodological aspects are addressed with regard to the specific issues of the existing bridge structures, not seismically designed (and not satisfying capacity design principles), and thus characterized by failure modes, limit states, hysteretic behaviour, and local ductility of the nodes that are different from those characterizing new seismically designed structures. In particular the calibration effort regards the assessment of pier capacity, piers generally representing the most vulnerable elements in existing bridges. A simplified numerical model is defined for the aggregation of phenomenological non linear shear behaviour and fiber representation of flexural behaviour for piers, calibrated by using experimental results on rc columns with flexure and shear failure extracted from on line databases (PEER database). A parametrical study is then developed for single bent and multiple <b>bent</b> <b>piers</b> (cantilever, walls frame), considering all main geometrical and material properties that can influence the pier capacity, aiming at the determination of the effective properties for existing rc bridge piers, to be used in a Displacement-Based framework. The effective ranges of the selected parameters were determined by a preliminary statistical analysis on the bridges of the reference database (the Veneto Region road network bridge stock, named VR stock). With regard to the appraisal of existing structures, the specific advantage in the use of simplified analytical procedures becomes apparent when a probabilistic seismic risk estimation is carried out on a large-scale. In this study, in the final part, the DBA method previously calibrated, is applied to assess the seismic vulnerability of the bridge stock under exam on a regional scale. A limited number of bridges are chosen as reference examples for each homogeneous subclass of multi-span bridges, comparing simplified DBA procedures with NLTH analyses for the development of analytical fragility curves, and an extensive vulnerability analysis for the class of multi-span rc bridges of the VR stock is then developed, using the previously calibrated DB fragility curves. Finally regional seismic risk maps are drafted including all the multi-span rc bridges of the VR stock, for three different scenarios of damage: the seismic risk is obtained by the convolution of hazard functions, defined on the base of the PGA exceedance probabilities provided by the current Italian seismic code, and the analytical fragility curves calculated with the Displacement-Based approaches. An immediate extension of the research on existing rc bridges, may be represented by the development of fragility curves for the whole classes of multi-span structures: these fragility functions could be obtained considering the variability in the range of geometrical and mechanical characteristics obtained from the statistical analysis of the VR database for that specific classes, and the envelope curves obtained could than be applied for the vulnerability evaluation of typical bridges of the Italian or European stocks. A long-term development of the work may regard the extension of the simplified Displacement-Based procedures to the evaluation of different classes of structures, particularly of single span rc bridges and masonry arch bridges, which represent the other major category of existing bridges, to complete as much as possible the scenario of seismic risk for the infrastructure network under examination. In this context it will be possible to calibrate the seismic input for risk analysis through the use of hazard curves, obtained from micro-zonation studies in the areas of interest. ...|$|R
40|$|Bridge {{foundations}} must {{be designed}} based on acceptable risks of failure. To secure rapid implementation of Load Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) principles for foundation design, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) are requiring their use through AASHTO code. The Bridge Section of the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) has responsibility for satisfactory design {{of all the}} bridge structures across the state’s highway system. The widespread geotechnical adoption of the LRFD code throughout state DOTs has been difficult {{in the case of}} deep foundations due to regional differences and in some cases a lack of any close match to DOT foundation practices. This lack of matching stems from the source research conducted on which the code is based, documented as NCHRP 507. For ODOT, the evaluation of nominal axial static capacity for each driven pile in the field is conducted by dynamic methods and AASHTO offers resistance factors for these techniques. ODOT typically uses the wave equation software (WEAP) applied at the end of initial driving, EOID, and occasionally at the beginning of pile restrike (BOR) to capture increases in capacity from set-up. This study reports that, based on past and new surveys, ODOT practice is reasonably typical for DOT practice in sands, silts, and clays. The AASHTO resistance factor, φ, for WEAP is at EOID and is too low for the efficient design of piles to match the likely probabilities of pile failure. The survey of Northwest state DOTs revealed that 80 % of the DOTs believe that a φ of 0. 4 is conservative and 37. 5 % do not use the AASHTO-sanctioned φ of 0. 4. Matching LRFD to allowable stress design (ASD) by direct calibration for a single pile, without any reported capacity bias, sets φ as 0. 55 to match the ASD factor of safety of 2. 5. An ODOT case history of a recently completed pilesupported bridge designed and constructed to FHWA and AASHTO ASD standards in use at that time, shows the number of <b>piles</b> at the <b>bent</b> studied would be doubled under new AASHTO requirements. This suggests the standard will add considerable pile foundation costs to all new bridges. This cost increase is a strong incentive to complete statistical recalibration of GRLWEAP dynamic capacity resistance value in a Phase 2 of this study...|$|R
