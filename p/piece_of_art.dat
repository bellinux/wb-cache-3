5|$|The Doctor learns Scaroth {{threatens to}} destroy Paris if Romana does not {{continue}} the work. He tries {{to gain the}} Countess' help by showing the Count's true form, but he kills her. Romana completes the adjustments, and Scaroth uses it {{to travel to the}} past. The Doctor quickly ushers Romana and Duggan to the TARDIS, fearing that the ship's explosion was the spark that started the development of life on Earth, and if Scaroth should prevent it, humanity would not come about. They arrive it time for Duggan to knock Scaroth out before he can reach the ship. Scaroth's body returns to the present, and when his alien form is discovered by his bodyguard, they get into a fight that damages the equipment and sets the mansion on fire, killing them both. By the time the Doctor, Romana and Duggan arrive, the original Mona Lisa and 5 of the 6 copies have been burnt, but the last copy remains safe. Duggan argues that they've lost an invaluable <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> but the Doctor assures him that the copy, still done by da Vinci's hand, will go unnoticed, and that art is worthless if its monetary value is all that matters. The Doctor and Romana say goodbye to Duggan at the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

25|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the collection is Le Rêve, the Picasso portrait that was the working name of the resort project.

Cohen for $139 million, which would at that time have been the highest price paid for any <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> However, he put his elbow through the canvas while showing it to a group of guests—including the screenwriter Nora Ephron and her husband Nick Pileggi, the broadcaster Barbara Walters, the art dealer Serge Sorokko and his wife, the model Tatiana Sorokko, the New York socialite Louise Grunwald, and the lawyer David Boies and his wife, Mary.|$|E

25|$|During the Great Depression the Public Works Administration {{often used}} Art Deco {{elements}} in a primarily classical and monumental framework. The Visalia Town Center US Post Office thus presages the style and aesthetic of much subsequent government architecture in the thirties. This style of architecture was commonly used in private projects in the 1920s and {{is often associated with}} decadently luxurious shops and hotels, though by the time the Town Center Post Office was built the Depression had halted most of these private projects. Although the Visalia Post Office uses Art Deco ornamental motifs, the structure is more of a monolithic monument than a pretty <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> a characteristic typical of Government construction in the period in which it was built.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} 191st Street station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} subway system. The station was completely renovated in 2003–2004 by the New York City Transit Authority. All of the deteriorating tiles and mosaics were replaced with exact reproductions of the originals made by Serpentile, a company that does reproductions of original subway motifs. The tiles are all unglazed porcelain a half inch wide. Each of the 72 columns had to be plastered and prepared for four-sided mosaics that wrap around each one. There are 72 vertical panels, and over 3500 linear feet of mosaics. New York City Transit construction crews did all of the tile and installation work. The station {{is also home to}} a mosaic tile <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> titled Primavera by Raul Colon, accessible from the St. Nicholas Ave entrance to the station, or via the access tunnel on Broadway.|$|E
25|$|Early Abbasid {{painting}} has not {{survived in}} great quantities, and sometimes harder to differentiate; however Samarra {{is a good}} example as it was built by the Abbasids and abandoned 56 years later. The walls of the principal rooms of the palace that has been excavated show wall paintings and lively carved stucco dadoes. The style is obviously adopted with little variation from Sassanian art, as not only the styles is similar with harems, animals, and dancing people, all enclosed in scrollwork, but also the garments are Persian. Nishapur had its own school of painting. Excavations at Nishapur show artwork both monochrome and polychrome from the 8th and 9th centuries. One famous <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> consists of hunting nobles with falcons and on horseback, in full regalia; the clothing identifies him as Tahirid, which was again, a sub-dynasty of the Abbasids. Other styles are of vegetation, and fruit in nice colors on a four foot high dedo.|$|E
