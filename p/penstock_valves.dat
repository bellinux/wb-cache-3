50|$|In a major {{disaster}} at the project site, which occurred 17 September 2007, {{one of the}} <b>penstock</b> <b>valves</b> burst causing the death of 7 people, destroying 15 houses, and damaging 150 acre of crops. The reason attributed to the pipe burst is the loosening of the flange bolt connection. The damaged valve was rectified in July 2009.|$|E
50|$|Firewater is {{the runoff}} {{when you have}} a fire, this is a {{cocktail}} of water, foam and whatever you were storing. It can be deadly and have a major impact to the environment should it escape from your site. Hence, key in the Directive is an Environmental Management System EMS that to contain spills and firewater on their site for safe disposal later. Trawl the internet and you will find some good examples of automatic spill and firewater containment systems that use the drains on the site a high capacity storage vessels. These systems tend to use inflatable pneumatic bladders, lockable flap valves or motorised <b>penstock</b> <b>valves</b> to seal the site. Sandbags and spill kits can also be used but these are really only suitable for low volume spills and certainly are dangerous to deploy when hazardous substances or fires are involved.|$|E
40|$|The {{depletion}} of fossil resources {{drive up the}} price of electrical energy in Indonesia, so that the necessary sources of renewable energy as an alternative energy source, one of which is the potential energy in the water that makes it possible to build power plant that has the basic components such as tranquilizers tub, settling basin, channel carrier, <b>penstock,</b> <b>valve,</b> nozzle, turbine, and generator. To support the development of the facilities available at the power plant, there is currently providing the <b>penstock</b> <b>valve</b> on the pipe opening and closing automatically according to frequency, so the frequency remains constant at the desired value. From there we plan to make, and model the controller panel which will then connect to the dc motor in the gearbox on the ball valve that can be opened and closed automatically based on frequency, and the result is the greater burden given the frequency will remain constant at 7 Hz (setpoint), while the ball valve will open approximately 90...|$|R
40|$|In {{the event}} of an {{instantaneous}} valve closure, the pressure transmitted to a surge tank induces the mass fluctuations that can cause high amplitude of water-level fluctuation in the surge tank for a reasonable cross-sectional area. The height of the surge tank is then designed using this high water level mark generated by the completely closed <b>penstock</b> <b>valve.</b> Using a conical surge tank with a non-constant cross-sectional area can resolve the problems of space and height. When ad-dressing issues in designing open surge tanks, key parameters are usually calculated by using complex equations, which may become cumbersome when multiple iterations are required. A more effective alternative in obtaining these values is the use of simple charts. Firstly, this paper presents and describes the equations used to design open conical surge tanks. Secondly, it intro-duces user-friendly charts {{that can be used in}} the design of cylindrical and conical open surge tanks. The contribution can be a benefit for practicing engineers in this field. A case study is also presented to illustrate the use of these design charts. The case studyâ€™s results show that key pa-rameters obtained via successive approximation method required 26 iterations or complex calcu...|$|R
40|$|Biogas {{generation}} {{is one of}} the most promising renewable energy sources in Ghana. Anaerobic digestion {{is one of the}} effective ways of generating biogas. Anaerobic digestion is also a reliable method for wastewater treatment and the digestion the effluent can be used as fertilizer to enhance the fertility of the soil. This paper looks at the possibility of constructing a biogas plant at the KNUST sewage treatment plant tapping its feedstock the sludge at the Primary Sedimentation Tank to generate biogas. A laboratory experiment was done to determine the faecal sludge quality. The flowrate of the sludge was estimated based on the number of times the <b>penstocks</b> (<b>valves)</b> are operated to desludge the sewage which also depends on whether the university is on vacation (35. 72 m 3 /day) or in session (71. 44 m 3 /day). These parameters were used to determine the biogas potential of the sewage using 10, 20 and 30 days retention time for plant sizes of 540 m 3, 1100 m 3 and 1600 m 3 respectively. It was estimated that 170, 719 m 3, 341, 858 m 3 and 419, 458 m 3 of methane can be produced in a year and the power production was estimated to be 50 kW, 100 kW and 120 kW for the 540 m 3, 1100 m 3 and 1600 m 3 digester sizes respectively...|$|R
50|$|The valve {{is housed}} within a bulged {{section of the}} <b>penstock</b> pipe. The <b>valve</b> {{mechanism}} forms a cylindrical body within this pipe, with the water flowing around it. This downstream section of this valve body is conical and free to move axially. When it moves downstream, it seals against a conical surface at the outlet of the valve, closing off the flow. When closed, the valve is held shut by the supply water pressure, providing a good seal.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an analytical investigation of water hammer in a hydraulic pressurized pipe {{system with a}} throttled surge chamber located at the junction between a tunnel and a <b>penstock,</b> and a <b>valve</b> positioned at the downstream end of the penstock. Analytical formulas of maximum water hammer pressures at the downstream {{end of the tunnel}} and the valve were derived for a system subjected to linear and slow valve closure. The analytical results were then compared with numerical ones obtained using the method of characteristics. There is agreement between them. The formulas can be applied to estimating water hammer pressure at the valve and transmission of water hammer pressure through the surge chamber at the junction for a hydraulic pipe system with a surge chamber...|$|R

40|$|Since {{many years}} the EPFL Laboratory of Electrical Machines {{develops}} SIMSEN, a numerical software {{package for the}} simulation of electrical power systems and adjustable speed drives, in transient and steady-state conditions, having an arbitrary topology. SIMSEN {{is based on a}} collection of modules, each corresponding to one system component (machines, converters, transformers, control devices, etc.). For more information, one refers to: [URL] This contribution presents the extension of SIMSEN to the hydraulic components of a hydroelectric power plant including pump-turbine, <b>valve,</b> <b>penstock,</b> surge tank, gallery, reservoir etc. The basic idea is to define for each hydraulic component an equivalent electric component which can be introduced in the existing electric version of SIMSEN. Doing this, it becomes possible to use the modularity of the electric version to define the complete topology of the hydroelectric power plant and the connected electrical network. This extension makes possible a numerical simulation taking precisely into account the interactions between the hydraulic and the electric parts of the system during transients. It is therefore useful for transient and stability analyses {{as well as for the}} design optimization...|$|R
