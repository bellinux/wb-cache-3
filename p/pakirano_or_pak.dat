40|$|The p 21 -activated kinase (PAK) serine/threonine kinases are {{important}} effectors {{of the small}} GTPases Rac and Cdc 42, and play significant roles in controlling cell growth, motility, and transformation. Knockdown of <b>PAK</b> 4 <b>or</b> <b>PAK</b> 1 inhibited the proliferation of mutant KRAS or BRAF colon cancer cells in vitro. Dependence on <b>PAK</b> 4 <b>or</b> <b>PAK</b> 1 protein for colon cancer cell proliferation was independent of <b>PAK</b> 4 <b>or</b> <b>PAK</b> 1 protein expression levels. Mutant KRAS HCT 116 colorectal cells were the most sensitive to <b>PAK</b> 4 <b>or</b> <b>PAK</b> 1 knockdown resulting in the potent inhibition of anchorage-dependent and-independent proliferation {{as well as the}} formation and proliferation ofHCT 116 colon cancer spheroids. This inhibition of proliferation did not correlate with inhibition of RAF/MEK/ ERK or PI 3 K/AKT signaling. In HCT 116 cells, knockdown of <b>PAK</b> 4 <b>or</b> <b>PAK</b> 1 caused changes to the actin cytoskeleton resulting in reduced basal spread and cell elongation and increased cell rounding. These cytoskeletal rearrangements seemed to be independent of LIMK/cofilin/paxillin phosphorylation. <b>PAK</b> 4 <b>or</b> <b>PAK</b> 1 knockdown initially induced growth arrest in HCT 116 cells followed by cell death at later time points. Inhibition of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl- 2 and Bcl-XL with the pharmacologic inhibitor ABT- 737 increased effector caspase activation and apoptosis, and reduced cell survival with <b>PAK</b> 4 <b>or</b> <b>PAK</b> 1 knockdown. These results support a role for the PAKs in the proliferation of mutant KRAS-driven colorectal carcinoma cells via pathways not involving RAF/MEK/ERK and PI 3 K/AKT signaling.

50|$|In Indonesian, the T-V {{distinction}} is extremely important; addressing a stranger with the pronoun kau or kamu (you) is considered rude and impolite (unless the stranger is, for example, a child). When addressing a stranger or someone older, typically Bu ('ma'am') <b>or</b> <b>Pak</b> ('sir') is used. People also use mas (Javanese for 'older brother') or mbak (Javanese for 'older sister') when addressing someone {{that is not}} {{old enough to be}} called Bu <b>or</b> <b>Pak.</b> There are variations in different areas. If the situation is more formal, such as in meetings or news broadcasting, Anda is always used, even if those addressed would otherwise be addressed by kau or kamu in informal situations. A more informal pronoun, written lu, lo, or sometimes as loe (originated from Hokkien language) is considered very impolite. This is normally used by teenagers (particularly in urban centers) to their peers. Adults can sometimes be heard using this pronoun with their close friends or when they are angry.|$|R

40|$|Cervical carcinomas are {{initiated}} {{through a}} series of well-defined stages that rely on the expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes. A panel of 100 small hairpin RNAs that target essential kinases in many tumor types was used to study the stepwise appearance of kinase requirements during cervical tumor development. Twenty-six kinases were commonly required in three cell lines derived from frank carcinomas, and each kinase requirement was traced to the specific stage in which the requirement emerged. Six kinases became required following HPV-induced immortalization, and the requirement for two kinases, SGK 2 and PAK 3, was mapped to the inactivation of p 53 in primary human epithelial cells. Loss of the p 53 tumor suppressor in other primary epithelial cells also induced dependence on SGK 2 and PAK 3. Hence, SGK 2 and PAK 3 provide important cellular functions following p 53 inactivation, fulfilling the classical definition of synthetic lethality; loss of p 53, SGK 2, <b>or</b> <b>PAK</b> 3 alone has little effect on cell viability, whereas loss of p 53 together with either SGK 2 <b>or</b> <b>PAK</b> 3 loss leads to cell death. Whereas tumor suppressor gene mutations are not directly druggable, other proteins or pathways that become obligatory to cell viability following tumor suppressor loss provide theoretical targets for tumor suppressor-specific drug discovery efforts. The kinases SGK 2 and PAK 3 may thus represent such targets for p 53 -specific drug development...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ERK {{signaling}} regulates focal adhesion disassembly during cell movement, {{and increased}} ERK signaling frequently contributes to enhanced motility of human tumor cells. We previously {{found that the}} ERK scaffold MEK Partner 1 (MP 1) is required for focal adhesion disassembly in fibroblasts. Here we test the hypothesis that MP 1 -dependent ERK signaling regulates motility of DU 145 prostate cancer cells. We find that MP 1 is required for motility on fibronectin, but not for motility stimulated by serum or EGF. Surprisingly, MP 1 appears not to function through its known binding partners MEK 1 <b>or</b> <b>PAK</b> 1, suggesting {{the existence of a}} novel pathway by which MP 1 can regulate motility on fibronectin.

40|$|Stimulation of p 21 -activated kinase- 1 (Pak 1) {{signaling}} promotes motility, invasiveness, anchorage-independent {{growth and}} abnormal mitotic assembly in human breast cancer cells. Here, we provide new evidence that, before {{the onset of}} mitosis, activated Pak 1 is specifically localized with the chromosomes during prophase and on the centrosomes in metaphase and moves to the contraction ring during cytokinesis. To identify mitosis-specific substrates of Pak 1, we screened a synchronized G 2 –M expression library by using a glutathione transferase Pak 1 solid-phase-based kinase reaction. This analysis identified histone H 3 as a substrate of Pak 1 both in vitro and in vivo, and it specifically interacted with Pak 1 but not <b>Pak</b> 2 <b>or</b> <b>Pak</b> 3. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Pak 1 phosphorylates histone H 3 on Ser 10. Expressions of the wild-type, <b>or</b> catalytically active, <b>Pak</b> 1 caused it to appear at the poles corresponding to mitotic centrosomes in a variety of mammalian cells. Together, these results suggest {{for the first time that}} Pak 1 interacts with and phosphorylates histone H 3 and may thus influence the Pak 1 –histone H 3 pathway, which in turn may influence mitotic events in breast cancer cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRho GTPases are {{essential}} regulators of cytoskeletal reorganization, but {{how they do}} so during neuronal morphogenesis in vivo is poorly understood.

Cofilin function in axon growth is inhibited by LIM kinase and activated by Slingshot phosphatase. Dephosphorylating cofilin {{appears to be the}} major function of Slingshot in regulating axon growth in vivo. Genetic data provide evidence that Rho or Rac/Cdc 42, via effector kinases Rok <b>or</b> <b>Pak,</b> respectively, activate LIM kinase to inhibit axon growth. Importantly, Rac also activates a Pak-independent pathway that promotes axon growth, and different RacGEFs regulate these distinct pathways. These genetic analyses reveal convergent and divergent pathways from Rho GTPases to the cytoskeleton during axon growth in vivo and suggest that different developmental outcomes could be achieved by biases in pathway selection...|$|R
