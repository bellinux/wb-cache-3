One {{example of this}} is a new type of precast carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) pretensioned HPSCC panel intended as load-bearing panels for building envelopes. As for all load-bearing structural members in building applications, the performance of these members in fire must be understood before they can be used with confidence. In particular, the bond performance of CFRP <b>prestressing</b> <b>reinforcement</b> at elevated temperatures is not well known.

40|$|The use of {{stainless}} steel alloys in reinforced concrete structures has shown great success in mitigating corrosion {{in even the most}} severe of exposures. However, the use of high-strength stainless steels (HSSSs) for corrosion mitigation in prestressed concrete (PSC) structures has received limited attention. To address these deficiencies in knowledge, an experimental study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using HSSSs for corrosion mitigation in PSC. The study examined mechanical behavior, corrosion resistance, and techniques for the production of HSSS prestressing strands. Stainless steel grades 304, 316, 2101, 2205, 2304, and 17 - 7 along with a 1080 prestressing steel control were included in the study. Tensile strengths of 1250 to 1550 MPa (181 to 225 ksi) were achieved in the cold-drawn HSSSs. 1000 hr stress relaxation of all candidate HSSSs was predicted to be between 6 and 8 % {{based on the results of}} 200 hr tests conducted at 70 % of the ultimate tensile strength. Residual stresses due to the cold drawing had a significant influence on stress vs. strain behavior and stress relaxation. Electrochemical corrosion testing found that in solutions simulating alkaline concrete, all HSSSs showed exceptional corrosion resistance at chloride (Cl-) concentrations from zero to 0. 25 M. However, when exposed to solutions simulating carbonated concrete, corrosion resistance was reduced and the only HSSSs with acceptable corrosion resistance were duplex grades 2205 and 2304, with 2205 resistant to corrosion initiation at Cl- concentrations up to 1. 0 M (twice that in seawater). Based on these results, duplex grades 2205 and 2304 were identified as optimal HSSSs and were included in additional studies which found that: (1) 2304 is susceptible to corrosion when tested in a stranded geometry, (2) 2205 and 2304 are not susceptible to stress corrosion cracking, and (3) 2205 and 2304 are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Efforts focused on the production of 2205 and 2304 prestressing strands showed that they could be produced as strands using existing ASTM A 416 prestressing strand production facilities. Due to the ferromagnetic properties of 2205 and 2304, a low-relaxation heat treatment was found to be a viable option to reduce stress relaxation and improve mechanical properties. The overall conclusion of the study was that HSSSs, especially duplex grades 2205 and 2304, show excellent promise to mitigate corrosion if utilized as <b>prestressing</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in PSC structures exposed to severe marine environments.

40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{reinforcements}} {{embedded in concrete}} elements is generally {{known as one of}} the most common reasons that shorten the service life of the structures. The present study aims to contribute in overcoming this problem by replacing steel stirrups as shear reinforcement of concrete beams using a steel fiber reinforced self-compacting concrete (SFRSCC). In the present research the potential of SFRSCC for improving the shear resistance of the beams without stirrups is explored. In order to further reduce the risk of corrosion in this type of beams, a hybrid system of flexural reinforcement composed of a steel strand and GFRP rebars is applied and properly arranged in order to assure a relatively thick concrete cover for the steel reinforcement. The GFRP bars are placed with the minimum cover thickness for providing the maximum internal arm and, consequently, mobilizing efficiently their relatively high tensile strength. The effectiveness of applying different dosages of steel fibers and varying the prestress force to improve the shear behavior of the designed beam are evaluated. By considering the obtained experimental results, the predictive performance of a constitutive model (plastic-damage multidirectional fixed smeared crack model) implemented in a FEM-based computer program, as well as the one from three analytical formulations for estimating shear resistance of the developed beams were assessed. The FEM-based simulations have provided a good prediction of the deformational response and cracking behavior of the tested beams. All the analytical formulations demonstrated acceptable accuracy for design purposes, but the one proposed by CEB-FIP Modal Code 2010 predicts more conservative shear resistance.

40|$|Since the 1970 ?s {{concrete}} railroad ties {{have become}} more and more prominent in the railroad industry. Their improved durability and increased safety over traditional timber ties has paved the way for new and more efficient concrete ties to be developed. Prestressing with steel strands was a key design aspect in providing the strength the ties needed to overcome the tonnage seen in heavy haul lines spread across the United States and the world. A major flaw seen with these concrete ties is deterioration due to environment or fatigue loading under the connected rail. This deterioration can lead to a change in gauge of the track structure which can then cause derailment of trains. A second issue found in concrete ties that was not found in timber is the electrical conductivity. Timber is a highly insulating material while concrete possesses insulating and conductive properties based on the amount of moisture present. This is an issue because track structures use the steel rails to carry electrical signals to detect the presence of a train within a signaled block. During construction, the steel strands may come into contact with the embedded steel shoulders {{on both sides of the}} tie, therefore creating a direct circuit that needs to be insulated from the steel rails. Aramid fiber-reinforced polymer bars have shown promise, as an electrical non-conductive material, to fix the problem of false signaling due to electrical shorts. AFRP is a composite material made of Kevlar fibers bound in a polymer resin. This material has a tensile strength of approximately 200 ksi and has been investigated for use as a replacement for steel in such structures as concrete bridge girders and decks. The objective of this research is to design and test new concrete railroad ties utilizing AFRP as the prestressing material. Four of these ties were constructed and tested for strength following the guidelines provided by the American Railroad Engineering and Maintenance-of-way Association (AREMA). Bending tests at the rail seat section and center section of the tie were performed to prove strength adequacy, and electrical resistivity tests were performed to prove insulation from the current in the rails. The AFRP ties showed to have over twice the electrical resistance of their steel counterparts with 2. 42 M? of resistance compared to 1. 11 M?. The strength comparison proved inconclusive, for although the ties did not fail, they did not meet AREMA cracking requirements for strength. A major factor that was seen was in the method of testing AREMA provides, through improved testing procedures, AFRP shows to be very promising as a full replacement of steel as <b>prestressing</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for concrete railroad ties...|$|E
40|$|The {{durability}} of prestressed concrete structures in marine environments is of increasing concern. Traditionally, emphasis {{of research on}} this topic {{has been placed on}} the chloride diffusivity and permeability of the cement paste in order to increase the service life of prestressed concrete structures, while the characteristics and properties of the aggregate and steel reinforcement has received limited attention. This thesis encompasses two relatively unexplored topics regarding prestressed concrete durability in coastal regions. Recently, stainless steel alloys have been proposed to replace conventional <b>prestressing</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for concrete bridge piles in coastal regions in order to provide a 100 + year service life. Investigation of the performance of precast, prestressed concrete piles using duplex high-strength stainless steel (HSSS) 2205 prestressing strands and austenitic stainless steel (SS) 304 transverse, spiral reinforcement shows that these piles can be built following conventional construction procedures and driven to refusal without visible damage. Flexural and shear capacities of the piles are greater than predicted by AASHTO LRFD and ACI 318 specifications, while experimental prestress losses and development and transfer lengths are lower than values predicted by AASHTO LRFD. These results, in addition to the superior corrosion resistance providing a 100 + year service life, demonstrate that duplex HSSS 2205 can be used for prestressing strands in combination with austenitic SS 304 for the transverse confinement and shear reinforcement for prestressed concrete piles, using the same design requirements and construction procedures used for conventional prestressing strand and wire reinforcement. Additionally, this research evaluates the suitability of a sulfide- and sulfate-bearing aggregate obtained from a previously unexploited deposit in a coastal lowland region in Georgia. These sands produce low-pH condition in contact with moisture. Their impact on the early-age behavior, mechanical properties, and {{durability of}} cement-based materials is examined on mortar and concrete specimens. Results show a high variability of the composition of the sands and their performance when used in concrete and mortar, delays of the early-age hydration kinetics and setting time of mortar mixtures, earlier onset of reinforcement corrosion in structural concrete, and varied mechanical properties when acidic sands mined from the same source are used in concrete. The presence of sulfate and alkali feldspar minerals in the acidic sands was also shown to increase the potential of mortar mixtures to develop delayed ettringite formation (DEF) when exposed to high-temperature curing, such as during production in precast facilities. This thesis demonstrates that prestressed concrete bridge piles, reinforced with the proposed stainless steel alloys, can be effectively implemented in coastal regions but that aggregates from lowland coastal deposits may negatively impact the performance of cement-based materials. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the selection of reinforcement materials and aggregate should be examined as rigorously as the design elements (e. g., cementitious materials composition, concrete mixture proportions) more routinely assessed for marine structures.

This composite material is particularly useful for designs consisting of large spans where the dead load will cause significant cracking and deflection. Unlike mild steel <b>reinforcement,</b> <b>prestressing</b> steel is stressed and cause a compression force within the concrete. This prevents cracking {{and increases the}} structure’s capacity. A prestressed concrete member will also have a longer life expectancy due to the prevention of cracks. Without cracks the steel will not {{be exposed to the}} environment and therefore will be at a reduced risk of corrosion. The increased capacity, ability to sustain longer spans, and durability make this type of material an advantageous choice of construction. This paper investigates the residual properties of seven wire, uncoated, 0. 5 in. (12. 7 mm) and 0. 375 in. (9. 5 mm) diameter low relaxation grade 270 ksi (1862 MPa) prestressing tendon subjected to extreme temperature. The temperatures selected for the study were 500 °F (260 °C), 800 °F (427 °C), 1000 °F (538 °C), 1200 °F (649 °C), and 1300 °F (704 °C). The upper limit was defined by the furnace’s capability at Missouri S&T. In addition, control specimens were tested for each strand size. A control was defined as exposure to approximately 68 °F (20 °C). Two cooling methods were also investigated, namely inside the furnace and outside the furnace. Test results presented include visual observations, yield stress, ultimate load, and elastic modulus...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study was conducted}} to highlight key differences in the required amounts of <b>prestressing</b> and passive <b>reinforcement</b> for externally and internally prestressed box-girder bridges. The reinforcement is designed on the basis of combined serviceability and structural safety criteria for varying span length and girder slenderness. Under the assumptions of the study, the externally prestressed box-girder is shown to require up to 25 % more prestressing force for girder heights around 2 m. At girder heights above 3. 5 m however, internal prestressing becomes the more favorable type of prestressing. The study also shows that the externally prestressed girder tends to require more longitudinal and shear passive reinforcement in key design sections. 1...|$|R
40|$|Non-metallic {{reinforcement}} {{has many}} advantages, {{but there are}} some areas of application that need to be resolved to improve the usage of FRP reinforcement in real conditions. One of the disadvantages of FRP reinforcement is its lower modulus of elasticity, which leads to greater deflections of structures and can also cause early propagation of cracks. The paper deals with the possibility of eliminating this problem by <b>prestressing</b> the <b>reinforcement.</b> It covers several problems related to anchoring and current anchoring methods used world-wide. The paper also mentions some drawbacks of these methods. In an effort to bypass these drawbacks a new anchoring method has been developed. It differs in the way longitudinal forces are transferred from the bar to the surrounding concrete. Basically, {{it is based on the}} addition of an additional anchoring member (cylinder) on the surface. This member is made of polymers so the whole system remains completely steel-free and very simple to produce. Before using the system in real structures a series of tests were performed and the results are presented. Also, some prestressed test panels were prepared and compared with standard panels...|$|R
