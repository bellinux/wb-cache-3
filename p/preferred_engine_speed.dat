50|$|To {{maximize}} acceleration, the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of {{an automobile}} {{must be kept}} near that where maximum power is developed. For this reason, vehicles utilize transmissions; as the vehicle's speed increases such that the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> exceeds {{the speed at which}} maximum power is developed, the driver shifts to a higher (numerically lower ratio) gear, which reduces <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and allows continued acceleration.|$|R
5000|$|Overall, reduced <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> {{has benefited}} the sport {{because there is}} more racing, fewer {{accidents}} and breakdowns and racing fans get more value for their time and money invested in watching races. Costs across the board have dropped, and competition has increased. Still, Formula One is very much {{out of step with}} most [...] "mainstream" [...] motorsports where larger dispacement engines and lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> dominate. When compared to much larger engines producing much higher torque output at far lower <b>engines</b> <b>speeds</b> and powering much heavier vehicles to similar speeds, the diminishing returns of very high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and small displacements become apparent. And while many other motorsports, such as NASCAR, feature racing with the engines and cars spending the majority of their events at high speeds, Formula One cars spend much less time at full vehicle and <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> and typically the maximum <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> are seen while downshifting going into and exiting corners rather than in [...] "high gear" [...] for lengthy periods of time.|$|R

5000|$|... i-VTEC is {{the acronym}} for {{intelligent}} VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control), an evolution of Honda's VTEC engine. The i-VTEC engine works by controlling {{the timing and}} lifting of the camshafts depending on <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> The valves open a small amount during low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. The valves will open wider at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to achieve higher performance.|$|R
40|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} signals in the engine management system of a combustion engine. The signal is used to control the fuel injection, estimate the engine torque, and to generate reference values. Combustions in the cylinders result in the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> oscillating around a momentary average, and many applications are depending on stable estimates of this average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and the average acceleration. This thesis provides a signal model based method to estimate the momentary average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and acceleration. The estimation of momentary average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and acceleration is complicated by imperfections in the process of measuring the <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> Limited accuracy in the measurements causes quantization distortion in the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> signal. The effects of these errors are investigated and quantified. A signal model representing the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> is developed and used to estimate the momentary average and acceleration using a Kalman filter. The regular Kalman filter cannot provide estimates with low noise levels at steady state and at the same time be fast enough to track the signal during transient behavior. This problem is overcome by extending the Kalman filter with a change detection algorithm. While this signal model based method gives a satisfying result, it is computationally complex. To evaluate its performance, it is compared to a moving average FIR filter, which is computationally less expensive but does not succeed as well as the signal model based method in filtering out all oscillations...|$|R
50|$|The {{device is}} {{generally}} used over {{a range of}} <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to obtain power and torque curves for the engine, since there is a non-linear relationship between torque and <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> for most <b>engine</b> types.|$|R
5000|$|Engine builders, {{engineers}} and tuners read dynamometer results as {{a map of}} engine performance rather than a chart of data points. Since horsepower is calculated from torque and <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> {{at the point where}} torque output begins to drop and cannot be offset by increased <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> the <b>engine</b> is becoming less efficient and the horsepower output falls as a result. Beyond peak horsepower <b>speed,</b> additional <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> only wastes fuel and increases wear and tear on the engine and other powertrain components. Horsepower and high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> are grossly overestimated as indicators of performance in most applications, and high horsepower numbers that are dependent primarily upon <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> rather than torque output have to be offset by increasing torque via torque-converter design, transmission gearing, differential gearing and tire size so that available torque is used and multiplied most effectively.|$|R

Some engines also have an adjustable throttle by which the operator or the machine itself can alter the <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> Generally, the nominal [...] "throttle control" [...] does not directly control {{the opening of the}} carburetor throttle, but rather increases or decreases spring tension on the governor, which in turn regulates the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> higher or lower.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{investigation of the}} over-all performance of a simply constructed, short-life, turbojet engine was conducted.

The corrected <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> was varied from the minimum for good combustion to about 17, 000 rpm, which is approximately 75 percent of rated speed.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation to investigate the in-cylinder flow characteristics of 2 D combustion chamber for a hydrogen-fuelled four-stroke internal combustion engine. CFD simulation {{has been carried out}} using commercial CFD codes. The <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> was varied from 1000 to 3000 rpm, the range of equivalent ratio from 0. 6 to 1. 0 and the crank angle from 0 to 720 degrees in this study. The effect of the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and equivalence ratio on the flow-field characteristics and volumetric efficiency are investigated in the motoring condition. The increase of <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> gives a more efficient diffusion process for hydrogen and gives a more homogeneous air–fuel mixture structure. The characteristics of the flow-field are represented by the in-cylinder pressure and temperature distribution as well as the contours of the hydrogen mass fraction for different <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> The acquired results show the maximum in-cylinder temperature and pressure obtained of 650 K and 1. 143 MPa at the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of 3000 rpm respectively. It can be seen that the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and equivalence ratio are strongly related to the volumetric efficiency. The results show that the volumetric efficiency increases linearly with increase of the <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> but decreases with increase of the equivalence ratio. The results obtained from the simulation can be employed to examine the homogeneity of the air–fuel mixture structure for a better combustion process and engine performance...|$|R
50|$|The {{ignition}} timing {{will need to}} become increasingly advanced (relative to TDC) as the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> increases so that the air-fuel mixture has the correct {{amount of time to}} fully burn. As the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> (RPM) increases, the time available to burn the mixture decreases but the burning itself proceeds at the same speed, it needs to be started increasingly earlier to complete in time. Poor volumetric efficiency at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> also requires increased advancement of {{ignition timing}}. The correct timing advance for a given <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> will allow for maximum cylinder pressure to be achieved at the correct crankshaft angular position. When setting the timing for an automobile engine, the factory timing setting can usually be found on a sticker in the engine bay.|$|R
50|$|They are cam driven, and {{injection}} pressure {{is proportional to}} <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> This typically means that the highest {{injection pressure}} can only be achieved at the highest <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and the maximum achievable injection pressure decreases as <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> decreases. This relationship is true with all pumps, even those used on common rail systems. With unit or distributor systems, the injection pressure {{is tied to the}} instantaneous pressure of a single pumping event with no accumulator, and thus the relationship is more prominent and troublesome.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{hydraulic}} pumps are positive-displacement type, the flow rate they deliver is {{directly proportional to}} the <b>speed</b> of the <b>engine.</b> This means that at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> the steering would naturally operate faster than at low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Because this would be undesirable, a restricting orifice and flow-control valve direct some of the pump's output back to {{the hydraulic}} reservoir at high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> A pressure relief valve prevents a dangerous build-up of pressure when the hydraulic cylinder's piston reaches {{the end of its}} stroke.|$|R

50|$|Sequential turbos {{refer to}} a set-up in which the motor uses one {{turbocharger}} for lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> and a second or both turbochargers at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Typically, larger high-flow turbochargers are not as efficient at low RPM, resulting in lower intake manifold pressures under these conditions. On the other hand, smaller turbos spool up quickly at low RPM but cannot supply enough air at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> During low to mid <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> when available spent exhaust energy is minimal, only one relatively small turbocharger (called the primary turbocharger) is active. During this period, all of the engine's exhaust energy is directed to the primary turbocharger only, providing the small turbo's benefits of a lower boost threshold, minimal turbo lag, and increased power output at low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> As RPM increases, the secondary turbocharger is partially activated in order to pre-spool prior to its full utilization. Once a preset <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> or boost pressure is attained, valves controlling compressor and turbine flow through the secondary turbocharger are opened completely. (The primary turbocharger is deactivated {{at this point in}} some applications.) In this way a full twin-turbocharger setup provides the benefits associated with a large turbo, including maximum power output, without the disadvantage of increased turbo lag.|$|R
