25|$|Wheat {{proteins}} have a {{low quality}} for human nutrition, {{according to the new}} <b>protein</b> <b>quality</b> method (DIAAS) promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Wheat proteins are deficient in the essential amino acid, lysine, and contain adequate amounts of the other essential amino acids, at least for adults. Because the proteins present in the wheat endosperm (gluten proteins) are particularly poor in lysine, white flours are more deficient in lysine compared with whole grains. Significant efforts in plant breeding are being made to develop lysine-rich wheat varieties, without success as of 2017. Supplementation with proteins from other food sources (mainly legumes) is commonly used to compensate for this deficiency, since the limitation of a single essential amino acid causes the others to break down and become excreted, which is especially important during the period of growth.|$|E

2500|$|Bodybuilders may {{supplement}} their diets with protein {{for reasons of}} convenience, lower cost (relative to meat and fish products), ease of preparation, and to avoid the concurrent consumption of carbohydrates and fats. In addition, some argue that bodybuilders, {{by virtue of their}} unique training and goals, require higher-than-average quantities of protein to support maximal muscle growth; however there is no scientific consensus for bodybuilders to consume more protein than the recommended dietary allowance. Protein supplements are sold in ready-to-drink shakes, bars, meal replacement products (see below), bites, oats, gels and powders. Protein powders are the most popular and may have flavoring added for palatability.

40|$|This study entails quality {{assessment}} of whole grain bread produced from composite flours of <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> maize and wheat. <b>Quality</b> <b>protein</b> maize and wheat were processed into flours and mixed at various ratios for bread production. The proximate compositions, physical properties, glycemic response, functional and sensory {{properties of the}} samples were evaluated using standard methods. The result showed no significant difference (p< 0. 05) in the proximate composition parameters of the bread samples. The loaf height (2. 50 - 3. 95 cm), volume (291. 00 - 415. 00 cm 3) and specific volume(1. 72 - 2. 42 cm 3 /g) decreased significantly with increasing level of <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> maize, however, loaf length was not affected by the substitution of <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> maize. The result of the functional properties showed that final viscosity, water absorption and swelling capacity increased with increasing level of <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> maize. The result of the glycemic response showed that the inclusion of <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> maize resulted in decline in the blood glucose content (glycemic index) of the products. The bread samples were generally acceptable however; bread with 100 % wheat was the most preferred. The result of the sensory properties showed that there was significant difference (p< 0. 05) in the texture and taste of 100 % wheat bread and the other samples.

Several non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to prevent sarcopenia, {{one of which is}} increased protein consumption above the current RDA and/or reaching a certain threshold (≈ 10 grams of essential amino acids) of <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> at each meal. PURPOSE: To examine the association between the amount of Skeletal muscle mass in older active adults with regards to their total protein intake and amount of <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> consumed at each meal throughout the day (<b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> distribution). METHODS: Thirty-three healthy male (n= 11) and female (n= 22) active older adults (60. 1 ± 7. 1 years, 168. 1 ± 8. 4 cm, 68. 4 ± 12. 5 kg) participated in this cross sectional study. Total <b>protein</b> (g) and <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> distribution over 24 hrs (defined as consumption of a meal offering at least 10 grams of EAA) were determined from a seven-day food record. Seven-day food records and subsequent amino acid profiling were analyzed using a computer software program (Nutribase, v. 11, Cybersoft Inc., Phoenix, AZ). Daily food records were averaged across seven-days to give an average representation of total <b>protein</b> intake and <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> distribution. Total and appendicular lean mass were determined by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (Discovery A, Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA). Relative lean mass (RLM, total lean mass/height 2) and appendicular lean mass (aLM) index (aLM/height 2) were calculated. Self-reported physical activity level of the participants was determined using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Pearson Partial Correlation Coefficients controlling for body weight and physical activity level with an alpha level of 0. 05. RESULTS: Total protein intake (89. 9 ± 28. 7 g) was positively associated with RLM (r = 0. 598, p = 0. 001) as well as aLM index (r = 0. 605, p < 0. 001). <b>Quality</b> <b>protein</b> distribution throughout a day (1. 02 ± 0. 60) was also positively associated with RLM (r = 0. 502, p = 0. 005) and aLM index (r = 0. 464, p = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, not only total protein, but also the quality and quantity (≈ 10 grams of essential amino acids) of protein consumed throughout a day may be important for maintaining muscle mass in older adults...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} {{the influence of a}} maternal low protein diet on the fetus. However, the effect of a maternal low <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> diet on fetal growth and development is largely unknown. Wistar rats (11 weeks old) were mated and maintained on either a chow diet with 20 % casein (n = 6) as the control group (C), or a low <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> diet with 20 % wheat gluten (n = 7) as the experimental group (WG) through gestation and lactation. Maternal body weights were similar in both groups throughout the study. Birth weights were not influenced by maternal diet and offspring body weights during lactation were similar between the groups. Offspring’s plasma amino acid profiles showed that plasma methionine, glutamine and lysine were significantly lower and aspartic acid, ornithine and glycine-proline were significantly higher in the WG. Plant based protein comprises an important part of protein intake in developing countries. It is well-known that these diets can be inadequate in terms of essential amino acids. The current study shows differential effects of a maternal low <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> diet on the offspring’s plasma amino acids. Future studies will examine further aspects of the influence of maternal low <b>quality</b> <b>protein</b> diets on fetal growth and development...|$|R
