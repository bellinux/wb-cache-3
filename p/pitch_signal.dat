40|$|The {{development}} of sustainable energy production methods {{is an important}} aspect in lowering the emission of greenhouse gases and exhaustion of fossil fuels. Wind energy is recognized globally {{as one of the}} most promising sustainable forms of electricity generation, but the cost of offshore wind energy does not meet the level of fossil-based energy sources. An opportunity for wind energy cost reduction is the deployment of two-bladed wind turbines at offshore locations. Two-bladed turbines save the mass and cost of one rotor blade, which allows the entire wind turbine construction to be designed lighter, and in effect leads to lower initial costs. Moreover, reduction of harmonic fatigue loads on blades and other turbine parts using Individual Pitch Control (IPC) is a way to extend the turbine lifetime. This type of control, using a feedback control structure incorporating the Multi-Blade Coordinate (MBC) transformation, is capable of mitigating the most dominant periodic loads. It is generally known that significant turbine load reductions can be achieved using IPC, however, it is unclear to what extent the MBC <b>pitch</b> <b>signal</b> is optimal in terms of load alleviations. The main goal of this thesis is to develop a self-learning feedforward IPC strategy for a state-ofthe- art two-bladed wind turbine. This IPC strategy will be compared to the conventional feedback IPC implementation. By making use of properties of the MBC transformation, implementations of yaw control by IPC in different configurations are evaluated in terms of performance and stability. As a preparation for the comparison between conventional feedback and self-learning feedforward IPC strategies, a linear control-oriented model from blade pitch angles to harmonic blade loads is identified and used throughout this work for two main purposes. The first purpose is to reveal the level of interaction between both blades, which turns out to be negligible. On the basis of this reasoning, an appropriate cost-function is implemented for optimization of the feedforward controller. The second purpose of the linear model is the simplified and faster {{development of}} the Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) algorithm, which is later implemented in high-fidelity non-linear wind turbine simulation software. IFT is a self-learning model-free algorithm, and is used to optimize the rotor-position dependent feedforward IPC implementation. It is shown that the self-learning algorithm succeeds in optimization of the feedforward controller at all constant wind speeds, but also in more realistic turbulent wind conditions in the above-rated region. As the feedforward controller generates a constant amplitude <b>pitch</b> <b>signal</b> for each wind speed, the amplitude of the feedforward <b>pitch</b> <b>signal</b> is gain-scheduled on exogenous load signals, in an effort to improve feedforward performance. Results show that the conventional IPC strategy is optimal in terms of load reductions in steady state wind conditions, as the IFT algorithm optimizes to the exact same <b>pitch</b> <b>signal</b> at various constant wind speeds. In turbulent wind conditions, performance results indicate that the constant amplitude feedforward controller is able to attain significant load reductions, but that the performance of the conventional feedback control method is still superior. Comparing the pitch signals of both controllers in turbulent wind conditions, reveals that the conventional method continuously changes the phase of the implemented <b>pitch</b> <b>signal,</b> which is not driven by the varying rotor speed. To see how these changing pitch periodics have an effect on the load reduction capabilities, the feedforward (rotor speed dependent) <b>pitch</b> <b>signal</b> amplitude is scheduled on exogenous signals in various ways. This scheduling shows only minor performance improvements, and it can be concluded that the frequency changes in the <b>pitch</b> <b>signal</b> imposed by MBC, help to actively mitigate periodic blade loads. Using both the azimuth and blade load measurements, the conventional IPC strategy seems to actively track and mitigate the current present blade load harmonic, and it appears to be a serious challenge to develop control strategies that can improve performance already attained by MBC.

40|$|Gaze {{stabilization}} was quantified {{in subjects}} (n= 11) {{as they walked}} on a motorized treadmill (1. 8 m/s) and viewed visual targets at two viewing distances. A "far" target was positioned at 4 m (FAR) {{in front of the}} subject and the "near" target was placed at a distance of 0. 5 m (NEAR). A direct measure of visual acuity was used to assess the overall effectiveness of the gaze stabilization system. The contributions of nonocular mechanisms to the gaze goal were also quantified using a measure of the distance between the subject and point in space where fixation of the visual target would require the least eye movement amplitude (i. e. the head fixation distance (HFD)). Kinematic variables mirrored those of previous investigations with the vertical trunk translation and head pitch signals, and the lateral translation and head yaw signals maintaining what appear as antiphase relationships. However, an investigation of the temporal relationships between the maxima and minima of the vertical translation and head pitch signals show that while the maximum in vertical translation occurs at the point of the minimum head <b>pitch</b> <b>signal,</b> the inverse is not true. The maximum in the head <b>pitch</b> <b>signal</b> lags the vertical translation minimum by an average of greater than 12 percent of the step cycle time. Three HFD measures, one each for data in the sagittal and transverse planes, and one that combined the movements from both planes, all revealed changes between the FAR and NEAR target viewing conditions. This reorganization of the nonocular degrees of freedom while walking was consistent with a strategy to reduce the magnitude of the eye movements required when viewing the NEAR target. Despite this reorganization, acuity measures show that image stabilization is not occurring while walking and viewing the NEAR target. Group means indicate that visual acuity is not affected while walking in the FAR condition, but a decrement of 0. 15 logMAR (i. e. 1. 5 eye chart lines) exists between the standing and walking acuity measures when viewing the NEAR target...|$|E

Besides IRN steady state and linear rising stimuli, curvilinear rising stimuli were modeled after pitch contours of natural productions of Mandarin Tone 2. Electrophysiological data on pitch representation {{at the level of the}} brainstem, as reflected in FFR, were evaluated for all stimuli, static or dynamic. Autocorrelation peaks were observed corresponding to the fundamental period () as well as spectral bands at the fundamental and its harmonics for both a low and a high iteration step. At the higher iteration step, both spectral and temporal FFR representations were more robust, indicating that both acoustic properties may be utilized for pitch extraction at the level of the brainstem. By applying curvilinear IRN stimuli to elicit FFRs, we can evaluate the effects of temporal degradation on 1) the neural representation of linguistically-relevant pitch features in a target population (e. g., cochlear implant) and 2) the efficacy of signal processing schemes in conventional hearing aids and cochlear implants to recover these features.

In contrast to mechanical aspects, feedback and servo drive systems and their interactional behavior within a complex machine setup have not been sufficiently analyzed yet. This applies especially to ultra-precision machining. However the mechanical performance of an ultra-precision axis strongly depends on the control loop parameters and components. At Fraunhofer IPT a test bench has been developed to analyze CNC machine controls, servo drives and encoder systems with regard to an evaluation of their application in ultra-precision applications for high accuracy motion control. Investigating on all components applied in closed loop controls, their individual performance and simultaneously mutual disturbances and limitations within a complex system setup can be identified. Focusing on hardware structures, software modules and data processing structures, an overall statement concerning all aspects of modern closed loop control systems is targeted. The test bench has been configured as an ultra-precision lathe to later validate the measured results by diamond turning an optical part. The setup uses two air bearing ironless linear drives and an air bearing spindle. A modular mounting grid allows for the flexible integration of external metrology such as laser interferometers, laser vibrometers as well as capacitive or acceleration sensors.

The match was halted and never resumed. The decision was made to void the match and re-play it {{two and a half weeks}} later on Wednesday, 21 May 1980 at the same stadium. Red Star won the re-play 3-1.|$|R
40|$|While {{sleep is}} clearly a major risk factor for dying in a fire, in this review {{it is argued that}} in most fire {{fatalities}} during the sleeping period additional risk factors are also operating. This view is consistent with the data from empirical sleep studies and smoke alarms where most (but not all) adults tested will awaken to a signal reaching the pillow at 75 dBA. However, research suggests that significant "staying asleep" risk factors include high levels of background noise, being a heavy sleeper, sleep deprivation, being a child, sleeping tablets, alcohol intoxication, hearing impairment and being over age 60 (for high frequency signals). Recent sleep studies that have compared the waking effectiveness of different alarm signals (using children, sober adults and alcohol intoxicated adults) suggest that the high frequency beeping signal (usually around 3000 Hz) currently used in smoke alarms is significantly less effective in waking "at risk" groups than either a voice alarm (300 - 2500 Hz) or a low <b>pitched</b> beeping <b>signal</b> (500 - 2500 Hz). Compared to the high <b>pitched</b> <b>signal,</b> the latter two signals required a 13 dBA lower volume to awaken sober adults and, when presented at 89 dBA to 6 - 10 year olds, were almost twice as likely to cause awakenings. The findings suggest that alarm signals of a frequency below 2500 Hz will reduce the likelihood of individuals sleeping through a smoke alarm and further research should seek to more narrowly define the most effective frequency band and signal for arousal from sleep...|$|R

His pitch perception research {{is characterized by}} an unusual emphasis on tonotopically local effects such as pitch shifts, presumably originating in the auditory periphery. His sound localization research has emphasized signal confusions caused by room reflections and the strategies used by listeners to cope with them.|$|R
