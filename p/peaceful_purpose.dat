60|$|Thus the Anglo-Saxons, {{before the}} great exodus from Denmark and North Germany, appear as a race of fierce, cruel, and barbaric pagans, delighting in the sea, in slaughter, and in drink. They dwelt in little {{isolated}} communities, bound together internally by ties of blood, and uniting occasionally with others only for purposes of rapine. They lived a life which mainly alternated between grazing, piratical seafaring, and cattle-lifting; always on the war-trail against the possessions of others, {{when they were not}} specially engaged in taking care of their own. Every record and every indication shows them to us as fiercer heathen prototypes of the Scotch clans in the most lawless days of the Highlands. Incapable of union for any <b>peaceful</b> <b>purpose</b> at home, they learned their earliest lesson of subordination in their piratical attacks upon the civilised Christian community of Roman Britain.

5000|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} {{that is used}} to produce {{plutonium}} for weapons therefore generally has a means for exposing U-238 to neutron radiation and for frequently replacing the irradiated U-238 with new U-238. A reactor running on unenriched or moderately enriched uranium contains a great deal of U-238. However, most commercial nuclear power reactor designs require the entire reactor to shut down, often for weeks, in order to change the fuel elements. They therefore produce plutonium in a mix of isotopes that is not well-suited to weapon construction. Such a reactor could have machinery added that would permit U-238 slugs to be placed near the core and changed frequently, or it could be shut down frequently, so proliferation is a concern; for this reason, the International Atomic Energy Agency inspects licensed reactors often. A few commercial power reactor designs, such as the reaktor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalniy (RBMK) and pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR), do permit refueling without shutdowns, and they may pose a proliferation risk. (In fact, the RBMK was built by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, so despite their ostensibly <b>peaceful</b> <b>purpose,</b> it is likely that plutonium production was a design criterion.) By contrast, the Canadian CANDU heavy-water moderated natural-uranium fueled reactor can also be refueled while operating, but it normally consumes most of the Pu-239 it produces in situ; thus, it is not only inherently less proliferative than most reactors, but can even be operated as an [...] "actinide incinerator." [...] The American IFR (Integral Fast Reactor) can also be operated in an [...] "incineration mode," [...] having some advantages in not building up the Pu-242 isotope or the long-lived actinides, either of which cannot be easily burned except in a fast reactor. Also IFR fuel has a high proportion of burnable isotopes, while in CANDU an inert material is needed to dilute the fuel; this means the IFR can burn a higher fraction of its fuel before needing reprocessing. Most plutonium is produced in research reactors or plutonium production reactors called breeder reactors because they produce more plutonium than they consume fuel; in principle, such reactors make extremely efficient use of natural uranium. In practice, their construction and operation is sufficiently difficult that they are generally only used to produce plutonium. Breeder reactors are generally (but not always) fast reactors, since fast neutrons are somewhat more efficient at plutonium production.|$|E
5000|$|According to International law, Article 92 of the {{convention}} which describes ships shall sail under the flag of one state only and, save in exceptional cases expressly provided for in international treaties or in this Convention, shall be subject to its exclusive jurisdiction on the high seas; however, when a ship is involved in certain criminal acts, such as piracy, any nation can exercise jurisdiction under the doctrine of universal jurisdiction. High seas were defined as {{any part of the}} sea that was not either territorial sea or internal waters, territorial waters and exclusive economic zones.Article 88 of the 1982 Convention states that the high seas shall be reserved for <b>peaceful</b> <b>purpose.</b> Many countries engage in military maneuvers and the testing of conventional weapons and nuclear weapons on the high seas.In order to deliver the right punishment to the right person or state, the ships need to be registered to a country to show proof of ownership. [...] The owner of the vessel sometimes prefers to pay the lower registration fees by picking countries such as Panama, Bermuda, Italy, Malta and the Netherlands. According to Cruise Lines International Association, 90% of commercial vessels calling on U.S. ports fly foreign flags. To avoid the high cost with more rules and regulations, ships and tankers sometime prefer lower cost registration with a lower standard of inspection and regulation by picking a country that exercises less control over their registered ships, though many ships are owned by individuals or companies in another country (most commonly Japan and Greece) under a system called 'flag of convenience'. Registering a ship in Panama means that the ship is governed by the maritime rules of Panama rather than the ship owner's country. Ship owners do this because Panama has low taxes and fewer labor and safety regulations than most other countries. Ship owners can make their staff work longer hours in less safe environments, and therefore maximize their profits. Other countries, including Liberia, Cyprus and the Bahamas also offer flags of convenience, but Panama has the most ships registered under the scheme. Ships registered with the US will cost more, and the employee wages will be even higher.Freedom of the seas allows a ship to move freely on the ocean as long as it follows the international law.|$|E
40|$|Issue of WMDs {{proliferation}} in general, and {{of nuclear}} proliferation in particular, {{has emerged as}} high priority agenda of post-cold war western community. However along with global non-proliferation efforts, a surge in nuclear energy has also been witnessed owing to mounting energy crisis and environmental hazardous of using conventional means of energy. Abundance of oil resources is considered a hallmark of Middle East region, nevertheless many states in this region has made commitment to venture into nuclear energy to contain depletion of their conventional energy resources. The region has a special focus due to its political instability and WMD proliferation credentials, {{particularly with regard to}} Iran’s nuclear program since last decade. Such troubled issue has made the demand of nuclear energy in Middle EAST a grave concern of nuclear proliferation. To address such issues of nuclear proliferation, Middle Eastern states have taken many voluntary nuclear safety and export control measures. One such decision is to voluntary forgo enrichment and uranium reprocessing capabilities by the state which intends to venture into nuclear energy, as is evident in case of UAE. However, the action of forgoing any nuclear related capability on part of an individual state is highly debatable as an appropriate way to address proliferation concerns. Many states have raised serious reservations on issue of withdrawing ay technical capability, otherwise allowed under NPT. There is a need to further strengthen and broaden the scope of IAEA safety measures and protocols including verification mechanism and implementing stringent export control laws to achieve the overall goal of nuclear non-proliferation, instead of denying or withdrawing any technical capability as a condition to enter into a nuclear deal for <b>peaceful</b> <b>purpose...</b>|$|E

Prior to this there had been {{considerable}} debate in the country on whether India should go nuclear and whether she could afford to do so. Now that India is set on the nuclear path, much of the debate is theoretical Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has of course stated that India {{does not intend to}} make nuclear weapons of destruction. But nuclear technology and nuclear explosions, whether for peaceful or destructive purposes cost of the same. If the question whether India can effort it at all is relevant now, it is so {{only to the extent that}} we are discussing the pace of development of nuclear technology. The more significant question especially since India still claims that its nuclear programme is strictly for <b>peaceful</b> <b>purpose</b> is: Is it in India's security interest to renounce the use of nuclear technology for building nuclear weapons. What posture we adopt towards a nuclear weapons. Programme will of course depend on our threat perception. The history of India's nuclear technological development begins directly after independence with Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru pressed hard for the development of civilian nuclear facilities in the name of scientific progress and domestic energy production. This was mainly driven by his desire to develop a Commission in 1947 to develop these civilian technologies by the 1960 's India had fuel and reprocessing facilities that resulted in weapons- ready plutonium. But all official considerations of nuclear energy research was still focused on civilian technologies. Any talk of nuclear weapons technology did not begin until Indira Gandhi's premiership in the 1970 's the research and debates leading to India are peaceful. Nuclear explosion (PNE) did not begin until 1972, shortly after India's third war with Pakistan, even then public discourse on nuclear weapons was minimal...|$|E
40|$|ITER is a {{magnetic}} confinement fusion experimental reactor (TOKAMAK), {{planned to be}} built in France (Cadarache). The scope of ITER is to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy for <b>peaceful</b> <b>purpose.</b> The Divertor is a fundamental "in-vessel" component of the ITER machine. The main function of the Divertor system is to exhaust the major part of the alpha particle power as well as helium and impurities from the plasma. As the main interface component under normal operation between the plasma and material surfaces, it must tolerate high heat and electro magnetic loads {{while at the same time}} providing neutron shielding for the vacuum vessel and magnet coils in the vicinity of the Divertor. The research activity of this Ph. D. has been focalized mainly on two topics that represent "the pillars" of the entire work. The first topic concerns the methodology and a possible approach to the problem of set up the acceptance criteria for the tiles of CFC (Carbon Fibre Composite) of the Divertor at the start of life of the ITER machine. A study on the reliability and the applicability of this method as well as a possible statistical approach to the definition of the acceptance criteria are addressed in this thesis. The second topic is the developing of a user-friendly software, inside a commercial, certificated and very well documented finite element code like ANSYS, able to evaluate the evolution of the erosion in the CFC tiles of the Divertor. The evaluation of the speed of erosion of the CFC (Carbon Fibre Composite) tiles is very important to evaluate the longevity of those components. Moreover, the software developed will be an important tool for the final definition of the acceptance criteria for the tiles of CFC...|$|E
