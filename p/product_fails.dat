500|$|... "Weight Gain 4000" [...] {{served as}} a {{commentary}} on American consumerism, the equation of personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. This satire is particularly demonstrated by Cartman's blind faith in the Weight Gain 4000 bodybuilding supplement product despite strong evidence that the <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> at its primary function. Specifically, the product promises to build muscle, and Cartman believes it has fulfilled this function even after he only becomes extremely overweight. This blind faith is also illustrated by the complete disregard Cartman demonstrates for warnings that Weight Gain 4000 carries a risk of permanent damage to the liver and kidneys. The tremendous amount of product Cartman buys is further indicative of American purchasing habits.|$|E

5000|$|If a {{software}} <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> to perform properly, {{it may not}} cause physical, personal, or advertising damages, therefore the general liability policy would not be triggered; it may, however, directly cause financial losses which could potentially {{be attributed to the}} software developer's misrepresentation of the product capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|Design defects occur {{where the}} product design is {{inherently}} dangerous or useless (and hence defective) {{no matter how}} carefully manufactured; this may be demonstrated either by showing that the <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> to satisfy ordinary consumer expectations as to what constitutes a safe product, or that the risks of the product outweigh its benefits.|$|E
50|$|Aside from {{offering}} {{environmental benefits}} {{that do not}} meet consumer preferences, green marketing myopia can also occur when green <b>products</b> <b>fail</b> to provide credible, substantive environmental benefits.|$|R
50|$|In Taipei, Taiwan, a 2010 city {{health survey}} found one-third of tested dried fruit <b>products</b> <b>failed</b> health {{standard}} tests, most having excessive amounts of sodium cyclamate, some at levels 20 {{times higher than}} the legal limit.|$|R
50|$|On 21 February 2007, {{under the}} General Product Safety Regulations 2005, Trading Standards Officers in Oldham ordered Vance Miller, again trading from Maple Mill, to {{immediately}} withdraw {{four types of}} minibikes from sale.

50|$|A failure {{analysis}} engineer often plays a {{lead role in}} the analysis of failures, whether a component or <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> in service or if failure occurs in manufacturing or during production processing. In any case, one must determine the cause of failure to prevent future occurrence, and/or to improve the performance of the device, component or structure.|$|E
50|$|Gathering {{insights}} from an MVP is often {{less expensive than}} developing a product with more features, which increase costs and risk if the <b>product</b> <b>fails,</b> for example, due to incorrect assumptions. The term was coined and defined by Frank Robinson about 2001, and popularized by Steve Blank, and Eric Ries.It may also involve carrying out market analysis beforehand.|$|E
50|$|If {{a company}} does not say {{what they will do}} if the <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> to meet expectations, then they are free to do very little. This is due to a legal technicality that states that a {{contract}} cannot be enforced unless it provides a basis not only for determining a breach but also for giving a remedy {{in the event of a}} breach.|$|E

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{pharmaceutical}} quality of Xenical (chemically produced orlistat) with nine generic products, each produced by fermentation processes.; Xenical 120 mg capsules (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) {{were used as}} reference material. Generic products were from India, Malaysia, Argentina, Philippines, Uruguay, and Taiwan. Colour, melting temperature, crystalline form, particle size, capsule fill mass, active pharmaceutical ingredient content, amount of impurities, and dissolution were compared. Standard physical and chemical laboratory tests were those developed by Roche for Xenical.; All nine generic <b>products</b> <b>failed</b> the Xenical specifications in four or more tests, and two generic <b>products</b> <b>failed</b> in seven tests. A failure common to all generic products was the amount of impurities present, mostly due to different by-products, including side-chain homologues not present in Xenical. Some impurities were unidentified. Two generic <b>products</b> tested <b>failed</b> the dissolution test, one product formed a capsule-shaped agglomerate on storage and resulted in poor (>/= 15 %) dissolution. Six generic products were powder formulations.; All tested generic orlistat products were pharmaceutically inferior to Xenical. The high levels of impurities in generic orlistat products are a major safety and tolerability concern...|$|R
5000|$|If a {{custom-designed}} <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> {{without causing}} damage to person or property {{other than to}} the subject product itself, a product liability policy may cover consequential damages such as losses from business interruption, but will generally not cover the cost to redesign, repair or replace the failed product itself. Claims for these losses against the manufacturer may be covered by a professional liability policy.|$|E
5000|$|The Sabatier {{principle}} is a qualitative concept in chemical catalysis {{named after the}} French chemist Paul Sabatier. It states that the interactions between the catalyst and the substrate should be [...] "just right"; that is, neither too strong nor too weak. If the interaction is too weak, the substrate will fail to bind to the catalyst and no reaction will take place. On the other hand, if the interaction is too strong, the <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> to dissociate.|$|E
5000|$|... "Adulteration" [...] is a {{legal term}} meaning that a food <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> to meet federal or state standards.Adulteration is an {{addition}} of another substance to a food item {{in order to increase}} the quantity of the food item in raw form or prepared form, which may result in the loss of actual quality of food item. These substances may be other available food items or non-food items. Among meat and meat products some of the items used to adulterate are water or ice, carcasses, or carcasses of animals other than the animal meant to be consumed.|$|E

50|$|Forensic polymer {{engineering}} {{is the study}} of failure in polymeric products. The topic includes the fracture of plastic products, or any other reason why such a <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> in service, or fails to meet its specification. The subject focuses on the material evidence from crime or accident scenes, seeking defects in those materials that might explain why an accident occurred, or the source of a specific material to identify a criminal. Many analytical methods used for polymer identification may be used in investigations, the exact set being determined {{by the nature of the}} polymer in question, be it thermoset, thermoplastic, elastomeric or composite in nature.|$|E

5000|$|A {{collection}} of Dragon was released as the Dragon Magazine Archive in 1999. It was released as a CD-ROM for Windows 95/98 or Windows NT with files in Adobe's PDF format. The Dragon Magazine Archive {{was directed by}} Rob Voce, and published by TSR/Wizards of the Coast. It was reviewed by the online version of Pyramid on November 25, 1999. The reviewer felt that the archive was [...] "worth the price", but noted {{that it was not}} Macintosh compatible: [...] "This <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> pretty badly in the Mac world. Because the actual archive is in Adobe's PDF format, the files can be read by anyone with a Macintosh and Adobe Acrobat.

50|$|Those selling Energy Star {{approved}} luminaries will {{be required}} to participate in quality assurance testing, which uses independent, third-party, qualified testing facilities. Third-party testing provides an active system to verify the quality of Energy Star qualified SSL Luminaire products. Qualified products are selected on a random basis as well as through a nomination process. The manufacturer of each selected luminaire {{will be required}} to commission third-party testing, each being tested for: total luminous flux, luminaire efficacy, correlated color temperature, color rendering index, steady state package/module/array temperature, and maximum power supply case. If a <b>product</b> <b>fails</b> quality assurance testing, the entire product grouping is de-listed, if two ore more variations of a product qualified under a product grouping fail, the applicant is place on a probationary list. The DOE reserves the right to terminate any partnership agreements with a manufacturer whose products repeatedly violate the ENERGY STAR specifications.|$|E

50|$|The employees' bonuses are, in a {{clawback}} scheme, tied {{specifically to}} the performance (or lack thereof) of the financial product(s) the individual(s) may have created and/or sold {{as part of his}} or her job expecting a high profit. If the product does indeed do well {{over a long period of}} time, and permanently improves the nature of the firm, the bonuses paid to the individual are allowed to be retained by the individual. However, if the <b>product</b> <b>fails,</b> and damages the nature of the firm—even years down the line from the product's inception—then the firm has the inherent right to revoke, reclaim, or otherwise repossess some or all of the bonus amount(s). However, research shows managers who are subject to clawback provisions that are newly in place in a company often try to offset their increased risk of bonus clawback by demanding an increase in base salary that is not subject to being clawed back.|$|E
