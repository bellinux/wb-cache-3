40|$|We analyze {{distributional}} {{preferences in}} {{games in which}} a decider chooses the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good that <b>benefits</b> <b>a</b> receiver and creates costs for <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> payers. The average decider {{takes into account the}} welfare of all parties and has concerns for efficiency. However, she attaches similar weights to small and large groups so that she neglects large provision costs that are dispersed among many payers. This holds regardless of whether the decider benefits from the provision or not. A CES utility function which rationalizes average behavior implies altruism in bilateral situations and welfare-damaging actions when costs are dispersed. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{negative}} relationship between weekly hours worked and the gross hourly wage rate {{is due to the}} <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> fringe <b>benefits.</b> <b>As</b> the total weekly wage increases, employers and employees avoid taxation by substituting wages with nontaxable, nonwage benefits. The author produces a wage that incorporates the benefit effects and estimates the corresponding labor-supply elasticities. An estimator is presented for the wage/hours market locus and the structural labor-supply function. An empirical application indicates that an estimated negative labor-supply elasticity associated with the observed gross wage is reversed when the adjusted wage is employed.

40|$|In the {{existing}} literature on welfare state typologies, {{the concept of the}} universal welfare state is not defined precisely enough to allow for comparisons of universality over time and between countries. In this paper, I discuss some problems with the way the term 'the universal welfare state' has been used and I suggest possible solutions. Among other things, I propose that the term 'universality' be used to describe the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specific welfare <b>benefit</b> independently of individual income and/or other individual characteristics. It should also be used to describe the coverage of welfare benefits rather than their size. Based on the theoretical discussion, <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> possible indicators of universality are applied to the case of Sweden in the 1990 s. The conclusion is that, despite its economic crisis, universality in Sweden did not decrease...|$|R
3000|$|If we now {{go back to}} {{the policy}} meeting in Brussels, we can state that the core of the Lisbon {{strategy}} is the quality <b>of</b> ECEC. At <b>a</b> societal level, the meaning of ECEC quality is, according to Peter Moss (2004), inextricably linked with the concepts of child and childhood, and the aims and goals of preschool curricula. From that perspective, children’s wellbeing depends not only on a country’s national wealth, but also on its policy concerning child-related expenditures (Bradshaw, 2006). Comparatively, Sweden {{has come a long way}} in introducing reforms supporting families and young children’s lives. For example, Sweden holds a leading position in the world when it comes to child-related policy inputs such as the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child <b>benefit</b> allowance, maternity leave to be shared by both parents, access to preschool for all children whose parents require it, etc. (Pramling Samuelsson & Sheridan, 2004; UNICEF, 2008). In Sweden, preschool is open to all children aged @ 1 – 5 years. Preschool is part of the educational system and has a national curriculum that is linked to the curricula for other school forms within the system of education (Swedish National Agency of Education, 2006). The preschool curriculum both embraces fundamental values and <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> learning gaols to strive for. The question is, has Sweden, at a societal level, reached its gaols concerning family reforms and preschool quality? [...]...|$|R

40|$|Local arts {{agencies}} (LAAs), which support, promote, {{and develop}} the arts at a local level, can meet a community’s needs for engaging its citizens by using the arts in creative and strategic ways. In this capstone project, I explore how LAAs’ programs perceive and define civic engagement {{in order to understand}} how they seek to create civic competencies, and engage communities in crucial activities of local public life. Further, I analyzed current trends, practices, and program outcomes of LAAs that promote or integrate the arts in other civic activities to develop a resource for community leaders wanting to create a more cohesive, integrated, and sustainable community. My goal is to provide a framework to explore and understand how LAA programs have succeeded in attaining civic engagement objectives. In order to do this, I examined different roles LAAs can assume in civic engagement programs, as makers, enablers, and funders. I explore how changing governance structures affect the development of programs that promote various opportunities for education, dialogue, and participation. Through a purposive sampling technique, I assessed how 16 LAAs are working to accomplish their civic engagement program goals. Analyzing 13 interviews with practitioners and secondary data about the organizations, I found that the most common perception of civic engagement was the creation of social capital through community participation. This has been achieved by a change in funding priorities to focus on individual projects and by capacity building to enable greater participation by more diverse social groups. Further, many LAAs face the challenge of continued and sustainable funding, so public agencies are playing a major role as funders, while private organizations tend to focus on programmatic development. Understanding the unique contexts for civic engagement program development is important to help enable LAAs and community leaders to initiate their own programs. Whether communities face urban and demographic challenges or are developing a city’s identity, civic engagement leads to the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> public <b>benefit</b> in multi-faceted ways. Local policymakers should support strategic civic engagement initiatives and look to LAAs as creative partners, since the goals of government and the goals of LAAs are increasingly becoming complementary. Thus, the perception of civic engagement needs to be diversified from simply participating in traditional civic activities, to include the capacity for dialogue, which is essential to sustain a vibrant community and to increase the impact of these activities on local governance and community life...|$|R
