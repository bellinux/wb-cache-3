In this study, we focused coating and drying process of <b>PTFE</b> <b>treatment</b> to PEFC gas diffusion layer (GDL). By numerical analysis of evaporation and phase change of polymer in GDL, the effect of drying process on polymer distribution and porous property was examined.

40|$|A direct {{methanol}} {{fuel cell}} (DMFC) is an electrochemical energy-conversion device that converts methanol directly to electric energy {{without the use}} of reformers. Because of its simplicity and high energy density, the DMFC has been viewed {{as one of the most}} promising candidates for powering portable electronic devices that are typically powered by primary or secondary batteries. The electrochemical reactions occurring in the DMFC are intrinsically coupled with a series of complex liquid-gas two-phase mass transport processes in both the anode and the cathode. A better understanding of these mass transport processes in the DMFC is essential for the improvement of cell performance and for the optimal design of the DMFC system. This thesis work is focused on the mass transport phenomena of methanol and water in the DMFC. Both experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out. The thesis starts with reporting on an analysis of the mass transport of methanol at the anode of the DMFC. An analytical expression to quantify the overall mass transport coefficient from the anode flow field to the catalyst layer was obtained for the first time. This expression explicitly gives the relationship between the overall mass transport coefficient and the limiting current density, which means that the very complex mass transport coefficient can now be obtained by measuring the limiting current density. This expression was then used to guide experimental investigations. One of the most significant findings is that the overall mass transfer coefficient was nearly independent of current density, but was strongly affected by the methanol flow rate. The effect of the anode backing layer on the mass transport of methanol and cell performance was then studied. We found that a too thin anode backing layer resulted in lower cell voltages in the entire current density region, whereas a too thick backing layer led to a lower limiting current density. The reduced cell performance as a result of thinning the backing layer may be attributed to the increased under-rib mass transport polarization due to the weaker under-rib convection in a thinner backing layer. The experimental results also showed that the use of a PTFE-treated backing layer resulted in a lower limiting current density, due primarily to the increased through-plane methanol transport resistance as a result of the <b>PTFE</b> <b>treatment.</b> To enhance the mass transport of methanol in both the in-plane and through-plane directions at the anode, a new flow field, termed convection-enhanced serpentine flow field (CESFF), was invented. This new flow field can enhance the in-plane mass transport, resulting in more uniform distributions of reactants over the fuel cell electrodes. The most significant advantage of this flow field that it enables the fuel cell to discharge stably at low flow rates of reactants (which means smaller pumping work). As a result, the use of the new flow field can lead to a higher overall fuel cell efficiency. The mass transport of water through the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) used for DMFCs has also been studied in this thesis work. A measurement method that enables in-situ quantification of the water-crossover flux through the membrane was developed. With this method, we investigated each of the water transport mechanisms, and the effects of the MEA design and operating parameters on water loss and cell performance. The experimental data showed that diffusion dominated the total water-crossover flux at low current densities due to the high water concentration difference across the membrane. With the increase in current density, the water flux by diffusion decreased, but the flux by back convection increased. The corresponding net water-transport coefficient was also found to decrease with current density. The effects of both the PTFE loading in the cathode backing layer (BL) as well as in the micro-porous layer (MPL) and the carbon loading in the MPL on both the water transport and cell performance were also studied. The thesis also presents a one-dimensional, isothermal two-phase mass transport model for water transport through the MEA. The liquid (methanol-water solution) and gas (gas CO 2, methanol vapor and water vapor) two-phase mass transport in the porous anode and cathode was formulated based on classical multiphase flow theory in porous media. In the anode and cathode catalyst layers, the simultaneous three-phase (liquid and vapor in pores as well as dissolved phase in the electrolyte) water transport was considered and the phase exchange of water was modeled with finite-rate interfacial exchanges between different phases. This model enables further investigations of the respective effect of three water transport mechanisms, such as diffusion, electro-osmotic drag, and convection, through the membrane for the DMFC. With this model, the effect of the MEA design, particularly the cathode micro-porous layer, on water crossover and cell performance was investigated.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the surface modification of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) by an Ar and Ar/O 2 plasma created with an atmospheric-pressure radio frequency (r. f.) torch is presented here. The surfaces were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), XPS and water contact angle (WCA) to get an insight of the surface morphology and chemistry. An increase of roughness is observed with the Ar/O 2 plasma treatment. The WCA analysis shows that these surfaces are more hydrophobic than pristine PTFE; a contact angle of 135 ° was measured. When a PTFE surface is treated by Ar plasma, no roughening or significant change of the surface morphology and chemistry of PTFE was observed. The effects of the Ar and O 2 fluxes on the <b>PTFE</b> surface <b>treatment</b> were analyzed, {{as well as the}} effect of the power and treatment time. The plasma phase was also analyzed by optical emission spectroscopy, and some correlations with the treatment efficiency of the plasma are made. The chemistry on the surface is finally discussed and the competition between etching and re-deposition chemical reactions on the surface is proposed as a possible explanation of the results.

40|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{used in many}} industries due to its low frictional coefficient and excellent chemical inertness. The surface properties of PTFE are of importance in various applications. The surface properties of PTFE can be modified by different techniques. In this study, PTFE film was treated in oxygen plasma for improving surface wettability. The effects of plasma treatment on dynamic wetting behavior were characterized using Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and dynamic contact angle (DCA) measurements. SPM observations revealed the etching effect of the plasma treatment on the film. The introduction of hydrophilic groups by plasma treatment was detected by FTIR. The roughened and functionalized surface resulted in the change in both advancing and receding contact angles. Advancing and receding contact angles were significantly reduced, but the contact angle hysteresis was obviously increased after plasma treatment.

[2] {{employed}} O 2 APPJ as {{a second}} step of <b>treatment</b> of Polytetrafluoroethylene (<b>PTFE)</b> after chemical <b>treatment.</b> <b>PTFE</b> is extensively utilized in synthetic vascular surgery and medical devices because of its chemical and mechanical stability, but it is limited {{due to lack of}} haemocompatibility. APPJ is a suitable choice as it could improve cellular interaction property and tailor the biological response to the implant. Sorrentino and Carrino demonstrated that an oxygen cold plasma treatment could improve wettability and adhesion of Al 2024 surface which is an important alloy at aeronautical application. It should be painted to prevent corrosion which is caused by aeronautical critical environmental condition. They also investigated the influence of different parameters of plasma on the durability of paint on its surface [4]. The plasma processing results in physical and chemical modification in scale of several nanometres (first few molecular layers) while maintaining the properties of the bulk unchanged [3]. There are many investigations, in which plasma was utilized to improve surface properties of materials such as polymers, textiles and etc. Their physical and chemical properties after plasma treatment were examined in detail as well. But there are a few studies investigated the effect of plasma on the properties of non-carbonic base surfaces and needs more investigations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The aim {{of this paper is to}} utilize atmospheric pressure helium plasma jet on Raw and Frit glaze surfaces to improve their paintability and explore the effect of the plasma on their surface properties which seems not fully understood so far. Helium, in comparison with other gases, could be considered the most convenient gas working at atmospheric pressure, as it allows stabilizing homogeneous glow discharges at lower sustaining voltages and inter-electrode gaps. It is also very suitable for surface treatment because of low degradation effect and high properties of cross linking and functionalizing on to the surface [8, 10]. We used helium plasma as it is capable of maintaining simultaneous stability and reactivity, while in other inert gases chemical reactivity is obtained by adding a small amount of reactive gases at the expense of stability and increasing the temperature which may cause non-uniform processing.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim {{of the project was}} {{to gain a better understanding}} of the factors that affect adhesion of fluoropolymers. This was achieved by employing various analytical techniques to the treated and untreated polymers. The effects of novel pretreatments, and established <b>treatments,</b> on Polytetrafluoroethylene, <b>PTFE,</b> Poly (vinyl fluoride), PVF, and poly (vinylidene fluoride) PVdF, were characterised using: adhesion tests, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), including derivatisation reactions, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), contact angles and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) For untreated PVF and PTFE it was found that a certain degree of adhesion improvement was achievable without any chemical modification of the surfaces. This was observed when the substrates were repeatedly bonded. It is proposed that weakly cohesive material was present in the polymers and these acted as weak boundary layers when bonded. Removal of weak boundary layers alone was found to be insufficient to obtain high adhesion with PTFE. Surface functionality, increased wettabiIity and favourable topography all contributed to the high bond strengths observed with 'Tetra-Etch' treated <b>PTFE.</b> 'Tetra-Etch' <b>treatment</b> is used commercially on PTFE but prior to this programme was unreported on PVF and PVdF. The treatment was effective at promoting adhesion for PVF though at a· much slower rate than for PTFE. Additional mechanisms to that for PTFE (Le. electron transfer) are proposed for the action of 'Tetra-Etch' on PVF. These are dehydrohalogenation through electron transfer and an elimination reaction. The same mechanisms are proposed for PV dF. Flame and Iow pressure plasma treatments·,w 7 re carried out on PVF and PTFE. Flame was found to be ineffective for PTFE but with PVF chemical modification (oxidation) occurred at the carbon/hydrogen sites. No defluorination was observed; this was in contrast to the mechanism of oxidation via plasmas on PVF, where defluorination, oxidation, ablation, and crosslinking may have all contributed to the high bond strength obtained. Certain plasma treatments were effective at improving the adhesion of PTFE but were slower and caused less modification. Removal of weak boundary layers was proposed as the major factor since oxidation was often slight. Reaction with solutions of potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) were effective as adhesion pretreatments for PVF and PVdF but not for PTFE. For PVF and PVdF rates of reaction and chemical modification varied with time, temperature, molarity of solution and the nature of the solution i. e. aqueous or alcoholic. The greatest improvement in rate and effectiveness of the treatment for adhesion improvement was on the addition of a phase transfer catalyst to the aqueous solution. It was found for PVF that substantial surface oxidation could be achieved without improving the adhesion. It was suggested that oxidation occurred at sites present in a weakly cohesive layer. Mechanisms of the reactions were considered in terms of neucloephilic substitution and elimination; for PVF and PV dF both are likely. The mechanism of the phase transfer catalyst was investigated and found to be complex. It was found not to be simply a wetting agent but had inherent reactivity on its own. A combination of mechanisms was proposed...|$|R
