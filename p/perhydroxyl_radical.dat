50|$|The hydroperoxyl radical, {{also known}} as the <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radical,</b> is the protonated form of {{superoxide}} with the chemical formula HO2.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} early {{effort in}} the field is that of Goodeve and Kitchener, who {{were among the first to}} demonstrate the “photosensitization” of TiO2—e.g., as evidenced by the fading of paints incorporating it as a pigment. Another important work is that of Markham and Laidler. They demonstrated through several measurements and a process of deduction that the generation of hydrogen peroxide by aqueous suspensions of ZnO under UV irradiation must occur by transferring a freed electron from the semiconductor, forming the <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radical.</b> They further indicated that when organic compounds were present, these compounds were oxidized at the semiconductor surface by oxidizing species with increased production of hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} {{effects of}} moisture {{can be seen}} in the chalking of titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigmented coatings and polymers; the anatase form is particularly sensitive to wavelengths below about 405 nm while the rutile forms absorb energy above that wavelength. Chalking results from the degradation of the binding material resulting in a release of the TiO2 pigment particles. These particles form a dull layer on the surface which may be wiped off. Experience shows that chalking is strongest where more water is available on the surface; little to no chalking occurs in dry atmospheres. TiO2 is a semiconductor where electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band result from the absorption of light at wavelengths in the near UV range, below 400 nm. Ultraviolet radiation causes electron-hole pairs to be created in the TiO2 lattice. These react with the hydroxide groups on the surface and the Ti4+ ions. Hydroxyl and perhydroxyl radicals are formed through the conversion of oxygen and a water molecule whereby the TiO2 surface again resumes the initial form and acts as a catalyst for continued activity, thus repeating the chalking cycle. The hydroxide and <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> then cause oxidative decomposition of the binder with the subsequent release of TiO2 particles.|$|E
30|$|However, Psa {{applications}} from 0.1 to 0.6  % decreased pulp viscosity by 6.7 – 15.1 cP (Fig.  3 b), {{which indicates that}} cellulose is partly degraded. The treatment may have low selectivity due to residual H 2 O 2 in the solution. For example, the loss of viscosity during ozone treatment is reportedly due to the reaction between carbohydrates and hydroxyl and <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> generated as by-products [29]. It is presumed that the viscosity loss during Psa treatment would be caused by hydroxyl radicals formed from the residual H 2 O 2. This residual oxidant remains from the synthesis of peroxymonosulfuric acid in which 55  % hydrogen peroxide reacts with sulfuric acid at equilibrium. The viscosity loss, as similarly observed during alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment to improve TCF performance, might be mitigated {{by the addition of}} a chelation (Q) stage, but the effects would not be totally identical.|$|R
40|$|We {{have tried}} to {{elucidate}} the mechanism of phagosome acidification in human neutrophils. Assuming that phenomena occurring at the plasma membrane reflect reactions in the phagocytic vacuoles, we have stimulated human neutrophils with agents that induce a "respiratory burst," and we have measured the release of protons into the extracellular medium. Phorbol myristate acetate, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and serum-opsonized zymosan particles each caused a rapid release of protons, concomitant {{with the increase in}} oxygen consumption. The stimulated release of protons was strictly coupled to the increase respiration of the cells, because inhibition of the respiration of either anaerobiosis, chlorpromazine, or glycolytic inhibitors also inhibited the release of protons. Also, {{in the presence of the}} above-mentioned stimulating agents, neutrophils from three patients with chronic granulomatous disease enhanced neither respiration not proton release. In normal cells, the ratio of deltaH+/-deltaO 2 was 1. 04 +/- 0. 19 (mean +/ SD, n = 13). The mechanism of this proton release is not clear. The amount of lactic and carbonic acid produced by stimulated neutrophils was inadequate to explain the amount of protons released. <b>Perhydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> were also ruled out as the source of the protons. Because the cells did not release measurable amounts of phosphate ions, a phosphate-hydroxyl-ion antiport was also excluded. Finally, the lack of any effect of uncouplers renders it unlikely that a respiration-driven proton gradient is built up across the plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntracellular {{singlet oxygen}} {{generation}} in photofrin-loaded cells caused cell death without discrimination between nonmalignant and malignant cells. In contrast, extracellular singlet oxygen generation caused apoptosis induction selectively in tumor cells through singlet oxygen-mediated inactivation of tumor cell protective catalase and subsequent reactivation of intercellular ROS-mediated apoptosis signaling through the HOCl and the NO/peroxynitrite signaling pathway. Singlet oxygen generation by extracellular photofrin alone was, however, not sufficient for optimal direct inactivation of catalase, but needed {{to trigger the}} generation of cell-derived extracellular singlet oxygen through the interaction between H 2 O 2 and peroxynitrite. Thereby, formation of peroxynitrous acid, generation of hydroxyl radicals and formation of <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> (HO 2.) through hydroxyl radical/H 2 O 2 interaction seemed to be required as intermediate steps. This amplificatory mechanism {{led to the formation}} of singlet oxygen at a sufficiently high concentration for optimal inactivation of membrane-associated catalase. At low initial concentrations of singlet oxygen, an additional amplification step needed to be activated. It depended on singlet oxygen-dependent activation of the FAS receptor and caspase- 8, followed by caspase- 8 -mediated enhancement of NOX activity. The biochemical mechanisms described here might be considered as promising principle for the development of novel approaches in tumor therapy that specifically direct membrane-associated catalase of tumor cells and thus utilize tumor cell-specific apoptosis-inducing ROS signaling...|$|R
30|$|But in khiber clay, the {{adsorption}} capacity did {{not increase}} {{as shown in the}} isotherm curve. This phenomenon is clear {{from the fact that the}} radicals playing significant role in the hydrogen peroxide chemistry are the hydroxyl radical (OH−), superoxide radical (O− 2), and <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> (HO− 2). These radicals interact with other radicals or ions present on the clay surface (Petri et al. 2011). Therefore, the adsorption capacity {{did not increase}} as shown in the isotherm curve which may be attributed to adhesion of radicals of hydrogen peroxide to the clay surface and rendered the cationic ion exchange capacity ineffective for cobalt ions attraction.|$|E
40|$|A model (NADH-phenazine methosulfate-O 2) {{formally}} {{similar to}} pyridine nucleotide-dependent flavoprotein hydroxylases catalyzed the hydroxylation of several aromatic compounds. The hydroxylation was maximal at acid pH and was inhibited by ovine Superoxide dismutase, suggesting that perhydroxyl radicals might be intermediates in this process. The stoichiometry {{of the reaction}} indicated that a univalent reduction of oxygen was occurring. The correlation between the concentration of semiquinone and hydroxylation, and the inhibition of hydroxylation by ethanol which inhibited semiquinone oxidation, suggested the involvement of phenazine methosulfate-semiquinone. Activation of hydroxylation by Fe 3 + and Cu 2 + supported the contention that univalently reduced species of oxygen was involved in hydroxylation. Catalase was without effect on the hydroxylation by the model, ruling out H 2 O 2 as an intermediate. A reaction sequence, involving a two-electron reduction of phenazine methosulfate to reduced phenazine methosulfate followed by disproportionation with phenazine methosulfate to generate the semiquinone, was proposed. The semiquinone could donate an electron to O 2 to generate O 2 which could be subsequently protonated to form the <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radical...</b>|$|E
40|$|Phorbol myristate acetate {{activated}} {{in normal}} human neutrophils a single enzymatic entity that was dormant in unstimulated cells, optimally active at pH 7. 0, {{and capable of}} oxidizing either NADH or NADPH, producing NAD(P) + and superoxide (O 27). Comparative fluorometric and spectrophotometric measurements supported the stoichiometry NAD(P) H + 20 (2) leads to NAD(P) + + 20 (27) + H+. the seemingly considerable NAD(P) + production at pH 5. 5 and 6. 0 was due largely to nonenzymatic oxidation of NAD(P) H by chain reactions initiated by HO 27 (<b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radical),</b> the conjugate acid of O 27. This artifact, responsible for earlier erroneous assignments of an acid pH optimum for NAD(P) H oxidase, was prevented by including superoxide dismutase in fluorometric assays. NAD(P) H oxidase was more active towards NADPH (Km = 0. 15 +/- 0. 03 mM) than NADH (Km = 0. 68 +/- 0. 2 mM). No suggestion that oxidase activity was allosterically regulated by NAD(P) H was seen. Phorbol myristate acetate-induced O 27 production was noted to be modulated by pH in intact neutrophils, suggesting that NAD(P) H oxidase is localized in the plasma membrane where its activity {{may be subject to}} (auto) regulation by local H+ concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the oxidation of iron(II) in 4 M {{sodium chloride}} solutions {{has been studied}} in order to resolve differences in the rates and rate equations from previously published studies. It has been confirmed that the rate is second order in iron(II) and first order in dissolved oxygen. The presence of trace concentrations of copper in the iron(II) solutions and catalysis by platinum metal used to monitor the solution potentials in previous studies have been experimentally identified as points of difference. The rates of oxidation of iron(II) and copper(I) by peroxide under similar conditions have been studied and the rate equations shown to be first order in both metal ion and peroxide. It is shown that peroxide is not a detectable intermediate in the reduction of oxygen by iron(II). Comparison with published data for the oxidation of copper(I) and that of iron(II) by oxygen {{in the presence of}} strongly complexing anions for iron(III) suggests that both outer-sphere and inner-sphere mechanisms are involved in the oxidation of iron(II) depending on the equilibrium for the transfer of the first electron to oxygen. This interpretation is supported by thermodynamic calculations and published kinetic data for the oxidation of iron(II) and copper(I) by the <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radical...</b>|$|E
40|$|Brown rot {{basidiomycetes}} initiate wood decay {{by producing}} extracellular {{reactive oxygen species}} that depolymerize the structural polysaccharides of lignocellulose. Secreted fungal hydroquinones are considered one contributor {{because they have been}} shown to reduce Fe 3 +, thus generating perhydroxyl radicals and Fe 2 +, which subsequently react further to produce biodegradative hydroxyl radicals. However, many brown rot fungi also secrete high levels of oxalate, which chelates Fe 3 + tightly, making it unreactive with hydroquinones. For hydroquinone-driven hydroxyl radical production to contribute in this environment, an alternative mechanism to oxidize hydroquinones is required. We show here that aspen wood undergoing decay by the oxalate producer Postia placenta contained both 2, 5 -dimethoxyhydroquinone and laccase activity. Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins extracted from the wood identified a putative laccase (Joint Genome Institute P. placenta protein identification number 111314), and heterologous expression of the corresponding gene confirmed this assignment. Ultrafiltration experiments with liquid pressed from the biodegrading wood showed that a highmolecular-weight component was required for it to oxidize 2, 5 -dimethoxyhydroquinone rapidly and that this component was replaceable by P. placenta laccase. The purified laccase oxidized 2, 5 -dimethoxyhydroquinone with a second-order rate constant near 10 4 M- 1 s- 1, and measurements of the H 2 O 2 produced indicated that approximately one <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> was generated per hydroquinone supplied. Using these values and...|$|E
40|$|When Fenton {{reactions}} {{are applied to}} treat contaminated soil, due to initial rapid reactions the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) gets exhausted too early. This poses practical difficulty in treating contaminated soil using Fenton reactions. In present study acetate was employed as a ligand of Ferrous iron (Fe (II)) to enhance the removal efficiency of diesel by securing the stability of hydrogen peroxide. 0. 5 - 2 times more of acetate was added compared to molar concentration of Fe (II). To eliminate {{the side effects of}} removal efficiency low initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide 2 % was maintained. From the results it is evident that when more than 8 mM of acetate was added the hydroxide life time lasted up to 72 hours which is 12 times more than normal life time. The diesel removal efficiency also improved up to 40 % due to stabilized hydroxide conditions. Ferrous ion was oxidized to ferric ion. In the case of general Fenton system, the remained ferrous increased continuously all through the experiment. When more acetate was added the reduction rate of ferric to ferrous also decreased proportionally. Ferrous ion concentrations increased at the point of exhaust of H 2 O 2 which is end point of Fenton reaction. The relative ferric/ferrous variation and reduction of ferric to ferrous ions can be explained by <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> mechanism. The study helps in finding the possibilities to treat contaminated soil by Fenton reactions and its economic feasibilit...|$|E
40|$|The submillimetre is an understudied {{region of}} the Earth's {{atmospheric}} electromagnetic spectrum. Prior technological gaps and relatively high opacity due to the prevalence of rotational water vapour lines at these wavelengths have slowed progress from a ground-based remote sensing perspective; however, emerging superconducting detector technologies {{in the fields of}} astronomy offer the potential to address key atmospheric science challenges with new instrumental methods. A site study, with a focus on the polar regions, is performed to assess theoretical feasibility by simulating the downwelling (zenith angle =  0 °) clear-sky submillimetre spectrum from 30  mm (10  GHz) to 150  µm (2000  GHz) at six locations under annual mean, summer, winter, daytime, night-time and low-humidity conditions. Vertical profiles of temperature, pressure and 28 atmospheric gases are constructed by combining radiosonde, meteorological reanalysis and atmospheric chemistry model data. The sensitivity of the simulated spectra to the choice of water vapour continuum model and spectroscopic line database is explored. For the atmospheric trace species hypobromous acid (HOBr), hydrogen bromide (HBr), <b>perhydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> (HO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) the emission lines producing the largest change in brightness temperature are identified. Signal strengths, centre frequencies, bandwidths, estimated minimum integration times and maximum receiver noise temperatures are determined for all cases. HOBr, HBr and HO 2 produce brightness temperature peaks in the mK to µK range, whereas the N 2 O peaks are in the K range. The optimal submillimetre remote sensing lines for the four species are shown to vary significantly between location and scenario, strengthening the case for future hyperspectral instruments that measure over a broad wavelength range. The techniques presented here provide a framework that can be applied to additional species of interest and taken forward to simulate retrievals and guide the design of future submillimetre instruments...|$|E
