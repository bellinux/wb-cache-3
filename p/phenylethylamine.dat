25|$|Biogenic amines {{have been}} implicated as a {{potential}} cause of red wine headaches. In wine, histamine, cadaverine, <b>phenylethylamine,</b> putrescine, and tyramine have all been detected. These amines are created by the degradation of amino acids found in grape must and {{left over from the}} breakdown of dead yeast cells after fermentation. Most LAB have the potential to create biogenic amines, even some strains of O. oeni, but high levels of biogenic amines are most often associated with species from the Lactobacillus and Pediococcus genera. In the European Union, the concentration of biogenic amines in wine is beginning to be monitored, while the United States currently does not have any regulations.|$|E

40|$|Methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA, "Ecstasy") {{and other}} related <b>phenylethylamines</b> are {{nowadays}} used extensively in Western Switzerland at dance clubs and raves. There is a widely held belief among teenagers and misusers that ecstasy is safe. In the last years however, {{an increasing number of}} reports of MDMA-related deaths has been reported. Acute clinical toxicity problems following MDMA ingestion include hyperthermia, convulsions and arrhythmias. There is also growing concern that these <b>phenylethylamines</b> are neurotoxic and cause long-term damage to serotonineric nerve terminals in animal brains. Qualitative analyses by GC-MS of street samples of ecstasy showed that only a part of them contain MDMA or related <b>phenylethylamines</b> (MDA, MDEA, MBDB and 2 C-B). Most of them were mixed with caffeine and an excipient (sugars or polyols [e. g. mannitol]). Amphetamine cut with caffeine and other drugs (e. g. testosterone), stimulants (e. g. pseudoephedrine) and other drugs unrelated to stimulants and <b>phenylethylamines</b> (e. g. LSD, chloroquine, vasodilators) were also detected. Quantitative determinations performed by HPLC-DAD or EC-DAD reveal huge fluctuations in the amount of active substance(s) per tablet. MDMA and related compounds display unique psychoactive properties, acting as a stimulant and inducing feelings of empathy. The effects of MDMA intake are very likely the results of the large release of serotonin (5 -HT) in the synaptic cleft, of the inhibition of the re-uptake inactivation of 5 -HT and of the inhibition of a key-enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of 5 -HT. Forensic investigations performed at our institute showed significant blood levels of MDMA, MDEA and MDA in samples drawn from people suspected of driving under the influence of psychoactive drugs. Up to now, no death could be attributed to MDMA intoxication only because our analyses always revealed the additional presence of toxic amounts of other psychoactive drugs (e. g. opiates, cocaine). Our study shows that because of the variable composition of ecstasy tablets, unpredictable types and amounts of drugs may be taken by MDMA misusers. Moreover, there is considerable concern that traffic accidents may be caused by MDMA-abusers. MDMA intake could result in severe intoxication and even death, especially when combined with other types of drugs...|$|R

25|$|Quanah Parker is {{credited}} {{as one of}} the first important leaders of the Native American Church movement. Parker adopted the peyote religion after having been gored in southern Texas by a bull. Parker was visiting his uncle, John Parker, in Texas where he was attacked, giving him severe wounds. To fight an onset of blood burning fever, a Mexican curandera was summoned and she prepared a strong peyote tea from fresh peyote to heal him. Thereafter, Quanah Parker became involved with peyote, which contains hordenine, mescaline or <b>phenylethylamine</b> alkaloids, and tyramine which act as natural antibiotics when taken in a combined form. Clinical studies indicate that peyocactin, a water-soluble crystalline substance separated from an ethanol extract of the plant, proved an effective antibiotic against 18 strains of penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, several other bacteria, and a fungus.|$|E
25|$|Reticuline {{is known}} as the {{immediate}} precursor of protoberberine alkaloids in plants. Berberine is an alkaloid derived from tyrosine. L-DOPA and 4-hydroxypyruvic acid both come from L-tyrosine. Although two tyrosine molecules are used in the biosynthetic pathway, only the <b>phenylethylamine</b> fragment of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring system is formed via DOPA, the remaining carbon atoms come from tyrosine via 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. L-DOPA loses carbon dioxide to form dopamine 1. Likewise, 4-hydroxypyruvic acid also loses carbon dioxide to form 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde 2. Dopamine 1 then reacts with 4-hydroxy-phenylacetaldehyde 2 to form (S)-norcolaurine 3 in a reaction similar to the Mannich reaction. After oxidation and methylation by SAM, (S)-reticuline 4 is formed. (S)-reticuline serves as a pivotal intermediate to other alkaloids. Oxidation of the tertiary amine then occurs and an iminium ion is formed 5. In a Mannich-like reaction the ortho position to the phenol is nucleophilic, and electrons are pushed to form 6. Product 6 then undergoes keto-enol tautomerism to form (S)-scoulerine, which is then methylated by SAM to form (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine 7. Product 7 is then oxidized to form the methylenedioxy ring from the ortho-methoxyphenol, via an O2-, NADPH- and cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme, giving (S)-canadine 8. (S)-canadine is then oxidized to give the quaternary isoquinolinium system of berberine. This happens in two separate oxidation steps, both requiring molecular oxygen, with H2O2 and H2O produced in the successive processes.|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{profile of}} a series of (±) - 2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -(X) -phenylisopropylamines (X=I, Br, NO 2, CH 3, or H) and corresponding <b>phenylethylamines,</b> was determined in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with cRNA coding for rat 5 -HT 2 A or 5 -HT 2 C receptors. The efficacy and relative potency of these drugs were determined and compared to classical 5 -HT 2 receptor agonists and antagonists. The rank order of agonist potency at the 5 -HT 2 A receptor was: α-methyl- 5 -HT= 5 -HT>m-CPP>MK- 212; at the 5 -HT 2 C receptor the order was: 5 -HT>α-methyl- 5 -HT>MK- 212 >m-CPP. All these compounds were full agonists at the 5 -HT 2 C receptor, but α-methyl- 5 -HT and m-CPP showed lower efficacy at the 5 -HT 2 A receptor. 4 -(4 -Fluorobenzoyl) - 1 -(4 -phenylbutyl) piperidine (4 F 4 PP) was 200 times more potent as a 5 -HT 2 A antagonist than at 5 -HT 2 C receptors. Conversely, RS 102221 was 100 times more potent as a 5 -HT 2 C antagonist, confirming their relative receptor selectivities. The phenylisopropylamines were partial agonists at the 5 -HT 2 A receptor, with Imax relative to 5 -HT in the 22 ± 7 to 58 ± 15 % range; the corresponding <b>phenylethylamines</b> had lower or undetectable efficacies.

The antagonism was time-dependent at the 5 -HT 2 C receptor but independent of pre-incubation time at the 5 -HT 2 A receptor subtype.

40|$|Certain <b>phenylethylamines,</b> such as 1 -(4 -bromo- 2, 5 -dimethoxyphenyl) - 2 -aminopropane (DOB; 1 a), are high-affinity 5 -HT 2 agonists. Previous structure-affinity {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that both the 2, 5 -dimethoxy substitution pattern {{and the nature of}} substituents at the 4 -position are important determinants of high affinity. We recently demonstrated that replacement of the bromo group of DOB with a 3 -(phenyl) propyl substituent results in retention of affinity and that, counter to established structure-affinity relationships, the 2, 5 -dimethoxy substitution pattern is no longer a requirement for the binding. The present investigation extends these findings by examining a series of analogues, 3, lacking a 5 -methoxy group. It was additionally found that shifting the phenylalkyl substituent from the 4 - to the 5 -position (e. g., 4 i) also results in retention of affinity. For example, 1 -(2 -methoxy- 5 -(3 -phenylpropyl) - 2 -aminopropane (6; the R-methyl derivative of 4 i) binds at 5 -HT 2 A receptors with high affinity (Ki) 13 nM) and possesses 5 -HT 2 A antagonist character.
