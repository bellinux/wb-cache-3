2500|$|Technical dives may {{be defined}} as being dives deeper than about [...] or dives in an {{overhead}} environment with no {{direct access to the}} surface or natural light. Such environments may include fresh and saltwater caves and the interiors of shipwrecks. In many cases, technical dives also include planned decompression carried out over a number of stages during a controlled ascent to the surface {{at the end of the}} dive. The depth-based definition is based on risk caused by the progressive impairment of mental competence with increasing partial pressure of respired nitrogen. Breathing air under pressure causes nitrogen narcosis that usually starts to become a problem at depths of [...] or greater, but this differs between divers. Increased depth also increases the partial pressure of oxygen and so increases the risk of oxygen toxicity. Technical diving often includes the use of <b>breathing</b> <b>mixtures</b> other than air to reduce these risks, and the additional complexity of managing a variety of <b>breathing</b> <b>mixtures</b> introduces other risks and is managed by equipment configuration and procedural training. To reduce nitrogen narcosis, it is common to use trimix which uses helium to replace some of the nitrogen in the diver's <b>breathing</b> <b>mixture,</b> or heliox, in which there is no nitrogen.|$|R

50|$|In {{underwater}} diving an {{inert gas}} is {{a component of}} the <b>breathing</b> <b>mixture</b> which is not metabolically active, and serves to dilute the gas mixture.

50|$|Because A-a {{gradient}} is approximated as: (150 − 5/4(pCO2)) - PaO2 at {{sea level}} and on room air (0.21x(760-47) = 149.7 mmHg for the alveolar oxygen partial pressure, after accounting for the water vapor), the direct mathematical cause of a large value is that the blood has a low PO2, a low PCO2, or both. CO2 is very easily exchanged in the lungs and low PCO2 directly correlates with high minute ventilation; therefore a low arterial PCO2 indicates that extra respiratory effort {{is being used to}} oxygenate the blood. A low PaO2 indicates that the patient's current minute ventilation (whether high or normal) is not enough to allow adequate oxygen diffusion into the blood. Therefore, the A-a gradient essentially demonstrates a high respiratory effort (low arterial PCO2) relative to the achieved level of oxygenation (arterial PO2). A high A-a gradient could indicate a <b>patient</b> <b>breathing</b> hard to achieve normal oxygenation, a <b>patient</b> <b>breathing</b> normally and attaining low oxygenation, or a <b>patient</b> <b>breathing</b> hard and still failing to achieve normal oxygenation.|$|R

2500|$|In the {{unconscious}} patient, after the airway is opened the next area to assess is the <b>patient's</b> <b>breathing,</b> primarily to find {{if the patient}} is making normal respiratory efforts. [...] Normal breathing rates are between 12 and 20 breaths per minute, and if a <b>patient</b> is <b>breathing</b> below the minimum rate, then in current ILCOR basic life support protocols, CPR should be considered, although professional rescuers may have their own protocols to follow, such as artificial respiration.|$|R
2500|$|The sum {{of partial}} {{pressures}} of the gas that the diver breathes must necessarily balance with the sum of partial pressures in the lung gas. In the alveoli the gas has been humidified and has gained [...] carbon dioxide from the venous blood. Oxygen has also diffused into the arterial blood, reducing the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. As the total pressure in the alveoli must balance with the ambient pressure, this dilution results in an effective partial pressure of nitrogen of about 758mb (569mmHg) in air at normal atmospheric pressure. At a steady state, when the tissues have been saturated by the inert gases of the <b>breathing</b> <b>mixture,</b> metabolic processes reduce the partial pressure of the less soluble oxygen {{and replace it with}} carbon dioxide, which is considerably more soluble in water. In the cells of a typical tissue, the partial pressure of oxygen will drop, while the partial pressure of carbon dioxide will rise. The sum of these partial pressures (water, oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen) is less than the total pressure of the respiratory gas. This is a significant saturation deficit, and it provides a buffer against supersaturation and a driving force for dissolving bubbles. Experiments suggest that the degree of unsaturation increases linearly with pressure for a <b>breathing</b> <b>mixture</b> of fixed composition, and decreases linearly with fraction of inert gas in the <b>breathing</b> <b>mixture.</b> As a consequence, the conditions for maximising the degree of unsaturation are a breathing gas with the lowest possible fraction of inert gas – i.e. pure oxygen, at the maximum permissible partial pressure.
