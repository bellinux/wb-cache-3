2500|$|The most {{recognisable}} decorated Arretine form is Dragendorff 11, a large, deep goblet {{on a high}} <b>pedestal</b> <b>base,</b> closely resembling some silver table {{vessels of}} the same period, such as the Warren Cup. [...] The iconography, too, tended to match the subjects and styles seen on silver plate, namely mythological and genre scenes, including erotic subjects, and small decorative details of swags, leafy wreaths and ovolo (egg-and-tongue) borders that may be compared with elements of Augustan architectural ornament. The deep form of the Dr.11 allowed the poinçons (stamps) used making the moulds of human and animal figures to be fairly large, often about 5–6cm high, and the modelling is frequently very accomplished indeed, attracting the interest of modern art-historians as well as archaeologists. [...] Major workshops, {{such as those of}} M.Perennius Tigranus, P. Cornelius and Cn. Ateius, stamped their products, and the names of the factory-owners and of the workers within the factories, which often appear on completed bowls and on plain wares, have been extensively studied, as have the forms of the vessels, and the details of their dating and distribution.|$|E

Not portrayed on-screen by an actor, the Face of Boe is a wholly mechanical effect, resembling a gigantic human-like head with a weathered face and in place of hair, numerous tendrils which terminate in round pod-like structures. Typically it is encased in a clear sealed container and mounted on a movable <b>pedestal</b> <b>base.</b> The Face merely grunted during his appearance in [...] "The End of the World", communicated telepathically in [...] "New Earth" [...] and [...] "Gridlock", and spoke {{for the first and}} last time in the latter, and was voiced by Struan Rodger. It is stated in [...] "New Earth" [...] that he is thought to be millions of years old (billions, at least according to [...] "Gridlock"); however, when this was suggested to him, he responded with a leading question concerning the impossibility of such an age. It was suggested in [...] "Last of the Time Lords" [...] that the Face of Boe is a future Jack Harkness.|$|E

25|$|Where {{the towers}} are founded on {{underwater}} piers, caissons are sunk and any soft bottom is excavated for a foundation. If the bedrock is too deep {{to be exposed}} by excavation or the sinking of a caisson, pilings are driven to the bedrock or into overlying hard soil, or a large concrete pad to distribute the weight over less resistant soil may be constructed, first preparing the surface with a bed of compacted gravel. (Such a pad footing can also accommodate the movements of an active fault, {{and this has been}} implemented on the foundations of the cable-stayed Rio-Antirio bridge.) The piers are then extended above water level, where they are capped with <b>pedestal</b> <b>bases</b> for the towers.|$|R

50|$|Irwin {{recently}} completed {{the second phase}} of the installation of a primordial Palm Garden at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art which began in 2007. The Palm Garden is arranged in a “T” shape with the east-west axis running between and around, both the Broad Contemporary Art Museum and the Resnick Pavilion. The north-south axis terminates with a grid of date palms serving as a counterpoint to artist Chris Burden’s Urban Light installation. Irwin has long been intrigued with how palm trees capture and reflect Southern California light; designing the Palm Garden provided Irwin with an opportunity to work with both the phenomenal and cultural perceptions of palms. Individual species of palms are planted in Cor-Ten boxes, modern and formalized versions of common wood nursery boxes. The sculptural containers make reference to the <b>pedestal</b> <b>bases</b> traditionally signifying art objects. Irwin’s use of palm trees considers the ubiquitous and iconic connection between the palm tree and images of Los Angeles.|$|R
