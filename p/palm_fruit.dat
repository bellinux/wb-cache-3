Males may spend more than two months chewing the veins of leaves and palm fronds until they fall to form a shelter. Individuals use tactile, visual, and acoustic stimuli to communicate.

60|$|And if I {{allow this}} flower {{to be the}} first we take up for careful study in Proserpina, on account of its {{simplicity}} of form and splendour of colour, I wish you also to remember, in connection with it, the cause of Proserpine's eternal captivity--her having tasted a pomegranate seed,--the pomegranate being in Greek mythology what the apple is in the Mosaic legend; and, in the whole {103} worship of Demeter, associated with the poppy by a multitude of ideas which are not definitely expressed, but can only be gathered out of Greek art and literature, as we learn their symbolism. The chief character on which these thoughts are founded is the fulness of seed in the poppy and pomegranate, as an image of life: then the forms of both became adopted for beads or bosses in ornamental art; the pomegranate remains more distinctly a Jewish and Christian type, from its use in the border of Aaron's robe, down to the fruit in the hand of Angelico's and Botticelli's Infant Christs; while the poppy is gradually confused by the Byzantine Greeks with grapes; and both of these with <b>palm</b> <b>fruit.</b> The palm, in the shorthand of their art, gradually becomes a symmetrical branched ornament with two pendent bosses; this is again confused with the Greek iris, (Homer's blue iris, and Pindar's water-flag,)--and the Florentines, in adopting Byzantine ornament, read it into their own Fleur-de-lys; but insert two poppyheads {{on each side of the}} entire foil, in their finest heraldry.|$|E

40|$|After harvest, macaw <b>palm</b> <b>fruits</b> show high {{deterioration}} rates when improperly preserved. A {{possible cause}} {{is the high}} fruit water content favoring enzymatic and microbiological degradation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of drying on the mesocarp oil quality during storage and to set the drying curve of macaw <b>palm</b> <b>fruits.</b> For that, two experiments were carried out. In the first, the drying curve of macaw <b>palm</b> <b>fruits</b> was determined at 60 °C, and mathematical models were defined for the process. Drying was performed with freshly harvested fruits (S 0) and with fruits stored for 20 days after harvest (S 20). Fruits were stored for 20 days after harvested and then went through drying. The fruits were dried in a prototype dryer at 60 °C. After drying, the fruits were stored for different periods (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 days) and evaluated for oil physicochemical parameters. When compared to S 0, drying of macaw <b>palm</b> <b>fruits</b> in the S 20 treatment showed a lower drying time until equilibrium moisture was reached. In general, all the mathematical models tested were adequate to describe the drying process. Fruits dried at 60 °C controlled mesocarp oil acidification for up to 90 days in storage. On the other hand, drying impaired the mesocarp oil oxidative stability. We may conclude that the drying process is efficient to maintain acidity during the storage of macaw <b>palm</b> <b>fruits...</b>|$|R

The recent problem in the industry is to resolve the oil content dispute between the oil mill owners and fruit owners in fastest possible time, in order for both parties to directly determine the price based on the actual percentage of oil contents in the oil <b>palm</b> <b>fruits.</b> For the parameters that have been studied, by using the conventional methods, the results shown that the bunch weight of 30 - 39 kg and the tree ages of 8 - 12 years old have the highest oil contents. Therefore, by using the Near Infrared Spectrometer, it will be used to provide faster and reliable results and it will be expected to replace the conventional methods as it has potential to reduce time and energy-consuming in years to come.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Palm oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} agricultural products in the areas of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and South America, which plays a crucial role in economic development. Maturity or ripeness of the <b>palm</b> oil <b>fruits</b> commands the quality, as well as the overall marketing of palm oil produced. The traditional method for the detection of <b>palm</b> oil <b>fruit</b> maturity involves manual detection of maturity fresh <b>palm</b> oil <b>fruits</b> or counting number of fruits loosened in a bunch. Manual counting of fresh <b>palm</b> oil <b>fruits</b> is a labor-intensive process takes a long time, leading to bias and human error, which affects dramatically the profitability of farmers. This study uses a genetic algorithm to develop palm oil ripeness index. Genetic algorithms are adaptive heuristic search algorithm based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics. The results of this study indicated that genetic algorithm is useful for the detection of palm oil maturity. This has been achieved for the overall accuracy of (67. 10 %), while accuracy of (60 %) and (73. 60 %) were achieved for under-ripe and ripe <b>palm</b> oil <b>fruits</b> respectively...|$|R
