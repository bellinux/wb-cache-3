5|$|When Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) demands £4000 {{for some}} goods he asked Anthony and Tyler to sell, Anthony says he only has £3000 as {{he needed to}} pay some bills. He agrees to sell a {{necklace}} {{to get some of}} the money, but instead, he gives it to Amira. He then gambles the rest but loses it. Derek then asks Anthony and Tyler to either pay up or steal cable from the railway, otherwise he will break their legs. Anthony goes to Michael for financial help but Michael locks Anthony in his office and calls the police, who arrest Derek and Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), who offered to help the brothers. They are released without charge, but Derek then accuses Anthony and Tyler of calling the police, and increases their debt to £8000.

5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston <b>pays</b> <b>off</b> his bounty and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E

5000|$|Decision-making {{research}} {{has revealed that}} the debt-snowball method is a very common approach to managing multiple debts, even when larger debts have larger interest rates. Amar, Ariely, Ayal, Cryder, and Rick (2011) observed this tendency in surveys of indebted consumers and in incentive-compatible experiments. Amar et al. (2011) found that people naturally use the snowball method, by <b>paying</b> <b>off</b> small debts first, and this reflects negatively on their financial outcomes since they keep on <b>paying</b> <b>off</b> debts in an inefficient way. Moreover, Amar et al. (2011) found that restricting participants’ ability to completely <b>pay</b> <b>off</b> small debts actually helped them to reduce overall debt more quickly, by refocusing their attention on <b>paying</b> <b>off</b> high-interest debts. The natural tendency to <b>pay</b> <b>off</b> small debts first (which Amar et al. termed [...] "debt account aversion") {{has been attributed to}} the appeal of achieving goals that are near completion and the tendency for multiple losses (e.g., debts) to be more distressing than a single loss of equivalent total value.|$|R

25|$|Normally batsmen never {{attempt to}} run byes when the wicket-keeper catches the ball. However, in {{situations}} {{at the end}} of a game when the batting team must score runs quickly in order to have a chance of winning, the batsmen may risk running a bye and hope that the wicket-keeper fumbles the ball or throws it inaccurately when attempting to run a batsman out. The usual result of this is a batsman's being run out, but sometimes the tactic <b>pays</b> <b>off</b> with a few One Day International matches having been won on byes.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{carnivorous}} {{plants are}} poor competitors, because they invest too heavily in structures {{that have no}} selective advantage in nutrient-rich habitats. They succeed only where other plants fail. Carnivores are to nutrients what cacti are to water. Carnivory only <b>pays</b> <b>off</b> when the nutrient stress is high and where light is abundant. When these conditions are not met, some plants give up carnivory temporarily. Sarracenia spp. produce flat, non-carnivorous leaves (phyllodes) in winter. Light levels are lower than in summer, so light is more limiting than nutrients, and carnivory does not pay. The lack of insects in winter exacerbates the problem. Damage to growing pitcher leaves prevent them from forming proper pitchers, and again, the plant produces a phyllode instead.|$|E
50|$|Mortgage {{acceleration}} is {{the practice}} of <b>paying</b> <b>off</b> a mortgage loan faster than required by terms of the mortgage agreement.
