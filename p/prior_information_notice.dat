In Malang {{there are a}} lot of public <b>information</b> <b>notices</b> found in public places especially in crowded area such as Pasar Besar area and campus area. In the application, some public <b>information</b> <b>notices</b> use figurative language to gain certain effect for the readers. Figurative language is the utterance or expression used to express things in unusual way. Using Reaske (1966) definition of figurative {{language and}} Yule (1996) theory of context, this study is aimed to identify (1) the types of figurative language found in public infomation notice in Malang (2) the meaning of figrative language used in public <b>information</b> <b>notice.</b> This study uses qualitative approach in relation of the document analysis. The document analysis is intended to provide clear description about the text in the public <b>information</b> <b>notice.</b> This study finds that (1) figurative languages used in the public <b>information</b> <b>notices</b> in Pasar Besar area and campus area in Malang are sarcasm, metaphor, irony, synecdoche, hyperbole, and personification.

40|$|In {{statistical}} practice, {{whether a}} Bayesian or frequentist approach {{is used in}} inference depends {{not only on the}} availability of <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> but also on the attitude taken toward partial <b>prior</b> <b>information,</b> with frequentists tending to be more cautious than Bayesians. The proposed framework defines that attitude in terms of a specified amount of caution, thereby enabling data analysis at the level of caution desired and on the basis of any <b>prior</b> <b>information.</b> The caution parameter represents the attitude toward partial <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> {{in much the same way}} as a loss function represents the attitude toward risk. When there is very little <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> and nonzero caution, the resulting inferences correspond to those of the candidate confidence intervals and p-values that are most similar to the credible intervals and hypothesis probabilities of the specified Bayesian posterior. On the other hand, in the presence of a known physical distribution of the parameter, inferences are based only on the corresponding physical posterior. In those extremes of either negligible <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> or complete <b>prior</b> <b>information,</b> inferences do not depend on the degree of caution. Partial <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> between those two extremes leads to intermediate inferences that are more frequentistic to the extent that the caution is high and more Bayesian to the extent that the caution is low...|$|R

40|$|In {{electrical}} impedance tomography, currents {{are applied to}} the body through electrodes that {{are attached to the}} surface and the corresponding surface voltages are measured. Based on these boundary measurements, the internal admittivity distribution of the body can be reconstructed. In order to improve the image quality it is necessary and useful to apply physiologically meaningful <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> into the image reconstruction. Such <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> usually can be obtained from other sources. For example, information on the object's boundary shape and internal structure can be obtained from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan. However, this type of <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> may change {{from time to time and}} from person to person. As these changes are limited anatomically and physiologically, the <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> including the possible changes can be presented in a number of variational forms. The aim of this paper is to find which form of <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> is more compatible for a specific imaged object at the time of imaging. This paper proposes a new method for selecting the most appropriate form of <b>prior</b> <b>information,</b> through the procedure of iterative image reconstruction by using the information obtained from boundary measurements. The method is based on the principle that incompatible <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> causes errors which are able to affect the image reconstruction's convergence behavior. In this method, according to the various forms of <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> available, several image reconstruction configurations are designed. Then, through monitoring the convergence behavior in an iterative image reconstruction, the configuration with compatible <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> can be found among those different configurations.

Shape <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> is captured from a training set and is introduced in the optimization procedure to restrict the evolution into allowable shapes. In this way, the evolution converges onto regions even with weak boundaries. Although significant effort has been devoted on different ways of capturing and analyzing <b>prior</b> <b>information,</b> very little thought has been devoted on the way of combining image <b>information</b> with <b>prior</b> <b>information.</b> This paper focuses on a more natural way of incorporating the <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> in the level set framework. For proof of concept the method is applied on hippocampus segmentation in T 1 -MR images. Hippocampus segmentation is a very challenging task, due to the multivariate surrounding region and the missing boundary with the neighboring amygdala, whose intensities are identical. The proposed method, mimics the human segmentation way and thus shows enhancements in the segmentation accuracy.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces the}} theory of compressive sensing with <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> about a signal 2 ̆ 7 s sparse representation. We show, mathematically and in numerical simulations, that <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> improves signal reconstruction, in terms of number of required measurements, computation time and signal-to-noise ratios. Following, we present a set of methods for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and tomography that can be combined with <b>prior</b> <b>information,</b> for enhanced image quality. ^ In developing {{the theory of}} compressive sensing with <b>prior</b> <b>information,</b> we provide a mathematical proof of the required condition (in terms of number of linear measurements) for reconstruction using the ideal approach of 2 ̆ 6 ell; 0 -minimization, {{as well as the}} necessary and sufficient conditions for reconstruction using 2 ̆ 6 ell; 1 -minimization. We then develop the theory for evaluating the probability of reconstruction when dealing with stochastic signals, both in the case without and with <b>prior</b> <b>information.</b> Furthermore, we compare the proposed models with the empirical probability of reconstruction, by evaluating in Monte-Carlo simulations the percentage of cases in which the conditions for reconstruction with <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> are satisfied, opposed to compressive sensing without <b>prior</b> <b>information.</b> These analyzes show that <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> about the sparse representation 2 ̆ 7 s support reduces the number of linear measurements required to reconstruct a signal, both in terms of the theoretical lower bound and of the 2 ̆ 6 ell; 1 -minimization procedure, commonly used in the compressive sensing literature. ^ Regarding practical reconstruction algorithms, we provide an optimization procedure for compressive sensing with <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> based on 2 ̆ 6 ell; p-minimization. The experimental results show that further improvement can be obtained by combining support <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> with the reduction of the p parameter in the 2 ̆ 6 ell;p-minimization. Furthermore, by using this method we show that partial support information also reduces the total computation time, when using a direct method to solve the inner linear systems. For a fixed number of taken linear measurements, on the other hand, the experiments show that <b>prior</b> <b>information</b> improves the signal-to-noise ratios of the reconstructed signals. ^ The dissertation also proposes a compressive sensing method for enhanced reconstruction of magnetic resonance (MR) images using a prefiltering strategy in the k-space domain. This method can improve the quality of the reconstruction over a standard compressive sensing approach. In particular, it leads to higher signal-to-noise ratios, and generally to lower reconstruction times. Also, it easily allows for a parallel implementation since different computation stages are independent of each other, which can further reduce the reconstruction times by a factor of up to three, in the tested reconstruction schemes. ^ Finally, we show how the proposed MR imaging method can be combined with the previous approach of compressive sensing with <b>prior</b> <b>information.</b> The experiments conducted over simulated and real MR images and functional MR images show a further improvement by combining pre-filtering in the k-space domain with the use of support <b>prior</b> <b>information,</b> in terms of visual quality and signal-to-noise ratios. ...|$|R
