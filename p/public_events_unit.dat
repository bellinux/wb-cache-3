A headache {{is an example of a}} private event and a car accident is an example of a <b>public</b> <b>event.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>events</b> differ {{mainly in}} size and nature {{including}} duration and location. The transport issues arising during <b>public</b> <b>events</b> are provision of traveller information, parking and public transport, management of traffic and reduction of community impact. The stakeholders concerned with <b>public</b> <b>events</b> {{have an important role}} to play in the transport planning process. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a framework for planning <b>public</b> <b>events</b> for organisers and local councils in relation to the transport issues. The output will be in the form of checklists for promoters, local councils, transport operators, traffic managers and the Police Department. This study involved a review of available literature on transport aspects of <b>public</b> <b>events</b> and examined events at both ends of the spectrum of event sizes, namely small scale and large scale events. Small scale events are dependent on the existing supply of transport services in which the major mode of transport is private transport. On the other hand, large scale events are greatly dependent on the existing and additional supply of transport in which the major mode of transport is still private transport, but public transport plays an important role. Administrative procedures for <b>public</b> <b>events</b> vary from local council to local council. Implementation of uniform local law pertaining to <b>public</b> <b>events</b> is currently under preparation in some local councils. However, it does not adequately address the transport issues. In the case of small scale events, organisers must submit their application to the relevant local council, prior to the event, preferably four weeks before the event. The local council consults with the Police, local residents and local businesses and approves the <b>public</b> <b>event.</b> On the other hand, the administrative procedures for large scale <b>public</b> <b>events</b> are similar to small scale events except planning span, appointment of event co-ordinator and the need to organise additional supply of public transport services. A municipal survey of the administrative procedures used to manage small scale <b>public</b> <b>events,</b> a vehicle occupancy survey during a cricket match and travel survey during a cricket and a football match were conducted and the results were analysed. The municipal survey has highlighted the extent to which municipalities follow a regulated procedure in the process of approving small scale <b>public</b> <b>events.</b> Within the time scale of this project, it has not been possible to explore in depth, the effectiveness of the various procedures. It is acknowledged that most detailed and involved administrative procedures may not always produce the best results. Clearly, there is likely to be merit in a system which retains some flexibility to respond to the unique characteristics of a particular event. Unquestionably, there is scope for further work in this area. The travel survey revealed that transport planning for large scale <b>public</b> <b>events</b> should focus on supply of additional public transport services, parking restrictions and effective traveller information systems to encourage public transport use. This study recommends that a position of event co-ordinator be created, especially in the case of large scale <b>public</b> <b>events</b> and the provision of statutory standards for traveller information, temporary traffic signs, parking provision, public transport provision, traffic management and community impact reduction for <b>public</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R

40|$|In 2 {{studies with}} older adults, the authors {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} executive attention resources on the retrieval of emotional <b>public</b> <b>events.</b> Participants completed a battery of working memory tasks, {{as a measure of}} executive attention, and a battery of tasks assessing memory, as well as subjective experiences associated with the retrieval of remote <b>public</b> <b>events.</b> Participants also rated the valence of each <b>public</b> <b>event</b> story. The group-rated valence of the <b>public</b> <b>event</b> stories predicted retrieval and the quality of experiences associated with them, such that emotionally arousing events elicited the highest memory rates and the richest experiences. Furthermore, positive <b>public</b> <b>events</b> elicited the highest memory rates. Executive attention moderated only the relationship between event valence and how participants’ associated memories are experienced at retrieval, such that superior executive attention resources predicted richer experiences associated with positive relative to neutral and negative stories. The current results extend previous findings on the effects of aging on emotion regulation, suggesting that cognitive control resources modulate subjective experiences associated with retrieved memories for remote real life events, but not memory retrieval itself...|$|R
