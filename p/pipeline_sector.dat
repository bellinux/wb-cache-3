External interference continues to be {{the most common cause of}} pipeline damage despite a range of technical and legislative measures in place. This research project aims to enhance the safety strategies regarding third party pipeline strikes by giving the <b>pipeline</b> <b>sector</b> a greater understanding of the motivations and priorities of those who work around pipeline assets and so how to work with them to achieve better outcomes. Using data gathered from more than 70 in-depth interviews, we explore empirically alternate understandings of risk amongst a range of stakeholders responsible for work near or around high-pressure gas transmission pipelines in Australia. Outside the <b>pipeline</b> <b>sector,</b> much of the work around pipelines is conducted by those at the bottom of long chains of contractors and sub-contractors. We discuss perceptions of risk held by a range of third party actors whose activities have the potential to threaten gas pipeline integrity. We compare these views with gas pipeline industry perceptions of risk, couched in terms of asset management, public safety, legal and insurance obligations, and reputation management. This paper focuses on how financial risk and so also management of the potential for pipeline strikes is shifted down the third party contractor chain. The data shows that third party contractors feel the time and cost impact of design or project changes most immediately. Consequently, strikes or near misses may result as sub-contractors seek to avoid perceived &# 039;unnecessary&# 039; time delays along with the associated financial impact. We argue that efforts to reduce the potential for pipeline strike need to be targeted at structural changes, rather than simply aimed at worker risk perception and enforcement of safety compliance strategies...|$|E

40|$|Note by the secretariat 1. The {{development}} of modern transport and related infrastructure {{is critical for}} the {{development of}} international trade and the international mobility of production factors. Transport services are horizontal: they service all sectors of the economy at various stages of production, distribution and consumption. From a geographical perspective, effective transportation contributes to levelling out regional imbalances both within countries and at the European level. This transport function is particularly important in view of the integration prospects in Europe and intensified exchanges between the European Union (EU) and the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). 2. In statistical terms, transport services include activities related to providing passenger or freight transport by rail, pipeline, road, water or air. Different types of transport vary considerably in terms of factor intensities. Rail and pipeline transport for example, are highly capital-intensive, whereas road transport is not. At the same time, rail transport and road transportare labour-intensive, whereas in the <b>pipeline</b> <b>sector</b> the labour costs are marginal.

40|$|Worldwide, {{there has}} been a rapid growth in the use of {{pipelines}} to transport energy products. Due to the strategic nature of energy products that are transported by pipelines, the importance of risk awareness, assessment and management cannot be over-emphasised. With the risk of pipeline disruptions increasing globally, energy pipeline organisations are compelled to incorporate measures that should help to identify and address areas that can lead to energy pipeline disruptions. The incorporation of such measures for any organisation is premised on an understanding and appreciation of the risks involved. Given the strategic importance of energy pipelines, the main {{purpose of this paper is}} to establish whether the South African energy <b>pipeline</b> <b>sector</b> and the public at large appreciate the risks associated with energy pipelines. Thus, the paper seeks to ascertain awareness of the risks associated with the energy pipeline's physical environment, not only from the energy pipeline operators, but also from communities who are exposed to such risks.

40|$|Risk {{management}} {{is an integral}} part of a successful project planning and control mechanism. Standards, e. g., AS/NZS ISO 31000 : 2009, establish frameworks on how to perform comprehensive risk management process. However, there remain gaps in enacting such standards in reality, one of which is balancing risk treatment with the associated costs to risk-bearing project stakeholders. Although many studies were carried out to identify the range of factors representing project risk events and the recommended responses, very little has addressed the means of making such decisions. In this context, the guided search capabilities of evolutionary algorithms can play a role. After discussing and modeling the costs and benefits of alternative risk treatment strategies, the paper introduces ant colony as a capable algorithm for the balanced selection of such strategies.

Based on the criteria established by senior management, the risk management plan goes about defining how each risk is to be handled.

5000|$|The {{state of}} the tourism sector is widely {{regarded}} as below potential, especially given the country’s rich history, ancient ruins, Mediterranean climate, and diverse geography. Despite personal appeals by the king and an increasingly sophisticated marketing campaign, the industry is still adversely affected by the political instability of the region. More than 5 million visitors entered Jordan in 2004, generating US$1.3 billion in earnings. Earnings from tourism rose to US$1.4 billion in 2005. The fact that the bulk of Jordan’s tourist trade emanates from elsewhere in the Middle East should contribute to the industry’s growth potential in the years ahead, as Jordan is relatively stable, open, and safe in comparison to many of its neighbors. [...] The tourism sector remains an important element of the Jordanian economy, directly employing some 30,000 Jordanians and contributing 10% to the kingdom’s GDP. Despite a decline in Arab and Gulf visitors, 2007 marked a year of steady growth for the tourism sector. Revenues jumped 13% to nearly $2.11bn during the first 11 months, up from $1.86bn for the same period in 2006. The sector is overseen by the government’s National Tourism Strategy (NTS), which was established in 2004 to take the industry through 2010. NTS aimed to double tourism revenues during the period and to increase tourism-related jobs to 91,719. The first goal has already been met but the second one might be more of a challenge: between 2004 and 2007 the total number of people employed in the sector rose from 23,544 to 35,484. This is impressive growth, but less than half the 90,000-or-more goal. NTS hopes to place Jordan as a boutique destination for high-end tourists. The strategy identifies seven priorities or niche markets: cultural heritage (archaeology); religious; ecotourism; health and wellness; adventure; meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE); and cruises. The Jordan Tourism Board’s (JTB) marketing budget has increased in the past year from JD6m ($8.52m) to JD11.5m ($16.3m). These are positive times for tourism in Jordan, with steady growth and major projects in the <b>pipeline.</b> The <b>sector</b> has to make improvements of infrastructure and marketing, but overall the industry has been improving for the past several years.|$|R
40|$|While network {{studies have}} focused on mapping out the {{structural}} linkages between participants within a policy network, less attentionhas been paid to the behaviours of policy actors. Attention to network behaviour is important because it varies and with implications for the performance, legitimacy, and effectiveness of government. This dissertation seeks to examine actor behaviour by investigating the challenges, opportunities, and coping strategies of public servants who work in policy networks. Interviews were conducted with forty-five Canadian federal public servants across four horizontal initiatives: the Mackenzie Gas <b>Pipeline</b> Project, the <b>Sector</b> Council Program, Team Canada Inc, and the Federal Initiative to Address HIV/AIDS in Canada. Together with organizational documents and reports, these interviews highlight the limited ability of networks to support long-term policy development, translate political ambiguity into policy outputs, generate effective leadership, and adopt new collegial cultures. Reconfiguration of existing accountabilities, renewal of central agency support structures, and increased senior leadership might help public servants to overcome key network challenges: gaining inclusion, obtaining commitment, facilitating collegiality, and achieving agreement. This work highlights the importance of actor-centred understandings of collaboration. It reveals distinct challenges for public servants when they collaborate with other public servants, stakeholders, and political actors and uses a framework of rule contestation due to an institutional deficit to understand why they face these challenges. In turn, the concept of rule contestation raises important questions regarding the fit of current political and administrative arrangements for governance in an increasingly networked era...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSteel {{pipelines}} are {{an important}} part of industrial operations in many <b>sectors.</b> <b>Pipelines</b> serve to transport media in liquid and gaseous state. Ducts, with a ratio of pipe diameter to wall thickness up to 150 are considered as simple beams. Ducts with higher ratio are considered as shell elements. In literature we can find how to calculate these structures stressed by many kinds of load. Failures, that have occurred in recent past suggest, that the issue of industrial piping design is not yet fully explored. The phenomenon presented in this study is behaviour of reinforced steel shell stressed by temperature changes. Due to high temperature load, there is a big temperature deformation of the whole system. However, the deformation caused by temperature is not the same in all parts of the system. As the high temperature source is inside the pipe, the highest temperature is on the inner surface of the shell. The variation of the temperature in the shell and partial warming of ring stiffeners is caused by heat conduction. Due to the different temperatures of the surrounding environment, the stiffener is warmed less than the shell. Therefore the shell and the stiffener are deformed in a different way. The research is, in more details, focused on the area close to the ring stiffener, where it is a higher possibility of cracks initiation and their expansion due to the cyclical stress. The aim of this study is a construction life diagnosis considering this detail; eventually a proposal of a more effective construction detail...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of sustainable financial management {{of water and}} wastewater pipeline infrastructure has grown in recent years due to the increasing backlog of maintenance, renewal and replacement of aging water and wastewater infrastructure. As the water and wastewater infrastructure age, {{the condition of the}} water and wastewater infrastructure will continue to deteriorate increasing the cost for renewal and replacement. In response to the aging and deteriorating potable water and wastewater infrastructure Public Sector Accounting Board PS 3150 and Regulation 453 / 07 under the Ontario Safe Drinking Water Act were established. PS 3150 requires local governments to report their tangible capital assets along with their depreciation on financial statements. One key component of this reporting is determining the need for and cost of the replacement of these assets. Ontario Regulation 453 / 07 requires public utilities to prepare and submit long term financial plans for water systems. One key principle of the financial plans is that the expenses of operating water systems should be paid by revenues generated from providing the water systems. A crucial aspect of PS 3150, Ontario regulation 453 / 07 and the financial management of water and wastewater infrastructure are accurate estimates of future capital works construction prices. Historically, construction indices are used to forecast construction prices. Engineering New Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index (CCI), Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) composite National Highway Construction Cost Index (NHCCI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) have been used to estimate future construction prices of water and wastewater infrastructure in Canada. However, these indices do not accurately represent the circumstance of the water and wastewater infrastructure construction sector, which can lead to errors and inaccuracies in construction price forecasts. It is recommended sector specific construction indices be used to forecast construction prices. However, there are few construction indices available for the water and wastewater infrastructure sector and available indices are not based on actual construction data. This thesis presents a methodology to accurately estimate future construction prices for water and wastewater pipeline capital works based on actual construction price data. The methodology contains three components: construction data processing, development of unit price indices for watermain and sanitary sewer construction, and estimation of inflation in watermain and sanitary sewer construction. The data processing component cleans and transforms actual construction price data from the City of Niagara Falls from 1981 to 2014 into a centralized, organized and auditable construction price dataset. Based on the construction price dataset, unit price indices specific to the watermain and sanitary sewer construction sector were developed. Unit price indices were developed and calculated for watermain projects, pipes, valves, and hydrants, and sanitary sewer projects, pipes, and maintenance holes. Geometric Brownian Motion was used to estimate inflation in and forecast future construction prices for watermain and sanitary sewer capital works construction based on the developed unit price indices. A Microsoft Access relational database containing the data processing function, calculation of watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices, and estimation of inflation was developed to improve the accuracy, efficiency and consistency of the methodology. Additionally, the methodology allows contractor markup in watermain and sanitary sewer construction and factors influencing watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices to be examined. The inflation of watermain reference project construction is 5. 79 % per annum from 1982 - 2014, while the inflation of sanitary sewer reference project capital works construction is 4. 66 % per annum from 1981 - 2014. The inflation rates of watermain pipe, valve and hydrant construction from 1982 - 2014 are 6. 36 %, 5. 09 %, and 2. 81 % per annum, respectively. The inflation rates of sanitary sewer pipe and maintenance hole construction from 1981 - 2014 are 7. 41 % and 5. 25 % per annum, respectively. Inflation of watermain and sanitary sewer reference projects is above inflation of CPI, NRBCPI and LDCCT at 2. 25 %, 3. 17 % and 3. 77 % per annum, respectively, but below inflation of S&P/TSX composite index at 6. 90 % per annum. This indicates when forecasting future prices within a construction sector, the use of a proxy index will result in inaccurate estimates of future construction prices. In the water and wastewater <b>pipeline</b> construction <b>sector</b> the use of CPI, NRBCPI or LDCCT will result in significant underestimation of future construction prices. To obtain accurate estimates of future construction prices it is important to use sector specific indices which the developed unit price indices represent for the water and wastewater <b>pipeline</b> construction <b>sector.</b> In this thesis contractor markup is defined as a financial premium in excess of market inflation {{in the form of a}} per annum interest rate surcharge. Contractor markup includes risk premiums, overhead and profit. The contractor markups for watermain and sanitary sewer projects are 3. 54 % and 2. 41 %, respectively. As the number of tender bids submitted for a project increase, the unit price of reference projects generally decreases. This is caused by an increase in the competition among contractors resulting in a decrease in the unit prices of the reference projects as bidders attempt to win the project. The Infrastructure Stimulus Fund increased the total number of projects and the total value of projects in 2009 and 2010 but did not significantly alter the watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices...|$|R

With the introduction of pipeline natural gas from Mozambique, the South African government, which holds a stake in the natural gas pipeline, has made clear its intentions of opening the industry to more players, in order to squash once and for all the industry perception of Sasol being a monopolistic player in gas industry. The government intends to eradicate this perception by entrenching regulations and an Act that would see the transmission and distribution of pipeline gas being open to companies that would compete with Sasol. According to agreements reached with the South African government, Sasol shall be given a certain grace period, to be able to recoup its investment in the 1, 9 billion US pipeline, where-after the pipeline shall be open to players who satisfy certain government conditions. Depending on the proven gas reserves the period could be from 0 to 10 years from the first gas. New players are envisaged to enter the downstream end of the pipeline gas industry as mostly independent distributors and retailers of gas. The fight for market share will certainly intensify. As a result of these implications Sasol Gas, a subsidiary of Sasol, will have to look at new ways of retaining and protecting its markets from new entrants. A point of departure has been to gauge how satisfied customers are with Sasol’s present offering. Customer satisfaction has long been a construct looked at as the primary essential in marketing oriented companies. The customer satisfaction principle has evolved from “primitive marketing tools” the more recent sophisticated measuring tools such as the Customer Satisfaction Index. An exploratory survey to assess customer satisfaction levels and pertinent issues of satisfaction has been carried out at Sasol Gas. The survey instrument was designed along the American Customer Satisfaction Index Fornell (1994) satisfaction antecedents i. e. perceived value, perceived quality, customer expectations and satisfaction consequences of customer loyalty and customer complaints. It should be stressed here that the aspect of quality was limited to customer service only and not to the physical product and reliability of supply. These two aspects were considered by all customers as givens. However emphasis should be made that due to the exploratory nature of this study, the methodology used iii was to assess quantitative as well as qualitative issues. Thus the designed instrument addressed both quantitative as well as qualitative aspects. It is the intention of the author of this report to create a more comprehensive questionnaire, {{along the lines of the}} American Customer Satisfaction Index, to cover the entire South African Energy industry spectrum...|$|R
