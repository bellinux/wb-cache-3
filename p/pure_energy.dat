5|$|For some readers, Arthur C. Clarke's more {{straightforward}} novelization of {{the script}} is key to interpreting the film. Clarke's novel explicitly identifies the monolith as a tool created by an alien race that has been through many stages of evolution, moving from organic form to biomechanical, and finally achieving a state of <b>pure</b> <b>energy.</b> These aliens travel the cosmos assisting lesser species to take evolutionary steps. Conversely, film critic Penelope Houston wrote in 1971 that because the novel differs in many key respects from the film, it perhaps should not {{be regarded as the}} skeleton key to unlock it.|$|E

He is a human-shaped {{apparition}} composed of <b>pure</b> <b>energy,</b> {{with a single}} eye-shaped object located where a person's stomach would be. He is able to conjure several weapons for use in battle, including a rapier and large chakram. His other powers include the ability to change his size at will and teleportation. Towards the end of The Subspace Emissary, it is revealed that Tabuu is the entity that controlled Master Hand and the true antagonist behind {{the events of the}} story.|$|E
5|$|The agents find Banton at {{the train}} station, but he runs to a poorly lit area. He {{declares}} that walking into his shadow will kill the agents, so Mulder shoots out the overhead lights. Banton allows himself {{to be taken to}} a mental hospital, where he is put in a room with soft light per his own request. He tells the agents that the accident in his lab caused his shadow to behave like a black hole, splitting atoms into component particles and reducing matter into <b>pure</b> <b>energy.</b> Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents, and that the government wants to exploit him. Detective Ryan and her superior officer stop the questioning, declaring the case closed, despite Mulder's objections. Mulder contacts X (Steven Williams), who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton. However, X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power. In the process, the two attendants are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton's shadow falls upon them. Banton flees from the hospital.|$|E

The outlook would be more favorable if the plasma could reabsorb the radiation. Absorption occurs primarily via Thomson scattering on the electrons, which has a total cross section of σT = 6.65×10−29 m².

25|$|Several Hindu stories present {{alternate}} {{aspects of}} Parvati, {{such as the}} ferocious, violent aspect as Shakti and related forms. Shakti is <b>pure</b> <b>energy,</b> untamed, unchecked and chaotic. Her wrath crystallizes into a dark, blood-thirsty, tangled-hair Goddess with an open mouth and a drooping tongue. This goddess is usually identified as the terrible Mahakali or Kali (time). In Linga Purana, Parvati metamorphoses into Kali, on the request of Shiva, to destroy a female asura (demoness) Daruka. Even after destroying the demoness, Kali's wrath could not be controlled. To lower Kali's rage, Shiva appeared as a crying baby. The cries of the baby raised the maternal instinct of Kali who resorts back to her benign form as Parvati.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Rushd (Averroës), the {{contemporary}} of Maimonides, closed {{the first great}} philosophical era of the Muslims. He was a defender of Aristotelian philosophy against Ash'ari theologians led by Al-Ghazali. Averroes' philosophy was considered controversial in Muslim circles. The theories of Ibn Rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Tufail, who only follow the teachings of Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Al-Farabi. Like all Islamic Peripatetics, Ibn Rushd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated {{from place to place}} to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme worldhypotheses which, {{in the mind of the}} Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of <b>pure</b> <b>energy</b> and eternal matter. His ideas on the separation of philosophy and religion, further developed by the Averroist school of philosophy, were later influential in the development of modern secularism.|$|E

25|$|West and Central African {{religious}} practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in {{which members of}} the community, overcome by force (or ashe, nyama, etc.), are excited {{to the point of}} going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or mantric drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in Gabon and Cameroon is the Okuyi, practiced by several Bantu ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness. When this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, practitioners are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of <b>pure</b> <b>energy</b> or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech. Further, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.|$|E
25|$|The Mask of Life's descent ends in Mahri Nui, an {{underwater}} city originally part of Voya Nui before it broke off and {{sunk into the}} sea. Upon sight, it becomes an object {{of interest to the}} Matoran villagers as well as the Barraki: six former warlords sent to the Pit (a prison that sits on the lip of the city) after their crimes as part of the League of Six Kingdoms. But after the Pit was damaged in the Great Cataclysm, they escaped into the surrounding ocean and were mutated by its mutagen waters. Believing the mask can change them back so they can rule the Kingdoms once again, the Barraki battle one another for possession of the Ignika. Meanwhile, the Toa Inika continue their descent through the stone cord, where they battle mutated incarnations of the Piraka, Vezon and an army of murderous Zyglak. Upon reaching the depths of the sea, the Mask of Life transforms the heroes into the water-breathing Toa Mahri, complete with new masks and weapons. The team engage with the Barraki and their aquatic Rahi armies upon arrival, but {{in the midst of the}} battle, Matoro is imprisoned in the Pit by a robotic Maxilos guard that reveals itself as Makuta Teridax, who possessed the robot after his essence followed the Toa through the stone cord. He informs Matoro that Mata Nui's life can only be saved if the Toa shatter the cord, and although not trustful in the villain's words, he relays the information to his team-mates. They agree and evacuate Matoran from both locations before proceeding to destroy the cord; sending Voya Nui plummeting into the ocean and demolishing Mahri Nui in the process. But by the time the Toa Mahri retrieve the Ignika, Mata Nui dies. Believing there's still hope, Matoro - the one person who can touch the Ignika without becoming cursed - races towards a hole in the seabed with it before Voya Nui descends to close it, leaving his team to continue fighting the Barraki. Once in, he falls through a waterfall in what resembles a large cave and hears a voice from inside the mask telling him to put it on. In doing so, Matoro learns of the Ignika's history and how to use it to resurrect Mata Nui. Now knowing it was his destiny to sacrifice himself to save the universe, Matoro uses the sentient mask's powers to teleport the Toa Mahri back to Metru Nui and make them amphibious, before the mask turns his body into <b>pure</b> <b>energy</b> that saves the Great Spirit. Meanwhile, the Maxilos body that Teridax inhabited is found badly damaged after a ferocious battle with the Barraki's armies, and is so presumed dead. Mata Nui has been saved, but remains asleep.|$|E

40|$|Two new &quot;nitely {{deformed}} dynamical beam {{models are}} established for serious study on non-linear vibrations of thick beams subjected to arbitrarily given external loads. The total potentials of these beam models are non-convex with double-well structures, {{which can be}} used in post-buckling analysis and frictional contact problems. Dual extremum principles in unstable dynamic systems are developed. A <b>pure</b> complementary <b>energy</b> principle (in terms of the second Piola}Kirchho!'s type stress only) in &quot;nite deformation mechanics is actually constructed. An interesting triality theory in post-buckling analysis is proved. This theory shows that if the gap function introduced by Gao and Strang in 1989 in positive, the generalized <b>pure</b> complementary <b>energy</b> has only one saddle point, which gives a global stable buckling state. However, if the gap function is negative, the generalized complementary energy may have two so-called super-critical points: the one which minimizes the <b>pure</b> complementary <b>energy</b> gives another relatively stable buckling state; and the other one which maximizes the complementary energy is a unstable buckling state. Application in unilateral buckling problem is illustrated, and an analytic solution for non-linear complementarity problem is obtained. Moreover, the general duality theory proposed recently is generalized into the non-linear dynamical systems. A pair o...|$|R
