2500|$|Another semi-negative {{response}} to the poem followed on 4 January 1808 in the Eclectic Review. The writer, James Montgomery, attacked the 1807 collection of poems for depicting low subjects. When {{it came to the}} ode, Montgomery attacked the poem for depicting pre-existence. After quoting the poem with extracts from the whole collection, he claimed, [...] "We need insist no more on the necessity of using, in poetry, a language different from and superior to 'the real language of men,' since Mr. Wordsworth himself is so frequently compelled to employ it, for the expression of thoughts which without it would be incommunicable. These volumes are distinguished by the same blemishes and beauties as were found in their predecessors, but in an inverse proportion: the defects of the poet, in this performance, being as much greater than his merits, as they were less in his former publication." [...] In his conclusion, Montgomery returned to the ode and claimed, that [...] "the reader is turned loose into a wilderness of sublimity, tenderness, bombast, and absurdity, to find out the subject as well as he can... After our <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks</b> on Mr. Wordsworth's theory of poetical language, and the quotations which we have given from these and his earlier compositions, it will be unnecessary to offer any further estimate or character of his genius. We shall only add one remark.... Of the pieces now published he has said nothing: most of them seem to have been written for no purpose at all, and certainly to no good one." [...] In January 1815, Montgomery returned to Wordsworth's poetry in another review and argues, [...] "Mr. Wordsworth often speaks in ecstatic strains of the pleasure of infancy. If we rightly understand him, he conjectures that the soul comes immediately from a world of pure felicity, when it is born into this troublous scene of care and vicissitude... This brilliant allegory, (for such we must regard it,) is employed to illustrate the mournful truth, that looking back from middle age to the earliest period of remembrance we find, 'That there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth,'... Such is Life".|$|E

Inherent difficulties and complexities in cooperation are highlighted. These have over the years led to a certain marginalization of studies related to cooperation.

Based on that, a reconsideration of cooperation is suggested, as a more evolved form of rational behaviour.

40|$|Abstract. Most of the {{magnetic}} fields of cosmic objects are generated and maintained by dynamo action of the motions of electrically conducting fluids. A brief survey on observational facts concerning cosmic magnetic fields is given. Some basic principles of magnetofluiddynamics are explained. On this basis essential features of the dynamo theory of cosmic objects are developed, first on the kinematic level and later {{taking into account the}} full interaction between magnetic field and motion. Particular attention is paid on mean–field electrodynamics and mean–field magnetofluiddynamics and their application to mean–field dynamo models for objects showing irregular or turbulent motions and magnetic fields. A few explanations are given on dynamos in the Earth and the planets, in the Sun and stellar objects and in galaxies. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>remark</b> The lectures whose main content is reproduced in this article were planned to give an introduction to the dynamo theory of cosmic magnetic fields. It was not the intention of the lectures, and it is not that of this article to deliver a more or less complete survey on all findings or activities. Other represen...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this {{presentation}} {{we focus}} on the problem of minimization of the consumption for the coplanar orbit transfer problem. This problem is usually solved numerically by a shooting method, based on the application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, however the shooting method is known to be hard to initialize and the convergence is difficult to obtain due to discontinuities of the optimal control. Several tricks are known in order to overcome that problem, however in this article we introduce a new approach based on the following <b>preliminary</b> <b>remark.</b> When considering a 2 D flat Earth model with constant gravity, the optimal control problem of passing from an initial configuration to some final configuration by minimizing the consumption can be very efficiently solved, and the solution leads to an extremely efficient algorithm. Based on that, we propose a continuous deformation from this flat Earth model to a modified flat Earth model that is diffeomorphic to the usual round Earth model. The resulting numerical continuation process thus provides a new way {{to solve the problem of}} minimization of the consumption for the coplanar orbit transfer problem...|$|R

40|$|Mass {{customization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} interesting and promising approach in the e-business field. In today's competitive global market the understanding of customer needs is becoming the essential <b>preliminary</b> <b>remark</b> for a successful design and implementation of products. In fact the ability to create customized product configurations fulfilling user’s needs is a major aim sought by many companies, especially the design and implementation of web-based services that allows users to create and customize in a simple and intuitive way a desired product. To define a common vocabulary that opens possibilities such as the ability to express customer requirements correctly and to exchange knowledge, a popular approach uses ontological formalisms. Ontology, in fact, is a key factor for enabling interoperability across heterogeneous systems, services and users. Different users, however, usually represent the same knowledge domain by the use of different ontologies that can differ in structure, concepts, relations and attributes. Therefore, ontology could lose its main feature: allowing the semantic interoperability among actors working on the same knowledge domain. An effective solution to this problem is the introduction of methods for finding mapping among the various components of ontologies. This paper presents an ontology-based configurator system that maximally satisfies user’s needs starting from the desired requirements, the available components, the context information and previous similar configurations...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{sections}} iv and v of part II of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations. In these sections Wittgenstein deals with two closely knit problems: {{our knowledge of}} other minds and {{the subject matter of}} psychology. The interpretation of Wittgenstein's treatment of these problems cannot remain confined to these sections, however, as equally important references to these problems occur elsewhere in the Investigations {{as well as in the}} Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology. Moreover, Wittgenstein's very treatment of the two problems is intertwined with his treatment of some other problems in the philosophy of psychology. For instance, in the context of his discussion of the subject matter of psychology, he points out analogies with problems pertaining to theories of perception. I take these analogies seriously and, therefore, a discussion of perception is interwoven as appropriately. Yet another <b>preliminary</b> <b>remark.</b> Although references to other philosophers and psychologists do not occur in sections iv and v, it does not follow that they were not written in response to others. On the contrary, a substantial part of these (and other) sections is the product of reflecting upon theories produced by Russell, James and Köhler. In my view, the best way to understand Wittgenstein is to involve the standpoints of his adversaries explicitly into the discussion. Otherwise seemingly trivial questions and condensed remarks, gain power and depth when explicitly seen as undermining and reversing dominant theories in philosophy and psychology...|$|R
