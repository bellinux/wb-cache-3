In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to {{participate}} in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a <b>project</b> <b>coordinator</b> for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.|$|E
5|$|VR {{has given}} mixed {{statements}} about the fault-sensitivity of the train. Pentti Kuokkanen, <b>project</b> <b>coordinator</b> of VR Engineering downplayed the problems when questioned about the reliability of another Fiat Ferroviaria multiple unit, the Sm4, in 1999. According to him, the Pendolino had been VR's most reliable passenger train during winter 1998–1999. In 2006, VR's CEO Henri Kuitunen affirmed that the Pendolino was causing serious image problems to VR Group. In 2010, the company's head of traffic control Mauno Haapala stated that the Sm3 was not more fault-sensitive than their other trains. However during winter 2011, VR Group's head of service and production department Pertti Saarela gave a totally different answer, saying that Pendolinos {{are more prone to}} failures especially during winter. It is impossible to know if the train has more problems than VR's other rolling stock, as the company does not give out punctuality statistics for specific train types.|$|E

5|$|Vitarelli's {{personal}} views often {{put him at}} odds with the US government. He personally wanted to help the Palauans become self-sufficient, but the TTPI wanted to focus on improving Micronesia–United States relations. Nevertheless, he established community schools that replaced the Japanese three Rs educational model with Deweyism. In 1962, the TTPI assigned Vitarelli as an architect and <b>project</b> <b>coordinator</b> in the Accelerated Elementary School Program (AESP), a project costing over one million dollars. He wanted to have local Palauans to build schools and houses under this program. The TTPI rejected these plans, insisting that the locals could not meet the project's physical specifications. As a result of this conflict, the TTPI transferred Vitarelli to its headquarters in Saipan. While on Saipan, Vitarelli used local bayogo seeds to create the Bo Jo Bo Wishing Doll for an upcoming arts festival. These traditional-style dolls are still sold on Saipan today.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This article aims to {{describe}} {{an evaluation of}} a national pilot programme of telephone support services for older people in England and Scotland and is focussed on organisational outcomes. Design/methodology/approach – The “Call in Time Programme” {{was funded by the}} national charity Help the Aged and comprised eight telephone support projects in different locations, managed by different voluntary or charitable organisations. Researchers used semi-structured interviews and a Delphi questionnaire to obtain the views of <b>project</b> <b>coordinators.</b> Findings – Although the projects were found to provide a much needed service for socially isolated and lonely older people, the study identified four key areas of concern: operational structure; promotion and publicity; recruitment of volunteers; referral processes. <b>Project</b> <b>coordinators</b> wanted more autonomy and the flexibility to respond to older people's needs. Projects were limited by restrictions imposed by funding bodies or services themselves. Practical implications – <b>Project</b> <b>coordinators</b> recommended more local control over project finances, clear referral pathways linking voluntary and statutory bodies, long-term funding involving <b>project</b> <b>coordinators</b> and older people in planning and delivery, more training for <b>project</b> <b>coordinators,</b> clear record keeping and a coordinated approach to promotion and publicity. Originality/value – While other studies have highlighted the importance of user involvement, this study provides valuable evidence demonstrating that those responsible for managing and delivering telephone support services, and service users, are instrumental in decision making and planning processes. As organisations are streamlined in efforts to increase efficiency and effectiveness, {{there is a need for}} a wider cultural change in the way supportive programmes are viewed and funded...|$|R

In 1982 the two primary schools the Bahá'ís had founded in 1961 were again under Bahá'í administration by February 1982. More than 200 Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'ís gathered in 1983 to celebrate children and a kindergarten multi-racial nursery school established by Claire Gung and Rex Collison died in June 1983.

500|$|The World Bank loaned India {{funds for}} development, and Mayawati was to manage {{projects}} with this money in UP. The projects were preplanned and on schedule, but the Mayawati government made changes which put the projects behind schedule, including rapidly transferring high-caste managers {{in and out}} of rural posts. The World Bank sent a letter of complaint on 1 August 2002 to India's central government stating, [...] "We have now learnt that project managers have been replaced within three weeks of assuming office. The <b>project</b> <b>coordinator</b> of the Diversified Agriculture Support Project has been changed twice in quick succession and at the moment there is no <b>project</b> <b>coordinator.</b> In the forestry project, numerous changes have been made over the past six months ... Such developments do not augur well for these time-bound projects that require consistently good leadership." [...] Mayawati initially responded by saying the letter was a fake and later said there had been a misunderstanding. She then decreased the number of transfers, stopped creating new posts, and temporarily reduced the level of government spending on furniture and vehicles in response to the allegations.

We sought to identify characteristics of successful partnerships from the perspective of <b>project</b> <b>coordinators</b> involved in a mini-grant program to promote physical activity among young people. MethodsSemistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with county coordinators (n = 19) of 20 North Carolina 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 Eat Smart, Move More 22 ̆ 0 ac? Community Grants projects funded during 2010 through 2012.

On the basis of <b>project</b> <b>coordinators</b> 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 responses, each partnership was classified as strong, moderate, or weak. ResultsThree overarching themes characterized partnership relationships: continuity (history with partner and willingness to engage in a future partnership), community connectedness, and capacity (interest, enthusiasm, engagement, communication, and clarity of roles and responsibilities). Strong partnerships were those in which <b>project</b> <b>coordinators</b> indicated a positive working history with partners, experienced a high level of engagement from partners, had clearly defined roles and responsibilities of partners, and expressed a clear interest in working with their partners in the future.
