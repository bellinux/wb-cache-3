5|$|According to {{historian}} Zbyněk Zeman, broadcasting {{became the}} most important medium for propaganda throughout the war. Posters were also used domestically and leaflets were dropped behind enemy lines by air-ship. In regions conquered by Germany, citizens could be <b>punished</b> <b>by</b> death for listening to foreign broadcasts. Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war efforts and industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.|$|E

5000|$|Punishment - While the {{classical}} totalitarian regimes punished harshly (imprisoning or killing political or ideological opponents and scapegoats), inverted totalitarianism in particular <b>punishes</b> <b>by</b> {{means of an}} economy of fear (minimizing social security, [...] busting unions, outdating skills, outsourcing jobs, etc.).|$|R

However, he did manage to resist the Australians with the bat; in his only two innings he made 32 not out and 23 as the Indian batting was dismissed for only 203 and 151 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Metro {{contended that}} though TumbleSeed was marketed as a roguelike, {{apart from its}} procedurally {{generated}} levels, it was closer in genre to traditional arcade games. Though like roguelikes, player mistakes are costly and unforgivingly <b>punished</b> <b>by</b> returning the player {{to the beginning of}} the game. Polygon wrote that while this mechanic is acceptable, the act of losing all equipped upgrades upon losing a single heart was harsh.|$|E

5|$|Prometheus– <b>Punished</b> <b>by</b> Zeus {{for giving}} mankind the Fires of Olympus, Prometheus was made mortal, and was {{attacked}} by an eagle that ripped out and ate his liver, which regrew instantly, on a daily basis.

Emma was not punished because Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau may possibly have been with Emma and others in the room at the time. Emma was nine years old at the time, and she would one day marry Alexander Liholiho, i. e. King Kamehameha IV.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{elements of}} the ceiling illustrate that God made the World as a perfect creation and put humanity into it, that humanity fell into disgrace and was <b>punished</b> <b>by</b> death and by separation from God. Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace, and was <b>punished</b> <b>by</b> the Great Flood. Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the saviour of humanity, Christ Jesus. The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world. The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine. Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect {{of the life of}} Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist. Jonah, for example, was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus' death and resurrection.|$|E

5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were <b>punished</b> <b>by</b> the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E
5|$|After taking match {{figures of}} 6/117 and 5/140 for India A against Sri Lanka A, Kartik {{made his first}} {{overseas}} appearance for India, replacing the injured Harbhajan midway through the 2003–04 tour of Australia.

5|$|Another {{tradition}} {{says that}} the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the forbidden fruit and was <b>punished</b> <b>by</b> being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so {{that it would not be}} returned to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.|$|E
50|$|The amende honorable was {{sometimes}} {{incorporated into a}} larger ritual of capital punishment (specifically the French version of drawing and quartering) for parricides and regicides; this is described in the 1975 book Discipline and <b>Punish</b> <b>by</b> Michel Foucault, notably in reference to Robert-François Damiens who was condemned to make the amende honorable before the main door of the Church of Paris in 1757.|$|R

5|$|In {{the year}} 8000 BC, Pandora finds {{the box and}} {{inadvertently}} opens it, unleashing the Seven Sins on the world. As a result she is <b>punished</b> <b>by</b> the Council of Wizards with immortality. Pandora begins her travels, training and trying to destroy the Seven Sins. In the present, she receives information from the Wizard informing her that the box can only be opened by either the purest or darkest of heart. Pandora approaches Superman to open her box, believing he is 'without sin', but when he touches the box he appears to become possessed. Pandora manages to escape with the box, after which Superman seems to return to normal.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{may also}} have been drawing upon various {{references}} to ravens in mythology and folklore. In Norse mythology, Odin possessed two ravens named Huginn and Muninn, representing thought and memory. According to Hebrew folklore, Noah sends a white raven to check conditions while on the ark. It learns that the floodwaters are beginning to dissipate, but it does not immediately return with the news. It is <b>punished</b> <b>by</b> being turned black and being forced to feed on carrion forever. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, a raven also begins as white before Apollo punishes it by turning it black for delivering a message of a lover's unfaithfulness. The raven's role as a messenger in Poe's poem may draw from those stories.|$|E
5|$|The {{second section}} of the Fourteenth Amendment <b>punished,</b> <b>by</b> reduced {{representation}} in the House of Representatives, any states that disenfranchised any male citizens over 21 years of age. By failing to adopt a harsher penalty, this signaled to the states that they still possessed the right to deny ballot access to blacks. Northern states were generally as averse to granting voting rights to blacks as Southern states. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed blacks to vote. In the South, blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through {{the intervention of the}} occupying Union Army. Congress had granted suffrage to the blacks in the territories in 1867 by passing the Territorial Suffrage Act.|$|E
