40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the current state}} of the art in mobile robots used on <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines.</b> Many theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted in order to develop autonomous machines to travel along <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> to perform inspection and/or repair work. These machines can improve efficiency, reduce labour costs and are expected to reduce the risk of injury to maintenance personnel. Despite there already being a number of pieces of theoretical research and technological developments in this area, problems related to stability, ability and autonomy still exist. As such, first this paper {{presents the}} main studies already carried out and the devices generally used on <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines.</b> After the latest trends have been presented, a new idea for module robots carrying out inspections/maintenance of <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> is presented.

Many areas were scanned especially close to the <b>transmission</b> <b>lines.</b> The areas were monitored over a 12 month period with repeated visits to each location. Some have shown safely low levels, while few locations close to power stations exhibited high levels.

The relay can obtain the electric field energy from the <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> and wirelessly <b>power</b> the RFID sensor tags around for longer operating distance. A prototype of the energy relay is built and tested on a 110 kv line. The measurement results show that the energy relay can provide stable energy even with the influences of wind, noise and power outage.
