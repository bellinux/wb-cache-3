This was investigated by analyzing the Triton X- 100 resistance of designed transmembrane peptides in model membranes of 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine, sphingomyelin and cholesterol (1 / 1 / 1, molar ratio), which contain both Lo <b>phase</b> <b>domains</b> and fluid bilayers. By using peptides with one or two palmitate chains covalently linked to their N-terminus or with variable hydrophobic lengths, the roles of protein palmitoylation and of mismatch between the transmembrane segment of the protein and the bilayer thickness, respectively, were investigated. The results show that neither hydrophobic matching nor palmitoylation is sufficient for partitioning of peptides into Lo <b>phase</b> <b>domains.</b> It is concluded that the Lo phase itself, due to the tight packing of the lipids, constitutes an unfavorable environment for accommodation of protein transmembrane segments...|$|R

40|$|Shock-induced {{twinning}} and martensitic {{transformation in}} tantalum, which exhibits no solid-state phase transformation under hydrostatic pressures up to 100 GPa, have been further investigated. Since the volume fraction {{and size of}} twin and <b>phase</b> <b>domains</b> are small in scale, they are considered foming by heterogeneous nucleation that is catalyzed by high density lattice dislocations. A dynamic dislocation mechanism is accordingly proposed based upon the observation of dense dislocation clustering within shock-recovered tantalum. The dense dislocation clustering can cause a significant increase of strain energy in local regions of {beta} (bcc) matrix, which renders mechanical instability and initiates the nucleation of twin and <b>phase</b> <b>domains</b> through the spontaneous reactions of dislocation dissociation within the dislocation clusters.

The traditional sequence domain method has congenital defects to treat such cases, which leads to a trend of using the actual <b>phase</b> <b>domain</b> method in fault calculation. Although the calculation speed of the <b>phase</b> <b>domain</b> method is not so fast and is memory consumable, it perfomrs well when handling complicated faults.

40|$|Cell {{membranes}} have {{complex lipid}} compositions, including an asymmetric distribution of phospholipids between the opposing leaflets of the bilayer. Although {{it has been}} demonstrated that the lipid composition of the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is sufficient {{for the formation of}} raft-like liquid-ordered (lo) <b>phase</b> <b>domains,</b> the influence that such domains may have on the lipids and proteins of the inner leaflet remains unknown. We used tethered polymer supports and a combined Langmuir-Blodgett/vesicle fusion (LB/VF) technique to build asymmetric planar bilayers that mimic plasma membrane asymmetry in many ways. We show that directly supported LB monolayers containing cholesterol-rich lo phases are inherently unstable when exposed to water or vesicle suspensions. However, tethering the LB monolayer to the solid support with the lipid-anchored polymer 1, 2 -dimyristoyl phophatidylethanolamine-N-[poly(ethylene glycol) -triethoxysilane] significantly improves stability and allows for the formation of complex planar-supported bilayers that retain > 90 % asymmetry for 1 – 2 h. We developed a single molecule tracking (SPT) system for the study of lipid diffusion in asymmetric bilayers with coexisting liquid phases. SPT allowed us to study in detail the diffusion of individual lipids inside, outside, or directly opposed to lo <b>phase</b> <b>domains.</b> We show here that lo <b>phase</b> <b>domains</b> in one monolayer of an asymmetric bilayer do not induce the formation of domains in the opposite leaflet when this leaflet is composed of palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol but do induce domains when this leaflet is composed of porcine brain phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol. The diffusion of lipids is similar in lo and liquid-disordered <b>phase</b> <b>domains</b> and is not affected by transbilayer coupling, indicating that lateral and transverse lipid interactions that give rise to the domain structure are weak in the biological lipid mixtures that were employed in this work...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBenzyl alcohol (BA) has a {{well-known}} fluidizing effect on both artificial and cellular membranes. BA {{is also likely}} to modulate the activities of certain membrane proteins by decreasing the membrane order. This phenomenon is presumably related to the ability of BA to interrupt interactions between membrane proteins and the surrounding lipids by fluidizing the lipid bilayer. The components of biological membranes are laterally diversified into transient assemblies of varying content and order, and many proteins are suggested to be activated or inactivated by their localization in or out of membrane domains displaying different physical phases. We studied the ability of BA to fluidize artificial bilayer membranes representing liquid-disordered, cholesterol-enriched and gel phases. Multilamellar vesicles were studied by steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene and trans-parinaric acid, which display different <b>phase</b> partitioning. <b>Domains</b> of different degree of order and thermal stability showed varying abilities to resist fluidization by BA. In bilayers composed of mixtures of an unsaturated phosphatidylcholine, a saturated high melting temperature lipid (sphingomyelin or phosphatidylcholine) and cholesterol, BA fluidized and lowered the melting temperature of the ordered and gel <b>phase</b> <b>domains.</b> In general, cholesterol-enriched domains were more resistant to BA than pure gel <b>phase</b> <b>domains.</b> In contrast, bilayers containing high melting temperature gel <b>phase</b> <b>domains</b> containing a ceramide or a galactosylceramide proved to be the most effective in resisting fluidization. The results of our study suggest that the ability of BA to affect the fluidity and lateral organization of the membranes was dependent on the characteristic features of the membrane compositions studied and related to the intermolecular cohesion in the domains...|$|R
