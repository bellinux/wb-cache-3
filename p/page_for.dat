5|$|Page and Brin {{used the}} former's basic HTML {{programming}} skills {{to set up}} a simple search <b>page</b> <b>for</b> users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users.

In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.|$|E

5|$|As the Stranger {{continues}} {{to explore the}} island, books linking to more Ages are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. The Stranger must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and return to Myst Island. These pages can then {{be placed in the}} corresponding books. As the Stranger adds more pages to these books, the brothers can be seen and heard more clearly. After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell the Stranger where the fifth and final missing <b>page</b> <b>for</b> their book is hidden; if the Stranger can complete either book, that brother will be set free. The clearer dialog also allows the player to more accurately judge each brother's personality. The Stranger is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.|$|E
5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{originally}} intended to adapt the entire, still-incomplete A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels for television. After Game of Thrones began outpacing the published novels in the sixth season, the series {{was based on a}} plot outline of the future novels provided by Martin and original content. In April 2016, the showrunners' plan was to shoot 13 more episodes after the sixth season: seven episodes in the seventh season and six episodes in the eighth. Later that month, the series was renewed for a seventh season with a seven-episode order. , seven seasons have been ordered and filmed, adapting the novels {{at a rate of about}} 48 seconds per <b>page</b> <b>for</b> the first three seasons.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, {{the song}} was offered as a free {{download}} on Kesha's MySpace <b>page</b> <b>for</b> over a month before its official sale release. The song was later released to iTunes on August 7, 2009, and on August 25, 2009, in the United States. Barry Weiss of RCA/Jive Label Group relied on a similar marketing scheme to that of Britney Spears' in 1999 when choosing to give the song away for free. The song's marketing relied heavily on radio once she had achieved a strong online interest, but its radio release was delayed until October in order to capitalize on social media's interest in her. After spreading the song quickly topped iTunes charts.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's 1922-3 design, {{based on}} Jannon's {{work in the}} Imprimerie Nationale, is bundled with many Microsoft products. Its italic, {{faithful}} to Jannon's, is extremely calligraphic, with a very variable angle of slant and flourishes on several lower-case letters. Its commercial release is more extensive than the basic Microsoft release, featuring additional features such as swash capitals and small capitals, although like many pre-digital fonts these are only included in the regular weight. Popular in the metal type era, its digitisation has been criticised for having too light a colour on the <b>page</b> <b>for</b> body text if printed with many common printing systems, a problem with several Monotype digitisations of the period. Monotype's 1933 guide to identifying their typefaces noted the asymmetrical T, the sharp triangular serif at top left of m, n, p and r, and a q unlike the p, with a point at top right rather than a full serif.|$|E

5|$|The FIPS {{county code}} is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely {{identifies}} counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number {{is unique to}} each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, while Addison County, Vermont is 001, Belknap County, New Hampshire and Alachua County, Florida are also 001. To uniquely identify Addison County, Vermont, one must use the state code of 50 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Addison County, Vermont is 50001. The links in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau Info <b>page</b> <b>for</b> that county.|$|E
5|$|Despite Autumn Games' {{support and}} desire to expand Skullgirls, their {{continued}} litigation prevented the publisher from providing any financial backing. Attempting {{to pick up where}} they left off, Lab Zero Games decided to ask its fanbase for help once more, following the success of the EVO 2013 charity drive. On February 25, 2013, Lab Zero Games set up an Indiegogo <b>page</b> <b>for</b> Skullgirls, in an effort to raise $150,000 {{for the development of the}} game's first DLC character, Squigly. Contributors received various rewards, including desktop wallpapers, a digital copy of the official soundtrack, Steam keys for the PC release, Steam keys for Half-Minute Hero, and the chance to add a background character to the game, among others. The campaign reached its initial goal in less than 24 hours, while the stretch goal of a second DLC character, Big Band, secured funding in just over 2 weeks. A third DLC character, determined by fan vote, was funded during the final two days, along with a playable robotic version of Ms. Fortune named Robo-Fortune. An additional stretch goal that would provide a free license for the game's engine, Z-Engine, to the developers of Them's Fightin' Herds (at the time called Fighting is Magic) was also funded. With minutes left before the end of the drive, the last stretch goal was met, securing funding for another fan-selected DLC character. The Indiegogo campaign raised nearly $830,000 of its original $150,000 goal. Several alternate character and announcer voice packs were also funded. All downloadable characters and voice packs were free to download on all platforms within the first three months of their release.|$|E

The new management would be composed of people who he deemed trustworthy given their long history of support or because they had suffered a loss {{as a result of the}} violence. In a closing statement, he bid farewell by thanking God for bringing happiness to his personal and professional life. In the comment section of the Facebook post, many people thanked the admin for his support. Some of them, however, expressed their concerned with the new administration given his/her relationship with the government.|$|E
