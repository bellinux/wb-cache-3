40|$|An accountants’ ethical code {{of conduct}} {{represents}} the moral values, principles and rules that accountants should have. The ethical codes of conduct of AICPA and IFAC are the two main codes most countries adopt to guide their members {{on how to deal}} with accounting information from the ethical perspective. While the AICPA ethical {{code of conduct}} was developed specifically for the USA, the IFAC ethical code of conduct was developed by taking into account the different practices of ethical code of conduct in various countries. The main purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the similarities and differences of these two codes. The comparison of the two documents is made on the following issues: establishment, structure and approach of the codes, the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> principle, <b>and</b> the <b>independence</b> principle. The comparative analysis shows that the AICPA and IFAC codes are more similar than different even though some differences are noticeably important...|$|R

Here, three crucial issues will be discussed : 1) how is the changing and challenging in the relationship among mass media, <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> violence in the name of religion in Indonesian context; 2) how did the religious values dominated public lives and constructed their public interest; and 3) how did the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> expectation of mass media 2 ̆ 7 s rules in the public minds tend be constructed unperfectly. Based on qualitative method, I propose that the dynamic domination of religious values will construct the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> it tend to navigate the mass media performance as well as their consumer 2 ̆ 7 s expectations, but it will raise the unfinished dilemma in defining and searching of the best formula of mass media performance and their public responsibilities...|$|R

40|$|With {{reference}} to Karl Polyani’s notion of fictitious commodities we evaluate whether {{the protection of}} two worldwide known streets, namely ‘Regent Street’ in London and the ‘Champs- Elysées’ in Paris {{may be perceived as}} an erosion of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> thus call for potential policy reformulation or reforms to substantive trademark law. The reasons for this choice are twofold: Firstly, the existing body of literature offers an in-depth discussion on the complex dynamics between the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> patents and copyrights, yet relatively little has been said so far on the correlation of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> trademarks. Secondly, trademark protection over urban space is a recent phenomenon that has in and by itself not yet been properly grasped, neither from a policy, commercial or legal perspective. We conclude that the ownership structure of each of these two trademarks suggests that, contrary to intuition, it is the use of trademark protection rather than the renouncement from trademark protection that guarantees, at least in these two instances, the <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> We contend however that the increased use of trademark protection over urban space does bear the potential for the erosion of the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> call upon policy makers to formulate guidelines in that respect. ...|$|R
