If I had succeeded I am sure that forcible feeding could not in all conscience have been resorted to again.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus {{spent the}} last years of his life {{wandering}} from place to place. Hungary's central government lost <b>power</b> <b>because</b> the prelates and the barons ruled the kingdom independently of the monarch. For example, Ivan Kőszegi and his brothers waged wars against Albert I, Duke of Austria, but Ladislaus did not intervene, although the Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses along the western borders.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the royal}} {{prerogative}} {{is available in}} the conduct of the government of the United Kingdom, including foreign affairs, defence, and national security. The monarchy has a significant constitutional presence in these and other matters, but limited <b>power,</b> <b>because</b> the exercise of the prerogative {{is in the hands of}} the prime minister and other ministers or other government officials.|$|E

50|$|The {{only other}} human/Kryptonian hybrid, Superboy, {{inherited}} (eventually, through retcon) more traditional <b>powers</b> <b>because</b> his D.N.A. is 50 percent Kryptonian, whereas Cir-El's D.N.A. is primarily human, with some grafted-on Kryptonian attributes.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the film}} ends, Xiaowei is shown {{manifested}} {{in her white}} fox form without her <b>powers</b> <b>because</b> she has already given them up to bring Peirong and Wang Sheng back to life.|$|R
5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining <b>power</b> <b>because</b> they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa's {{government}} would face {{an economic crisis}} and the 2001 riots, resigning two years later. De la Rúa thought that Duhalde had organized a coup d'état against him Rodolfo Terragno, De la Rúa's Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, thought instead that the crisis was the exclusive result of keeping the peso-dollar parity despite the costs generated by it. Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said that the party {{had no interest in}} removing De la Rúa from <b>power,</b> <b>because</b> he was so unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E
5|$|NigComSat-1, a Nigerian {{satellite}} {{built in}} 2004, was Nigeria's third satellite and Africa's first communication satellite. It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese Long March 3B carrier rocket, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China. The spacecraft was operated by NigComSat and the Nigerian Space Agency, NASRDA. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after {{running out of}} <b>power</b> <b>because</b> of an anomaly in its solar array. It {{was based on the}} Chinese DFH-4 satellite bus, and carries a variety of transponders: 4 C-band; 14 Ku-band; 8 Ka-band; and 2 L-band. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.|$|E
50|$|The diviner {{is called}} the Nyamso lo.The Nyamso lo {{possesses}} divinatory <b>powers</b> <b>because</b> of {{the fact of the}} divinator being possessed and, while possessed, controlled by a sentient force known as the Zinthi ki.|$|R
50|$|Super Islaw {{was a young}} {{crippled}} boy who {{was granted}} mystical <b>powers</b> <b>because</b> of his good heart. He used these abilities to protect the innocents of his town, battling supernatural beings such as vampires.|$|R
50|$|Rain-makers {{are thought}} to possess magical powers, {{although}} they possess these <b>powers</b> <b>because</b> they (the <b>powers)</b> are given them by the sky God or the Great Spirit. Rain-making is something which requires both religion and magic.|$|R
5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} {{the pursuit}} of power as a virtue. Some philosophies {{are rooted in the}} love of <b>power</b> <b>because</b> philosophies tend to be coherent unification in {{the pursuit of}} some goal or desire. Just as a philosophy may strive for truth, it may also strive for happiness, virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E
5|$|The primary {{reasons for}} the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, {{he was no longer}} in an {{official}} position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary. When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this <b>power</b> <b>because</b> his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry in 1189, the new King Richard I {{appointed}} Walter Bishop of Salisbury; the election took place on 15 September 1189 at Pipewell, with the consecration on 22 October 1189 at Westminster. Also elected to bishoprics at this council were Godfrey de Lucy to the see of Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to the see of London, and William Longchamp to the see of Ely. The elevation of so many new bishops was probably meant to signal the new king's break with his father's habit of keeping bishoprics empty to retain the revenues of the sees. At {{about the same time}} Glanvill was either forced out of his justiciarship or resigned, but the sources are unclear. Walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his uncle had lost some of his <b>power</b> <b>because</b> of political manoeuvring over the elevation of King Richard's illegitimate half-brother Geoffrey to the see of York, which Walter had at first opposed. The bishopric was either a reward or a bribe for Walter's withdrawal of his objections to Geoffrey's election.|$|E

50|$|The core {{gameplay}} {{revolved around}} using powers to damage opponents, while simultaneously positioning oneself favorably (by adding or upgrading powers and activating defensive <b>powers).</b> <b>Because</b> <b>powers</b> {{had to be}} recharged {{before they can be}} used again, it was possible to get into a state where a number of turns had to be spent simply getting back into a position from which one can again attack.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the 22 Floréal coup in France {{undermined}} Delacroix, {{because it}} inspired more sympathy by French foreign minister Talleyrand for the Dutch opposition members who demanded the ambassador's recall. At the same time, Daendels became disaffected {{with the regime}} he had helped put into <b>power</b> <b>because</b> of the depredations of the purging commissions. His French colleague General Joubert was displeased with the radicals because of conflicts about the co-dominion of Flushing. Finally, the newly appointed Agenten were disturbed about the inefficiency of the Uitvoerend Bewind. All these disaffections came together with the putsch on June 12, 1798, of that recidivist, general Daendels, in which he disturbed a dinner party of Delacroix and {{three members of the}} Uitvoerend Bewind, violating the diplomatic immunity of the ambassador by putting pistols to his chest. The members of the Representative Assembly were arrested in session.|$|E
5|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} to the National Socialist leadership that the United Kingdom {{was not interested in}} a military alliance, anti-British policies were adopted to ensure the attainment of Germany’s war aims. Even during the war however, hope remained that Britain would in time yet become a reliable German ally. Hitler preferred to see the British Empire preserved as a world <b>power,</b> <b>because</b> its break-up would benefit other countries far more than it would Germany, particularly the United States and Japan. In fact, Hitler's strategy during 1935-1937 for winning Britain over was based on a German guarantee of defence of the British Empire. After the war, Ribbentrop testified that in 1935 Hitler had promised to deliver twelve German divisions to the disposal of Britain for maintaining the integrity of her colonial possessions.|$|E

50|$|The Turkish-Islamic First East Turkestan Republic {{had some}} {{links to the}} Axis <b>Powers,</b> <b>because</b> during 1930-37 the Axis wanted to exploit Pan-Islamic sentiments to create a pro-Axis client state in Central Asia {{as a way of}} {{checking}} Soviet influence in the area.|$|R
25|$|Brian is the fraternal twin of Betsy Braddock, a telepath, {{resulting}} in a strong psychic bond between the two. As described by writer Chris Claremont in the Uncanny X-Men House of M storyline, the two are in fact immune to each other's <b>powers</b> <b>because</b> of their genetic connection.|$|R
50|$|The books tell a {{story of}} a boy (Leo North) living in Malonia. He attends {{military}} school, lives with his fearful grandmother, and looks after his brother Stirling. He resists his innate <b>powers,</b> <b>because</b> those who demonstrate any sort of magical ability are considered enemies of the state.|$|R

25|$|Most {{portable}} stations {{rely upon}} generator or battery <b>power.</b> <b>Because</b> {{this form of}} power might be of limited supply, portable stations often operate at lower transmitter power output to conserve energy.|$|E
25|$|Human {{factors can}} also be significant. Rohloff {{demonstrates}} that overall efficiency can be improved in some cases by using a slightly less efficient gear ratio when this leads to greater human efficiency (in converting food to pedal <b>power)</b> <b>because</b> a more effective pedalling speed is being used.|$|E
50|$|He has {{a younger}} brother named Jiu Lai, who has the {{appearance}} {{of an old man}} due to his misuse of supernatural <b>powers.</b> <b>Because</b> he rarely reveals himself, people that know his brother assume that their appearances and ages would be alike; some even refer their names to be similar.|$|R

50|$|After {{the events}} of Bialya, the Guardians drift apart. Fain Y'onia attacks her and the Olympian in London, England. This {{particular}} battle ends in his retreat, but not before he wounds her, apparently with the end cause {{of the loss of}} her <b>powers</b> <b>because</b> an explosion burnt her hair right off and knocked her out.|$|R
25|$|In 1988, all of Quebec {{and parts}} of New England and New Brunswick lost <b>power</b> <b>because</b> of an {{equipment}} failure at a substation on the North Shore. The March 1989 geomagnetic storm tripped circuit breakers on the transmission network causing a nine-hour Quebec-wide blackout.|$|E
25|$|Mearsheimer {{asserts that}} Australia should be {{concerned}} with China's accretion of <b>power</b> <b>because</b> {{it will lead to}} an intense security competition between the China and the US that would destabilize the region. He also argues that China is implementing the militarily aggressive philosophy of the U.S. naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, who argued for sea control and decisive battle.|$|E
25|$|Using a solar roof, {{solar cells}} can provide {{electric}} power. Solar roofs {{have the potential}} to be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar <b>power,</b> <b>because</b> buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.|$|E
25|$|Initially, four {{airtanker}} operators {{were represented}} by Reagan {{and participated in}} the exchange program: Hemet Valley Flying Service, Aero Union, TBM, Inc., and Hawkins and <b>Powers.</b> <b>Because</b> only a select number of contractors were provided aircraft, and because the program was not publicized nor were the contracts and aircraft put up for bid, accusations of favoritism followed.|$|R
