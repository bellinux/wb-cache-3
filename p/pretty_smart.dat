500|$|General Cornwallis {{occupied}} {{the house of}} Thomas Cooch, and Howe's forces remained at Iron Hill for five days. [...] In a letter to Congress, Washington justified the defeat by saying, [...] "This Morning the Enemy came out with considerable force and three pieces of Artillery, against our Light advanced Corps, and after some <b>pretty</b> <b>smart</b> skirmishing obliged them to retreat, being far inferior in number and without Cannon." [...] Certain that Howe would advance along the main road toward Wilmington in his bid to capture Philadelphia, Washington continued to fortify {{the city and the}} Red Clay Creek. He moved his headquarters from Wilmington to Newport, and the army formed defenses between Newport and Marshallton. While Howe's army remained in place, the two forces engaged in small skirmishes over the next few days. One officer under Howe noted that the rebel patrols, which usually consist of 10 to 15 dragoons and 20 to 30 infantrymen, now appear more often, and they fire at our posts occasionally." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle {{appreciated}} {{the shift from}} the teen slasher films of the 1980s and their [...] "endless series of laborious, half-baked sequels". [...] Kevin Thomas of The Los Angeles Times called Scream [...] "a bravura, provocative sendup of horror pictures" [...] and complimented the film for being [...] "scary and gruesome" [...] while avoiding a sense of [...] "morbidity". Empire Adam Smith called it [...] "Clever, quick and bloody funny". Williamson's script was praised as containing a [...] "fiendishly clever, complicated plot" [...] which [...] "deftly mixes irony, self-reference and wry social commentary with chills and blood spills". Time Out London lauded the film's intelligence and scares, while praising the casting, saying [...] "at last, a horror movie to shout about!" [...] Film4 cited Craven's own Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) and its cast of self-aware characters as inspiration for Scream, but declared that while New Nightmare was a [...] "noble failure – <b>pretty</b> <b>smart,</b> but crucially not very scary" [...] that Scream was [...] "not merely clever...it is, from its breathtaking opening sequence (with Barrymore as the woman in peril) onwards, simply terrifying".|$|E
500|$|Brian Lowry, {{reviewing}} the two-part premiere for Variety, felt that giving Atwell her own television series was [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>smart</b> bet" [...] by Marvel, {{and he called}} the episodes [...] "considerable fun". He noted the period setting as contributing to this, and positively mentioned the score by composer Christopher Lennertz. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "the show isn't as retro-stylish as it thinks it is ... the first hour of Agent Carter feels like an above-average episode of Young Indiana Jones Chronicles", noting that it tonally aims for His Girl Friday, Dick Tracy, and Alias ("A tough tonal mixture on a weekly broadcast budget, but also an ambition worth pursuing"), but praised Atwell's performance, calling her [...] "a delight" [...] and [...] "firing on all cylinders". Franich was negative about what he saw to be common MCU tropes, notably [...] "Somebody named Stark invented something dangerous; everyone wants an All-Important Glowing Thing; there's an implicit promise that nothing will be solved for weeks/years to come." [...] Though he was wary about the series being forced {{to contribute to the}} rest of the MCU, he did note that [...] "Agent Carter feels pleasantly segmented off from the greater Marvel Machinery".|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{reflected}} on the film's themes, writing [...] "Little Miss Sunshine shows us {{a world in which}} there's a form, a brochure, a procedure, a job title, a diet, a step-by-step program, a career path, a prize, a retirement community, to quantify, sort, categorize and process every human emotion or desire. Nothing exists that cannot be compartmentalized or turned into a self-improvement mantra about 'winners and losers.'" [...] Brian Tallerico of UGO.com also focused on the film's themes: [...] "Little Miss Sunshine teaches us to embrace that middle ground, acknowledging that life may just be a beauty pageant, where we're often going to be outdone by someone <b>prettier,</b> <b>smarter,</b> or just plain luckier, but if we get up on that stage and be ourselves, everything will turn out fine." ...|$|R
