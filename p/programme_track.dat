40|$|The {{voluntary}} sector {{is growing in}} importance; in fundraising turnover, number of players and marketing professionalism. This study explores {{the process by which}} the fundraising organisations define and develop their propositions to the market. Starting with an observation that organisations with very different history and tradition present themselves to the market in similar ways, it investigates how three leading Swedish organisations create the basis for their propositions to the market of donors, which in fundraising practice jargon is called the Case for Support. Drawing upon research in philanthropic giving and organisational identity, the author suggests a theoretical framework for such a fundraising Case for Support. It recognises two main sources of influence, an external market source driven by donors, consumer image and behavioural trends and an internal mission driven source, defined by organisational history, values and <b>programme</b> <b>track</b> record. In the playing field between Market and Mission an organisation can reflect, develop and communicate their Case for Support – and their own "selves"...|$|E

40|$|Fluorescence in situ {{hybridisation}} (FISH) is {{a powerful}} molecular biological tool to detect and enumerate harmful microorganism in the marine environment. Different FISH methods are available, and especially in combination with automated counting techniques, the po- tential for a routine monitoring of harmful marine micro- algae is attainable. Various oligonucleotide probes are developed for detecting harmful microalgae. However, FISH-based methods are not yet regularly included in mon- itoring <b>programmes</b> <b>tracking</b> the presence of harmful marine microalgae. A limitation factor of the FISH technique is the currently available number of suited fluorochromes attached to the FISH probes to detect various harmful species in one environmental sample at a time. However, coupled automated techniques, like flow cytometry or solid-phase cytometry, can facilitate the analysis of nu- merous field samples and help to overcome this draw- back. A great benefit of FISH in contrast to other molecular biological detection methods for harmful ma- rine microalgae is the direct visualisation of the hybridised target cells, which are not permitted in cell free formats, like DNA depending analysis methods. Therefore, an additional validation of the FISH-generated results is simultaneously given...|$|R
