40|$|This paper {{examines}} the practices {{and experiences of}} self-drive tourists to the East Kimberley region of Australia and considers their relationship to promotional stereotypes of place. It draws on fieldwork involving indepth interviews with tourists. In particular, it focuses on their practices of taking photographs and collecting souvenirs and draws out {{some aspects of the}} underlying value system that motivates such interests. Tourists perceive their destination as empty land that exists outside time. However, its <b>postcolonial</b> <b>geopolitical</b> context appears to challenge such understandings. The anthropological concept of inalienable possessions is drawn upon to analyze the tensions associated with sustaining these values...|$|E

40|$|Examining {{a classic}} {{formulation}} {{of the relationship between}} colonialism and postcolonial nationalisms in postcolonial theory, as well as its recent critiques, this article puts forward a thesis that contemporary colonialisms and imperialisms may be best diagnosed through the lens of identifying forms of sovereignty rather than relying on the geopolitical framework of West/non-West recognisable in the conceptual vocabulary of postcolonial theory. Focusing on the disputed issue of Indian sovereignty over Kashmir, this essay asks the following questions: What forms of occupation by postcolonial nation-states remain concealed by ways in which extant <b>postcolonial</b> approaches assume <b>geopolitical</b> divisions? Why is it necessary to rethink the parameters of imperialism and colonialism for a contemporary era...|$|R
40|$|Postcolonial intercommunal {{violence}} on Cyprus and its after-effects {{have been studied}} extensively {{in the social sciences}} and humanities over the past five decades. However, the cinematic representations of the postcolonial condition in Cyprus have not yet received significant critical recognition. This dissertation is a response to the scarcity of scholarship on cinematic representations of the postcolonial history of the island. By analysing cinematically recreated and visualised ghostly matters of interethnic strife and post-conflict situation in Cyprus, I want to contribute to the current debates on the politics of postcolonial memory in Cyprus. My discussion focuses specifically on a film trilogy by the Turkish-Cypriot art house film director Dervis Zaim, ‘The Cyprus Trilogy’: Mud (Çamur, 2003), Parallel Trips (Paralel Yolculuklar/ Ta parállila monopátia [Τα παράλληλα μονοπάτια], codirected with Panicos Chrysanthou, 2004), and Shadows and Faces (Gölgeler ve Suretler, 2011). This trilogy is the most remarkable set of critical films about the partition of the island that have been produced in post-Yesilçam Turkish film history. My analysis of Zaim’s film trilogy departs from the assumption of the primacy of the phenomenological experiences of the <b>postcolonial</b> Cypriots over <b>geopolitical</b> and macro-historical explanations. The reading of Dervis Zaim’s works about the intercommunal civil wars in postcolonial Cyprus raises the question of the haunting/hauntedness. Therefore, this Ph. D. thesis addresses hauntological themes such as disjointed time, memory, historical justice, haunting, visor effect, voice, silence, ghost story, haunted house, haunted body, and the absent other that appear persistently in the films. Throughout this thesis, the spatial/temporal, vocal/narrative, and embodied/disembodied aspects of Zaim’s film trilogy are discussed, drawing primarily upon a Derridean hauntology. Building a theoretical bridge between hauntology and postcolonial cinema, the relationship between postcolonial memory, film, and haunting is examined in the context of Cyprus. This thesis concludes by discussing the extent to which Dervis Zaim and his spectral realist films have achieved the deconstruction of postcolonial memory through challenging both the imperialist and nationalist structures imposed by dominant discourses...|$|R
