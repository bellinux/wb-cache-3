A permanent magnet attached to a Kapton beam was deflected with the magnetic field produced by electromagnetic coils fabricated on LTCC.

40|$|AbstractA {{physically}} based {{method is}} proposed to represent interpenetrating polymer networks and their electromechanical behavior. The mechanical {{behavior of the}} material is nonlinear elastic and the electromechanical coupling arises from electrostatic effects often called the Maxwell stress effect. Ha et al. have synthesized interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) that invalidate {{the need for an}} external pre-stretch mechanism in dielectric elastomers. IPNs of acrylic elastomer and 1, 6 -hexanediol diacrylate were successfully synthesized to create free-standing films with preserved <b>prestretch.</b> This results in a dual polymer network, with one polymer network in tension and the other in compression. The <b>prestretch</b> is preserved chemically in the dominant network. The internal <b>prestretch</b> is accompanied by an overall stiffening of the dual polymer network leading to compromised actuation strains. A mechanistically simple representation of the networks is proposed by means of a model of two springs in parallel, replaced by an equivalent single spring. A material parameter is introduced to account for the effect of the weight percent of the secondary network. The effect of the additive on the preserved <b>prestretch</b> in the primary network and hence the overall stress strain response is determined. Specifically, a modified Ogden strain energy function is proposed that describes the mechanical behavior of the new interpenetrating polymer network. The electromechanical response of the material is described using a previously presented constitutive formulation that works well for single network polymers. The model results indicate that ideally an interpenetrating polymer network DE should not stiffen when the secondary network is formed to avoid reduced actuation strains...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of series elastic structures on {{the dynamics of}} the contractile machinery was examined in the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) of five male Wistar rats, with respect to enhancement of work of a muscle-tendon complex after active stretch. Imposed isotonic and isokinetic contractions were preceded by either an isometric phase (PI) or an active stretch (PS). The effects of fibre length differences at the onset of shortening, due to differences of extension of tendinous structures, were studied. For the isotonic experiments fibre length and shortening velocity were estimated 30 ms after release and compared with the PI length-velocity curve determined at the same force level. For shortening above the optimum length, about half of the enhanced shortening found after <b>prestretch</b> could be explained by PS—PI fibre length differences. Below the optimum length, PS shortening velocity was somewhat lower than expected on the basis of length-velocity characteristics. Enhancement of work output due to stretch was different for isokinetic and isotonic shortening. In isokinetic shortening, following <b>prestretch,</b> fibre work was limited because of enhanced shortening of the tendinous structures. In stretch-shortening cycles imposed on a muscle-tendon complex, the length of the complex affected all <b>prestretch</b> effects, i. e. potentiation of the contractile element, contractile element interaction with the tendinous structures, and elastic energy release. It is concluded that, besides potentiation effects and enhanced elastic energy release, the {{influence of}} series elastic structures on fibre dynamics determines active stretch-induced work enhancement.

40|$|Stretching {{metallic}} conductors {{to large}} deformations {{while maintaining a}} low and constant electrical resistance {{is one of the}} main challenges in stretchable electronics technologies. Here, we report the conservation of conductivity for deformations of up to 100 % in 80 and 500 nm thick gold films deposited on rough polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates. The roughness is produced by curing PDMS on sand-blasted or surface-etched masters. Under stretching, roughness creates a fine-scale inhomogeneous stress state within the film and a non-percolating crack pattern develops, preserving the conductivity. Compared to smooth surfaces, the strain corresponding to electrical failure is increased by a factor > 50. By combining the roughness effect with <b>prestretching</b> of the substrate during deposition, a fine-scale random wrinkling morphology develops and the stretchability is enhanced even further. The stretchability is finally improved by increasing the thickness of the film. These synergistic effects can be explained based on fracture mechanics arguments. Finally, a high number of large deformation cycles can be accommodated without electrical failure. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
