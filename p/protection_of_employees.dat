Some important phenomena of today’s labour market like gender questions, mobbing, interest <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> mistreated in big chain stores, temporary work or subcontracted labour became topics of the public debate thanks to civil society, the media and ad hoc socio- political associations.
