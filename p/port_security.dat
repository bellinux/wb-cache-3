Blacklists were at work throughout the entertainment industry, in universities and schools at all levels, in the legal profession, and in many other fields. A <b>port</b> <b>security</b> program initiated by the Coast Guard shortly {{after the start of}} the Korean War required a review of every maritime worker who loaded or worked aboard any American ship, regardless of cargo or destination. As with other loyalty-security reviews of McCarthyism, the identities of any accusers and even the nature of any accusations were typically kept secret from the accused. Nearly 3,000 seamen and longshoremen lost their jobs due to this program alone.|$|E

25|$|With {{the entry}} of the United States into World War I in April 1917, the {{operational}} control of the new U.S. Coast Guard {{was transferred to the}} Department of the Navy. Bertholf's responsibilities were to advise the Chief of Naval Operations about U.S. Coast Guard matters and he had administrative control of Department of the Treasury functions within the Coast Guard. An immediate problem he faced was the one-year enlistment period that enlisted personnel served under. Many of the sailors were foreign born and either deserted or were discharged {{at the end of their}} enlistment when the war broke out. Others chose to enlist in another armed service where the chances of promotion were better. In 1918 the enlistments were changed to the duration of the war but no longer than three years. The pay and rank differences between Navy and Coast Guard personnel were also a continuing problem for Bertholf during this time and were not completely solved during his tenure as Captain-Commandant. Projects that he had direct supervision over during the war included setting up land communications between shore installations on the Eastern seaboard, enforcement of the Espionage Act of 1917; <b>port</b> <b>security,</b> and establishment of a Coast Guard aviation branch. On 1 July 1918 he was promoted to Commodore, USCG.|$|E
25|$|Roland {{served as}} Commandant {{during the time}} that the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) {{requested}} greater U.S. Navy involvement in interdiction of North Vietnamese troops and equipment into South Vietnam under Operation Market Time. The Navy did not have the patrol craft that would serve MACV's purposes and they requested assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard. Roland agreed to supply Point-class cutters and their crews to the operation, fearing that if the U.S. Coast Guard were left out of the Vietnam War that its standing as an armed service would be jeopardized. Coast Guard Squadron One was commissioned on 27 May 1965 and 17 cutters with their crews were assigned to Navy control and sent to Vietnam to assist with the mission of interdicting Communist vessels at sea and preventing personnel and supplies from entering South Vietnam. An additional nine Point-class cutters were assigned to Squadron One on 29 October at the request of MACV. The increased operations in Vietnam during Roland's time as Commandant included buoy tenders to service Vietnamese aids to navigation. U.S. Coast Guard <b>port</b> <b>security</b> personnel were assigned at MACV's request after a visit to Vietnam by Roland in July 1965. There were additional manning requirements for new Loran-C radio stations for radio navigation of ships and aircraft. During the time of the Vietnam preparations he also managed the U.S. Coast Guard's response to the Camarioca boatlift operations in the Straits of Florida. In all, Roland oversaw the increase of over 3,500 additional personnel in 1966.|$|E
