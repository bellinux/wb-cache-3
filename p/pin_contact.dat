3000|$|The drying of {{solution}} droplets {{is described}} by the coffee-stain mechanism [51, 56 – 59]. The higher evaporation rate at the pinned sessile convex droplet contact edge causes convective capillary flow and precipitation of solute at the edge. The capillary flow goes from the bulk solution {{to the edge of}} the droplet in order to maintain the spherical shape to counter evaporative losses [57]. The flow results in solute accumulation at the <b>pinned</b> <b>contact</b> edge as a solid ring. <b>Pinning</b> of the <b>contact</b> line is a [...] "self-pinning" [...] process, which means that the accumulation of the solute at the contact line perpetuates the <b>pinning</b> of the <b>contact</b> line [58]. Multiple rings can result from the solute deposit. An incomplete transfer of solute results in material left inside the ring. Our results show the sequence of this solute deposition for the first time at the molecular scale. The results show that the <b>pinned</b> <b>contact</b> line moves unidirectionally by either a clockwise or counterclockwise inward rotating motion. The process starts with one precipitating H-bonded carboxyl dimer (some spirals have a thicker starting point indicating that sometimes evaporation may start from a cluster of dimers), grows by a crystallization process along a direction normal to the carbon chain and parallel the triple contact line, and terminates with the depletion of either the solute (partial spiral) or solvent (excess deposit of solute as dots inside the spiral).|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{approach is}} proposed {{to predict the}} sliding wear caused by a loaded spherical <b>pin</b> <b>contacting</b> a rotating disc, a condition typical of the so-called pin-on-disc test widely used in tribological studies. The proposed framework relies on the understanding that, when the <b>pin</b> <b>contacts</b> and slides on the disc, a predominantly plane strain region exists at {{the centre of the}} disc wear track. The wear rate in this plane strain region can therefore be determined from a two dimensional idealisation of the contact problem, reducing the need for computationally expensive three dimensional contact analyses. Periodic unit cell techniques are used in conjunction with a ratchetting-based failure criterion to predict the wear rate in the central plane strain region. The overall three dimensional wear rate of the disc is then determined by scaling the plane strain wear rate with a conversion factor related to the predicted shape of the wear track. The approach is used to predict pin-on-disc test data from an AlSi coating using a tungsten carbide pin. The predicted results are found to be consistent with measured data...|$|R

40|$|The {{frictional}} {{behavior of}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) films varies with environmental condition.

Testing of the frictional performance of DLC films in a pin-on-disk contact has mapped the transient behavior of the friction coefficient. A model for fractional coverage, based on the adsorption of environmental contaminants and their removal through the <b>pin</b> <b>contact,</b> is developed. The rate of adsorption is taken from Langmuir's model [1], which is combined with the removal rate from Blanchet and Sawyer [2]. The coefficient of friction is based on the average fractional coverage under the <b>pin</b> <b>contact.</b> The model also gives a closed-form expression for the steady-state fractional coverage. Model calculations compared favorably to the time progression of the friction coefficient for a series of earlier experiments on a superlow friction DLC coating [3], when the fractional removal term was allowed to increase with increasing sliding speed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The piston <b>pin</b> <b>contact</b> in {{a typical}} {{automotive}} engine {{is an example of}} a highly loaded. Therefore, for piston pin design several aspects are important. Among them are function, cost, NVH, fuel economy, durability, and impact on other design aspects of the engine. Continuously contacting with piston pin, the face of connecting rod, brings about abnormal wear such as unfairwear or earlywear. because the engine get more powered and one requirement for a good fuel economy is to achieve a low level of mechanical friction. In this study, modern low friction coatings and treatment at the piston pin interface aimed to investigate the potential. The profile of coated specimens were observed by non-contact type optical surface measuring system and the friction-wear behaviors of coated specimens were investigated by using piston pin wear tester. Piston pin wear test was performed to analyze the friction and wear behavior. The results showed that the application of low friction coatings and treatment effectively improved tribological performance of the piston pi...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{processing}} Wasted Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), and {{the separation of}} gold that it contains, is presented within the present work. Due {{to the fact that}} the amount of Au in real-life secondary resources covers a broad range of concentrations, the applied solutions were obtained by digesting in aqua regia WEEE characterized by relatively high (Central Processing Units, CPU) and relatively low (<b>Pin</b> <b>Contact</b> Elements, PIN) amounts of gold. The investigated systems were received after processes of enrichment and leaching, ignoring the usually applied WEEE processing reduction and solvent-extraction processes, keeping the amount of generated wastes to a minimum. The obtained CPU and PIN solutions were then directly contacted with core–shell type anion exchange resins functionalized using ethylenediamine and 1 -(2 -aminoethyl) piperazine. Application of the designed polymers allowed the process of aqua regia-leaching, omitting the application of other, more harmful agents. The investigated resins revealed great selectivity towards gold. Despite the fact that the obtained solutions contained only 1. 5 % (CPU) or 0. 1 % (PIN) of Au, its removal reached 86 % and the logarithms of partition coefficients indicate that affinity of the applied resins to gold is almost ten times greater than the very competitive nickel present in the obtained solutions. Finally, the gold-containing core–shell polymers were effectively eluted, recovering 100 % of the taken from the solutions gold...|$|E
40|$|In {{cases of}} {{completely}} conforming frictionless contact, the contact area generally either decreases or {{stays the same}} under load, {{in which case the}} extent of the contact area is subsequently independent of load and the stress and displacement fields vary linearly with the loading parameter. Dundurs and Stippes describe such cases as receding contact problems. Here, we demonstrate that similar results apply in the presence of Coulomb friction, in which case the extent of the stick and slip zones and the local direction of sliding are independent of load. We also show {{that if there is a}} small initial gap or interference throughout the potential contact area, the extent of the contact area and the stress and displacement fields will approach those of the corresponding receding contact problem as the applied load is increased. If the interface conditions permit adhesion between the contacting surfaces, the extent of the adhesion zone shrinks to zero as the load increases without limit. Progress of the contact configuration towards the limit is governed solely by a dimensionless load factor involving the ratio between the applied load and the initial clearance or interference. This permits results for a variety of initial geometries (due to tolerance variations) to be obtained from a set of finite element results for a single case. Some of these characteristics are demonstrated using a finite element solution of a connecting rod/bushing/gudgeon <b>pin</b> <b>contact.</b> Other interesting applications are those with complex geometries, ranging from biomechanics, as in prostheses, to the design of multiple fasteners.

40|$|The {{evaporation}} process for small, 1 - 2 -mm-diameter droplets {{of water from}} patterned polymer surfaces is followed and characterized. The surfaces consist of circular pillars (5 - 15 mu m diameter) of SU- 8 photoresist arranged in square lattice patterns such that the center-to-center separation between pillars is 20 - 30,mu m. These types of surface provide superhydrophobic systems with theoretical initial Cassie-Baxter contact angles for water droplets of up to 140 - 167 degrees, which are significantly larger than {{can be achieved by}} smooth hydrophobic surfaces. Experiments show that on these SU- 8 textured surfaces water droplets initially evaporate in a <b>pinned</b> <b>contact</b> line mode, before the contact line recedes in a stepwise fashion jumping from pillar to pillar. Provided the droplets of water are deposited without too much pressure from the needle, the initial state appears to correspond to a Cassie-Baxter one with the droplet sitting upon the tops of the pillars. In some cases, but not all, a collapse of the droplet into the pillar structure occurs abruptly. For these collapsed droplets, further evaporation occurs with a completely <b>pinned</b> <b>contact</b> area consistent with a Wenzel-type state.
