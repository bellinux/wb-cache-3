5|$|Like {{the modern}} <b>pygmy</b> hippopotamus, the Malagasy <b>pygmy</b> hippo has {{eyes on the}} side of its head rather than high orbits and teeth {{similar to those of the}} <b>pygmy</b> hippopotamus.

5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy <b>pygmy</b> hippopotamus, this species was {{originally}} classified as Hippopotamus along with H. lemerlei, {{and indeed the}} two species were roughly the same size.

5|$|Both the Bengal slow loris and <b>pygmy</b> slow loris {{are found}} in more than 20 {{protected}} areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded. The <b>pygmy</b> slow loris is protected in most of its range states: in Cambodia, China, and Vietnam. This makes hunting and capture illegal, and in China and Vietnam, possession and storage are also illegal. Under Vietnamese law it has had {{the highest level of}} wildlife protection since 1992, all exploitation and use of the <b>pygmy</b> slow loris is illegal. However, enforcement is poor while minor penalties have little deterring effect. In terms of international protection, the species was elevated to Appendix I of CITES in 2007. In addition, since October 2001, the European Union prohibits imports for all wild specimens of <b>pygmy</b> slow loris from Laos and Cambodia for conservation reasons.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough dissimilarities in cranial and post-cranial {{morphology}} among African <b>pygmies</b> {{groups have}} been recognized, comparative studies on skull morphology usually pull all <b>pygmies</b> together assuming that morphological characters are similar among them and different with respect to other populations. The main {{aim of this study}} is to compare cranial morphology between African <b>pygmies</b> and non-pygmies populations from Equatorial Africa derived from both the Eastern and the Western regions in order to test if the greatest morphological difference is obtained in the comparison between <b>pygmies</b> and non-pygmies. Thirty three-dimensional (3 D) landmarks registered with Microscribe in four cranial samples (Western and Eastern <b>pygmies</b> and non-pygmies) were obtained. Multivariate analysis (generalized Procrustes analysis, Mahalanobis distances, multivariate regression) and complementary dimensions of size were evaluated with ANOVA and post hoc LSD. Results suggest that important cranial shape differentiation does occur between <b>pygmies</b> and non-pygmies but also between Eastern and Western populations and that size changes and allometries do not affect similarly Eastern and Western <b>pygmies.</b> Therefore, our findings raise serious doubt about the fact to consider African <b>pygmies</b> as a homogenous group in studies on skull morphology. Differences in cranial morphology among <b>pygmies</b> would suggest differentiation after divergence. Although not directly related to skull differentiation, the diversity among <b>pygmies</b> would probably suggest that the process responsible for reduced stature occurred after the split of the ancestors of modern Eastern and Western <b>pygmies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Eastern <b>Pygmies</b> from Zaire and Western <b>Pygmies</b> from Cameroon, Congo, and the Central African Republic {{represent}} the two principal groups of African <b>Pygmies.</b> In the "recent divergence" hypothesis in which Western <b>Pygmies</b> {{are thought to}} be the result of hybridization between the ancestors of Eastern <b>Pygmies</b> and Bantu farmers who penetrated the equatorial belt and came into contact with <b>Pygmies</b> around 2 - 3 kiloyears ago. On the basis of recent archaeological research in the tropical rain forest, we propose a "pre-Bantu divergence" hypothesis, which posits the separation between the ancestors of Eastern and Western <b>Pygmies</b> earlier than 18 kiloyears ago. In order to test the two hypotheses, we analyzed the variation of the hypervariable region 1 of the mitochondrial DNA in the Mbenzele, Western <b>Pygmies</b> of the Central African Republic, and compared our results with those of previous mtDNA and Y chromosome studies. Distribution, sequence variation, and age of haplogroups along with genetic distances among populations, estimates of divergence times, and simulations based on the coalescent approach were found to be congruent with the pre-Bantu divergence but failed to support the recent divergence hypothesi...|$|R

A study published in 2012, based on bone structure, moved the <b>pygmy</b> right whale from the family Neobalaenidae to the family Cetotheriidae, making it a living fossil; Neobalaenidae was elevated down to subfamily level as Neobalaeninae.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that <b>Pygmies</b> {{may differ from}} Caucasians in {{some aspects of the}} mechanics of locomotion was tested. A total of 13 <b>Pygmies</b> and 7 Caucasians were asked to walk and run on a treadmill at 4 - 12 km. h- 1. Simultaneous metabolic measurements and three-dimensional motion analysis were performed allowing the energy expenditure and the mechanical external and internal work to be calculated. In <b>Pygmies</b> the metabolic energy cost was higher during walking at all speeds (P < 0. 05), but tended to be lower during running (NS). The stride frequency and the internal mechanical work were higher for <b>Pygmies</b> at all walking (P < 0. 05) and running (NS) speeds although the external mechanical work was similar. The total mechanical work for <b>Pygmies</b> was higher during walking (P < 0. 05), but not during running and the efficiency of locomotion was similar in all subjects and speeds. The higher cost of walking in <b>Pygmies</b> is consistent with the allometric prediction for smaller subjects. The major determinants of the higher cost of walking was the difference in stride frequency (+ 9. 45, SD 0. 44 % for <b>Pygmies),</b> which affected the mechanical internal work. This explains the observed higher total mechanical work of walking in <b>Pygmies,</b> even when the external component was the same. Most of the differences between <b>Pygmies</b> and Caucasians, observed during walking, tended to disappear when the speed was normalized as the Froude number. However, {{this was not the case}} for running. Thus, whereas the tested hypothesis must be rejected for walking, the data from running, do indeed suggest that <b>Pygmies</b> may differ in some aspects of the mechanics of locomotion...|$|R

In this study, we evaluated Ig levels in Cameroon's Babinga <b>Pygmies</b> from infancy to adulthood {{and the effects}} of a national health program on these Ig levels. We found that IgG and IgM levels were outside the normal range for Italians of the same age and were comparable to those measured in Babinga <b>Pygmies</b> living in the same region by Siccardi in 1975. In conclusion, the hypergammaglobulinaemia of Babinga <b>Pygmies</b> is already present in infants and is not affected by sanitation improvements, suggesting that it could be partly genetically-determined...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the <b>pygmy</b> slow loris is seriously threatened by hunting and trade. Within its geographic range and neighbor countries, {{the trade in}} the <b>pygmy</b> slow loris has recently increased due to economic changes and human population growth, and the trend is expected to continue. Decreased sightings {{in the field and}} at animal markets indicate that wild populations are being depleted since the low reproduction rate of the <b>pygmy</b> slow loris cannot keep pace with these large-scale off-takes. Accordingly, conservationists and field biologists fear local extinctions in the near future. Between 1998 and 2006, 70% of <b>pygmy</b> slow lorises seized by authorities died before reaching a sheltering zoo, resulting in replacement demand and additional captures from the wild.|$|E
