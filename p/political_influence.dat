His eldest son, Yelü Hongji (who {{would later}} be known by the name Emperor Daozong of Liao), assumed the throne having already gained {{experience}} in governing while his father was alive.

While both Ji Dian and Zhong Yuan remained alive, and both had the <b>political</b> <b>influence</b> {{to interfere with the}} succession process, neither did.|$|E

5|$|Ranavalona's European contemporaries {{generally}} condemned her {{policies and}} characterized {{her as a}} tyrant at best and insane at worst. These negative characterizations persisted in foreign scholarly literature until the mid-1970s.

5|$|The Catholic Church {{attained}} increasing <b>political</b> <b>influence</b> in the 1930s, {{and used}} its influence to promote censorship of movies, and to discourage publication {{of birth control}} information.

5|$|Abu Bakar promuglated the Johor State Establishment Constitution (Malay: Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor), {{drafted by}} Abdul Rahman Andak, on 14 April 1895.

It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in light of his failing health, promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British <b>political</b> <b>influence</b> in the Malay states.|$|E
5|$|Around 1912, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's <b>political</b> <b>influence</b> {{was on the}} rise. He {{had begun}} associating with an inner faction of the Conservative Party, which had as its leader Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, the Mayor of Bucharest. Afterward, Bogdan-Pitești became the {{publisher}} of Seara, but was reportedly a front for Cantacuzino, who used him to test the impact of his agenda on the Romanian public. Searas main negative campaign at the time focused on Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democrats, who, to Cantacuzino's displeasure, had been co-opted in government by the other mainstream Conservatives. The paper published gossip columns and lampoons having Ionescu, Alexandru Bădărău and Nicolae Titulescu for their main targets.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the inspection, Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 to improve the defences on the islands, {{supported}} by a shipment of lead to help with construction, and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England. The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth.

5|$|Between 1386 and 1572, the Polish-Lithuanian {{union was}} {{ruled by a}} {{succession}} of constitutional monarchs of the Jagiellonian dynasty. The <b>political</b> <b>influence</b> of the Jagiellonian kings gradually diminished during this period, while the landed nobility took over an ever-increasing role in central government and national affairs. The royal dynasty, however, had a stabilizing effect on Poland's politics. The Jagiellonian Era is often regarded as a period of maximum political power, great prosperity, and in its later stage, a Golden Age of Polish culture.|$|E
40|$|A {{realistic}} {{analysis of}} antitrust must deal in positive terms with <b>political</b> <b>influences.</b> <b>Political</b> <b>influences</b> are especially {{strong in the}} antitrust arena, where decisions and policy measures often significantly affect the profitability of market players. It is thus important, in designing an antitrust regime, to acknowledge such influences and to design institutions and methods that will harness political aspirations to the achievement of antitrust goals. Accordingly, {{the goal of this}} article is to analyze the different effects political motivations might have on antitrust, and to suggest tools that may minimize such effects. A short theoretical analysis of the political economy of antitrust enforcement is followed by some recent and interesting examples of cases in which <b>political</b> <b>influences</b> shaped antitrust decisions. The conclusion that is reached is that we should wisely recognize that politics cannot be simply ignored. Building upon this conclusion, the article then introduces and analyzes some institutional design mechanisms that can be applied in order to reduce political pressures and even harness them for the goals of antitrust...|$|R

5|$|Chodkiewicz was not {{particularly}} involved {{in the politics of}} the Commonwealth, although his high office and wealth gave him significant influence; for the most part he used his <b>political</b> <b>influence,</b> and base of support in Lithuania, to gather support for his military plans, increased the size of the army, and personal gratifications. His life was dominated by warfare, if not on the front lines, then on the political scene against other Lithuanian magnates, particularly the Radziwiłł family and the Sejm politicians whom he held responsible for not passing enough taxes to support the army he wanted.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's visit {{prompted}} {{increased interest}} in Vietnam by Australian Catholics, particularly supporters of the DLP. Australian Catholics came to see South Vietnam as an anti-communist and Vatican stronghold in Asia and as a result, became strong supporters of the Vietnam War. Harold Lalor, a Jesuit priest and leading confidant of Santamaria, had studied with Thục in Rome. During the trip, Diệm met with Gilroy, the first Australian cardinal, as well as Santamaria and Archbishop of Melbourne Daniel Mannix, both of whom praised him strongly.

5|$|During Mubarak's presidency, Nasserist {{political}} parties {{began to emerge}} in Egypt, the first being the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party (ADNP). The party carried minor <b>political</b> <b>influence,</b> and splits between its members beginning in 1995 resulted in the gradual establishment of splinter parties, including Hamdeen Sabahi's 1997 founding of Al-Karama. Sabahi came in third place during the 2012 presidential election. Nasserist activists were among the founders of Kefaya, a major opposition force during Mubarak's rule. On 19 September 2012, four Nasserist parties (the ADNP, Karama, the National Conciliation Party, and the Popular Nasserist Congress Party) merged to form the United Nasserist Party.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, {{both parties}} made similar {{proposals}} to reduce authoritarianism and the <b>political</b> <b>influence</b> of the military, {{and to maintain}} the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Alfonsín denounced a pact {{between the military and}} the Peronist unions that sought an amnesty for the military. He maintained that the armed forced should be subject to the civilian government, and that unions should be regulated. He also proposed an investigation into the actions of the military during the Dirty War. He closed his campaign by reading the preamble of the constitution of Argentina. The last rally was at the Plaza de la República, and was attended by 400,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the <b>political</b> <b>influence</b> and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E

Marburger defended the Bush Administration from these accusations, saying they were inaccurate or motivated by partisanship, especially {{on the issue of}} science funding levels.
