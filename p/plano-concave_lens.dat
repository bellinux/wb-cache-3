By {{use of an}} elastomer membrane fabricated by spin coating onto a dry-etched silicon substrate, the liquid-filled cavity acts as a lens whereby applied pressure changes the membrane distension and thus the focal length. Both plano–convex and <b>plano–concave</b> <b>lenses,</b> individual elements as well as arrays, were fabricated and tested. The lens surface roughness was seen to be 9 nm rms, and the focal length could be tuned from 1 to 18 mm.

It used a convergent (plano-convex) objective lens and a divergent (<b>plano-concave)</b> eyepiece <b>lens</b> (Galileo, 1610).

The anomalous refraction induced in the planar input {{side of the}} lens and in the boundary of the wavelength-scale focal region boosts the curvature of the emerging wavefront, thus significantly enhancing {{the resolution of the}} tightly-focused optical wave.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{photonic crystal}} {{consisting of the}} fourth-order Fibonacci multilayer films has been studied by {{the finite-difference time-domain method}} and transfer matrix method. The refractive indices for two layers of the Fibonacci multilayer films are similar with that of manganese and silicon in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) band. The simulation result shows that there is an isotropic negative refractive index for the one-dimensional photonic crystal. Based on the character above, a kind of transmission-type <b>plano-concave</b> <b>lens,</b> which can be used in the EUV band (or soft X-ray), is designed. The distributions of the electromagnetic field for the lens and transimissivity of the Fibonacci multilayers films have also been calculated. The result demonstrates that the lens can focus the incoming EUV radiation, and its transmissivity is bigger than 5 %- 9 % compared with that of the Fibonacci multilayers films, having the same structure with the lens.

40|$|Refraction at {{a smooth}} {{interface}} {{is accompanied by}} momentum transfer normal to the interface. We show that corrugating an initially smooth, totally reflecting, non-metallic interface provides a momentum kick parallel to the surface, {{which can be used}} to refract light negatively or positively. This new mechanism of negative refraction is demonstrated by visible light and microwave experiments on grisms (grating-prisms). Single-beam all-angle-negative-refraction is achieved by incorporating a surface grating on a flat multilayered material. This negative refraction mechanism is used to create a new optical device, a grating <b>lens.</b> A <b>plano-concave</b> grating <b>lens</b> is demonstrated to focus plane microwaves to a point image.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{metamaterials}} has introduced {{new ways to}} manipulate how electromagnetic waves reflect, refract and radiate in systems where the range of available material properties now includes negative permittivity, permeability, and refractive index. While analytical and numerical tools are equipped to analyze the complex configurations of materials and geometry that constitute many proposed devices, realizations have been limited {{in part due to}} fabrication. The fabrication processes used to construct the majority of metamaterial media are optimized to produce 2 D products, including printed circuit board and microfabrication techniques, making the transition from two dimensional proof-of-concept to three dimensional prototype challenging. In the last decade, several reports have documented the use of additive manufacturing to fabricate 3 D electromagnetic devices, including gradient index lenses at both microwave and optical frequencies, and radio frequency lenses that attain resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Though primarily used for facsimile display models, additive manufacturing is uniquely capable of addressing the needs of 3 D electromagnetic designs which incorporate non-planar geometries and material inhomogeneity. The application of additive manufacturing to functional electromagnetic devices, however, is still uncommon, as the simultaneous layering of conductive and insulating materials remains complicated. To further advance the start of the art, we report our application of additive manufacturing in conjunction with other fabrication tools to fabricate several electromagnetics devices. The first involved the design of an artificial magnetic conducting substrate to enhance UHF RFID tags in close proximity to metal surfaces, which normally detune antennas and destructively interfere with any transmitted waves. The substrate incorporates 3 D metamaterial unit cells, the fabrication and assembly of which were enabled by additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing was then used to fabricate lightweight, self-supporting interconnected metamaterial structures. These structures exhibited minimal losses, making them ideal for a <b>plano-concave</b> microwave <b>lens</b> capable of focusing at 10 GHz with the highest gain measured for a metamaterial lens to date. Other achievements include the fabrication of frequency selective surfaces and antenna elements conformal to non-planar surfaces. Though many challenges remain to be overcome, it is clear that additive manufacturing has significant potential to contribute to the study and fabrication of electromagnetic elements. by Isaac M.

40|$|Tuberculosis causes {{more deaths}} {{worldwide}} {{than any other}} curable infectious disease. This is the case despite tuberculosis appearing {{to be on the}} verge of eradication midway through the last century. Efforts at reversing the spread of tuberculosis have intensified since the early 1990 s. Since then, microscopy has been the primary frontline diagnostic. In this dissertation, advances in clinical microscopy towards array microscopy for digital detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are presented. Digital array microscopy separates the tasks of microscope operation and pathogen detection and will reduce the specialization needed in order to operate the microscope. Distributing the work and reducing specialization will allow this technology to be deployed at the point of care, taking the front-line diagnostic for tuberculosis from the microscopy center to the community health center. By improving access to microscopy centers, hundreds of thousands of lives can be saved. For this dissertation, a lens was designed that can be manufactured as 4 × 6 array of microscopes. This lens design is diffraction limited, having less than 0. 071 waves of aberration (root mean square) over the entire field of view. A total area imaged onto a full-frame digital image sensor is expected to be 3. 94 mm 2, which according to tuberculosis microscopy guidelines is more than sufficient for a sensitive diagnosis. The design is tolerant to single point diamond turning manufacturing errors, as found by tolerance analysis and by fabricating a prototype. Diamond micro-milling, a fabrication technique for lens array molds, was applied to plastic <b>plano-concave</b> and plano-convex <b>lens</b> arrays, and found to produce high quality optical surfaces. The micro-milling technique did not prove robust enough to produce bi-convex and meniscus lens arrays in a variety of lens shapes, however, and it required lengthy fabrication times. In order to rapidly prototype new lenses, a new diamond machining technique was developed called 4 -axis single point diamond machining. This technique is 2 - 10 x faster than micro-milling, depending on how advanced the micro-milling equipment is. With array microscope fabrication still in development, a single prototype of the lens designed for an array microscope was fabricated using single point diamond turning. The prototype microscope objective was validated in a pre-clinical trial. The prototype was compared with a standard clinical microscope objective in diagnostic tests. High concordance, a Fleiss’s kappa of 0. 88, was found between diagnoses made using the prototype and standard microscope objectives and a reference test. With the lens designed and validated and an advanced fabrication process developed, array microscopy technology is advanced to the point where it is feasible to rapidly prototype an array microscope for detection of tuberculosis and translate array microscope from an innovative concept to a device that can save lives...|$|R
40|$|Grid imaging {{refractometry}} (GIR) is {{a method}} of measuring the density profile of a plasma region that is too large to be effectively measured using interferometry. A grid of beamlets generated by a laser is sent through the plasma and refracted. The refracted grid is imaged and the deflection of each grid point is measured to back calculate the plasma’s density profile. GIR will be implemented onto the fourth-harmonic probe beam on the OMEGA EP laser. A GIR system was designed and built to test the effectiveness of array generation using a physical grid or a three beam interfer-ometer. A three beam interferometer was built and produced a hexagonal pattern {{that could be used}} as a grid. Use of a three-beam interferometer allows arrays to be generated with substantially higher frequencies without facing detrimental diffraction effects. Figure 1 : Model of the GIR setup.

Different type of the refraction index and birefringence dependence from the packing pressure (in the last case is being observed a minimum value under the packing pressure 60 MPa) can be explained when considering the combinations of phenomena.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{efficacy}} of the panoramic viewing system (PVS) Reinverting Operating Lens System (ROLS) and the plano-concave Landers lens system in pars plana vitectomy (PPV). METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed the records of 117 PPV, 87 patients, performed between December 1996 and August 1998. The PPV was divided into two groups. Group 1 included 54 surgeries, with the Landers system. Group 2 included 63 surgeries with the ROLS. RESULTS: There were no statistical {{significant differences between the two}} groups, regarding pre and postoperative parameters. Surgeries employing the Landers system had an average time significantly higher than the ROLS group (p< 0. 001). When the surgical time was analyzed according to the disease, surgeries lasted significantly longer when the Landers system was used (p< 0. 05), except for the Uveitis group (p= 0. 262). Surgeries in group 2 required less air-fluid and lens exchanges, less use of perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL), and less need for scleral depression during the procedure. CONCLUSION: The use of ROLS significantly reduced the time for PPV, lowering the need for air-fluid exchange, lens exchange, PFCL use, and scleral depression. The PVS ROLS offered several advantages over the Landers <b>plano-concave</b> <b>lens</b> system during the surgery, without changing the final results...|$|E
40|$|Previously we {{developed}} a low-cost, multi-configurable handheld response system, using a reflective-type intensity modulated fiber-optic sensor (FOS) [1] to accurately gather participants' behavioral responses during {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Inspired by the popularity and omnipresence of the fingertip-based touch sensing user interface devices, in this paper we present the design of a prototype fMRI-compatible optical touch stripe (OTS) as an alternative configuration. The prototype device takes advantage of a proven frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) technique. By using a custom-built wedge-shaped optically transparent acrylic prism as an optical waveguide, and a <b>plano-concave</b> <b>lens</b> to provide the required light beam profile, the position of a fingertip touching the surface of the wedge prism can be determined from the deflected light beams that become trapped within the prism by total internal reflection. To achieve maximum sensitivity, the optical design of the wedge prism and lens were optimized through a series of light beam simulations using WinLens 3 D Basic software suite. Furthermore, OTS performance and MRI-compatibility were assessed on a 3. 0 Tesla MRI scanner running echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The results show that the OTS can detect a touch signal at high spatial resolution (about 0. 5 cm), and is well suited for use within the MRI environment with average time-variant signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) loss <; 3 %...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{concentrator}} photovoltaic (CPV) system with improved irradiation uniformity and system efficiency. CPV technology is very promising its for highly efficient solar energy conversion. A conventional CPV system usually uses only one optical component, {{such as a}} refractive Fresnel lens or a reflective parabolic dish, to collect and concentrate solar radiation on the solar cell surface. Such a system creates strongly non-uniform irradiation distribution on the solar cell, which tends to cause hot spots, current mismatch, and degrades the overall efficiency of the system. Additionally, a high-concentration CPV system is unable to collect diffuse solar radiation. In this paper, we propose a novel CPV system with improved irradiation uniformity and collection of diffuse solar radiation. The proposed system uses a Fresnel lens as a primary optical element (POE) to concentrate and focus the sunlight and a <b>plano-concave</b> <b>lens</b> as a secondary optical element (SOE) to uniformly distribute the sunlight {{over the surface of}} multi-junction (MJ) solar cells. By using the SOE, the irradiance uniformity is significantly improved in the system. Additionally, the proposed system also captures diffuse solar radiation by using an additional low-cost solar cell surrounding MJ cells. In our system, incident direct solar radiation is captured by MJ solar cells, whereas incident diffuse solar radiation is captured by the low-cost solar cell. Simulation models were developed using a commercial optical simulation tool (LightTools™). The irradiance uniformity and efficiency of the proposed CPV system were analyzed, evaluated, and compared with those of conventional CPV systems. The analyzed and simulated results show that the CPV system significantly improves the irradiance uniformity as well as the system efficiency compared to the conventional CPV systems. Numerically, for our simulation models, the designed CPV with the SOE and low-cost cell provided an optical power ratio increase of about 17. 12 % compared to the conventional CPV without the low-cost cell, and about 10. 26 % compared to the conventional CPV without using both the SOE and additional low-cost cell...|$|E
