40|$|We have {{previously}} described enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) strains that induce cytotoxic effects on T 84 cells, ligated rat ileal loops, and human intestine in culture. Such strains secrete a 104 -kDa protein termed Pet (for plasmid-encoded toxin). We have also shown previously that the Pet toxin induces rises in short-circuit current and decreases the electrical resistance in rat jejunum mounted in an Ussing chamber. The nucleotide {{sequence of the}} pet gene revealed that Pet {{is a member of}} the autotransporter class of secreted proteins. Here we show that a concentrated supernatant of E. coli HB 101 harboring the minimal pet clone pCEFN 1 induces temperature-, time- and dose-dependent cytopathic effects on HEp- 2 cells and HT 29 C 1 cells in culture. The effects were characterized by release of the cellular focal contacts from the glass substratum, followed by complete rounding of the cells and detachment from the glass. Staining of the Pet-treated cells with Live/Dead viability stain revealed that > 90 % of rounded cells were viable. Pet-intoxicated HEp- 2 and HT 29 cells stained with fluorescein-labeled phalloidin revealed contraction of the cytoskeleton and loss of actin stress fibers. However, the effects of Pet were not inhibited by cytoskeleton-altering drugs, including colchicine, taxol, cytochalasin D, and phallicidin. The Pet protein induced proteolysis in zymogram gels, and preincubation with the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride resulted in complete abrogation of Pet cytopathic effects. We introduced a mutation in a predicted catalytic serine residue and found that the mutant (<b>Pet</b> <b>S</b> 260 I) was deficient in protease activity and did not produce cytopathic effects, cytoskeletal damage, or enterotoxic effects in Ussing chambers.

Two sets of heating scans were measured {{as a function of}} the amount of volume isothermal relaxation for two different relaxation temperatures below T-g (60 and 52 degrees C), whereas other experimental variables were kept constant. The experimentally determined heating isobar inflection temperature is a linear function of the amount of Volume relaxation, which satisfies the application of PSM method for structure parameter x determination from volumetric heating data. The value of structure parameter of the used PET is independent of relaxation temperature and equal to 0. 50 +/- 0. 02.

It displays excellent properties for investigation of the cardiac beta-ARs in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). Furthermore, the simple production method allows its use in a routine clinical setting. The aim of this study was to investigate whether decreased myocardial beta-AR density in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) can be estimated using (S) -[C- 11]CGP 12388 PET. Methods. Myocardial beta-AR density was investigated in six patients with IDC and six age-matched healthy controls, using (S) -[C- 11]CGP 12388 PET. Results. beta-AR densities of 5. 4 +/- 1. 3 pmol/g (mean +/- SD) were observed in patients; these values were significantly lower than those observed in healthy controls (8. 4 +/- 1. 5 pmol/g, p < 0. 005).

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} whether we can use a qualitative analysis of data collected with the quantitative method to determine the reasons for violent behaviour among youth. The quantitative part of the research was conducted on a sample of N = 51 participants, first-grade students of Daruvar Grammar School. For the purposes of gathering quantitative data, we used the Aggression Questionnaire (Buss and Perry, 1992), and for the qualitative part, a semi-structured interview that was based on the Aggression Questionnaire. The qualitative part of the study was conducted on five participants with the minimum, and five participants with the maximum score on the Aggression Questionnaire. The method we used for qualitative data processing is called "Framework Analysis". The quantitative analysis provides an insight into the prominence of aggressive behaviour among youth, and the differences between the four dimensions of the Aggression Questionnaire. The qualitative data processing gives us a deeper insight into the differences between the participants with the minimum and the maximum score on the Aggression Questionnaire, and the differences among the participants at the individual level. There are differences that have been obtained by the quantitative method; nevertheless, the qualitative analysis shows that there are a number of characteristics shared by both groups of participants. It is shown that the two groups of respondents mainly differ in the expression of aggressive behaviour; however, their perceptions, emotions and cognition are quite similar.

40|$|The {{genotoxicity}} of energetic compounds (i. e., explosives) {{that are}} known to be present in contaminated soils at military training sites has not been extensively investigated. Thus, the Salmonella mutagenicity and Muta(TM) Mouse assays were employed as in vitro assays to examine the mutagenic activity of twelve explosive compounds, as well as three soil samples from Canadian Forces Base Petawawa. Salmonella analyses employed strains TA 98 (frameshift mutations) and TA 100 (base-pair substitution mutations), as well as the metabolically-enhanced YG 1041 (TA 98 background) and YG 1042 (TA 100 background), with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S 9). For Salmonella analyses, the results indicate that ten of the explosive compounds were mutagenic, and consistently elicited direct-acting, base-pair substitution activity. All three soil samples were also observed to be mutagenic, eliciting direct-acting, frameshift activity. Mutagenic potencies were significantly higher on the metabolically-enhanced strains for all compounds and soil samples. For Muta(TM) Mouse analyses on FE 1 cells, the results indicate that the majority of explosive compounds did not exhibit mutagenic activity. All three soil samples elicited significant positive responses (PET 1 and <b>PET</b> 3 without <b>S</b> 9, and <b>PET</b> 2 with <b>S</b> 9), and although there is some evidence of a concentration-related trend, the responses were weak. Correspondence of the mutagenic activity observed with the two assay systems, for both the explosive compounds and soil samples, was negligible. The differential response is likely due to differences in metabolic capacity between the two assay systems. Furthermore, it is likely that there are unidentified compounds present in these soil samples that are, at least in part, responsible for the observed mutagenic activity. Additional testing of other explosive compounds, as well as soil samples from other military training sites, using a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays, is warranted in order to reliably estimate mutagenic hazard and subsequently assess risk to human health...|$|R

It is widely used for various applications such as bottles, fibers, moldings, and sheets because of its excellent tensile and impact strength, clarity, processability, chemical resistance, and thermal stability (Pawlak et al. 2000; Kong and Hay 2003; Avila-Orta et al. 2003). The PET fiber patented originally by DuPont (DuPont, 1997) dominates over 50 % of the world synthetic fiber market. In the late 1950 <b>s,</b> <b>PET</b> film was developed and used for X-ray, photographic, and cassette recording films as well as flexible packing materials. Blow molding techniques began to be used to stretch PET, which produced three dimensional structures, resulting in the rapid growth of light and unbreakable PET bottle manufacturers in the early 1970 s (Wyeth and Roseveare 1973).|$|R
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) has an approximately 50 year-history. It was {{developed as a}} tool of medical science to quantitatively measure metabolic rates of bio-substances in vivo and in particular the number of receptors in neuroscience. Until the late 1990 <b>s</b> <b>PET</b> was, in most cases, research oriented activity. In 2001, positron {{emission tomography}}/X ray computed tomography (PET/CT) hybrid imaging system became commercially available. An era of clinical PET then emerged, in which PET images were utilized for clinical practice in the treatment and diagnosis of cancer patients. PET imaging could recognize areas of abnormal metabolic behaviour of cancers in vivo, and the addition of CT imaging underlines the site of malignancy. More accurate and precise interpretation of cancer lesions can therefore be performed by PET/CT imaging than PET or CT imaging alone. Clinical PET, in particular with fluorine- 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG), has already proven itself to have considerable value in oncology. The indications include malignan...|$|R
40|$|Poly(alkylene terephthalate) <b>s,</b> <b>PET</b> and PBT in particular, are {{materials}} of great relevance and growing projection in the thermoplastic field but are today almost totally produced from fossil resources. The current huge consumption of these polyesters necessitates urgent actions addressed {{to make them}} renewable by using naturally-occurring raw materials. Among the different approaches that are being followed to develop bio-based poly(terephthalate) s, the use of bicyclic carbohydrate-derived difunctional compounds as building-blocks is receiving much attention {{in the last few}} years because partially renewable polyesters with high Tg may be thus obtained. This review presents a critical account of the terephthalate homopolymers and copolymers that have been synthesized using the two types of carbohydrate-based bicyclic monomers, isohexides and diacetals, explored to date. The properties displayed by the novel bio-based poly(terephthalate) s in relation to the bicyclic structure of the used monomers are comparatively reviewed and their potential as emergent materials for thermoplastic applications is evaluated.

40|$|The use of {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) for tumor imaging has been increasing since the 1980 <b>s.</b> <b>PET</b> is a clinically useful tool that can cost-effectively detect different types of tumors [1]. For oncological studies, the whole-body PET (WB-PET) image {{plays an important role}} in detecting and staging various cancers, but there are some potential pitfalls in traditional display methods that need to be improved. The purpose of this study is to develop several data-processing techniques to overcome these problems and provide better image quality for visual interpretation of scans. Overview For WB-PET, the functional images could indicate a highly contrasted lesion but provide poor morphological information due to the poor resolution and the noisy properties of the image [2]. A number of centers have developed different methods to integrate the information from various imaging modalities to enhance the structural appearance of the resulting images. Fusing PET with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for localizing lesions in different organs, especially for brai...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1951 United Nations Convention, {{nations have}} dealt with refugee issues in various ways. In the United States, since the Vietnam War, there has been great debate and a {{significant}} amount of research on issues of refugee resettlement, with these discourses inherently involving issues of power and ideology. English language training and the promotion of economic self-sufficiency have been interventions used to integrate and assimilate refugees into American culture and society. These two interventions were the subject of the current investigation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to look into the way federal refugee resettlement policy mandated by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) construes the notion of self-sufficiency in policy documents; and whether or not that constructed version of self-sufficiency is reflected or reinforced in the local attendant English language training, provided by the Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization 2 ̆ 7 s (IRCO) Pre-Employment Training 2 ̆ 7 s English language training courses. Through a combination of Critical Discourse Analysis and analytic techniques influenced by Corpus Linguistics, this study was able to investigate the construal of self-sufficiency in ORR refugee resettlement policy and its reflection in IRCO PET ELT. The ORR policy Title 45 : Public Welfare, Part 400 : Refugee Settlement Program and the lesson plans and materials of IRCO 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>PET</b> 2 ̆ 7 s SPL levels 2 and 3 were analyzed with a textual analysis, process analysis, and social analysis. The ORR policy also underwent a collocation comparison analysis that employed the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). The results of this qualitative study indicate that the federal resettlement policy exploits a common connotation of self-sufficiency to mask its underlying subjugating policies that position resettled refugees into early employment positions with little opportunities for higher education or occupational advancement. The ELT provided by IRCO 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>PET</b> program reflects and reinforces the ORR 2 ̆ 7 s construed notion of self-sufficiency as well as its underlying hegemonic agenda. These findings this relate to broader discourses of immigration, neoliberalism, and education in the United States. Conclusions drawn from this investigation have pedagogical implications and applications that are discussed...|$|R

As dogs and cats are increasingly viewed as family members, a person 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>pets</b> may wield significant influence in partner choice. Here, we provide descriptive quantitative data on the role pets play in mate appraisal and mate selection; we also test two hypotheses regarding the role of pets in single Americans’ dating lives. We hypothesized that single women will place more value on a how a potential mate interacts with their pet, than will single men. We also hypothesized that dogs will serve more prominent roles as “social tools” in the dating arena than cats, given that dogs are more social and dogs require more constant care. Thus, dogs {{may be a better}} measure of a potential mate 2 ̆ 7 s caregiving capacity.
