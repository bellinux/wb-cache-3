5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E
5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} oxygen {{atmosphere was}} consistent with that {{that had been used}} successfully in the Mercury and Gemini programs. The pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogen-containing air and replace it with pure oxygen, and also to seal the <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> hatch cover. During launch, the pressure would have been gradually reduced to the in-flight level of , providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while reducing the fire risk. The Apollo 1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in the Operations and Checkout Building altitude (vacuum) chamber on October 18 and 19, 1966, and the backup crew of Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham had repeated it on December 30. The investigation board noted that, during these tests, the Command Module had been fully pressurized with pure oxygen four times, for a total of six hours and fifteen minutes, {{two and a half hours}} longer than it had been during the plugs-out test.|$|E

500|$|The inner {{hatch cover}} used a <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> design, sealed by higher {{pressure}} inside the cabin than outside. The normal pressure level used for launch ( [...] above ambient) created sufficient force to prevent removing the cover until the excess pressure was vented. Emergency procedure called for Grissom {{to open the}} cabin vent valve first, allowing White to remove the cover, but Grissom was prevented from doing this because the valve was located to the left, behind the initial wall of flames. Also, while the system could easily vent the normal pressure, its flow capacity was utterly incapable of handling the rapid increase to [...] absolute caused by the intense heat of the fire.|$|E

2500|$|The Boeing 747 was {{designed}} with an outward-hinging door, unlike a <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> which opens inward and jams against its frame as the pressure drops outside, {{making it impossible}} to accidentally open at high altitude. The outward-swinging door increases the cargo capacity, but it requires a strong locking mechanism to keep it closed. [...] Deficiencies in the design of wide-body aircraft cargo doors were known since the early 1970s from flaws in the DC-10 cargo door. These problems were not fully addressed by the aircraft industry or the NTSB, despite the warnings and deaths from the DC-10 incidents [...] and Boeing attempts to solve the problems in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, {{mechanical}} refrigeration began to replace ice-based systems. Soon after, mechanical refrigeration units replaced the [...] "armies" [...] of personnel required to re-ice the cars. The <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> was introduced experimentally by P.F.E. (Pacific Fruit Express) in April 1947, when one of their R-40-10 series cars, #42626, was equipped with one. P.F.E.'s R-40-26 series reefers, designed in 1949 and built in 1951, were the first production series cars to be so equipped. In addition, the Santa Fe Railroad first used plug doors on their SFRD RR-47 series cars, which were also built in 1951. This type of door provided a larger six foot opening to facilitate car loading and unloading. These tight-fitting doors were better insulated and could maintain an even temperature inside the car. By the mid-1970s, the few remaining ice bunker cars were relegated to [...] "top-ice" [...] service, where crushed ice was applied atop the commodity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>doors</b> {{are used}} on most modern airliners, {{particularly}} for the small passenger <b>doors.</b> However, since <b>plug</b> <b>doors</b> must open inward, the design is disadvantageous for cargo doors. Due to its large area, the cargo door on an airliner can not be swung inside the fuselage without taking up {{a considerable amount of}} valuable cargo space. For this reason, these doors often open outward and use a locking mechanism with multiple pins or hatch dogs to prevent opening while in flight.|$|R

50|$|Sliding plug {{doors are}} {{a type of}} <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> that open by sliding horizontally, whereby the door is either mounted on, or {{suspended}} from a track. They are also used on commercial vans, trains and other vehicles. They allow a large opening for passengers to enter or exit without obstructing access.|$|E
50|$|An outward-opening {{cargo hatch}} is {{inherently}} less resistant to blowing open than an inward-opening one, also called a <b>plug</b> <b>door.</b> In flight, the air pressure inside the aircraft {{is greater than}} that outside, and pushes outward on the hatch. In {{the case of a}} <b>plug</b> <b>door,</b> this actually seals the door more tightly. An outward-opening hatch, however, relies entirely upon its latch to prevent it from opening in flight. This makes it particularly important that the locking mechanisms be secure. Aircraft other than DC-10s have also experienced catastrophic failures of hatches. The Boeing 747 has experienced several such incidents, the most noteworthy of which occurred on United Airlines Flight 811 in February 1989. On Flight 811, the cargo hatch failed, causing a section of the fuselage to fail, resulting in the deaths of nine passengers, who were blown out of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> is a door {{designed}} to seal itself by {{taking advantage of}} pressure difference on its two sides and is typically used on aircraft with cabin pressurization. The higher pressure on one side forces the usually wedge-shaped door into its socket, making a good seal and preventing it from being opened until the pressure is released.|$|E

50|$|The pre-series set, S11, was {{upgraded}} to full-production standard in February 2013 and renumbered U1. It retains the flush <b>plug</b> <b>doors</b> for the passenger doors immediately behind the driving cabs, whereas the full-production sets have recessed sliding doors.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> {{is often}} seen on {{aircraft}} with pressurized cabins. Due to the air pressure within the aircraft cabin being {{higher than that of}} the surrounding atmosphere, the door seals itself closed as the aircraft climbs and the pressure differential increases. This prevents accidental opening of the door. In the event of a decompression, with there no longer being a pressure differential, the doors may be opened, and as such most airlines' operating procedures require cabin crew to keep passengers away from the doors until the aircraft has safely landed. On some aircraft the <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> opens partially inward, and through a complex hinge design can be tilted to fit through the fuselage opening, or the door may have locking hinged panels at the top and bottom edges that can make it smaller than the opening, so that it may be swung outward.|$|E
50|$|A <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> {{on a bus}} has a pantographic hinge {{that moves}} the door panel {{outwards}} from its plug socket and then parallel {{to the side of}} the bus to clear the opening. On closing, the door is wedged and locked into the opening. This arrangement makes a very good airtight and soundproof seal but is usually limited to buses such as coaches that make infrequent stops as the door operation is slow and mechanically complex.|$|E
50|$|A pure oxygen {{atmosphere}} carries risk of fire. The {{original design}} of the Apollo spacecraft used pure oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure prior to launch. An electrical fire started in the cabin of Apollo 1 during a ground test at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34 on 27 January 1967, and spread rapidly. The high pressure (increased even higher by the fire) prevented removal of the <b>plug</b> <b>door</b> hatch cover in time to rescue the crew. All three, Gus Grissom, Edward H. White, and Roger Chaffee, were killed. This led NASA to use a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere before launch, and low pressure pure oxygen only in space.|$|E
50|$|Many {{passenger}} train carriages use <b>plug</b> <b>doors.</b> On commuter and regional trains <b>doors</b> of <b>plug</b> design take less room than sliding doors, but may restrict the compatibility {{of a car}} with high passenger platforms since these doors open outwards.|$|R
