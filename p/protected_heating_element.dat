50|$|Almost any {{conductive}} wire can be {{used for}} heating, but most metals conduct electricity with great efficiency, requiring them to be formed into very thin/ delicate wires in order to create enough resistance to generate heat. Once heated, most metals then oxidize quickly, become brittle, and break when heated in air.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Natural convective heat transfer from a square horizontal flat isothermal <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> imbedded in a larger flat square adiabatic surface with a square flat horizontal adiabatic surface mounted parallel to the heated surface at a relatively short distance from it has been numerically studied. The surface of the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> {{is in the same}} plane as the surface of the surrounding adiabatic material. The square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> considered in this study is at a higher temperature than that of the surrounding fluid. Both the case where the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> is facing upwards and the surrounding adiabatic covering surface is above the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> (upward facing case) and the case where the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> is facing downwards and the surrounding adiabatic covering surface is below the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> (downward facing case) have been considered. The situation considered is a simplified model of some situations that arise in engineering practice examples occurring in some electrical and electronic component cooling problems. In this study, the range of conditions considered is such that laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows occur. The {{purpose of this study was}} to numerically determine how the heat transfer rate from the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> varies with the distance of the adiabatic covering surface from the <b>heated</b> <b>element.</b> The solution was obtained by numerically solving the governing equations subject to the boundary conditions using the commercial CFD solver ANSYS FLUENT© using the kepsilon turbulence model with full account being taken of buoyancy force effects. Because of the applications that motivated this study, results have been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0. 74, i. e., effectively the value for air. The effect of the dimensionless distance between the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> and the cover on the variation of the Nusselt number with Rayleigh number has been studied in detail for both the upward and the downward facing cases. dc 201...|$|R

40|$|Silicon carbide is {{electrically}} semi conductive. Its use as electrical <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> {{has been}} well known for more than 50 years. Therefore {{it is not surprising}} that foams made of silicon carbide can be used as electrical heaters as well. The different applications of <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> demand a specific design of the elements themselves. The ruling parameters are the specific electrical resistance of the heater material, the maximum thermal load, the specific power per surface area and the required geometry of the <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> Ceramic foams are easy to penetrate and flush by liquids and gases since their open porosity can reach 90 vol%. The foam structure enables an intense contact of the bypassing medium to the solid struts of the foam.

40|$|Current leakage is {{a concern}} with {{resistance}} welding of carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites. This phenomenon is particularly important when unidirectional adherends, with the carbon fibres parallel to the electrical current direction, are welded. In this investigation, a new electrically-insulated <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> consisting of a ceramic-coated (TiO 2 ̆ 082) stainless steel mesh was developed to prevent current leakage. Special specimen geometry, called a skin/stringer configuration, was welded with this newly developed <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> to represent typical reinforced aerospace structures. The adherends were made of APC- 2 /AS 4 (carbon fibre/PEEK) composites. Unidirectional specimens, which represent the most critical case, were first welded using the new <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> The insulated <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> successfully prevented current leakage and showed great improvement in temperature homogeneity over the weld area. The impact of the new <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> on the mechanical performance of the welds was then assessed by welding quasi-isotropic specimens.

No mechanical performance drawback was observed with the new heating element; however, the failure mode of the welded quasi-isotropic specimens was changed from a delamination in the skin laminate failure to a weld interface debonding failure.
