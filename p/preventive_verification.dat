40|$|The paper {{presents}} three operative models {{whose purpose}} {{is to improve the}} practice of preventive maintenance {{to a wide range of}} technical installations. Although the calculation criteria are different, the goal is the same: to determine the optimum time between two consecutive preventive interventions. The optimum criteria of these models are: - the maximum share of technical entity operating probabilities, in the case of the Ackoff - Sasieni [1] method; -the optimum time interval for <b>preventive</b> <b>verification</b> depending on the preventive-corrective maintenance costs imposed by the deciding factor, for the AsturioBaldin [2] model; - the minimum number of renewals – preventive and/or corrective maintenance operations [3...|$|E
40|$|In Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES), the {{simulation}} model is partitioned into {{a set of}} distinct Logical Processes (LPs) which are allowed to concurrently execute simulation events. In this work we present an innovative approach to load-sharing on multi-core/multiprocessor machines, targeted at the optimistic PDES paradigm, where LPs are speculatively allowed to process simulation events with no <b>preventive</b> <b>verification</b> of causal consistency, and actual consistency violations (if any) are recovered via rollback techniques. In our approach, each simulation kernel instance, in charge of hosting and executing {{a specific set of}} LPs, runs a set of worker threads, which can be dynamically activated/deactivated {{on the basis of a}} distributed algorithm. The latter relies in turn on an analytical model that provides indications on how to reassign processor/core usage across the kernels in order to handle {{the simulation}} workload as efficiently as possible. We also present a real implementation of our load-sharing architecture within the ROme OpTimistic Simulator (ROOT-Sim), namely an open-source C-based simulation platform implemented according to the PDES paradigm and the optimistic synchronization approach. Experimental results for an assessment of the validity of our proposal are presented as well...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCarbon dioxide (CO 2) {{geological}} storage {{relies on}} safe, long-term injection of {{large quantities of}} CO 2 in underground porous rocks. Wells, whether they are the conduit of the pumped fluid or are exposed to CO 2 in the storage reservoir (observation and old wells) are man-made disturbances to the geological storage complex, and are thus viewed {{by some as a}} possible risk factor to the containment of the injected CO 2. Wells are composite structures, with an inner steel pipe separated from the borehole rock wall by a thin cement sheath (∼ 2 cm) that prevents vertical fluid migration. Both carbon steel and cement react in the presence of CO 2, although evidence from production of CO 2 -rich fluids in {{the oil and gas industry}} and from lab experiments suggests that competent, defect-free cement offers an effective barrier to CO 2 migration and leaks. However, reactivity of cement and steel may result in CO 2 migration pathways degrading over time, thus in the leakage risk increasing during the life of the storage project. The issue then becomes how to best integrate <b>preventive</b> <b>verification</b> of zonal isolation/well integrity in the storage site monitoring plan. An analysis of the order of magnitude of possible CO 2 leaks, and of their path to potable aquifers or the atmosphere, is also necessary to optimize the assurance (mitigation) monitoring of the storage site. Evidence gathered during the MovECBM project indicates that migration of small quantities of CO 2 happened during injection in a coal seam in Southwest Poland. The evidence, gathered from casing and cement logging as well as soil gas monitoring over a 3 -year period, was coupled with laboratory testing and extensive modeling of the chemo-mechanical behavior of cement and steel to determine if CO 2 migration might have been responsible of the observed behavior. The three lines of evidence were: The detection of very small CO 2 fluxes, coupled with less controversial helium concentration in soil; the occurrence of a thin pathway at the interface between cement and casing; and the change in mechanical properties of cement, suggestive of partial carbonation. Whereas the observations suggest that limited CO 2 migration might have happened in the well, they are by no means proof that the migration did happen. Nonetheless, the integration of measurement and modeling yields important lessons for wellbore monitoring. First, it puts a probable ceiling on the order of magnitude of expected leaks from reasonably well-cemented wells at around 100 metric tons per year (less than 0. 05 % of the injected mass in a well like Sleipner or In Salah). It also suggests that cement may be a very effective leak detector: Exposure to CO 2 modifies its mechanical properties, which in turn can be detected using cement evaluation logs. Finally, coupling with dispersion modeling suggests the precision and accuracy required from soil gas and atmospheric monitoring, as well as the placement of sampling points; it also suggest that hysteresis, due to the accumulation in CO 2 in surface aquifers and to the time required for it to be transported to the survey points, may delay initial detection; the same hysteresis may at the same time prolong the occurrence of CO 2 shows long after the leak has stopped...|$|E
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of a business era that embraces changes as one of its major characteristics, manufacturing success and survival {{are becoming more and more}} difficult to ensure. The emphasis is on adaptability to changes in the business environment and on addressing market and customer needs proactively. Changes in the business environment due to varying needs of the customers lead to uncertainty in the decision for requirements from supplier. Flexibility is needed in the value stream map (VSM) to counter the uncertainty in the decision for requirements from supplier. VSM adapts the changes if it is flexible and agile in nature. In this paper a model is presented, which encapsulates the market sensitiveness, process integration, information driver and flexibility measures of VSM demands from supplier and grantee customer requirements. The model was addressed validation to <b>preventive</b> and <b>verification</b> to corrective (VPVC) that is a concept within six-sigma definition. (VPVC) depends on the systematic investigation of discrepancies (failures / deviations) which must be applied in lean six-sigma environment that adopt one piece flow layout. The model is consists of two phases, the first phase is a mathematical model explores the relationship among customer demand, quality, and service level and the leanness and agility of VSM in fast moving consumer goods. The second phase is a quality assurance process of establishing evidence that provides a high degree of preventive that a product involves acceptance of fitness for purpose with customers'. The paper concludes with the justifications of the system input, which depends on the effect of the jerky demand of the market with high quality specification...|$|R
40|$|The book is {{dedicated}} to the study of trans-boundary and European insolvency procedures and represents a relevant and useful instrument in the analysis of the international, European and national policies with reference to judicial cooperation in the field of the insolvency procedures. In particular, the work faces in deepened and exhaustive way the topic of the insolvency of debtors whose entrepreneurial activities is localised in more than one legal order, supplying a critical reconstruction of the European discipline setting up autonomous rules concerning jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency decisions. In order to bring on a systematic study of the problem, the volume is subdivided in three sections, respectively devoted to the analysis of i) the national and international models that can represent a reference in order to prepare an independent discipline dedicated to the trans-boundary insolvency, ii) the Regulation 1346 / 2000 and iii) national rules of the Italian legal order. In {{the first part of the}} book – Chapter I - the Author takes care of the techniques that have been employed in order to rule the insolvency of an enterprise having cross-border characters, verifying that, on the one hand, the traditional models of the “universality” and “territoriality” are not employed in “pure” forms in any legal order and that, on the other hand, there are many obstacles to the full realization of the universal vocation inborn in every insolvency discipline (that is aimed to guarantee the par condicio creditorum principle). Then, the Author analyses the positive and negative aspects of the so called “limited universality”, that represents the outline which currently inspires the most recent rulings both at the international and national level. Such a theory allows a connection between the different jurisdictions of the interested States with the insolvency, without imposing the opening of a sole procedure with universal effects, but concurring the slope of parallel proceedings by coordinating their effects. The universality in the limited form presupposes that the procedure opened in the country in which the centre of the main interests of the debtor is localised has main character and can have universal character, but this does not forbid the opening of local proceedings in the States in which another seat of the enterprise in crisis is found. Chapter II {{is dedicated}} to the study of national rules inspired by the limited universality principle, as well as to the analysis of the instruments created in order to favour the acceptance of such a model by national legislators (i. e. the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency and the Concordat of the International Bar Association). Among them, common law legal orders are taken in consideration (UK and USA), as well as civil law legislations (Switzerland, Germany and France). The Second Part of the monograph is devoted to the European common discipline of the insolvency and, in particular, to the analysis of Regulations 1346 / 2000 on insolvency procedures. Chapter III examines the evolution of the European judicial area that has brought to the adoption of the Regulation, emphasizing the reasons of the European Community intervention in this field. The following Chapters IV and V are dedicated to the deep analysis of the Regulation itself. To such purpose, detailed attention is given to the notion of “centre of the main interests” of the debtor and “establishment”, definitions relevant in order to operate the bipartition, made by the Regulation, between main and territorial-secondary insolvency procedures. Concerning recognition and enforcement of decisions rendered within the insolvency proceeding, the principle of mutual confidence that print the relationships between the Member States of the European Community is recalled. Such a principle has carried to the affirmation of the automatic recognition of decisions coming from European judges in civil and commercial matters, comprised those concerning bankruptcy. In the event in which decisions are wanted to produce their executive effects, it is said that the judge of the demanded State must always proceed to a <b>preventive</b> <b>verification</b> on the content and on the way of formation of the decision emitted in another EU State, exam that has to be brought on following the exequatur procedure verification set forth by Regulations 44 / 2001. The Third Part of the book, finally, {{is dedicated to}} the discipline of the insolvency in the Italian legal order, taking into account both rules contained in the bankrupt law and those introduced by private international law act (law 218 / 95). in this seat it is stressed the difficult coordination to which the interpreter is called upon when he has to face a cross-border insolvency case: in fact, while within the scope of application of Regulation 1346 / 2000 the main insolvency proceeding potentially has universal character, hypotheses that are not included in that scope of application remain subject to the rigid territorialistic principle that inspires the bankruptcy law of 1942 (that has not been modified yet). Chapter VI, therefore, proposes a new reading that, in an interpretative way, reconciles the conflicts gushing from the differences inspiring the different rules concerning jurisdiction and insolvency procedures with reference to the Italian legal order...|$|E
