Collision safety and rigidity of vehicles are strongly affected by strength and rigidity {{of the structural}} components. Accordingly, they are made of high strength steel / ultra-high strength steel and have closed cross section shapes (closed-profiles). Conventional closed-profile components are currently assembled by spot welding of two <b>press-formed</b> parts. Flanges of <b>press-formed</b> parts {{are required}} for spot welding and inhibit weight reduction. In the present situation, a new forming method was developed for closed-profile parts without flanges. The developed method was constituted three forming processes by using conventional mechanical press machines. In the 1 st process, a steel sheet was partially stretched for adjustment of the cross section length and formed folds at ridgeline positions of the final shape. In the 2 nd process, the formed sheet in 1 st process was bent by press forming. In the 3 rd process, the formed sheet in 2 nd process was closed to hexagonal cross section shape by side tools which were driven transversely by cams. And finally it was added compression in plain by the punch. Trial product by the developed forming method satisfied the target performances (bending and torsion rigidity and collision strength). Weight reduction ratio was 39 % by optimization of the cress section shape and removing flanges...|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) forming of {{paperboard}} and heat sealing of lidding films to trays manufactured {{by the press}} forming process are investigated in this thesis. The aim of the work was to investigate and recognize the factors affecting the quality of heat sealing and the leak resistance (tightness) of <b>press-formed,</b> polymer-coated paperboard trays heatsealed with a multi-layer polymer based lidding film. One target was to achieve a solution {{that can be used}} in food packaging using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The main challenge in acquiring adequate tightness properties for the use of MAP is creases in the sealing area of the paperboard trays which can act as capillary tubes and prevent leak-proof sealing. Several experiments were made to investigate the effect of different factors and process parameters in the forming and sealing processes. Also different methods of analysis, such as microscopic analysis and 3 D-profilometry were used to investigate the structure of the creases in the sealing area, and to analyse the surface characteristics of the tray flange of the formed trays to define quality that can be sealed with satisfactory tightness for the use of MAP. The main factors and parameters that had an effect on the result of leak-proof sealing and must be adjusted accordingly were the tray geometry and dimensions, blank holding force in press forming, surface roughness of the sealing area, the geometry and depth of the creases, and the sealing pressure. The results show that the quality of <b>press-formed,</b> polymer-coated paperboard trays and multi-layer polymer lidding films can be satisfactory for the use of modified atmosphere packaging in food solutions. Suitable tools, materials, and process parameters have to be selected and used during the tray manufacturing process and lid sealing process, however. Utilizing these solutions and results makes it possible for a package that is made mostly from renewable and recyclable sources to be a considerable alternative for packages made completely from oil based polymers, and to achieve a greater market share for fibre-based solutions in food packaging using MAP...|$|R
40|$|Wrinkling often {{occurs during}} textile {{composite}} forming {{and is a}} major problem for manufacturers. The prediction of this defect is, therefore, of major importance for the design and optimization of textile composite structures. Numerical simulations of forming for textile composites over a hemisphere have been conducted using a rate/temperature-dependent hybrid FE model. The hybrid FE model incorporates a fully predictive multi-scale energy model which determines the shear resistance of the textile composite sheet. The effects of varying the normal force distribution across the edges of the blank and blank size, together with the effect of changes in forming temperature on the final fibre pattern and wrinkling behaviour, are investigated. Predictions are evaluated against <b>press-formed</b> components.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The most {{advanced}} structural frames {{of cars and}} motorcycles are made of aluminium alloys welded box beams. A recent technological solution for the beams consists of <b>press-formed</b> metal sheets joined by welded lap-joints. Because the frames undergo relevant fatigue loads, the evaluation of fatigue endurance {{of this kind of}} connections plays a crucial role during the development of frame. The present research deals with the evaluation of fatigue behaviour of welded lap joints, subjected to tensile and bending loads. Fractographic evidences and numerical analyses showed that fatigue strength is controlled by the presence of defects ad inhomogeneities {{at the tip of the}} weld root. In particular these defects, which appear to lie onto the maximum Kqq path, increase SIF at weld singularity. Such an analysis, together with the statistical description of defects population, allowed to develop a methodology able to predict the fatigue strength of lap-joints. A simple method for SIF based on FEM analyses and structural stresses at the lap-joint is then presented...|$|R

Wood plastic composites are one possible way to recycle thermoplastic materials, as they have desirable material properties for many applications. However, due to technical restrictions and lack of knowledge, the product geometries have been mainly limited to extruded twodimensional profiles. In this work, the development of post-processing and line development methodology for an extruded thermoplastic wood plastic composite is investigated to enable the production of more complex shapes. The aim {{of the work is}} to investigate and recognize the major factors affecting the post-processing of the composite material by utilizing the press forming technique, and to develop a practical prototype line based on these observations and findings. Several experiments are done to investigate the most influential material properties and parameters of one interesting thermoplastic composite material.

This new composite was manufactured employing papermaking principles, dispersing the recycled carbon fibers (rCF) in water, and forming them into mats. Two layers of the recycled polypropylene (rPP) films manufactured using press-forming were sandwiched between three rCF pre-form layers in a stack. The stack was heated and <b>press-formed</b> resulting in a composite plate with a nominal thickness of 1. 20 mm and a fiber volume fraction of 40 %. A series of tensile tests using rectangular specimens cut in four different directions (0, 90, 45) in the composite plate were performed to confirm in-plane material isotropy. Models to predict stiffness and strength of the short fiber rCF/rPP composite were also employed and validated using experiments.
