Direct application of 2. 0 % T. polium extract to the nerve trunk caused immediate complete inhibition of compound action potentials (CAPs) {{of all types of}} <b>primary</b> afferent <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers.</b> Partial recovery of CAPs was seen in up to 37. 5 % of Aab-fibers, 30. 4 % of Ad-fibers and 32. 4 % for C-fibers over one hour after removal of the extract. Fifteen to twenty days after a single perineural application of 2 % T. polium extract, the CAPs of <b>primary</b> afferent <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> were reduced to 60. 78 % – 7. 54 (n = 14) for Aab-fibers, 67. 39 % – 9. 34 (n = 14) for Ad-fibers and 62. 2 % – 8. 25 (n = 14) for C-fibers. Carrageenan-induced acute skin inflammation was reduced to 56. 86 % – 12. 81 (n = 9) after local subcutaneous injection of the herb extract.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} indicates that inflammation of visceral organs is significantly affected by the autonomic nervous system. Such neuroimmune interactions have not been studied in the kidney. Here, we show that the rat kidney is innervated by both tyrosine hydroxylase–positive sympathetic efferent <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> and calcitonin gene-related peptide–positive <b>primary</b> afferent <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers,</b> {{both of which are}} found in proximity to macrophages and dendritic cells. Complete surgical bilateral renal denervation was performed 2 d before glomerulonephritis was induced by injecting the monoclonal anti–Thy- 1. 1 antibody OX- 7. Denervation significantly reduced albuminuria, mesangiolysis, formation of microaneurysms, deposition of glomerular collagen IV, and expression of TGF-β compared with sham-operated controls. Accordingly, inflammation, identified by accumulation of interstitial macrophages and renal expression of TNF-α, and mesangial cell proliferation were significantly reduced. These findings indicate that autonomic renal denervation ameliorates and, by inference, innervation exacerbates acute inflammation in the kidney; therefore, neurotransmitters or neuropeptides and their receptors might represent novel targets for the treatment of acute glomerulonephritis...|$|R
40|$|The two {{amino acids}} GABA and glycine mediate fast {{inhibitory}} neurotransmission in different CNS areas and serve pivotal {{roles in the}} spinal sensory processing. Under healthy conditions, they limit the excitability of spinal terminals of <b>primary</b> sensory <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> and of intrinsic dorsal horn neurons through pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, and thereby facilitate the spatial and temporal discrimination of sensory stimuli.

40|$|Wiener kernel {{analysis}} was used to characterize the auditory pathway from tympanic membrane to single <b>primary</b> auditory <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in the European edible frog, Rana esculenta. <b>Nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> signals were recorded in response to white Gaussian noise. By cross-correlating the noise stimulus and the <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> response, we computed (1) the full second-order Wiener kernel, and (2) the diagonals of the zeroth-to fourth-order Wiener kernels. These diagonals are usually referred to as polynomial correlation functions. The measured Wiener kernels were fitted with a 'sandwich' model. A new fitting procedure was used to compute the response characteristics of(1) the first filter, (2) the static nonlinearity, and (3) the second filter, which form the functional components of the model. The first filter is a bandpass filter. In the majority of low frequency fibers, with best excitatory frequency (BEF) < 800 Hz, this filter was tuned to two frequencies. This dual tuning mechanism gives rise to 'off-diagonal' components in the second-order Wiener kernel. The static nonlinearity resembles a rectifier, and is dominated by second-order (quadratic) nonlinearity. As a function of BEF, the shape of the nonlinearity changes systematically. Finally, the last filter in the model was a low pass filter. Across fibers, its cutoff frequency(f- 3 dB) ranged from 106 to 434 Hz. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Fish acquire {{information}} about their aquatic environment by means of their mechanosensory lateral-line system. This system consists of superficial and canal neuromasts that sense perturbations in the water sur-rounding them. Based on a hydrodynamic model presented here, we propose a mechanism through which fish can localize the source of these perturbations. In doing so we include the curvature of the fish body, a realistic lateral line canal inter-pore distance for the lateral-line canals, and the surface boundary layer. Using our model to explore receptor behavior based on experimental data of responses to dipole stimuli we suggest that superficial and canal neuromasts employ the same mechanism, hence provide {{the same type of}} input to the central nervous system. The analytical predictions agree well with spiking responses recorded experimentally from <b>primary</b> lateral-line <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers.</b> From this, and taking into account the central organization of the lateral-line system, we present a simple biophysical model for determining the distance to a source...|$|R
40|$|Ever since Pliny the Elder {{coined the}} term tinnitus, the {{perception}} of sound {{in the absence of}} an external sound source has remained enigmatic. Traditional theories assume that tinnitus is triggered by cochlear damage, but many tinnitus patients present with a normal audiogram, i. e., with no direct signs of cochlear damage. Here, we report that in human subjects with tinnitus and a normal audiogram, auditory brainstem responses show a significantly reduced amplitude of the wave I potential (generated by <b>primary</b> auditory <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers)</b> but normal amplitudes of the more centrally generated wave V. This provides direct physiological evidence of “hidden hearing loss” that manifests as reduced neural output from the cochlea, and consequent renormalization of neuronal response magnitude within the brainstem. Employing an established computational model, we demonstrate how tinnitus could arise from a homeostatic response of neurons in the central auditory system to reduced auditory nerve input in the absence of elevated hearing thresholds. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} response of single <b>primary</b> auditory <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> (n = 31) was investigated in the European edible frog, Rana esculenta (seven ears). <b>Nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> responses were analyzed with Wiener kernel analysis and polynomial correlation. The responses were described with a cascade model, consisting of a linear bandpass filter, a static nonlinearity, and a linear lowpass filter. From the computed Wiener kernels and the polynomial correlation functions, {{the characteristics of the}} three model components were obtained. With increasing temperature (1) tuning of the first filter increased in the majority (n = 16) of amphibian papilla fibers (best excitatory frequency, BEF 1 kHz, n = 11), (2) the gain of the first filter remained unchanged, (3) the shape of nonlinear IO function remained unchanged, (4) the combined gain of the static nonlinearity and the second filter usually increased, but displayed considerable scatter across fibers (from - 0. 7 dB/degrees C to 3 dB/degrees C), and (5) the cutoff frequency of the second lowpass filter increases, with average 0. 13 oct/ degrees C. The immunity of the shape of the nonlinearity is considered evidence of a temperature independent gating mechanism in the transduction channels. The {{temperature dependence}} of the second filter may have resulted from a decrease of the hair cell membrane resistance, but may also reflect changes in subsequent staging of <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> excitation.

Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells are proposed to fulfill this role by acting as chemosensors, but understanding how these rare and unique cell types transduce chemosensory information to the nervous system has been hampered by their paucity and inaccessibility to single-cell measurements. Here, we circumvent this limitation by exploiting cultured intestinal organoids together with single-cell measurements to elucidate intrinsic biophysical, pharmacological, and genetic properties of EC cells.

40|$|It is {{currently}} accepted that the neural transduction pathways of gastrointestinal (GI) visceral pain include the peripheral and central pathways. Existing {{research on the}} neurological mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) {{in the treatment of}} GI visceral pain has primarily been concerned with the regulation of relevant transduction pathways.

40|$|Pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe and {{debilitating}} symptoms associated with several forms of cancer. Various types of carcinomas and sarcomas metastasize to skeletal bones and cause spontaneous bone pain and hyperalgesia, which is accompanied by bone degradation and remodeling of peripheral nerves. Despite recent advances, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of cancer-evoked pain are not well understood. Several types of non-hematopoietic tumors secrete hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors that act on myeloid cells and tumor cells. Here we report that receptors and signaling mediators of granulocyte- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) are also functionally expressed on sensory nerves. GM-CSF sensitized nerves to mechanical stimuli in vitro and in vivo, potentiated CGRP release and caused sprouting of sensory nerve endings in the skin. Interruption of G-CSF and GM-CSF signaling in vivo led to reduced tumor growth and nerve remodeling, and abrogated bone cancer pain. The key significance of GM-CSF signaling in sensory neurons was revealed by an attenuation of tumor-evoked pain following a sensory nerve-specific knockdown of GM-CSF receptors. These results show that G-CSF and GM-CSF are important in tumor-nerve interactions and suggest that their receptors on <b>primary</b> afferent <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> constitute potential therapeutic targets in cancer pai...|$|R
40|$|Loperamide reverses {{signs of}} {{mechanical}} hypersensitivity in an animal model of neuropathic pain suggesting that peripheral opioid receptors may be suitable {{targets for the}} treatment of neuropathic pain. Since little is known about loperamide effects on the responsiveness of <b>primary</b> afferent <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers,</b> in vivo electrophysiological recordings from unmyelinated afferents innervating the glabrous skin of the hind paw were performed in rats with an L 5 spinal nerve lesion or sham surgery. Mechanical threshold and responsiveness to suprathreshold stimulation were tested before and after loperamide (1. 25, 2. 5 and 5 µg in 10 µl) or vehicle injection into the cutaneous receptive field. Loperamide dose-dependently decreased mechanosensitivity in unmyelinated afferents of nerve-injured and sham animals, and this effect was not blocked by naloxone pretreatment. We then investigated loperamide effects on nerve conduction by recording compound action potentials in vitro during incubation of the sciatic nerve with increasing loperamide concentrations. Loperamide dose-dependently decreased compound action potentials of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers (ED 50  =  8 and 4 µg/ 10 µl, respectively). This blockade was not prevented by pre-incubation with naloxone. These results suggest that loperamide reversal of behavioral signs of neuropathic pain may be mediated, at least in part, by mechanisms independent of opioid receptors, most probably by local anesthetic actions...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of 17 <b>primary</b> auditory <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) to acoustic noise {{stimulation of the}} tympanic membrane was recorded. For each fiber, the first- and second-order Wiener kernels, k(1) (tau(1)) and k(2) (tau(1),tau(2)), were computed by cross correlation of the stimulus and the response. The kernels revealed amplitude and phase characteristics of auditory filters of both phase-locking and non-phase-locking fibers. Wiener kernels of high- and midfrequency fibers (best frequency, BF> 500 Hz), implied a simple sandwich model, consisting of a cascade of a linear bandpass filter, a static nonlinearity, a linear low-pass filter, and a spike generator. The bandpass filter was at least of order 7, and had a linear phase response, for both the high- and the midfrequency fibers. Averaged across fibers, filter order 2, and cutoff frequency 451 Hz for the second filter in the model was observed. The responses of low-frequency fibers (BF< 500 Hz) could not be fit with the sandwich model, because the Fourier transform K- 2 (f(1),f(2)) of the second-order Wiener kernel showed significant components at off-diagonal frequencies f(1) not equal+/-f(2).

We examined interactions between primary cultured MMC and CGRP-IR DRG neurons in vitro by confocal recording of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +](i)). The degranulatory EC 50 for the mast cell secretagogue compound 48 / 80 (C 48 / 80; 10 mug/ml) and the neuropeptides CGRP (2. 10 (- 8) M) and substance P (SP; 3. 10 (- 8) M) were determined by measurement of extracellular release of the granule chymase, mouse mast cell protease- 1. Application of C 48 / 80 (10 mug/ml) and CGRP and SP (both 10 (- 7) M) to Fluo- 4 -loaded MMC induced a transient rise in [Ca 2 +](i) after a lag time, indicative of mast cell degranulation and/or secretion. The CGRP response could be completely blocked by pertussis toxin (2 mug/ml), indicating involvement of G(i) proteins. Application of MMC juice, obtained by C 48 / 80 degranulation of MMC, to Fluo- 4 -loaded DRG neurons induced in all neurons a rise in [Ca 2 +](i), indicative of activation. Degranulation of MMC by C 48 / 80 in culture dishes containing Fluo- 4 -loaded DRG neurons also caused activation of the DRG neurons. In conclusion, these results demonstrate a bidirectional cross-talk between cultured MMC and CGRP-IR DRG neurons in vitro. This indicates that such a communication may be the functional relevance for the close apposition between MMC and CGRP-IR <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in vivo...|$|R

Indirect immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry using antisera generated against a methionine enkephalin-bovine thyroglobulin conjugate {{was applied to}} surface preparations of the organ of Corti and cryostat sections of {{the whole of the}} cochlea. In the cochlear osseous spiral lamina, immunofluorescence was localized to unmyelinated fibers of the intraganglionic spiral bundle. In the organ of Corti, immunofluorescence was localized to a small number of fibers at inner hair cells, the inner spiral bundle, and tunnel spiral bundle, to tunnel crossing fibers {{at the level of the}} tunnel floor, to an occasional spiral outer fiber, and to the synaptic region of outer hair cells in the three rows of the basal turn of the cochlea. Less immunofluorescence was found in this region as one progressed towards the apex, with none seen at the apex. At the most apical region the inner spiral bundle became patchy and the tunnel spiral bundle developed arcades. There was no immunofluorescence found in spiral ganglion cells, in auditory <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers,</b> or in the hair cells of the organ of Corti. The findings were the same in cat as in guinea pig, the latter being studied in more detail. It was concluded that efferent, olivocochlear neurons of the cochlea, synapsing predominantly with <b>primary</b> auditory <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> from the inner sensory cells or with the sensory cells, contain enkephalin-like immunoreactivity.

40|$|Chemotherapy induced {{peripheral}} neuropathy (CIPN) {{is a type}} of neuropathic pain that is a major dose-limiting side-effect of potentially curative cancer chemotherapy treatment regimens that develops in a "stocking and glove" distribution. When pain is severe, a change to less effective chemotherapy agents may be required, or patients may choose to discontinue treatment. Medications used to alleviate CIPN often lack efficacy and/or have unacceptable side-effects. Hence the unmet medical need for novel analgesics for relief of this painful condition has driven establishment of rodent models of CIPN. New insights on the pathobiology of CIPN gained using these models are discussed in this review. These include mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress that are implicated as key mechanisms in the development of CIPN. Associated structural changes in peripheral nerves include neuronopathy, axonopathy and/or myelinopathy, especially intra-epidermal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> (IENF) degeneration. In patients with CIPN, loss of heat sensitivity is a hallmark symptom due to preferential damage to myelinated <b>primary</b> afferent sensory <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in {{the presence or absence of}} demyelination.

40|$|AbstractWe {{hypothesized}} that TRPV 4, {{a member of}} the transient receptor family of ion channels, functions as a sensory transducer for osmotic stimulus-induced nociception. We found that, as expected for a transducer molecule, TRPV 4 protein is transported in sensory nerve distally toward the peripheral nerve endings. In vivo single-fiber recordings in rat showed that hypotonic solution activated 54 % of C-fibers, an effect enhanced by the hyperalgesic inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E 2. This osmotransduction causes nociception, since administration of a small osmotic stimulus into skin sensitized by PGE 2 produced pain-related behavior. Antisense-induced decrease in expression of TRPV 4 confirmed that the channel is required for hypotonic stimulus-induced nociception. Thus, we conclude that TRPV 4 can function as an osmo-transducer in <b>primary</b> afferent nociceptive <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers.</b> Because this action is enhanced by an inflammatory mediator, TRPV 4 may be important in pathological states and may be an attractive pharmacological target for the development of novel analgesics...|$|R

We compared equally noise exposed rats separated into groups with and without tinnitus for differences in brain responsiveness relative to the degree of deafferentation in the periphery. We analyzed (1) the number of CtBP 2 /RIBEYE-positive particles in ribbon synapses of the inner hair cell (IHC) as a measure for deafferentation; (2) the fine structure of the amplitudes of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) reflecting differences in sound responses following decreased auditory nerve activity and (3) the expression of the activity-regulated gene Arc in the auditory cortex (AC) to identify long-lasting central activity following sensory deprivation. Following moderate trauma, 30 % of animals exhibited tinnitus, similar to the tinnitus prevalence among hearing impaired humans. Although both tinnitus and no-tinnitus animals exhibited a reduced ABR wave I amplitude (generated by <b>primary</b> auditory <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers),</b> IHCs ribbon loss and high-frequency hearing impairment was more severe in tinnitus animals, associated with significantly reduced amplitudes of the more centrally generated wave IV and V and less intense staining of Arc mRNA and protein in the AC.

Over a range of AM frequencies from 0. 1 to 200 Hz, the modulation transfer function of P-type afferents is high-pass in character, with a gain that increases monotonically up to AM frequencies of 100 Hz where it begins to roll off, and a phase advance {{with a range of}} 1560 degrees.

The objective {{of the present study was}} to reevaluate the presence of <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in endometrium and in different types of endometriotic lesions. Patients and methods: <b>Nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> density (PGP 9. 5 immunohistochemical analysis), unmyelinated <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> presence (neurofilament immunohistochemical detection) and nerve growth factor expression were evaluated in endometrial (disease free: n= 20; endometriotic: n= 26) and endometriotic (peritoneal lesion: n= 11; ovarian lesion: n= 16; rectovaginal lesion: n= 27) samples. Results: Endometrial biopsies {{were found to be}} mostly negative for <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers.</b> <b>Nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> density was higher in deep nodular lesions than in peritoneal (p<. 01) or ovarian (p<. 001) lesions. Around 30 % of PGP 9. 5 -positive <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> were confirmed by neurofilament staining. Nerve growth factor expression was detected at higher levels in the stroma of deep-infiltrating lesions (p<. 05). Conclusions: No <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> were detected in endometrial biopsies (from healthy or endometriosis patients). However, <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> were detected in endometriotic lesions. Most of them were found to be unmyelinated, suggesting they could be implicated in pain. Deep nodular lesions may be more neuroattractive through the action of nerve growth factor...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Although {{the human}} cornea is densely innervated, {{observations}} of the <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> distribution and ultrastructure are scarce. This study aimed to provide a detailed electron microscopic analysis of <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in the central and peripheral human cornea. Methods, Samples from seven fresh corneas, obtained from eyes of persons with melanoma, were processed for light and electron microscopic examinations. Both frontal and crosssections were studied. Furthermore, serial ultrathin sections from the mid-epithelium to the anterior stroma were used. Results. Unmyelinated <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> bundles (as many as 30 <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> and cross-section as large as 20 ^,m) run parallel to the stromal collagen <b>fibers.</b> <b>Nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> contain clear, dense cored and dense vesicles and are ensheathed by thin rims of Schwann cell protrusions and amorphic matrix. Some <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> invaginate the cytoplasm of keratocytes. After passing through Bowman's membrane, bundles of straight fibers (cross-section 0. 1 to 0. 5 /um) and single-beaded <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers,</b> which both lack Schwann cell ensheathment, run parallel in an alternating manner. Beaded <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers,</b> containing many mitochondria and glycogen (crosssection as large as 2 /xm), turn upward and invaginate both basal and wing cells. Except fo...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} the peripapillary retinal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> layer and peripapillary retinal thickness in patients with diabetic macular edema. Fifty eyes (group I) with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF injection, and 90 eyes (group II) without diabetic macular edema were included in this case-control study. The peripapillary retinal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> layer thickness, peripapillary retinal thickness, and a new retinal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> layer index using a modeled relationship between the two parameters were evaluated with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, at baseline and at the 6 -month follow-up. In group I, the peripapillary retinal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> layer thickness decreased from 126. 4 μm at baseline to 117. 6 μm at 6 months (p 0. 01). Analysis with the new index to adjust for retinal edema showed no significant change from baseline to 6 months in both groups (p = 0. 593 and p = 0. 101, respectively). The peripapillary retinal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> layer thickness is strongly affected by the peripapillary retinal thickness. Therefore, the measured changes in peripapillary retinal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> layer thickness may not represent the real gain or loss of the retinal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> layer. Therefore, the new retinal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> layer index, which corrects for the component of macula edema, could be a better means of assessing the changes of peripapillary retinal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> layer thickness in patients with diabetic macular edema...|$|R

40|$|Cupric ion-ferricyanide {{labeling}} {{methods and}} related ferrocyanide-stained tissues {{were used to}} locate the characterize, at the ultrastructural level, presumptive impulse initiation zones in {{the three types of}} vestibular macular <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers.</b> Large-diameter, M-type vestibular <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> terminate in a calyx at the heminode, and labeling is coextensive with the base of the calyx. Intermediate, M/U-type <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> have short, unmyelinated preterminal segments that sometimes bifurcate intamacularly, and small-diameter, U-type <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> have long, unmyelinated preterminal axons and up to three branches. Preterminals of these <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> display ultrastructural heterogeneity that is correlated with labeling patterns for sodium channels and/or associated polyanionic sites. They have a nodelike ultrastructure and label heavily from near the heminode {{to the base of the}} macula. Their intramacular branches, less organized ultrastructurally, label only slightly. Results indicate that vestibular <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> have one impulse initiation zone, located near the heminode, that varies in length according to <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> type. Structural heterogeneity may favor impulse conduction in the central direction, and length of the impulse initiation zone could influence nerve discharge patterns...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral {{neuropathy}} is {{the most}} frequent neurological complication of HIV infection, affecting {{more than one-third of}} infected patients, including patients treated with antiretroviral therapy. Although emerging noninvasive techniques for corneal nerve assessments are increasingly being used to diagnose and monitor peripheral neuropathies, corneal nerve alterations have not been characterized in HIV. Here, to determine whether SIV infection leads to corneal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> loss, we immunostained corneas for the <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> marker βIII tubulin. We developed and applied both manual and automated methods to measure nerves in the corneal subbasal plexus. These counting methods independently indicated significantly lower subbasal corneal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> density among SIV-infected animals that rapidly progressed to AIDS compared with slow progressors. Concomitant with decreased corneal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> density, rapid progressors had increased levels of SIV RNA and CD 68 -positive macrophages and expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein by glial satellite cells in the trigeminal ganglia, the location of the neuronal cell bodies of corneal sensory <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers.</b> In addition, corneal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> density was directly correlated with epidermal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> length. These findings indicate that corneal nerve assessment has great potential to diagnose and monitor HIV-induced peripheral neuropathy and to set the stage for introducing noninvasive techniques to measure corneal <b>nerve</b> <b>fiber</b> density in HIV clinical settings...|$|R
40|$|The present {{immunohistochemical}} study {{describes the}} presence and distribution of <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> containing neuropeptide Y (NPY), and C-Flanking Peptide Of NPY (CPON) in the pineal gland of the sheep. <b>Nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> were detected by using a series of antisera directed against NPY or against CPON. Many positive immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> were identified in the pial capsule of the pineal, in connective septae and in the parenchyma between pinealocytes. The intraparenchymal fibers were particularly evident and created an extensive network throughout the gland. <b>Nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> immunoreactive for all the peptides were also observed in the posterior commissure and in the stria medullaris thalami. No NPY- or CPON-positive neurons {{were found in the}} pineal gland. In order to study the site of origin of NPY- and CPON-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers,</b> the superior cervical ganglia were bilaterally removed in a series of animals. Sympathetic denervation was checked by using an antiserum against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Nearly all TH-immunoreactive elements disappeared in the pineal glands of animals sacrificed 15 days after surgery. Also the density of NPY- and CPON-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> decreased in the animals after the ganglionectomy. However, a number of <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> still remained in the gland. These data indicate that some NPY- and CPON-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> of the sheep pineal gland derive from an extrasympathetic origin. The very dense innervation of the sheep pineal gland with <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> containing NPY and CPON strongly indicates a functional role for this family of peptides in the pineal gland of this species...|$|R

40|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament has a rich {{sensory nerve}} supply which originates from the trigeminal ganglion and trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus. Although {{various types of}} mechanoreceptors {{have been reported in}} the periodontal ligament, the Ruffini ending is an essential one. It is unknown whether the distribution of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in deciduous teeth is identical to that in permanent teeth or not. Moreover, morphological changes in the distribution of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> during resorption of deciduous teeth and eruption of successional permanent teeth in diphyodont animals have not been reported in detail. Therefore, in this study, we examined changes in the distribution of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in the cat during changes in dentition (i. e., deciduous, mixed and permanent dentition) by immunohistochemistry of protein gene product 9. 5. During deciduous dentition, periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> were concentrated at the apical portion, and sparsely distributed in the periodontal ligament of deciduous molars. During mixed dentition, the periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> of deciduous molars showed degenerative profiles during resorption. In permanent dentition, the periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> of permanent premolars, the successors of deciduous molars, increased in number. Similar to permanent premolars, the periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> of permanent molars, having no predecessors, increased in number, and were densely present in the apical portion. The present results indicate that the distribution of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in deciduous dentition is almost identical to that in permanent dentition although the number of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in deciduous dentition was low. The sparse distribution of periodontal <b>nerve</b> <b>fibers</b> in deciduous dentition agrees with clinical evidence that children are less sensitive to tooth stimulation than adults...|$|R
