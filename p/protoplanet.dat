40|$|At {{the final}} stage of {{terrestrial}} planet formation, known as the giant impact stage, a few tens of Mars-sized <b>protoplanets</b> collide with one another to form terrestrial planets.

However, recent impact simulations have shown that collisions among <b>protoplanets</b> are not always merging events, that is, two colliding <b>protoplanets</b> sometimes move apart after the collision (hit-and-run collision). As a first step towards studying the effects of such imperfect accretion of <b>protoplanets</b> on terrestrial planet formation, we investigated the merging criteria for collisions of rocky <b>protoplanets.</b> Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) method, we performed more than 1000 simulations of giant impacts with various parameter sets, such as the mass ratio of <b>protoplanets,</b> γ, the total mass of two <b>protoplanets,</b> M_ T, the impact angle, θ, and the impact velocity, v_ imp. We investigated the critical impact velocity, v_ cr, at the transition between merging and hit-and-run collisions. We found that the normalized critical impact velocity, v_ cr/v_ esc, depends on γ and θ, but does not depend on M_ T, where v_ esc is the two-body escape velocity. We derived a simple formula for v_ cr/v_ esc as a function of γ and θ, and applied it to the giant impact events obtained by N-body calculations in the previous studies. We found that 40...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have revealed}} the eccentricity and inclination distributions of close-in super-Earths. These distributions {{have the potential}} to constrain their formation processes. In the in-situ formation scenario, the eccentricities and inclinations of planets are determined by gravitational scattering and collisions between <b>protoplanets</b> on the giant impact stage. We investigate the effect of the initial eccentricities and inclinations of <b>protoplanets</b> on the formation of close-in super-Earths. We perform $N$-body simulations of <b>protoplanets</b> in gas-free disks, changing the initial eccentricities and inclinations systematically. We find that while the eccentricities of <b>protoplanets</b> are well relaxed through their evolution, the inclinations are not. When the initial inclinations are small, they are not generally pumped up since scattering is less effective and collisions occur immediately after orbital crossing. On the other hand, when the initial inclinations are large, they tend to be kept large since collisional damping is less effective. Not only the resultant inclinations of planets, but also their number, eccentricities, angular momentum deficit, and orbital separations are affected by the initial inclinations of <b>protoplanets.</b> Comment: Accepted for publication in A...|$|R

50|$|Early <b>protoplanets</b> {{had more}} {{radioactive}} elements, {{the quantity of}} which has been reduced over time due to radioactive decay.

30|$|<b>Protoplanets</b> {{are formed}} out of {{collisions}} with kilometer-sized or larger bodies called planetesimals. While <b>protoplanets</b> grow, e and i of planetesimals {{are determined by}} the Hill radius of the <b>protoplanets,</b> and their e and i are smaller than 0.3 unless the <b>protoplanets</b> are greater than ten Earth masses (see equation 15 of Kobayashi et al. 2010). Therefore, AHN derived formulae of ȧ, ė, and i̇ due to gas drag for a body with low e≲ 0.3 and i≪ 0.1. However, e and i may possibly increase when more massive planets are formed. Indeed, in the solar system, some comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects have very high e and i (e.g., Kobayashi et al. 2005). In addition, if inclined and eccentric orbits of irregular satellites around Jovian planets are originated from captures due to interaction with circumplanetary disks (e.g., Fujita et al. 2013), these captured bodies with high e and i evolve their orbits in the disks. Therefore, analytic formulae for ȧ, ė, and i̇ for bodies with high e and i are helpful for the analysis of small bodies in the late stage of planet formation.|$|R
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt formed from the primordial solar nebula {{as a group}} of planetesimals. Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the <b>protoplanets.</b> Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the <b>protoplanets</b> with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet. Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the <b>protoplanets</b> shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the {{asteroid belt}}'s original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} planetary accretion from planetesimals in terrestrial planet regions inside the ice line around M dwarf stars through N-body simulations including tidal interactions with disk gas. Because of low luminosity of M dwarfs, habitable zones (HZs) {{are located in}} inner regions (∼ 0. 1 AU). In the close-in HZ, type-I migration and the orbital decay induced by eccentricity damping are efficient according to the high disk gas density in the small orbital radii. Since the orbital decay is terminated around the disk inner edge and the disk edge {{is close to the}} HZ, the <b>protoplanets</b> accumulated near the disk edge affect formation of planets in the HZ. Ice lines are also in relatively inner regions at ∼ 0. 3 AU. Due to the small orbital radii, icy <b>protoplanets</b> accrete rapidly and undergo type-I migration before disk depletion.

30|$|Long term {{behavior}} of five <b>protoplanets</b> was studied {{under the same}} conditions as those used in Chambers et al. (1996). One major difference {{was the number of}} calculations carried out for one parameter set of initial orbital distance. We reconfirmed their result for the orbital crossing times among five <b>protoplanets</b> starting from circular and co-planar orbits with an equal distance of their semi major axes. For each distance, the distribution of orbital crossing times was calculated from 500 sets of azimuthal positions of <b>protoplanets</b> randomly chosen. The distribution of the times around the average value resembles each other for almost all orbital distance cases. Based on a statistical certification we conclude that the fluctuations in orbital crossing times take “the log normal function”. The dispersion of the log normal distribution function is equal to 0.2. This means that 70 % of the events of orbital crossing occurs in the range between 10 − 0.2 times earlier and 100.2 times later than the average orbital crossing time.|$|R
500|$|The {{formation}} of giant planets {{is a more}} complicated process. It is thought to occur beyond the frost line, where planetary embryos mainly are made of various types of ice. As a result, they are several times more massive than in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk. What follows after the embryo formation is not completely clear. Some embryos appear {{to continue to grow}} and eventually reach 5–10 Earth masses—the threshold value, which is necessary to begin accretion of the hydrogen–helium gas from the disk. The accumulation of gas by the core is initially a slow process, which continues for several million years, but after the forming <b>protoplanet</b> reaches about 30 Earth masses (...) it accelerates and proceeds in a runaway manner. Jupiter- and Saturn-like planets are thought to accumulate the bulk of their mass during only 10,000years. The accretion stops when the gas is exhausted. The formed planets can migrate over long distances during or after their formation. Ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune are thought to be failed cores, which formed too late when the disk had almost disappeared.|$|E
500|$|Giant planet core {{formation}} {{is thought to}} proceed roughly {{along the lines of}} the terrestrial planet formation. It starts with planetesimals that undergo runaway growth, followed by the slower oligarchic stage. Hypotheses do not predict a merger stage, due to the low probability of collisions between planetary embryos in the outer part of planetary systems. An additional difference is the composition of the planetesimals, which in the case of giant planets form beyond the so-called snow line and consist mainly of ice—the ice to rock ratio is about 4 to 1. This enhances the mass of planetesimals fourfold. However, the minimum mass nebula capable of terrestrial planet formation can only form [...] cores at the distance of Jupiter (5AU) within 10million years. The latter number represents the average lifetime of gaseous disks around Sun-like stars. The proposed solutions include enhanced mass of the disk—a tenfold increase would suffice; <b>protoplanet</b> migration, which allows the embryo to accrete more planetesimals; and finally accretion enhancement due to gas drag in the gaseous envelopes of the embryos. Some combination of the above-mentioned ideas may explain the formation of the cores of gas giant planets such as Jupiter and perhaps even Saturn. The formation of planets like Uranus and Neptune is more problematic, since no theory has been capable of providing for the in situ formation of their cores at the distance of 20–30AU from the central star. One hypothesis is that they initially accreted in the Jupiter-Saturn region, then were scattered and migrated to their present location. Another possible solution is the growth of the cores of the giant planets via pebble accretion. In pebble accretion objects between a cm and a meter in diameter falling toward a massive body are slowed enough by gas drag for them to spiral toward it and be accreted. Growth via pebble accretion may be as much as 1000 times faster than by the accretion of planesimals.|$|E
