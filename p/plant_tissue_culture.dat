25|$|Plants can be {{propagated}} by seed, cuttings, {{and tissue}} culture. Seeds are usually sown on damp chopped Sphagnum moss, or on sterile <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> media {{once they have}} been properly disinfected. The seeds generally become nonviable soon after harvesting, so seed are not usually the preferred method of propagation. A 1:1 mixture of orchid medium with moss or perlite {{has been used for}} germination and culture. Seed may take two months to germinate, and two years or more to yield mature plants. Cuttings may be rooted in damp Sphagnum moss in a plastic bag or tank with high humidity and moderate light. They can begin to root in one to two months and start to form pitchers in about six months. Tissue culture is now used commercially and helps reduce collection of wild plants, as well as making many rare species available to hobbyists at reasonable prices.

500|$|Particularly {{since the}} mid-1960s {{there have been}} {{advances}} in understanding of the physics of plant physiological processes such as transpiration (the transport of water within plant tissues), [...] the temperature dependence of rates of water evaporation from the leaf surface and the molecular diffusion of water vapour and carbon dioxide through stomatal apertures. These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, {{and the rate of}} photosynthesis have enabled precise description of the rates of gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Innovations in statistical analysis by Ronald Fisher, Frank Yates and others at Rothamsted Experimental Station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research. The discovery and identification of the auxin plant hormones by Kenneth V. Thimann in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals.

40|$|Poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra DN 34) <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> removed 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) from an aqueous {{solution}} in five days, reducing the toxicity {{of the solution}} from highly toxic Microtox® EC value {{to that of the}} control. 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazacyclohexane (RDX) was taken up by the <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> more slowly, but toxicity reduction of the solution was evident. The measurement of toxicity reduction of {{aqueous solution}}s containing TNT and RDX was performed using a novel methodology developed for use with the Microtox® testing system. Radiolabeled TNT and RDX were used to confirm removal of explosives from hydroponic solutions containing <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> and to verify that toxicity did not change in solutions where no plant cultures were present (positive controls). High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) measurements confirmed removal of TNT and RDX from solutions containing poplar <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> and constancy of the plant-free controls. In addition, metabolites were identified in remediated solutions by HPLC, confirming the mechanism by which plants can remediate groundwater, surface water, and soil solutions. Using an Affymetrix® microarray, poplar trees were exposed to TNT over 48 hours. General patterns, as well as significant downregulated and upregulated genes were studied. We identified several new genes that were implicated in the detoxification and metabolism of TNT by Populus. In particular, our results support the 2 ̆ 2 green liver 2 ̆ 2 model of different gene families being expressed during the time course experiments. This suggests an alignment with Phase I transformation, Phase II conjugation, and Phase III compartmentation processes. Many of the genes identified in this study were related to those significantly expressed in previous Arabidopsis studies, supporting the comparison between these two plants. Gene families represented as significant in this study were glucosyltransferases, glycosyltransferases, cytochromes, and phosphofructokinases. We saw patterns in the areas of respiration, citric acid cycle, shikimatic pathway, and toxic responses...|$|R
