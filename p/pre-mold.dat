In terms of technical specifications, the success {{of each of these}} methods depends on the bond’s strength and in terms of economic, the production method is important. In this study, the aim is to study the strength and microstructure of steel-bronze thrust bearing bond that has been produced through the casting using <b>pre-mold.</b> In this study, in order to bond, the raw metals are chemically washed with sulfuric acid solution for five minutes at first. Then, the molten bronze SAE 660 is cast in a structural steel S 235 JR <b>pre-mold.</b> The bond’s strength has been measured using the shear test three times; the measurement of bond’s length has been done using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The results indicate that the strength of the bond is at least 94. 8 MPa and bond’s length is 0. 45 micrometers. Therefore, this method was successful for trust bearing application...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{sandwich}} composites made of {{syntactic foam}} core and paper skin were developed as potential building materials. Interface bonding between core and skin {{was controlled by}} varying starch content. Two different microsphere size groups were employed for syntactic foam core manufacturing based on the <b>pre-mold</b> processing method. Properties of skin paper with starch adhesive on {{were found to be}} affected by drying time of starch adhesive. Mechanical behavior of manufactured sandwich composites in relation with properties of constituent materials was studied. Skin paper contributed to increase up to 40 % in estimated flexural strength over syntactic foams, depending on starch content in adhesive between syntactic foam core and paper skin. Small microsphere size group for syntactic foam core was found to be advantageous in strengthening of sandwich composites for a given starch content in adhesive. This finding was in agreement with calculated values of estimated shear stress at interface between skin and core. Failure process of the sandwich composites was discussed in relation with load–deflection curves. Cracking of syntactic foam core was detected to be the first event in sandwich composite failure sequence. Hygroscopic behavior of syntactic foam panels was investigated. Moisture content in the foam was measured to be high for high starch content in the foam panels. No significant moisture effect on flexural strength of syntactic foam panels after being subjected to moisture about 2 months was found for both microsphere size groups. However, substantial decrease (28 %) in flexural modulus was found for the foam panels made of large microspheres although not much moisture effect was found on that of small microspheres. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{simple method}} was devised to {{fabricate}} and anchor organosiloxane coatings along low-surface-energy plastics {{without resorting to}} chemical pre-treatment of the polymer surface. Polypropylene tubes were purposely distended by exposure to toluene-based solutions. An established solvent of many organic polymers and compounds, toluene not only perfused into the plastic via gradual intercalation of accessible polymer chains, but it also facilitated the entry of less compatible reagents as co-perfusates. The reagents, typically aminoalkyl si lanes, were activated either concomitant to perfitsion of polypro-pylene or during a subsequent hydrolysis step. Freed silanol groups, interacting along and beneath the Surface of the plastic, reacted to form a network held together by siloxane bonds. The type of network formed and presented herein was interpreted as an amorphous aminopropylsiloxane-silanol hydrate film, with overall thickness partially submerged and caught in the matrix of the plastic. This concept to intertwine a growing organosiloxane network and a compliant matrix precluded the conventional methods normally used to improve bonding on hydrophobic plastics. A comparison of ninhydrin color yields suggested that films were more effectively and conveniently synthesized when aminopropyltri-methoxysilane was applied in water-saturated toluene.

5000|$|Formally called [...] "encapsulation", potting {{consists}} of immersing the part or assembly in a liquid resin, then curing it. Potting {{can be done}} in a <b>pre-molded</b> potting shell, or directly in a mold. Today it is most widely used to protect semiconductor components from moisture and mechanical damage, and to serve as a mechanical structure holding the lead frame and the chip together. In earlier times it was often used to discourage reverse engineering of proprietary products built as printed circuit modules. It is also commonly used in high voltage products to allow live parts to be placed closer together, so that the product can be smaller. This also excludes dirt and conductive contaminants (such as impure water) from sensitive areas. Another use is to protect deep-submergence items such as sonar transducers from collapsing under extreme pressure, by filling all voids. Potting can be rigid or soft. When void-free potting is required, it is common practice to place the product in a vacuum chamber while the resin is still liquid, hold a vacuum for several minutes to draw the air out of internal cavities and the resin itself, then release the vacuum. Atmospheric pressure collapses the voids and forces the liquid resin into all internal spaces. Vacuum potting works best with resins that cure by polymerization, rather than solvent evaporation.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of movement activities and alternative fitting procedures on protection levels afforded by four hearing pro-tection devices (HPDs). Psychophysical attenuation measurements at nine one-third-octave bands from 125 to 8000 Hz were obtained prior to, during, and fol-lowing a 2 -hr wearing stint that included periods of either highly kinematic but controlled work activity or vigorous temporomandibular movement. The 40 sub-jects, who were nonusers of HPDs, initially fit the protectors according to either the instructions on the package (i. e., subject fit) or after receiving interactive train-ing on proper fit (i. e., trained fit). Thereafter no further protector adjustments were allowed during the wearing period. The subject-fit condition resulted in signifi-cantly lower protection levels, from 4 to 14 dB, at 1000 Hz and below for a <b>pre-molded</b> polymer earplug, a user-molded foam earplug, and a double protector consisting of a muff over the foam plug. The muff alone was significantly more resilient to fitting effects on attenuation than were the plugs. Movement activity caused up to a 6 -dB significant reduction in frequency-specific attenuation over time for the premolded plug, muff, and muff-plug combination. The compliant foam earplug was largely resistant to either type of movement effect but did ben-efit more than the other devices from use of the trained-fit procedure.

40|$|One {{significant}} {{challenge facing}} biosensor development is packaging. For {{surface acoustic wave}} based biosensors, packaging influences the general sensing performance. The acoustic wave is generated and received thanks to interdigital transducers and the separation between the transducers defines the sensing area. Liquids used in biosensing experiments lead to an attenuation of the acoustic signal while {{in contact with the}} transducers. We have developed a liquid cell based on photodefinable epoxy SU- 8 that prevents the presence of liquid on the transducers, has a small disturbance effect on the propagation of the acoustic wave, does not interfere with the biochemical sensing event, and leads to an integrated sensor system with reproducible properties. The liquid cell is achieved in two steps. In a first step, the SU- 8 is precisely patterned around the transducers to define 120 mu m thick walls. In a second step and after the dicing of the sensors, a glass capping is placed manually and glued on top of the SU- 8 walls. This design approach is an improvement compared to the more classical solution consisting of a <b>pre-molded</b> cell that must be pressed against the device in order to avoid leaks, with negative consequences on the reproducibility of the experimental results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by protein adsorption monitoring. The packaging materials do not interfere with the biomolecules and have a high chemical resistance. For future developments, wafer level bonding of the quartz capping onto the SU- 8 walls is envisioned. Anglai...|$|R

The <b>pre-molded</b> commercial mesh kits are expensive and not always available. Alternative effective and safe treatment ways, with lower costs are desirable. Objective To present long term follow-up of patients treated with a homemade mesh shape to correct high stage prolapses. Materials and Methods We describe prospectively 18 patients with anterior and apical vaginal prolapses, stages III and IV, repaired using this specific design of mesh. All patients were submitted to pre-operative clinical evaluation and urodynamics. Prolapse was classified using the pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q). Intervention Prolapse surgery, using a six arms prolene mesh, through a single anterior vaginal incision. Outcome Measurements: POP-Q, patients satisfaction, descriptive statistical analysis. Results Between February 2009 and Oct 2010, 18 consecutive women underwent the above-mentioned surgery. Mean age was 68 years. At a mean follow-up of., 4 years (5 to 5. 8 years), 16 (89 %) patients were continent, mean Ba point came from + 4. 7 cm to - 2. 5 cm, mean C point from + 2. 8 cm to - 6. 6 cm and mean Bp point from + 1. 3 to - 1. 7 cm.

40|$|A {{human factors}} {{experiment}} employed a hemi-anechoic sound {{field in which}} listeners were required to localize a vehicular backup alarm warning signal (both a standard and a frequency-augmented alarm) in 360 -degrees azimuth in pink noise of 60 dBA and 90 dBA. Measures of localization performance included: (1) percentage correct localization, (2) percentage of right [...] left localization errors, (3) percentage of front-rear localization errors, and (4) localization absolute deviation in degrees from the alarm′s actual location. In summary, the data demonstrated that, with some exceptions, normal hearing listeners′ ability to localize the backup alarm in 360 -degrees azimuth did not improve when wearing augmented hearing protectors (including dichotic sound transmission earmuffs, flat attenuation earplugs, and level-dependent earplugs) as compared to when wearing conventional passive earmuffs or earplugs of the foam or flanged types. Exceptions were that in the 90 dBA pink noise, the flat attenuation earplug yielded significantly better accuracy than the polyurethane foam earplug and both the dichotic and the custom-made diotic electronic sound transmission earmuffs. However, the flat attenuation earplug showed no benefit over the standard <b>pre-molded</b> earplug, the arc earplug, and the passive earmuff. Confusions of front-rear alarm directions were most significant in the 90 dBA noise condition, wherein two types of triple-flanged earplugs exhibited significantly fewer front-rear confusions than either of the electronic muffs. On all measures, the diotic sound transmission earmuff resulted in the poorest localization {{of any of the}} protectors {{due to the fact that}} its single-microphone design did not enable interaural cues to be heard. Localization was consistently more degraded in the 90 dBA pink noise as compared with the relatively quiet condition of the 60 dBA pink noise. A frequency-augmented backup alarm, which incorporated 400 Hz and 4000 Hz components to exploit the benefits of interaural phase and intensity cues respectively, slightly but significantly improved localization compared with the standard, more narrow-bandwidth backup alarm, and these results have implications for the updating of backup alarm standards...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that the {{reliability}} of using laboratory measurements to predict individual or even group hearing protector attenuation for occupationally exposed workers is quite poor. This makes it difficult to properly assign hearing protectors when one wishes to closely match attenuation to actual exposure. An alternative is the use of field-measurement methods, a number of which have been proposed and are beginning to be implemented. We examine one of those methods, namely the field microphone-in-real-ear (F-MIRE) approach in which a dual-element microphone probe is used to measure noise reduction by quickly sampling the difference in noise levels outside and under an earplug, with appropriate adjustments to predict real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT). We report on experiments that validate the ability of one commercially available F-MIRE device to predict the REAT of an earplug fitted identically for two tests. Results are reported on a representative roll-down foam earplug, stemmed-style pod plug, and <b>pre-molded</b> earplug, demonstrating that the 95 % confidence level of the Personal Attenuation Rating (PAR) as a function of the number of fits varies from ± 4. 4 dB to ± 6. 3 dB, depending on the plug type, which can be reduced to ± 3. 1 dB to ± 4. 5 dB with a single repeat measurement. The added measurement improves precision substantially. However, the largest portion of the error is due to the user′s fitting variability and not the uncertainty of the measurement system. Further we evaluated the inherent uncertainty of F-MIRE vs. the putative "gold standard" REAT procedures finding, that F-MIRE measurement uncertainty is less than one-half that of REAT at most test frequencies. An American National Standards Institute (ANSI) working group (S 12 /WG 11) is currently involved in developing methods similar to those in this paper so that procedures for evaluating and reporting uncertainty on all types of field attenuation measurement systems can be standardized. We conclude that the hearing conservationist now has available a portable, convenient, quick, and easy-to-use system that can improve training and motivation of employees, assign hearing protection devices based on noise exposures, and address other management and compliance issues...|$|R

The BONEFOAM network strives for sustainability and innovation basing on new partnerships, interdisciplinary approaches, combination of novel and conventional processes and specific research activities within the general topic of health and well-being. This particular contribution is about recent developments of ceramic parts and ceramic-metal composites at the Fraunhofer IKTS (Dresden) for possible applications in the field of biomedical technology. Currently, the so-called freeze-foaming method, for achieving open porous and mainly interconnected foam structures, was combined with an Additive Manufacturing process (i. e. DLM/LCM technique) which provides personalized and/or complex structures which also serve as <b>pre-molds.</b> After a co-sintering step, composite structures were achieved which combine the advantages of dense and porous features in one single part. These novel, potential bone replacement structures might serve as possible next generation bioceramics/-composites used for personalized implants which, additionally, allow a structural adaption according to the customer's needs. In another project, by tape casting, lamination and a later co-sintering step, metal-ceramic composites were obtained which can be used for an application in the medical technology. As possible bipolar scissors, the ceramic layer is made of zirconia (TZ- 3 Y-E) and features biocompatibility whereas the other layer consists of 17 - 4 PH steel providing electrical conductivity. Thus on the one hand, the scissor’s edge stays sharp (features of zirconia) and bleedings can be stopped right from the beginning by the applied electrical current in the metal layer. The aim of a further project is to develop a miniature button-sized device for a medical application. By tape casting, lamination and a later co-sintering step, metal (17 - 4 PH steel) -ceramic (ZrO 2, TZ- 3 Y-E) composite tapes were obtained which, after a final deep-drawing process, resulted in the desired part the size of a few millimeters in diameter.
