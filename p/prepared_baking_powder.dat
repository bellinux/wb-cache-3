50|$|Calumet <b>Baking</b> <b>Powder</b> Company was an American food company {{established}} in 1889 in Chicago, Illinois, by <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> salesman William Monroe Wright. His newly formulated double-acting <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> took {{its name from}} the French-derived, colonial-era word for a Native American ceremonial pipe, given to the lands now known as Calumet City, Illinois.

50|$|Commercial <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> {{formulations}} {{are different}} from domestic ones, although the principles remain the same. Instead of sodium aluminum sulfate, commercial <b>baking</b> <b>powders</b> use sodium acid pyrophosphate {{as one of the}} two acidic components.|$|R
5000|$|Eben Horsford {{probably}} is best remembered today for reformulating <b>baking</b> <b>powder.</b> Previously, <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> had contained <b>baking</b> soda and cream of tartar. Horsford replaced {{the cream of}} tartar with the more reliable calcium biphosphate (also known as calcium acid phosphate and many other names). He did this a little earlier than August Oetker. In 1854, Horsford, with partner George Wilson, formed the [...] Rumford Chemical Works. They named it after the title of Horsford's position at Harvard. It was in that enterprise that Horsford created his commercially successful <b>baking</b> <b>powder.</b> Horsford's development of <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in 2006.|$|R
50|$|While various <b>baking</b> <b>powders</b> {{were sold}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, the modern {{variants}} in use today were discovered by Alfred Bird in 1843. August Oetker, a German pharmacist, made <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> very popular when he began selling his mixture to housewives. The recipe he created in 1891 is still sold as Backin in Germany. Oetker started the mass production of <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> in 1898 and patented his technique in 1903.|$|R
50|$|In 1891, {{at the age}} of 29, Wrigley {{moved from}} Philadelphia to Chicago. He had $32 to his name and with it he formed a {{business}} to sell Wrigley's Scouring Soap. He offered customers small premiums, particularly <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> as an incentive to buy his soap. Finding the <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> was more popular than his soap, Wrigley switched to selling <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> and giving his customers two packages of chewing gum for each can of <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> they purchased. Again, Wrigley found that the premium he offered was more popular than his base product, and his company began to concentrate on the manufacture and sale of chewing gum. In this business, Wrigley made his name and fortune.|$|R
25|$|Many {{forms of}} <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> contain sodium {{bicarbonate}} combined with calcium acid phosphate, sodium aluminium phosphate or cream of tartar. Baking soda is alkaline; the acid used in <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> avoids a metallic taste when the chemical change during baking creates sodium carbonate.|$|R

5000|$|Clabber Girl is a {{brand of}} <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> <b>baking</b> soda, and corn starch popular in the United States. It is {{manufactured}} by Hulman & Company, which also owns and operates the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and INDYCAR, the sanctioning body for American open-wheel racing. The brand also owns the Rumford <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> label. The Clabber Girl name brand comes from the word [...] "clabber", a synonym of sour milk. In the early 1800s, people mixed clabber with pearl ash, soda, cream of tartar, {{and a few other}} ingredients to make what we know today as <b>baking</b> <b>powder.</b> The first <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> brand by Hulman and company was the [...] "Milk Brand". In 1899, it was changed to the [...] "Clabber Brand". In 1923, the company changed the name to [...] "Clabber Girl".|$|R

50|$|<b>Baking</b> <b>powders</b> are {{available}} both {{with and without}} aluminium compounds.Some people prefer not to use <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> with aluminium because they believe it gives food a vaguely metallic taste and aluminium is not an essential mineral. Others object because of possible health concerns associated with aluminium intake. In 2015, Cook's Country, an American TV show and magazine, evaluated six <b>baking</b> <b>powders</b> marketed to consumers. They reported that 30% of their testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminum.|$|R

40|$|How did a {{mid-nineteenth century}} American invention, <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> replace yeast as a {{leavening}} agent {{and create a}} culinary revolution as profound {{as the use of}} yeast thousands of years ago?The approach was two-pronged and gendered: business archives, U. S. government records and lawsuits revealed how <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> was created, marketed, and regulated. Women’s diaries and cookbooks—personal, corporate, community, ethnic—from the eighteenth century to internet blogs showed the use women made of the new technology of <b>baking</b> <b>powder.</b> American exceptionalism laid the groundwork for the <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> revolution. Unlike Europe, with a history of communal ovens and male-dominated bakers’ guilds, in the United States bread baking was the duty of women. In the North, literate women without slave labor to do laborious, day-long yeast bread baking experimented with chemical shortcuts. Beginning in 1856, professional male chemists patented various formulas for <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> which were not standardized. Of the 534 <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> companies in the U. S., four main companies—Rumford, Royal, Calumet, and Clabber Girl—fought advertising, trade, legislative, scientific, and judicial wars for market primacy, using proprietary cookbooks, lawsuits, trade cards, and bribes. In the process, they altered or created cake, cupcakes, cookies, biscuits, pancakes, quick breads, waffles, doughnuts, and other foods, and forged a distinct American culinary identity. <b>Baking</b> <b>powder</b> made baked goods cheaper to prepare and shortened their cooking time radically. This new American chemical leavening shortcut also changed the breadstuffs of Native Americans, African Americans, and every immigrant group and was a force for assimilation. The wars continued in spite of scandals exposed by muckraking journalists and investigation by President Theodore Roosevelt, through WWI, the 1920 s, the Depression, and WWII in every state and territory in the United States until standardization finally occurred {{at the end of the}} twentieth century. Now, <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> is used by global businesses such as McDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin’ Donuts, International House of Pancakes, and in home and commercial kitchens around the world. The legacies left by <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> fortunes include endowed chairs at Harvard and Yale; and the Indianapolis 500 and Triple Crown horse racing winners...|$|R

5000|$|During World War II, Byron H. Smith, an {{inventor}} in Bangor, Maine (U.S.), created a substitute product for American housewives, who {{were unable to}} obtain cream of tartar or <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> due to war food shortages. Under the name [...] "Bakewell", Smith marketed a mixture of sodium pyrophosphate mixed with corn starch to replace the acid cream of tartar component of <b>baking</b> <b>powder.</b> When mixed with baking soda, the product behaved like a single-acting <b>baking</b> <b>powder,</b> the only difference being that the acid is sodium acid pyrophosphate. A similar product is marketed today, under the name Bakewell Cream.|$|R

50|$|<b>Baking</b> <b>powder</b> is a dry {{chemical}} leavening agent, {{a mixture of}} a carbonate or bicarbonate and a weak acid and is used for increasing the volume and lightening the texture of baked goods. <b>Baking</b> <b>powder</b> works by releasing carbon dioxide gas into a batter or dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus leavening the mixture.|$|R
50|$|In baking breads, {{cakes and}} cookies, sodium {{aluminum}} sulfate (SAS) {{is used as}} an ingredient in <b>baking</b> <b>powder</b> as a second acting agent. SAS is activated at baking temperatures and reacts with <b>baking</b> <b>powder's</b> sodium bicarbonate (<b>baking</b> soda) to create carbon dioxide gas bubbles that helps leaven the baked items. The uses of SAS is seen by some consumers as a health concern.|$|R
