40|$|The recent move to in situ {{conservation}} management world-wide {{is supported}} by, and stems from the 1992 International Convention on Biological Diversity. The Department of Conservation - charged with the conservation of New Zealand's natural resources - has directed efforts towards the restoration of natural processes as an avenue to halt local biodiversity decline. Ecosystem, habitat, and nature restoration programmes such as the Boundary Stream Mainland Island Project (BSMIP) represent the forefront of conservation management, combining intensive multi-species pest control, with broad-scale hierarchical <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> confer information that is intended to support decision-making and management by the reduction of uncertainty, or by increasing knowledge. The validity of <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> depends on three key parts; the guiding objectives, biological relevance, and statistical reliability. Seven major long-term <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> established at the BSMIP were evaluated {{according to the above}} criteria. All <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> had appropriate guiding objectives, and were biologically relevant (outcome and result monitoring were balanced respective {{to each other and to}} the restoration intervention and efforts at BSMIP). The statistical reliability of the programmes was appraised with the use of the Computer <b>programme</b> <b>MONITOR,</b> which provided a calculated value for the statistical power of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes.</b> All <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> except two (Lizard monitoring: which was initially designed as a short-term species survey, and Mustelid monitoring: which would be a good candidate for a double sampling methodology) had a robust design (evaluated using the actual initial data, and conservative criteria for the detection of population change). The <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> that did achieve a level of statistical robustness, provided a statistical power of 0. 8 (80 %) within appropriate timeframes for restoration of ecosystem processes (e. g. the timeframe for detection of a 10 % change in the abundance, density, relative index, etc of the Result monitoring programmes: Rodents = three years, Possums = six years, and Outcome monitoring programmes: Weta = five years, Ground Invertebrates = four years, Birds (species nos.) = four years, Vegetation (Species, and sapling nos.) = 15 years). The guiding objectives for <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> must have clear, specific, measurable, and achievable goals, in-order to identify appropriate variables, in both spatial and temporal scales. The biological relevance or "linkage" between monitored groups is important and must be at least outlined, for <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> to be able to identify potential cause and effect. Statistical reliability (the balance between statistical significance, statistical power, and the timeframe for a conclusive result to be determined) is important, as it is the key method of detecting change.

Civil service which was the main employer in the past is now saturated and private sector is still only beginning. The programme aims to help self-starters in business. It also aims to help develop a responsible and sustainable entrepreneurial culture in Bhutan, inspired by the visionary and altruistic Bodhisattva ideals.

40|$|Thesis (MPhil) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Literature on {{monitoring}} and evaluation acknowledges the complexity in the field. Many evaluation studies require empirical evidence to be integrated with decisions on standards and values to reach robust evaluative conclusions. In this context, organizations face a number of difficulties in attempting to develop computerized software for {{monitoring and}} evaluating their programmes. The situation is exacerbated {{by the lack of}} literature on how various concepts used in <b>programme</b> <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation could be arranged into a coherent pattern of concepts upon which the development of {{monitoring and evaluation}} software could be contingent. The aim of this thesis is to present a conceptual model for a <b>programme</b> <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation information system that can guide programme agencies in the procurement, design and development of software for <b>programme</b> <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation. The conceptual model is based on an assessment of several key concepts that characterize <b>programme</b> <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation: programme goals and objectives; programme activities; programme providers; administrators; funders; community stakeholders; macro-environment and relationship between them; personal goals and objectives; existing conditions; targeted individual (s); family friends, and community; macro-environment and relationships between them; programme participation and programme outcomes. Using purposive techniques, 15 relevant monitoring and evaluation documents were selected from within 3 large-scale programmes implemented in Uganda. These documents were used to identify and describe the features and attributes associated with each of the key M&E concepts. The findings reveal that only eleven of the key concepts listed above were used by the three case study programmes. In particular, their use was geared mainly towards the collection of empirical evidence to demonstrate programme accountability requirements. The study arranged the eleven distinctions into a framework comprising of three dimensions: (1) programme design; (2) programme implementation plan; and (3) programme implementation result. The programme design dimension comprises of five key concepts used to capture the essential information on programme design. The implementation plan dimension comprises of three key concepts used to capture the essential information on the actions that have been planned by each programme. The implementation result comprises of four key concepts that capture the essential information on the outcome of both routine and terminal monitoring and evaluation activities...|$|E
