40|$|Background: Tree nut allergy is {{characterized}} by a high frequency of life-threatening reactions and is typically lifelong persistent. Some people with a <b>pistachio</b> nut allergy, which is common in the <b>pistachio</b> rich area of Iran, develop a hypersensitivity to other tree nuts as well. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence of <b>pistachio</b> nut allergy in Iran, the major <b>pistachio</b> cultivation region in the world. The study also addressed the presence of allergenic cross-reactivity between <b>pistachio</b> and other nuts, including almond, peanut, and cashew in <b>pistachio</b> allergic patients. Methods: A survey was conducted to determine whether the prevalence of <b>pistachio</b> allergy is affected by exposure to this nut in <b>pistachio</b> cultivation regions, as well as possible cross-reactivity between <b>pistachio</b> and other nuts including cashew, almond, and peanut. Inhibition Western blot and inhibition ELISA studies were conducted to assess the presence of allergenic cross-reactivity between <b>pistachio</b> and the other tree nuts. Results: Our results revealed that the prevalence of <b>pistachio</b> allergy is twice as much in <b>pistachio</b> cultivation regions than other areas. Western blotting and inhibition ELISA presented high percentages of inhibition with <b>pistachio</b> and cashew, followed by almond and, to some degree, peanut which indicates different levels of aller- genic cross-reactivity. Conclusions: The results indicate that exposure of people to <b>pistachio</b> significantly affects the prevalence of its allergic reactions. In addition, it was observed that, among <b>pistachio</b> allergic subjects, such exposure may affect the co-sensitivities with other nuts, including cashew and almond. The plant taxonomic classification of <b>pistachio</b> and other tree nuts does appear to predict allergenic cross-reactivity...|$|R

30|$|<b>Pistachio</b> is {{globally}} valuable {{due to its}} nutritional value, economic significance, {{and important}} role in health (Kashaninejad and Tabil 2011). Kerman Province (in {{the southern part of}} Iran) is the largest pistachio-producing area in Iran (FAO 2016). The specific climatic conditions for the cultivation of <b>pistachio</b> (such as wilderness and dry areas with long and hot summers, cold winters, and low-quality soil, and salted water) have resulted in the spread of pests in <b>pistachio</b> orchards (Hosseinifard et al. 2008). Many phytophagous (herbivore) arthropod pests attack <b>pistachio</b> trees, causing considerable damages to the crop (Zohdi et al. 2015). Among these pests, the common <b>pistachio</b> psyllid (CPP), Agonoscena pistaciae Burckhardt and Lauterer (Psyllidae), is the most adverse pest which was first reported on <b>pistachio</b> trees in Iran by Kiriukhin (1946) (Mehrnejad 2001).|$|R
40|$|Green skin (hull) of <b>pistachio</b> fruits is {{a barrier}} against the {{penetration}} of fungi and insects into the kernel of <b>pistachio.</b> Splitting of husk facilitates {{the entry of}} fungi and infection of <b>pistachio</b> kernels during the harvest. So far no effective way has been reported for controlling this problem. To evaluate the effects of gibberellic acid on hull spliting the present research was conducted in a commercial orchard of <b>pistachio</b> during 2001 - 2002 in Rafsanjan, Iran. Gibberellic acid (GA 3) at 0, 25, 50 and 100 mg – 1 was applied on 25 -year-old of “Owhadi” <b>pistachio</b> cultivar. Two branches of each tree was sprayed during two years of study. GA 3 at 25, 50 and 100 mg – 1 significantly reduced hull splitting and penetration by Aspergillus spp. into <b>pistachio</b> fruits. There was {{a positive correlation between}} the hull splitting and fungi penetration (r= 0. 92 *). The exocarp, mesocarp and endocarp of <b>pistachio</b> fruits cultured on selective medium of Aspergillus spp. showed no infection of <b>pistachio</b> kernel by Aspergillus spp. The highest concentration of aflatoxin was detected in the kernel of non-treated fruits (6. 25 ppb) and the lowest (0. 5 ppb) fruits treated by GA 3. GA 3 reduced husk slippery of <b>pistachio</b> fruits at harvest. The rate of husk slippery was reduced by increasing the concentration of GA 3. Gibberellic acid treatments had no significant effect on dehiscence, weight of 100 fruits, total soluble solids, but significantly increased fat and chlrophyll content of kernel of <b>pistachio</b> fruits. The results of the study is recommended for commerical <b>pistachio</b> production in Iran...|$|R
5|$|Kanafeh is {{the most}} famed Nabulsi sweet. Originating in Nablus during the 15th century, by 1575, its recipe was {{exported}} throughout the Ottoman Empire — which controlled Palestine at the time. Kanafeh is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed <b>pistachios.</b> Though it is now made throughout the Middle East, to the present day, kanafeh Nabulsi enjoys continued fame, partly due to its use of a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi.

5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are red meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, <b>pistachios,</b> tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, <b>pistachio</b> {{production}} and trade and influential factors on its exports in Iran and the USA are compared the the. Using the annual data from 1970 to 2011; this study aimed {{to analyze the}} effects of <b>pistachio</b> price {{and the effects of}} food security. Moreover, the relationship between exchange rate and <b>pistachio</b> export in the Iranian economy was analyzed through examining a non linear relation between the two factors. Therefore, the hypothesis validation upon nonlinearity relationship between exchange rate and <b>pistachio</b> export was analyzed using smooth transition autoregressive model (STAR). The results of smooth transition model (STAR) show that there is a nonlinear Granger causality between exchange rate and <b>pistachio</b> export and vice versa. It is therefore recommended,in order to determine the threshold level of potential benefits of <b>pistachio</b> exports, the existence of the nonlinear relationship between the dynamic exchange rate and <b>pistachio</b> exports should be considered. Furthermore, in order to maintain market share in the international level, understanding target markets of export and achieving complete information upon the position of the major competitors in the production and trade of <b>Pistachio</b> is essential...|$|R

5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), <b>pistachios</b> (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cashew nut, <b>pistachio</b> nut and mango {{belong to}} the Anacardiaceae family and are botanically related. Therefore, cashew nut sensitised {{children}} are frequently advised to eliminate cashew nuts and <b>pistachio</b> nuts from their diet. The ‘Improvement of Diagnostic mEthods for ALlergy assessment (IDEAL trial number NTR 3572) study showed that cashew nut sensitised children were co-sensitised to <b>pistachio</b> nut in 98 % of cases and to mango in 21 % of cases. The aim of this follow-up study to IDEAL is to assess the clinical relevance of co-sensitisation to <b>pistachio</b> nut and mango in cashew nut sensitised children. Methods: Children were recruited from the study: ‘Improvement of Diagnostic mEthods for ALlergy assessment (IDEAL trial number NTR 3572). Inclusion criterion for the IDEAL study was sensitization to cashew nut as demonstrated by either SPT or sIgE, and a clinical history of reactions to cashew nuts or no previous (known) exposure. Sensitized children who were tolerant to cashew nuts were excluded. Inclusion criterion for this IDEAL follow-up study was co-sensitization to <b>pistachio</b> nut, regardless {{the result of the}} DBPCFC with cashew nut. In this follow-up study a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge with <b>pistachio</b> nut and an open food challenge with mango were performed. Results: Twenty-nine children (mean age of 11. 6 years, 62 % male) were included. <b>Pistachio</b> nut sensitisation was clinically relevant in only 34 % of cashew-sensitised children and only 31 % of cashew challenge positive children. None of the children was challenge positive to mango. Conclusion: Although co-sensitisation between cashew nut and <b>pistachio</b> nut was observed in 98 %, <b>pistachio</b> nut sensitisation was only clinically relevant in 34 % of the children. Therefore, a challenge test with <b>pistachio</b> nut is recommended in children with cashew nut and <b>pistachio</b> nut sensitisation. </p...|$|R
