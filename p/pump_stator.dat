The stator rubber bushing {{is not only a}} damageable element, but also the key component deciding the service life and efficiency of the pump. Up to date, none effective method has been found for testing the deformation and enforced state of the stator’s rubber under the real working condition. For the general conventional screw stator with uniform internal pressure {{at both ends of the}} stator bushing enforced and deformed almost the same, as to other case when the cone screw <b>pump</b> <b>stator</b> has rubbers with different cross-sectional size and thickness at its different end, the enforcing and deforming state at different end varies differently. The stator of the opposed biconinal cone screw hydraulic pump is studied in this paper for the case when the stator is uniformly enforced, using finite element analyzing software ANSYS-Workbench, this study concluded the stress, the strain and inner-figure deformation of the screw hydraulic <b>pump</b> <b>stator,</b> the stator rubber and the stator steel thimble.

40|$|Abstract: The {{possibility}} of {{application of the}} advanced hypertrochoid curve in the inner surface of the stator of fixed displacement hydraulic vane pump, theoretically was studied in the last our work. By considering the properties of this curve, sealing action between pressure and suction sides of the pump can be improved. One of the important characteristics of a new profile must be improving of the inertial reaction of the vanes in each position where these vanes have a radial movement because it causes a smooth sliding motion of the vanes and hence, a higher performance of the pump while attaining a longer life of it. Then at this paper, {{the effect of the}} inertial force of the vanes on the performance of the pump with this curve will be studied. The regular motion of the vanes on the inner surface of the stator with smooth profile suppresses the lateral reactional force applied to the vanes and results to diminish local wear of the vanes tip and noise.

Also {{the effect of the}} inertial force of the vanes on the performance of the pump with this curve, a theoretical analysis of the internal pressure distribution in the pump and of the resulting forces and torques applied to its components were studied. This study presents the possibility of application of the advanced hypertrochoid curve in the inner surface of its stator. By using this curve in the inner surface of the stator, we are desirous of improving a sealing action between pressure and suction sides of the pump, in addition to improving of the inertial reaction of the vanes in each position where these vanes have a radial movement because, it causes a smooth sliding motion of the vanes and hence, a higher performance of the pump while attaining a longer life of it because of decreasing vane- tip and inner surface of stator wear and decreasing of vibration, noise and high stresses.

40|$|April 2006, page 1) briefly dis-cussed {{recovery}} considerations specific {{for heavy}} oils, particularly the large yields from some foamy oil reservoirs. Like foamy oil, sand pro-duction (simultaneous extraction of sand {{along with the}} oil) —the subject {{of this part of}} the article—has been associated with enhanced heavy oil recovery. Also as with foamy oil, sand production is not well understood mathematically, and the petroleum industry is attempting to evalu-ate its impact on reservoir performance, in terms of both well deliverability and ultimate recovery. Sand: Control and Exploitation Sand long represented little more than a costly problem and a safety hazard for the petroleum industry. Sand-related problems include: ■ erosion of equipment, such as valves, <b>pump</b> <b>stators,</b> tubing, and surface pipes; ■ subsidence of the reservoir matrix and collapse of casings; ■ blocked tubing assemblies and plugged surface facilities, leading to well blockage; ■ decreased conductivity of the reservoir matrix and, consequently, reduced efficiency of oil recovery; ■ need for disposal procedures; and ■ need for extensive work to replace or repair equipment and clean wells. Many techniques have been developed to prevent the mobilization of sand—that is, to control it. These techniques range from chemical con-solidation (e. g., via the injection of resin) to physical exclusion (via slotted liners, prepacked screens, and gravel pack placement). Use of thes...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} reporting period, modifications were completed for integrating a continuous wax filtration {{system for a}} 4 liter slurry bubble column reactor. During the current reporting period, a shakedown of the system was completed. Several problems were encountered with the progressive cavity pump used to circulate the wax/catalyst slurry though the cross-flow filter element and reactor. During the activation of the catalyst with elevated temperature (> 270 C) the elastomer <b>pump</b> <b>stator</b> released sulfur thereby totally deactivating the iron-based catalyst. Difficulties in maintaining an acceptable leak rate from the pump seal and stator housing were also encountered. Consequently, the system leak rate exceeded the expected production rate of wax; therefore, no online filtration could be accomplished. Work continued regarding the characterization of ultra-fine catalyst structures. The effect of carbidation on the morphology of iron hydroxide oxide particles {{was the focus of}} the study during this reporting period. Oxidation of Fe (II) sulfate results in predominantly {gamma}-FeOOH particles which have a rod-shaped (nano-needles) crystalline structure. Carbidation of the prepared {gamma}-FeOOH with CO at atmospheric pressure produced iron carbides with spherical layered structure.

40|$|It {{is common}} for an oil well to produce a mixture of {{hydrocarbons}} that flash when exposed to atmospheric pressure. The separation {{of oil and gas}} mixtures on site may prove expensive and lead to higher infrastructure and maintenance costs as well. A multiphase pump offers a good alternative with a lower capital cost and increased overall production. A Progressive Cavity Pump (PCP) is a positive displacement pump type {{that can be used to}} pump a wide range of multiphase mixtures, including high viscosity fluids with entrained gas and solid particles in suspension. Despite its advantages, a PCP has a reduced ability to handle high gas-liquid ratios due to limitations of its elastomeric stator material required to overcome thermo and mechanical effects. Also the efficiency decreases significantly with increases in gas volume fractions and reduced differential pressures. The current study focuses on studying the behavior of this unique pump in a wide range of GVFs and studying the effect of this ratio on overall efficiency, temperature and pressure distribution on the stator. The pump exhibits vibration issues at specific differential pressures and they have been studied in this work. This can be of critical value as severe vibration issues can damage the pump components such as couplings and bearings leading to high maintenance costs. Another important issue addressed by this research is the behavior of this pump in transient conditions. Oil well production is highly unpredictable with unexpected rises and drops in GVFs. These transient conditions have been simulated by varying the GVF over wide ranges and studying the pump's behavior in terms of load, temperature rises and instantaneous pressure profiles on the <b>pump</b> <b>stator.</b> This thesis provides a comprehensive study of this pump, its operating ranges and behavior in off-design conditions to assist oil and gas exploration ventures in making an informed choice in pump selection for their applications based on field conditions...|$|E
40|$|A need {{exists for}} miniaturized, rugged, {{low-cost}} high-vacuum systems. Recent advances in sensor technology {{have led to}} the development of very small mass spectrometer detectors as well as other analytical instruments such as scanning electron microscopes. However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power-hungry. To meet this need, a miniaturized vacuum system was developed based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive-to-manufacture molecular drag pump (MDP). The MDP is enabled by a miniature, very-high-speed (200, 000 rpm), rugged, low-power, brushless DC motor optimized for wide temperature operation and long life. The key advantages of the pump are reduced cost and improved ruggedness compared to other mechanical hig-hvacuum pumps. The machining of the rotor and stators is very simple compared to that necessary to fabricate rotor and stator blades for other pump designs. Also, the symmetry of the rotor is such that dynamic balancing of the rotor will likely not be necessary. Finally, the number of parts in the unit is cut by nearly a factor of three over competing designs. The new pump forms the heart of a complete vacuum system optimized to support analytical instruments in terrestrial applications and on spacecraft and planetary landers. The MDP achieves high vacuum coupled to a ruggedized diaphragm rough pump. Instead of the relatively complicated rotor and stator blades used in turbomolecular pumps, the rotor in the MDP consists of a simple, smooth cylinder of aluminum. This will turn at approximately 200, 000 rpm inside an outer stator housing. The <b>pump</b> <b>stator</b> comprises a cylindrical aluminum housing with one or more specially designed grooves that serve as flow channels. To minimize the length of the pump, the gas is forced down the flow channels of the outer stator to the base of the pump. The gas is then turned and pulled toward the top through a second set of channels cut into an inner stator housing that surrounds the motor. The compressed gas then flows down channels in the motor housing to the exhaust port of the pump. The exhaust port of the pump is connected to a commercially available diaphragm or scroll pump...|$|E

The MDP is enabled by the development of a miniature, veryhigh- speed, rugged, low-power, brushless DC motor optimized for wide temperature operation and long life. Such a pump represents an order-of-magnitude reduction in mass, volume, and cost over current, commercially available, state-ofthe- art vacuum pumps. The vacuum system consists of the MDP coupled to a ruggedized rough pump (for terrestrial applications or for planets with substantial atmospheres). The rotor in the MDP consists of a simple smooth cylinder of aluminum spinning at approximately 200, 000 RPM inside an outer stator housing. The <b>pump</b> <b>stator</b> comprises a cylindrical aluminum housing with one or more specially designed grooves that serve as flow channels. To minimize the length of the pump, the gas is forced down the flow channels of the outer stator to the base of the pump.

The compressed gas then flows down channels in the motor housing to the exhaust port of the pump. The exhaust port of the pump is connected to a diaphragm or scroll pump. This pump delivers very high performance in a very small envelope. The design was simplified so that a smaller compression ratio, easier manufacturing process, and enhanced ruggedness can be achieved at the lowest possible cost. The machining of the rotor and stators is very simple compared to that necessary to fabricate TMP (turbo molecular pump) rotor and stator blades. Also, the symmetry of the rotor is such that dynamic balancing of the rotor is greatly simplified. Finally, because of the simplified design, the number of parts in the unit is cut by nearly a factor of three. In fact, there are only five parts, not counting the motor and off-the-shelf screws and O-rings. This reduces the amount of machining and also makes fit-up much simpler while allowing the maintenance of close tolerances...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressing}} {{cavity pump}} {{is a type}} of positive displacement pump that is capable of moving nearly any fluid. This type of pump transports fluids in a series of discrete cavities formed by the helical geometries of its rigid rotor and elastomeric stator. With appropriate materials for the rotor and stator, this pump can move combinations of liquids, suspended solids, and gasses equally well. Because of its versatility, the progressing cavity pump is widely used in the oil industry to transport mixtures of oil, water, and sediment; this investigation was prompted by a desire to extend the use of progressing cavity pumps to wet gas pumping applications. One of the progressing cavity pump's limitations is that the friction between the rotor and stator can generate enough heat to damage the rotor if the pump is not lubricated and cooled by the process fluid. Conventional wisdom dictates that this type of pump will overheat if it pumps only gas, with no liquid in the process fluid. If a progressing cavity pump is used to boost the output from a wet gas well, it could potentially be damaged if the well's output is too dry {{for an extended period of}} time. This project seeks to determine how a progressing cavity pump behaves when operating at gas volume fractions between 0. 90 and 0. 98. A progressing cavity pump manufactured by seepex, model no. BN 130 - 12, is tested at half and full speed using air-water mixtures with gas volume fractions of 0. 90, 0. 92, 0. 94, 0. 96, and 0. 98. The pump's inlet and outlet conditions are controlled to produce suction pressures of 15, 30, and 45 psi and outlet pressures 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 psi higher than the inlet pressure. A series of thermocouples, pressure transducers, and turbine flow meters measures the pump's inlet and outlet conditions, the flow rates of water and air entering the pump, and pressures and temperatures at four positions within the pump's stator. Over all test conditions, the maximum recorded temperature of the <b>pump</b> <b>stator</b> did not exceed the maximum safe rubber temperature specified by the manufacturer. The pump?s flow rate is independent of both the fluid's gas volume fraction and the pressure difference across the pump, but it increases slightly with the pump's suction pressure. The pump's mechanical load, however, is dependent only on the pressure difference across the pump and increases linearly with that parameter. Pressure measurements within the stator demonstrated that the leakage between the pump's cavities increases with the fluids gas volume fraction, indicating that liquid inside the pump improves its sealing capability. However, those same measurements failed to detect any appreciable leakage between the two pressure taps nearest the pump's inlet. This last observation suggests that the pump could be shortened by as much as 25 percent without losing any performance in the range of tested conditions; shortening the pump should increase its efficiency by decreasing its frictional mechanical load...|$|E

Torque converters are used as coupling devices in automobile powertrains involving automatic transmissions. Efficient modeling of torque converters capturing various modes of operation is important for powertrain design and simulation, (Hroval and Tobler 1, Ishihara and Emori 2) optimization and control applications. Models of torque converters are available in various commercial simulation packages, Hadi et. al. 3. The information {{about the effect of}} model parameters on torque converter performance is valuable for any design operation. In this paper, a symbolic sensitivity analysis of a torque converter model will be presented. Direct differentiation (Serban and Freeman 4) is used to generate the sensitivity equations which results in equations in symbolic form. By solving the sensitivity equations, the effect of a perturbation of the model parameters on the behavior of the system is determined. A parametric importance analysis is performed on the model: the model parameters are arranged according to their effect on the amount loss of energy during the operation of the torque converter. The radii of the <b>pump,</b> turbine and <b>stator,</b> the density of the hydraulic fluid and the exit angle of the vanes of the stator were found to have the most significant effects on the model.

40|$|A {{parts of}} the {{contemporary}} rotary compressors are supported as by revolving crankshaft (rotor, roller, etc.), so by the housing (<b>stator,</b> <b>pump,</b> suction accumulator, etc.). Such dual supporting structure complicates assembly of a compressor due to the necessity of precision axial and radial positioning of the pump parts, motor rotor and stator. Developed novel rotary compressor provides a unitary assembly, in which a rotor of the driver -external rotor electric motor, is integrated with concentrically situated pump and rotatably arranged on stationary crankshaft. Stationary crankshaft is fixedly connected to the hermetic housing and supports as the fixed to it motor stator, so the rotor block and the piston block revolving around it. The single structure supporting the motor stator, the rotor block, the piston block and housing simplifies compressor assembly, and allows precision, reliable setting of the parts due to the common single reference - axial line. The piston block and the rotor block have only one line rolling contact, where tangential velocities of blocks are unidirectional and equal in magnitude. It means that the sliding frictional losses at the line contact are minimal. The frictional losses between the rotor blocks radial surfaces and facing surfaces of the piston block heads are also minimal due to the low relative rubbing speed between synchronously revolving in one direction contacting surfaces. Suction system of the novel rotary compressor excluded direct delivery of the refrigerant to the suction chamber by positioning a suction input cavity and a motor cavity in between the suction intake located {{at the top of}} the housing and suction port inlet {{at the top of the}} motor cavity. The arrangement of a refrigerant delivery eliminates external accumulator, increases the liquid refrigerant storage capacity and provides cooling of the compressor motor during and after its duty cycle. The vapor will be delivered substantially free of liquid refrigerant into the suction chamber under higher pressure (supercharged) due to the action of the impeller positioned in the motor cavity. The rotation of the piston block is due to the distributed forces which have been transmitted from an external rotor of the motor through the direct, no sliding line contact between both blocks and through a mechanical link – vane, which is rigidly fixed in the piston block wall. Another advantage of the novel rotary compressor is that the discharge gas will be tangentially ejected in form of one or more high-speed jets in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation. It creates a reaction forces acting in the direction of rotation and added to the forces revolving the piston block. The design modifications described above, employment of an external rotor motor as a driver, elimination of the roller, reciprocating movement of the vane, vane spring, and external accumulator, utilization of new developed tubular discharge valve improve performance of novel rotary compressor, make it compact, (smaller package space), reliable, and reduce manufacturing cost. *) Dreiman N.
