This paper examines the effects of <b>productivity</b> <b>increases</b> by developing a robust unrestricted error correction model (UECM) of RER based on a class of theories of time-varying equilibrium exchange rates as opposed to the conventional PPP-based theory. An empirical study was carried out on four selected Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. This work suggests that the effects of <b>productivity</b> <b>increases</b> may be more complicated than what the theory suggests and points to the possibility that the Balassa-Samuelson is affected by the stage of economic development rather than mere <b>productivity</b> <b>increases...</b>|$|R

These terms {{refer to a}} {{concentration}} of business, shopping, and entertainment outside a traditional downtown or central business district in what had previously been a residential or rural area. [...] There were several factors contributing {{to the growth of}} these cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston, and Phoenix. [...] The factors that contributed to these large cities include reliable automobiles, highway systems, refrigeration, and agricultural production increases. Large cities such as the ones mentioned above have not been uncommon in history but what separates these cities from the rest are that these cities are not along some natural channel of transport, or at some crossroad of two or more channels such as a trail, harbor, mountain, river, or valley. [...] These large cities have been developed in areas that only a few hundred years ago would have been uninhabitable. Without a cost efficient way of cooling air and transporting water and food great distances these large cities would have never developed. [...] The rapid growth of these cities was influenced by refrigeration and an agricultural <b>productivity</b> <b>increase,</b> allowing more distant farms to effectively feed the population.|$|E
