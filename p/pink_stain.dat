30|$|Of the fungi tested, only P. brumalis {{failed to}} produce {{significant}} amounts of spalting when paired with another culture. Most of the tested fungi were not capable of producing significant levels of spalting alone, but did so when paired together. The most successful fungal pairing was that of S. cuboideum and T. versicolor on maple for zone lines, although as noted above, <b>pink</b> <b>stain</b> production by S. cuboideum occurred only in very small amounts. Both S. cuboideum and T. versicolor {{are known to be}} aggressive, effective spalting fungi under sterile and semi-sterile conditions [9, 10]. As noted in Robinson et al. [9], when paired together, they are capable of mutual antagonism that results in the creation of zone lines. However, this antagonism appears to mostly prevent the pink pigment production of S. cuboideum, not only with T. versicolor as noted in the aforementioned paper, but also with the other paired fungi tested herein. The inhibition of pigment production by S. cuboideum in the presence of other fungi has been noted under contamination issues [10]. However, when no other fungi are present, this fungus is known to heavily saturate wood test pieces with its pigment. The results of this experiment indicate that S. cuboideum reliably antagonizes other spalting fungi, which results in the creation of zone lines. However, mass-scale pink pigmentation by this fungus is feasible only for small-scale inoculation where sterility can be tightly controlled; <b>pink</b> <b>stain</b> production by S. cuboideum under non-sterile conditions is not ideal, unless only minimal <b>pink</b> <b>stain</b> is desired.|$|E
30|$|The {{method of}} {{inoculation}} significantly impacted how the fungi performed within the logs, and fungi with different types of pigmentation appeared to prefer different methods of inoculation. Zone line producing fungi produced more zone lines when introduced into the logs in sterile plugs, while pink staining fungi performed better when sprayed onto the logs. Both methods are based in past literature, which includes pressing fungal mats against log ends [14, 15], spraying a mixture of distilled water and fungi on the logs [16 – 18], packing inoculated sawdust into drilled holes in the log [19], and using inoculated plugs to deliver active cultures directly into the wood [20]. Although spray inoculation was more effective with S. cuboidea, {{it is possible that}} the opening of the sapwood for spray inoculation also partially inhibited the <b>pink</b> <b>stain</b> production. As noted by Leatham [20], inoculum generally performs better when the bark is retained, as the bark helps maintain moisture content, insulates against temperature changes, and can inhibit the colonization by airborne contaminants. An inoculation method which enables entire surface coverage without exposing large portions of the internal wood would be ideal, but would be exceptionally difficult to achieve.|$|E

40|$|The {{annual survey}} of forest pests in the Yukon was {{conducted}} in July 2003. Attacks from the spruce bark beetle, Dendroctonus rufipennis, in southwest Yukon resulted in white spruce mortality on 41 641 ha, down from last year’s 69 400 ha. The most intensive activity is south of Mush Lake in Kluane National Park, and south of Dezadeash Lake {{as far as the}} B. C. border. Significant this year were expansions of infestations to the north along Talbot Arm on Kluane Lake and to the east from Dezadeash Lake toward Kusawa Lake. Current attack levels remained high, indicating that the infestation will continue undiminished in 2004. Another objective this year was an intensive survey to determine the incidence of the root disease, Inonotus tomentosus, and the relationship, if any, between the root disease and the spruce bark beetle. In the Shakwak Trench in southwest Yukon, 815 white spruce trees were sampled in the permanent forest health assessment plots.

30|$|Eight fungal species {{known to}} produce wood {{pigmentation}} were tested for reaction to various moisture contents in two hardwood species.

Fomes fomentarius and Polyporus brumalis produced maximum pigmentation in beech at 26 - 41 % and in sugar maple at 59 - 96 % moisture content. The <b>pink</b> <b>staining</b> Scytalidium cuboideum pigmented both wood species at above 35 % moisture content.

40|$|Objective To {{report the}} {{diagnosis}} and treatment of one case of solitary plasmacytoma of spine with amyloidosis and investigate the clinicopathological features combined with literatures. Methods and Results The patient was a 46 -year-old woman. She suffered from weakness of both lower limbs, unsteady gait and numbness of toes for 20 d. MRI examination revealed an irregular mass behind the spinal cord at T 5 - 7 level and T 6 - 7 vertebral body accessory. The enhanced MRI showed obvious heterogeneous enhancement. The border was clear and spinal dura mater was compressed to shift forward. During operation, T 5 - 7 processus spinosus and vertebral laminae were eroded, and the cortex of bone showed "moth-eaten" erosion. The intraspinal and extradural lesion had rich blood supply, loose bone structure and intact spinal dura mater. Histologically, tumor cells were composed of intensive small cells, and focal plasmacytoid cells were seen. Flake <b>pink</b> <b>staining</b> substance was among them. Artificial cracks were common and multinuclear giant tumor cells were scatteredly distributed. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the cytoplasm of tumor cells were diffusely positive for CD 138, CD 38 and vimentin (Vim),scatteredly positive for leukocyte common antigen (LCA), and negative for immune globulin κ light chain(IgGκ) and λ light chain (IgGλ), CD 99, S- 100 protein (S- 100), pan cytokeratin (PCK), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), HMB 45 and CD 34. The Ki- 67 labeling index was 1. 25 %. Congo red <b>staining</b> showed the <b>pink</b> <b>staining</b> substance was brownish red. Hybridization in situ examination showed the DNA content of IgGκ was more than that of IgGλ. The final pathological diagnosis was solitary plasmacytoma of spine with amyloidosis. The patient was treated with postoperative chemotherapy, and there was no recurrence or metastasis during 18 -month follow-up period. Conclusions Solitary plasmacytoma of spine with amyloidosis is a rare tumor. The imaging features can offer a few diagnostic cues. However, a clear diagnosis depends on specific histomorphology, immunophenotyping, special staining and hybridization in situ examination.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2017. 01. 010 </p...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTIONHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains {{have been}} used for at least a century and are still {{essential}} for recognizing various tissue types and the morphologic changes that form the basis of contemporary cancer diagnosis. The stain has been unchanged for many years because it works well with a variety of fixatives and displays a broad range of cytoplasmic, nuclear, and extracellular matrix features. Hematoxylin has a deep blue-purple color and stains nucleic acids by a complex, incompletely understood reaction. Eosin is <b>pink</b> and <b>stains</b> proteins nonspecifically. In a typical tissue, nuclei are stained blue, whereas the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix have varying degrees of <b>pink</b> <b>staining.</b> Well-fixed cells show considerable intranuclear detail. Nuclei show varying cell-type- and cancer-type-specific patterns of condensation of heterochromatin (hematoxylin staining) that are diagnostically very important. Nucleoli stain with eosin. If abundant polyribosomes are present, the cytoplasm will have a distinct blue cast. The Golgi zone can be tentatively identified by the absence of staining in a region next to the nucleus. Thus, the stain discloses abundant structural information, with specific functional implications. A limitation of hematoxylin staining is that it is incompatible with immunofluorescence. It is useful, however, to stain one serial paraffin section from a tissue in which immunofluorescence will be performed. Hematoxylin, generally without eosin, is useful as a counterstain for many immunohistochemical or hybridization procedures that use colorimetric substrates (such as alkaline phosphatase or peroxidase). This protocol describes H&E staining of tissue and cell sections...|$|R
