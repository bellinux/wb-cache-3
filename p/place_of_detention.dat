40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the way in}} which {{disabled}} people who are deprived of their liberty are treated in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention.</b> It argues that human rights law demands that disabled people should not be discriminated against while in detention and that the non-discrimination obligation includes a reasonable accommodation obligation. The nature of this obligation is explained, together with the heightened profile given to it in the context <b>of</b> <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> by Article 14 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. A number of cases decided by supranational bodies are used to demonstrate how failures to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled detainees may result in inhuman or degrading treatment, as well as in discrimination. The extent to which principles of disability equality and reasonable accommodation are incorporated into the guidance issued by three supranational systems for monitoring <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> is also examined. It is suggested that, in all three instances, more could and should be done to highlight the importance <b>of</b> ensuring that <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> develop systems for guaranteeing that reasonable accommodation is provided to disabled detainees and that this would {{play an important role in}} reducing the risk of exposing disabled people deprived of their liberty to inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment...|$|R

6000|$|Lise was {{the only}} member of the Bumpus family who did not find uncongenial such distractions and companionships as were offered by the civilization that {{surrounded}} them. The Bagatelle she despised; that was slavery--but slavery out of which she might any day be snatched, like Leila Hawtrey, by a prince charming who had made a success in life. Success to Lise meant money. Although what some sentimental sociologists might call a victim of our civilization, Lise would not have changed it, since it produced not only Lise herself, but also those fabulous financiers with yachts and motors and town and country houses she read about in the supplements of the Sunday newspapers. It contained her purgatory, which she regarded in good conventional fashion as a mere temporary <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> and likewise the heaven toward which she strained, the dwelling-place of light. In short, her philosophy was that of the modern, orthodox American, tinged by a somewhat commercialized Sunday school tradition of an earlier day, and highly approved by the censors of the movies. The peculiar kind of abstinence once euphemistically known as [...] "virtue," [...] particularly if it were combined with beauty, never failed of its reward. Lise, in this sense, was indeed virtuous, and her mirror told her she was beautiful. Almost anything could happen to such a lady: any day she might be carried up into heaven by that modern chariot of fire, the motor car, driven by a celestial chauffeur.|$|E
60|$|Robespierre {{was first}} {{conducted}} to the prisons of the Luxembourg. The gaoler, on some plea of informality, refused to receive him. The terrible prisoner was next {{taken to the}} Mairie, where he remained among joyful friends from eight in the evening until eleven. Meanwhile the old insurrectionary methods of the nights of June and of August in '92, of May and of June in '93, were again followed. The beating of the rappel and the générale was heard in all the sections; the tocsin sounded its dreadful note, reminding all who should hear it that insurrection is the most sacred and the most indispensable of duties. Hanriot, the commandant of the forces, had been arrested in the evening, but he was speedily released by the agents of the Commune. The Council issued manifestoes and decrees from the Common Hall every moment. The barriers were closed. Cannon were posted opposite {{the doors of the}} hall of the Convention. The quays were thronged. Emissaries sped to and fro between the Jacobin Club and the Common Hall, and between these two centres and each of the forty-eight sections. It is one of the inscrutable mysteries of this delirious night, that Hanriot did not at once use the force at his command to break up the Convention. There is no obvious reason why he should not have done so. The members of the Convention had re-assembled after their dinner, towards seven o'clock. The hall which had resounded with the shrieks and yells of the furious gladiators of the factions all day, now lent a lugubrious echo to gloomy reports which one member after another delivered from the shadow of the tribune. Towards nine o'clock the members of the two dread Committees came in panic to seek shelter among their colleagues, 'as dejected in their peril,' says an eyewitness, 'as they had been cruel and insolent in the hour of their supremacy.' When they heard that Hanriot had been released, and that guns were at their door, all gave themselves up for lost and made ready for death. News came that Robespierre had broken his arrest and gone to the Common Hall. Robespierre, after urgent and repeated solicitations, had been at length persuaded about an hour before midnight to leave the Mairie and join his partisans of the Commune. This was an act of revolt against the Convention, for the Mairie was a legal <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> and so long as he was there, he was within the law. The Convention with heroic intrepidity declared both Hanriot and Robespierre beyond the pale of the law. This prompt measure was its salvation. Twelve members were instantly named to carry the decree to all the sections. With the scarf of office round their waists, and a sabre in hand, they sallied forth. Mounting horses, and escorted by attendants with flaring torches, they scoured Paris, calling all good citizens to the succour of the Convention, haranguing crowds at the street corners with power and authority, and striking the imaginations of men. At midnight heavy rain began to fall.|$|E

40|$|Insomnia is a {{frequent}} reason for medical and psychiatric consultation in prisons.

In <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention,</b> principles should be balanced according to the same criteria as outside correctional institutions, while taking into account the unique harm-benefit ratios related to the specific context.

Insomnia treatment in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> is an ethical dilemma, but there is no evidence-based reason to avoid benzodiazepines in prison completely and to use only neuroleptics and antidepressants, which might represent more dangerous and less efficient treatment. In prison medicine, should we even treat insomnia? Widely accepted ethical strategies of decision-making indicate that we should. Institutional guidelines on insomnia should be based on ethically sound decision-making that takes into account the available evidence...|$|R
