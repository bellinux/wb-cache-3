The WHO estimates that on the order of 100 000 people die each year as a result of snake bites, and around three times as many amputations and other permanent disabilities are caused by snakebites annually.|$|E
25|$|The second tomb {{discovery}} was made, also by chance, in October 1968, by workers digging {{the foundation for}} a transmission tower. Gold pieces with a total weight of approx. 900 g were found; of these the authorities were only able to recover 800 g when the discovery became public the following February, the rest having probably been melted down and used to make modern jewelry. During the excavations {{the upper part of the}} tomb was destroyed, leaving only the lower <b>part</b> <b>thereof</b> to be studied by archaeologists.

25|$|Prior to 2009 {{regulation}} of consumer credit was primarily {{conducted by the}} states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated effective annual interest rate caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of consumer credit to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012 (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all consumer credit contracts (inclusive of all fees and charges). Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within {{the definition of a}} small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or <b>part</b> <b>thereof)</b> fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the statutory interest rate cap of 48%. Payday lenders are still required to comply with Responsible lending obligations applying to all creditors. Unlike other jurisdictions Australian payday lenders providing SACC or MACC products are not required to display their fees as an effective annual interest rate percentage.|$|E

500|$|Article 14(2)(a) of the Constitution {{recognizes that}} certain {{restrictions}} on speech and expression are {{necessary in the}} public interest. It states that Parliament may by law impose restrictions {{on the right to}} freedom of speech and expression [...] "as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore or any <b>part</b> <b>thereof,</b> friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence".|$|E
500|$|Chapter II of Part II of the ISA, {{which allows}} for {{preventive}} detention (also known as detention without trial), is the most conspicuous feature of the Act. It confers on the executive a discretionary power to arrest and detain without trial, when necessary, {{a person with a}} view to prevent [...] "that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or any <b>part</b> <b>thereof</b> or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein". For the purposes of this provision, essential services means services relating to water, electricity, public health, fire, prisons, post, telephony, telegraphy, radiocommunication (including broadcasting and television), ports, docks, harbours, public transport, and the bulk distribution of fuel and lubricants.|$|E
500|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{a number}} of those who adopt a thick conception {{of the rule of law}} in Singapore criticize the existence of the Internal Security Act.

This provision states that [...] "f the President is satisfied with respect to any person that, with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or any <b>part</b> <b>thereof</b> or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein, it is necessary to do so", the Minister for Home Affairs shall order that the person be, among other things, detained without trial for up to two years.|$|E

500|$|Parliament may {{restrict}} {{the rights to}} freedom of speech, assembly or association if it is necessary or expedient {{in the interests of}} the security of Singapore or any <b>part</b> <b>thereof.</b> The courts have taken a broad approach to this exception, and have shown a considerable amount of deference to the Government. For instance, in Public Prosecutor v. Phua Keng Tong (1986), a case involving the Official Secrets Act, the High Court held that security in Article 14(2) does not merely mean protection from danger but includes the [...] "protection of information which the Government considers vital or essential for its administration". However, not everything that the Government regards as an official secret will be necessarily be deemed to be so by the court, especially if the information is [...] "innocuous in nature". The burden of proving that official information is secret lies on the Prosecution.|$|E
500|$|Between 1928 and 1940, the {{subdivision}} was a legal battleground. [...] In 1928, landlords in {{the subdivision}} signed the covenants {{in which they}} agreed {{that they would not}} rent to non-whites. [...] The language of the covenants state that no properties in the subdivision [...] "...shall be sold, given, conveyed or leased to any negro or negroes, and no permission or license to use or occupy any <b>part</b> <b>thereof</b> shall be given to any negro except house servants or janitors or chauffeurs employed thereon..." [...] The covenants were signed by [...] "owners of land on the one or the other side of Evans, Langley, Champlain, St. Lawrence, Rhodes, Eberhart, Vernon and South Park Avenues, between 60th and 63rd Streets and on 60th, 61st and 62nd Streets between South Park and Cottage Grove Avenues" [...] on September 30, 1927, and they were recorded at the Cook County Register of Deeds on February 1, 1928. They were intended to be valid and in force until January 1, 1948.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, in {{an attempt}} to {{maintain}} secrecy over the impending release of the fifth Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Rowling and her publishers sought and received a groundbreaking injunction against [...] "the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any <b>part</b> <b>thereof</b> without the consent of the Claimants". The ruling obtained, {{for the first time in}} British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. Lawyers Winterbothams noted that, [...] "The new Harry Potter style injunction could be used if you expected a demonstration or trespass to take place, but which had not yet begun, so long as you could find a description for the people expected which the Court was satisfied identified 'those who are included and those who are not'". The [...] "Potter injunction" [...] was later used against a camp of Roma travellers. In 2006, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline employed the injunction against anonymous animal rights campaigners who had sent threatening letters to their investors.|$|E
