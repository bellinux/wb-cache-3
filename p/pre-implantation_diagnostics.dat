40|$|Abstract: Deciphering the Human Genome {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} achievements of modern science. The genetic code shows the importance of semiotics in our understanding of evolution. Biosemiotics as the study of signs, communication and information in living organisms has very much in com-mon with Bioinformatics. Biology, Bioinformatics, and Biosemiotics meet, but with ambivalent effects on science and society. In the paper we discuss the scientific and social implications, as well as a number of ethical problems. For instance, does the fertilized egg have the right to human dignity? Should <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>diagnostics</b> remain abso-lutely prohibited in the German society, while abortion of a twelve-week old fetus after counseling is allowed? What are the genetically engineered interventions that make sense from the few point of medicine, and what are those that should be fundamentally rejected? Furthermore, the possibil-ity is being discussed that the human genome project and the considerations accompanying it may eventually initiate new varieties of eugenics and racism (Fuchs-Kittowski...|$|E
40|$|Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) {{are rare}} {{monogenic}} inborn errors of immunity {{that result in}} impairment of functions of the human immune system. PIDs have a broad phenotype with increased morbidity and mortality and treatment choices are often complex. With increased accessibility of next-generation sequencing the rate of discovery of genetic causes for PID has increased exponentially. Identification of an underlying monogenic diagnosis provides important clinical benefits for patients {{with the potential to}} alter treatments, facilitate genetic counselling, and <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> We investigated a next-generation sequencing PID panel of 242 genes within clinical care across a range of PID phenotypes. We also evaluated Phenomizer to predict causal genes from human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms. 27 participants were recruited and a total of 15 reportable variants were identified in 48 % (13 / 27) of the participants. The panel results had implications for treatment in 37 % (10 / 27) of participants. Phenomizer identified the genes harbouring variants from HPO terms in 33 % (9 / 27) of participants. This study demonstrates the clinical efficacy that genetic testing has in the care of PID. However, it also highlights some of the disadvantages of gene panels in the rapidly moving field of PID genomics and current challenges in HPO term assignment for PID...|$|E
30|$|This “Forum” section exposes a wide {{field of}} {{technology}} reflection, ranging from biomedical issues over developments within robotics to the adequate design of climate policies. The article by S. Benöhr-Laqueur on Fighting {{in the legal}} grey area discusses the problems and needs of an interdisciplinary dialog {{in the case of}} <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>diagnostics</b> which normative implications are still ambiguous—at least from a German perspective. Another contribution on Privacy revisited? by A. Bialobrzeski reflects different bioethical concepts that might be applied to the adequate arrangement of medical biobank regimes. The main problem within this is based upon the dilemma between social interests in broad access to patient data on one hand and reasonable privacy rights of the individuals on the other hand. The author proposes a contested concept along Rawls’ theories for a just solution of the data handling problem. The paper of M. Decker et al. on Service robotics frames an interdisciplinary technology assessment on the changing roles and environments of sophisticated modern robots that will intrude progressively in peoples’ daily life and might affect the autonomy of the human users. The question whether “you know your new companion” is leading for the formulation of a corresponding interdisciplinary research initiative by the authors. Finally, D. Cansier’s article on Rainforest conservation as a strategy of climate policy unfolds a promising concept for the still pending implementation of rainforest conservation and utilization as an element of international climate protection policy. He proposes respective emission credits and certificates as instruments for the realization of his ideas and states that the combination of corresponding national and de-central approaches might give the best results for all relevant actors.|$|E
30|$|The Austrian case {{draws on}} {{previous}} research on the regulation of various innovative areas of biomedicine such as transplantation and xenotransplantation, human {{embryonic stem cell research}} and <b>pre-implantation</b> genetic <b>diagnostics</b> (Griessler 2010), genetic testing (Griessler and Lehner 2010) and prenatal diagnostics (Griessler 2012). Also in this case expert, interviews with politicians, civil servants, experts and other stakeholders were carried out and policy documents as well as newspaper articles were analysed.|$|R
30|$|This {{raises the}} {{question}} {{to what extent the}} public is actually involved in Austrian science and technology policy and what the chances of pTA are. In this context, Degelsegger and Torgersen (2011) emphasize the significance of “deeply held beliefs and engrained practices of political decision-making” (391). Drawing on political practices in the regulation of various innovative areas of biomedicine, such as transplantation, xenotransplantation, human embryonic stem cell research, <b>pre-implantation</b> genetic <b>diagnostics</b> (PGD) (Griessler 2010), genetic testing (Griessler and Lehner 2010) and prenatal diagnostics (PND, Griessler 2012), it will be argued that pTA faces serious difficulties in Austria because of dominant political practices and assumptions about policy-making and the public.|$|R

The Congress President Dr. Zaid Kilani, with Dr. Abdel Latif Abu Khadra, President of the Jordanian society for Fertility and Genetics, Dr. Rana Dajani of the Hashemite University of Jordan, and their Organizing Committee proved to be an excellent organizers and dedicated physician-scientists and, focusing on fertility, genetics and stem cells in a wide range of advanced therapeutic applications. Brilliant course participants included trainees, scientists and clinicians from the Greater Middle East. The lectures and practical sessions, presented by internationally acknowledged scientists, included overviews of recent achievements in pluripotent stem cell research, emphasizing the role of both the embryonic (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. A major emphasis was placed on the clinical achievements in germ cell and umbilical cord stem cell transplantation issues, and on the potential of fast and successful prenatal and <b>pre-implantation</b> molecular genetics <b>diagnostics.</b> The organization of the stem cell course in the Holy Land especially emphasized that issues of “eternal life” and “rejuvenation” are already at hand—at least in the pluripotent stem cell research field. In the lively atmosphere of the course about 60 participants had heated discussions on the possibility and ethics of advanced prenatal diagnostics, and on regulatory issues reflecting the need of separation of clinically effective versus unapproved, unwarranted stem cell treatments. An open discussion of many ethical issues, reflecting profound differences in religion and medical tradition in the different countries, made this course exceptionally interesting for both teachers and trainees...|$|R

Atsakant į iškeltą darbo tikslą buvo nagrinėjama Lietuvos teisės aktai, reglamentuojantys pagalbinį apvaisinimą. Apžvelgiami Europos sąjungos teisės aktai reglamentuojantys lytinių ląstelių donorystę, taip pat užsienio šalių teisės aktai reglamentuojantys pagalbinį apvaisinimą ir teismų praktika. Vadovaujantis Lietuvos ir užsienio šalių mokslinės literatūros šaltiniais, atlikto tyrimo analize, darbe yra atskleidžiama pagalbinio apvaisinimo, panaudojant mirusio asmens lytines ląsteles, teigiami ir neigiami aspektai taip pat būsimo vaiko interesų pirmumo klausimas pagalbinio apvaisinimo kontekste. Kalbant pagalbinio apvaisinimo kontekstu neturėtų būti besąlygiškai sutinkama su asmens pageidavimu panaudoti mirusio sutuoktinio lytines ląsteles, savo pagalbiniam apvaisinimui. Vertinant iš moralinės pusės yra svarbu nustatyti, asmenų norinčių pasinaudoti tokia teise, vertinimo apribojimus. Nustatyti reikalavimai, turi būti gerai apgalvoti norint pasinaudoti tokia teisia. Turi būti įvertinta būsimo vaiko ir tėvų interesai, taip pat galimas vaiko neigiamas poveikis. Šiame darbe iškelta hipotezė pasitvirtino, sutuoktinis turėtų turėti teisę paimti kito, jau mirusio, sutuoktinio lytines ląsteles ir panaudoti savo pagalbiniam apvaisinimui. Nes pagal dabar galiojantį Lietuvos Respublikos Pagalbinio apvaisinimo įstatymą, tai draudžiama. Teisė turėti šeimą yra pripažįstama pamatinia žmogaus teise, tai pripažinta tiek tarptautiniuose, tiek nacionaliniuose teisės aktuose, tačiau net ir ne atsižvelgiant į aplinkybes kuriomis vaikas atsirado šeimoje svarbu užtikrinti vaiko ir būsimų jo tėvų interesus. The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} work {{was to determine if}} a spouse has the right to take a deceased spouse’s sex cells and use them for assisted fertilization. For this purpose, we presented and analyzed problematic aspects of assisted fertilization using a deceased person’s sex cells. To reach the set aim, we analyzed legal acts of the Republic of Lithuania on assisted fertilization, reviewed legal acts of the European Union on sex cell donation, foreign legal acts regulating assisted fertilization, and court practice. Based on the analysis of Lithuanian and foreign scientific literature and the conducted research, we revealed the positive and negative aspects of assisted fertilization with a deceased donor’s sex cells as well as the issue of the priority of the future child’s interests in the context of assisted fertilization. Legalization of postmortem sex cell donation for assisted fertilization is a relevant issue in every constitutional state. Various countries have differing approaches to postmortem sex cell donation, and this is the object of much ethical and legal discussion. In some countries, like Great Britain, Belgium, India and some states of the US, the law permits harvesting sex cells of a deceased person, while in other countries, such as Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, and some states of Australia, this practice is prohibited. In Lithuania, the Law on Assisted Fertilization prohibits postmortem sex cell donation except for cases where the advance consent of the deceased person is available for the use of his or her sex cells for a concrete person. Sex cells may be obtained only with the donor’s written informed consent. Clause 8. 2 of the Republic of Lithuania Law on Assisted Fertilization prohibits harvesting and (or) use of a deceased person’s sex cells. If a person whose sex cells are stored in a cell bank dies, the sex cells are destroyed. A deceased person’s sex cells may be used for the assisted fertilization of a concrete person if the donor had granted consent for such use of the cells prior to his or her death. The legal regulation of assisted fertilization in European countries differs and is influenced by cultural, religious, and other differences between the countries. The European Union (EU) does not legally regulate assisted fertilization because of the aforementioned differences between European countries. In the EU and its member stated, questions of reproductive health are mostly analyzed from a specific, medical perspective. The EU encourages the development of a single system for ensuring high standards for the quality and safety of supply, examination, processing, storage, and distribution of human cells and tissues throughout the EU. The member states are encouraged to facilitate the exchange of human cells and tissues for patients who need such treatment on the yearly basis. For this reason, the EU, through Community regulations, tries to ensure similar quality and the same safety of human cells and tissues irrespectively of the location of their use. The rapid development of medicine results in the emergence of an increasing number of opinions concerning postmortem sex cell donation. When the cells have already been harvested before the death of one of the spouses and are stored in a cell bank, {{the answer to the question}} of whether the surviving spouse can use those cells is clear. The fact that a person decided to store his or her sex cells suggests that he or she intended to use those cells for assisted fertilization in the future. More discussions arise when the surviving spouse seeks to obtain the deceased spouse’s sex cells for assisted fertilization with the aim of having offspring in the absence of the donor’s written consent. Such situation may occur if the spouse or partner dies unexpectedly due to an accident or an acute illness. In such situations, appropriate use of the deceased spouse’s sex cells by the surviving spouse cannot be ensured, and thus the decision should be well-considered and stable. Taking into account the psychological condition of the deceased person’s family is important, as in such situation, they may make an unadvised decision. There is no unified global regulation of the harvesting or use of female or male sex cells. The donation of male sex cells is simpler and does not require any significant medical intervention. Freezing of male sex cells became available back in 1949. Meanwhile, harvesting and preservation of female sex cells is a relatively new and unexplored area, but biotechnologies have made this procedure available. It was first performed in 1970. <b>Pre-implantation</b> genetic <b>diagnostics</b> is another important aspect in assisted fertilization. <b>Pre-implantation</b> genetic <b>diagnostics</b> may have both positive and negative aspects. The embryo’s examination prior to the transfer to the uterus may help detect genetic diseases (such as Down’s syndrome, hemophilia, etc.), yet it may also be applied for non-medical purposes, such as the determination of the child’s sex and other characteristics, which violates the principles of ethics. The concept of a family is not well-defined in legislation, and there are a number of various definitions of a family member and other terms in the regulation of different legal relationships. The rapid development of the society causes changes in the concept of the family in legislation because the law has to react to changes in the society. Every person has the right to have a family and children. The introduction of new biotechnologies is changing the model of a family. Even though both national and international legal acts defend the right to a family, the right to use a deceased spouse’s sex cells has to be carefully evaluated, including the assessment of all its possible positive and negative aspects. The principle of the priority of a child’s interests was first formulated on the international scale in 1959 in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. In 1989, it was included in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child where it became one of the main legal principles of the Convention. The principle of the priority of a child’s interests is an imperative international norm of the human rights. Assisted fertilization is related to the interests of the child conceived via this method. A child in a family is a creation of two people, yet in case of children conceived via assisted fertilization after the demise of one of the parents, the main negative aspect that may affect the child’s well-being is the fact that that the child is born in a family with only one of the parents alive. This may cause the child to be perceived in the society as “different”. In the majority of countries that allow assisted fertilization using a deceased donor’s sex cells, parenthood of a child conceived via this method may be recognized if the following requirements are met: a written consent of the deceased parent, and a registered marriage. The court of law always demands proof that the wish to conceive via such method was mutual. The hypothesis raised in this work was confirmed: a spouse has the right to use a deceased spouse’s sex cells for assisted fertilization. The right to have a family is recognized as the basic human right both in national and international legal acts, but the child’s and the future parents’ interests have to be ensured irrespective of the mode in which the child was conceived...|$|R
