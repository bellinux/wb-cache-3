40|$|This paper investigates numerically {{the flow}} and {{unsteady}} aerodynamics {{of a complex}} landing gear using Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES). The case studied is a six-wheel main landing gear with some medium and small components included, which has been measured previously in wind tunnel. The {{aim of this study}} is to extend landing gear modelling to more complicated geometry and to understand the unsteady aerodynamic loads and flow features around landing gears with complex configuration. A meshing strategy based on unstructured mesh is used to cope with the geometrical complexity. Carefully chosen refinement zones and structured boundary layer meshes are employed to improve the mesh quality, which helped to ensure the accuracy for the DDES simulation. A hex-dominated mesh with 37 million cells was generated with resolved boundary mesh using 10 - 21 layers on all landing gear components. It is found that flow around the bogie is more complex due to stronger interactions between wheels in close proximity for the six-wheel bogie. Other components, such as wheel axles, bogie <b>pitch</b> <b>trimmer,</b> forward dressing link and after torque link introduces flow unsteadiness in the bogie region. Statistics of mean and RMS forces for all components of the main landing gear are obtained. The drag on the front pair of wheels was found to be lower than the middle and the back wheels. The presence of forward and after side stays (or diagonal struts) on the landing gear possibly creates asymmetry in the flow field. This asymmetric flow features further changes the separation on and around the wheels and influence its wake region. The presence of the components like side stays, forward dressing link and the after torque link changes the wake pattern behind the cylindrical strut. This increases the mean drag coefficient of the main strut compared to that of a simple cylinder with similar geometrical dimensions. This suggests that smaller components may play a significant role in changing flow features around a bigger component. The RMS side force coefficient of the main strut is higher than the RMS lift and drag coefficients, indicating a possibility of strong interaction between the main strut and wheels. Also, efforts are made to understand the unsteadiness in the landing gear wake. This study contributes to the limited literature available for aircraft main landing gear configurations with more geometrical details...|$|E

50|$|Both {{elevator}} <b>trim</b> and <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> {{affect the}} small trimming {{part of the}} elevator on jet airliners. The former {{is supposed to be}} set in a certain position for a longer time, while the <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> (controlled with the landing pilot's thumb on the yoke or joystick, and is thereby easy to maneuver) is used all the time after the flying pilot has disabled the autopilot, especially after each time the flaps are lowered or at every change in the airspeed, at the descent, approach and final. Elevator trim is most used for controlling the attitude at cruising by the autopilot.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper puts {{forward a}} design idea for blended wing body (BWB). The idea is {{described}} as that cruise point, maximum lift to drag point and <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> point {{are in the same}} flight attitude. According to this design idea, design objectives and constraints are defined. By applying low and high fidelity aerodynamic analysis tools, BWB aerodynamic design methodology is established by the combination of optimization design and inverse design methods. High lift to drag ratio, <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> and acceptable buffet margin can be achieved by this design methodology. For 300 -passenger BWB configuration based on static stability design, as compared with initial configuration, the maximum lift to drag ratio and <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> are achieved at cruise condition, zero lift pitching moment is positive, and buffet characteristics is well. Fuel burn of 300 -passenger BWB configuration is also significantly reduced as compared with conventional civil transports. Because aerodynamic design is carried out under the constraints of BWB design requirements, the design configuration fulfills the demands for interior layout and provides a solid foundation for continuous work...|$|R
2500|$|The {{plane was}} too badly damaged to {{determine}} a definite cause. Canadian aircraft {{were not required to}} carry voice cockpit recorders or flight data recorders at this point, complicating the investigation into the crash of TCA Flight 831. [...] The official report released in 1965 pointed to problems in the jet's <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> system (the device that maintains a set nose-up or -down attitude) as a possibility, since a <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> problem caused the similar crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 304, another DC-8, three months later in 1964. [...] Other possible causes were put forward that could not be ruled out: 1) Icing of the pitot system; and 2) Failure of the vertical gyro.|$|R
2500|$|On 6 May 1981, USAF EC-135N, (AF Serial Number 61-0328), crashed {{during a}} {{scheduled}} Advanced Range Instrumented Aircraft (ARIA) navigator and Primary Mission Electronic Equipment (PMEE) training mission from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. For an unexplained reason, the aircraft <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> {{was moved to}} the full nose-down position, which exceeded the ability of the autopilot to control, and the aircraft pitched over abruptly. [...] The abrupt pitch over caused the generators to trip off line and the loss of AC electrical power prevented the <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> from being operated normally. [...] The aircraft became uncontrollable and exploded at about 1,500ft MSL. [...] The crash occurred near Walkersville, MD at 10:50L. [...] All seventeen crew members and four passengers on board the aircraft were killed.|$|R
5000|$|November 1963: Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 831 - All 118 {{on board}} a Trans-Canada Airlines DC-8-54F were killed, when the plane crashed 5 minutes after takeoff near Montreal, leaving a crater in the ground. Impact speed was over 500 mph. They found the <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> {{compensator}} actuator was in the extended position and the horizontal stabilizer trim setting was at 1.65 to 2 degrees nosedown (both were improper positions, for that stage of flight). [...] "The probable cause of this accident could not be determined with certainty. Certain possible causes which were put forward could not be ruled out: 1) Icing of the Pitot system; 2) Failure of the vertical gyro; 3) An unprogrammed and unnoticed extension of the <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> compensator." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{design feature}} of the flap system {{is that there is}} no noticeable change in <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> with the extension of the flaps. This has been achieved by the incorporation of a simple interconnect system which applies bias to the elevator trim springs when the flap are extended.|$|R
50|$|On a three-surface aircraft, the <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> {{forces can}} be shared, as needed in flight, between the {{foreplane}} and tailplane. Equilibrium {{can be achieved}} with lift from the foreplane rather than downforce from the tailplane. Both effects, the reduced downforce and the extra lifting force, reduce the load on the main wing.|$|R
25|$|EASA {{grounded}} the Falcon 7X fleet after {{a report}} from Dassault Aviation regarding an uncontrolled <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> runaway during descent {{in one of its}} jets in May 2011.

50|$|A {{single centre}} stick {{controls}} the ailerons and elevators. Electrical <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> {{is controlled by}} two buttons {{on the top of}} the stick, operated by the thumb. A push to talk button is on the front of the stick, operated by the index finger, together with a vertical hand operated brake lever similar to a motorcycle front brake lever.|$|R

50|$|On a {{conventional}} aircraft this <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> {{force is applied}} by a tailplane. On many modern designs, the wing centre of lift spends much or all of its time aft of the centre of gravity, so the tailplane exerts a downward force. Any such negative lift generated by the tail must be compensated by additional lift from the main wing, thus increasing wing area, drag, and weight requirements.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the engine}} being mounted above the center of gravity, power was highly {{stabilizing}} (addition of power would push the nose down), {{which could have been}} disconcerting to pilots. Initially, Piper designers incorporated an automatic <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> system to coordinate horizontal stabilizer angle of incidence with power setting. This system was later replaced by a vectored thrust nozzle, developed by Williams International, which resulted in reduced weight and simplified manufacturing processes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{empennage}} of the Mooney M20 {{is easily}} recognizable by its unique tail fin with a vertical leading edge. (The tail fin {{looks as though}} it is [...] "leaning forward", but it is approximately vertical in level flight, depending on trim setting.) The horizontal tailplane, which consists of fixed stabilizers and trailing elevators, has no trim tabs. The entire tail assembly pivots {{at the rear of}} the fuselage to provide <b>pitch</b> <b>trim.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|R
50|$|Volume {{changes of}} the lifting gas due to {{temperature}} changes or to changes of altitude are compensated for by pumping air into internal ballonets (air bags) to maintain the overpressure. Without sufficient overpressure, the blimp loses its ability to be steered and is slowed due to increased drag and distortion. The propeller air stream {{can be used to}} inflate the ballonets and so the hull. In some models, such as the Skyship 600, differential ballonet inflation can provide a measure of <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> control.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a reliability {{analysis of a}} technical system. It {{is divided into three}} main sections. The first section introduces some of the most significant problems of reliability. It deals with a definition and an expresion of reliability, a reliability diagram selection and {{a detailed description of the}} reliability analysis. This part also includes an overview of reliability analysis types. Some of the most widely used reliability analyses are briefly described; further advantages and disadvantages of using each method are listed. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis - FMEA is then described in a greater detail. The second section contains an analysis of aviation conditions as well as a design of a reliability analysis that concerns a selected digital system; the system under analysis is a <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> indicator. The main design issue lies in a choice of a most suitable method. This choice stems from the overview of reliability analyses presented in the first section of the thesis. In the last section, a FMEA reliability analysis of the <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> indicator is conducted. This part includes a discussion of the results as well as a design action that is to lead to an increase in reliability of the analyzed system...|$|R
50|$|A lifting {{foreplane}} {{is positioned}} {{ahead of the}} centre of gravity, so its lift moment acts {{in the same direction}} as any movement in pitch. If the aircraft is to be naturally stable, the foreplane’s size, lift slope and moment arm must be chosen so that it does not overpower the stabilizing moment provided by the wing and tailplane. Stability constraints thus limit the foreplane’s volume ratio (a measure of its effectiveness in trim and stability terms), which may in turn limit its ability to share <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> forces as described above.|$|R

The aerodynamic characteristics of the overall configuration of the vehicle are measured by wind tunnel tests at Mach numbers ranging from 0. 3 to 2. 0.

50|$|The primary flight {{commands}} are actuated by {{cables and}} pulleys. The ailerons and flaps {{are made of}} aluminum alloy, while the rudder and elevators are made of steel tubes and fabric. The flaps have four positions (neutral, 15°, 30° and 45°), and are actuated manually, by a lever in the upper left part of the cockpit. The <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> tab {{is located in the}} trailing edge of the left elevator, and is actuated by a handle in {{the left side of the}} cockpit. The rudder and the left aileron also have ground-adjustable trim tabs.|$|R
5000|$|While F-15E pilot Sean Long {{commented that}} the flight model was high quality and {{landings}} were fairly accurate, this was prior {{to the release of}} a patch that fixed all landings being set to [...] "easy" [...] difficulty mode. There was widespread complaints by players on both the fight model's oscillations, tendency to have excessive instantaneous pitch authority, and the inability of the crudely modeled <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> SAS to deal with this disparity and the lower sustained turn rates. The usefulness of the radar modes was also lacking compared to the follow up Jane's F/A-18.|$|R
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|R
5000|$|The Aero Trasporti Italiani Flight 460 was {{a flight}} that crashed on 15 October 1987 in Conca di Crezzo, Italy, {{that took the}} lives of 34 {{passengers}} and 3 crew. The aircraft took off from Milan-Linate (LIN) for a flight to Cologne (CGN). Icing conditions existed. Fifteen minutes after takeoff, while climbing through FL147 in IAS hold mode (constant speed set at 133 kts) the aircraft rolled left and right. The plane rolled 41deg right, 100deg left, 105deg right and 135deg left. During pull up three anomalous <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> movements set the elevator to pitch down, preventing recovery.|$|R
40|$|Interactions {{between the}} pilot and onboard-automated systems, {{designed}} to reduce pilot work-load and to decrease variability of aircraft performance, have been implicated {{in a number of}} accidents and incidents. An examination of autopilot use by 29 general-aviation pilots having complex aircraft experience was performed in the Civil Aeromedical Institute 's Advanced Gen-eral Aviation Research Simulator, conjigured as a Piper Malibu, for four simulated autopi-lotbitch-trim failures. Response times were longer for subtle (sensor) failures than for overt (commanded roll) ones, and two distinct response strategies, immediate disconnect and manual override, were revealed. It was also. found that there was an appreciable delay between first re-sponse to runaway <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> andjinal resolution...|$|R
50|$|The {{pilot was}} {{accommodated}} in an enclosed cockpit in {{the centre of}} the fuselage forward of the two fuel tanks and aft of the armament in the nose. Visibility from the cockpit was excellent to the sides and front, but restricted to the rear by the large main wing, engine and large twin fins positioned at approximately the half-span position. Flying controls consisted of elevators on the trailing edges of the canard fore-plane controlling pitch, rudders on the large fins controlling yaw and ailerons on the main wings to control roll. <b>Pitch</b> <b>trim</b> was set by adjusting a trim tab on the starboard elevator.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{earliest}} stages of re-entry the HL-42, like the Shuttle, would rely {{entirely on the}} RCS for attitude control. In {{the case of the}} Shuttle, as the surrounding air grew denser and dynamic pressures increased, the ailerons on the outer trailing edges of the wings would grip the airflow first and take over roll control from the RCS. Then, a little later, the elevons on the inner trailing edges would take over pitch control. (The Shuttle's single rear body flap was less important for attitude control, acting only as a <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> tab and to shield the main engine nozzles from the heat of re-entry.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} TIG welded, CNC laser-cut stainless steel tubing for corrosion resistance. The cockpit fairing is non-structural carbon fibre and resin. Its 8.23 m diameter rotor has a chord of 22 cm and is mounted to a rotor head made {{from a combination of}} stainless steel and 7075 T6 aluminium. The triple tail is also made from carbon fibre and resin. Equipment fitted includes a pre-rotator, pneumatic <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> and mechanical roll trim. The Cougar version has an empty weight of 250 kg and a gross weight of 450 kg, giving a useful load of 200 kg. A forward baggage compartment with a volume of 60 L is optional.|$|R
5000|$|Airbus and Boeing {{commercial}} airplanes {{differ in}} their approaches in using fly-by-wire systems.

However, in the event of multiple failures of redundant computers, the A320 does have a mechanical back-up system for its <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> and its rudder. The A340-600 has a purely electrical (not electronic) back-up rudder control system, and beginning with the new A380 airliner, all flight-control systems have back-up systems that are purely electrical {{through the use of a}} so-called [...] "three-axis Backup Control Module" [...] (BCM) ...|$|R
50|$|The IS-4 {{high-performance}} glider {{followed the}} layout of the earlier IS-3d, constructed largely of wood with plywood and fabric skinning. The high-set cantilever wings with moderate dihedral (2º 30') were built with a single main spar with a plywood covered leading egdge torsion box. The ovoid section fuselage was of monocoque construction with plywood skin with a streamlined full-length cockpit canopyforward of the wings. The undercarriage consisted of a balloon main-wheel with nose and tail skids. Flying controls were largely conventional with plywood skinned fixed portions and fabric covered wooden built up movable surfaces. <b>Pitch</b> <b>trim</b> was achieved by a trim tab on the elevators and adverse yaw was alleviated through the use of differential ailerons.|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} {{and control of}} rotors at high advance ratio are considered. Teetering, articulated, gimbaled, and rigid hub types are considered for a compound helicopter (rotor and fixed wing). Stability predictions obtained using an analytical rigid flapping blade analysis, a rigid blade CAMRAD II model, and an elastic blade CAMRAD II model are compared. For the flapping blade analysis, the teetering rotor is the most stable, 5 howing no instabilities up to an advance ratio of 3 and a Lock number of 18. With an elastic blade model, the teetering rotor is unstable at an advance ratio of 1. 5. Analysis of the trim controls and blade flapping shows that for small positive collective <b>pitch,</b> <b>trim</b> can be maintained without excessive control input or flapping angles...|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash was the {{aircraft}} being flown in manual flight mode with excessive angles of attack causing a stall with a subsequent transition to a flat spin and collision with the ground at high vertical speed. The flight manual and crew training programs did not provide instruction on manual pitch control and <b>pitch</b> <b>trim</b> during high-altitude flight. The lack of appropriate simulators contributed to the crew’s lack of ability. While avoiding areas of thunderstorms and turbulence, the crew allowed the aircraft to enter pitch oscillations exceeding the angle of attack operational range. Lack of control over speed and not following the Flight Manual to prevent and recover from a stall and poor crew resource management allowed the situation to escalate into a catastrophic one.|$|R
