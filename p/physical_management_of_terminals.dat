40|$|Background: Terminal {{haemorrhage}} {{is a rare}} but devastating {{event that}} may occur in certain advanced cancers. The focus <b>of</b> <b>management</b> involves administration <b>of</b> ‘crisis medicine’ {{with the intention of}} relieving patient distress through sedative doses of anxiolytics or opioids. This practice, whilst widely accepted, is based on limited evidence and has never been formally evaluated. Aim: To evaluate the utility of crisis medication in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> haemorrhage, through the experiences of nurses who had personally managed such events. Method: Semi-structured interviews exploring the experiences of palliative care and head and neck oncology nurses were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Saturation of themes occurred after interviewing 11 nurses with cumulative experience <b>of</b> managing 37 <b>terminal</b> haemorrhages. Results: Participants reported crisis medication to have little, if any, role in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> haemorrhage, which was such a rapid event that patients died before it could be administered. As many events had not been predicted, anticipatory prescribing of crisis medication did not always occur. Staying with and supporting the patient, and using dark-coloured towels to camouflage blood were reported to be of more practical use. A focus on accessing crisis medicines had often been to the detriment of these simple yet beneficial measures. Conclusion: Anticipatory prescribing of crisis medication rarely benefits the patient and may unintentionally detract from nursing care. Guidelines on the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> haemorrhage should reconsider the emphasis on crisis medication and focus on non-pharmacological approaches to this invariably fatal event...|$|R

40|$|Mechanism-based {{classification}} and <b>physical</b> therapy <b>management</b> <b>of</b> pain {{is essential}} to effectively manage painful symptoms in patients attending palliative care. The objective of this review {{is to provide a}} detailed review of mechanism-based classification and <b>physical</b> therapy <b>management</b> <b>of</b> patients with cancer pain. Cancer pain can be classified based upon pain symptoms, pain mechanisms and pain syndromes. Classification based upon mechanisms not only addresses the underlying pathophysiology but also provides us with an understanding behind patient′s symptoms and treatment responses. Existing evidence suggests that the five mechanisms - central sensitization, peripheral sensitization, sympathetically maintained pain, nociceptive and cognitive-affective - operate in patients with cancer pain. Summary of studies showing evidence for physical therapy treatment methods for cancer pain follows with suggested therapeutic implications. Effective palliative physical therapy care using a mechanism-based classification model should be tailored to suit each patient′s findings, using a biopsychosocial model of pain...|$|R

50|$|Several {{scenarios}} {{serve to}} contraindicate the fabrication of palatal lift prostheses or discourage their use. The <b>physical</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> palatopharyngeal incompetence {{by way of}} a palatal lift prosthesis might not be well tolerated by patients with strong gag reflexes. Edentulous patients or partially edentulous patients without a sufficient number of dental abutments cannot predictably retain palatal lift prostheses. Dentoalveolar growth and development, pediatric dental exfoliation, and exodontia secondary to periodontitis, carious lesions, other pathoses, or trauma can necessitate the fabrication of successive palatal lift prostheses that may be deemed too costly and/or time consuming. As such, surgical tactics aimed at mitigating palatopharyngeal incompetence can be employed as a substitute to its prosthetic management. Conversely, prosthetic palatopharyngeal incompetence management can offer a favorable substitute to surgical management when surgical contraindications are encountered.|$|R
