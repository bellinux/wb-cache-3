The tins tend to be sold in the bigger stores that are targeting upper and middle-income consumers, whilst the packets and sachets are sold in smaller retailers targeting lower income consumers.

It is though interesting to note that small retailers are able to sell milk at the same price as the large retailers.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of freeze-drying and storage temperature of lyophilisates of mare milk and kumiss {{on the content of}} cholesterol, oxysterols and malonic aldehyde and change of colour during 6 -month storage. The research material was <b>liquid</b> mare <b>milk</b> and kumiss and lyophilisates made of them and stored for 6 months at temperatures of 4 – 6 °C and 18 – 20 °C. On the basis of the received results it was statistically reported that all the analysed compounds were significantly influenced by the type of material, freeze-drying process, storage time and storage temperatures. Changes in the content of cholesterol, oxysterols and malonic aldehyde were bigger in the lyophilisates of kumiss than in the lyophilisates of mare milk. The freeze-drying <b>process</b> of <b>liquid</b> mare <b>milk</b> and kumiss resulted in an increase in the content of oxysterols.

40|$|A novel {{solid-phase}} extraction–capillary electrophoresis (SPE–CE) {{method was}} developed for the determination of melamine residue in <b>liquid</b> <b>milk.</b> The conditions of SPE and CE were investigated and optimized. A 1 % trichloroacetic acid plus 2. 2 % lead acetate solution {{were used for the}} extraction of analyte and the removal of protein. A Cleanert PCX SPE cartridges column was used for clean up. The 50 mM sodium dihydrogenphosphate running buffer (pH adjusted to 3. 2 with citric acid) was used as a running buffer. The linearity is satisfactory in the range of 0. 8 – 100 µg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9998. Under the optimal conditions, the method limit of detection (LOD) and method limit of quantification were 0. 12 mg/kg and 0. 37 mg/kg, respectively. The recovery of melamine from different <b>liquid</b> <b>milk</b> samples was in the range of 89. 5 – 98. 5 % with a relative standard deviation of 1. 8 – 3. 5 %.

The objectives of the study are: to gain insight into {{the factors that influence}} buying and consumption behaviour with respect to milk and into the applicability of integrated models to consumer behaviour regarding generic products, such as <b>liquid</b> <b>milk.</b> It was established that <b>liquid</b> <b>milk</b> was perceived as a neutral drink: not ordinary or luxury, as a food not a drink for pleasure, and not as being refreshing. <b>Liquid</b> <b>milk</b> was perceived differently at varying times of consumption during the day. The most important socioeconomic variables explaining individual differences in consumer beliefs regarding milk are: age, level of education, and residential area. These and other conclusions from the analysis are useful for market segmentation. The results suggest that empirical models of the EKB type can contribute to the understanding of consumer behaviour in respect of generic food products. The specific extensions of the general EKB model made in this study may be relevant for the analysis of consumer behaviour in regard to other food products...|$|R

Looks into the smallholder milk processing techniques in the highlands of Ethiopia. It is found that milk produced by smallholders is used for family consumption {{and the production of}} butter and a cottage-type cheese. For butter making, milk is collected over a period of three or four days in a clay pot. When the milk has soured and sufficient milk has been collected, the pot is shaken back and forth until butter granules are formed. The buttermilk remaining after the butter is separated from the whole milk is used to produce a cottage type cheese by heating the buttermilk and separating the coagulated fat and protein from the whey. The various options and outlets for milk and milk products available to rural smallholder milk producers are shown.
