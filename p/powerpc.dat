5|$|As the MacBook Pro uses a {{different}} hardware platform from earlier <b>PowerPC</b> (PPC)-based Macintoshes, versions of OS X prior to Lion can run PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator, which exacts some performance penalty, cannot emulate some lower-level PPC code, {{and does not}} support 64-bit (G5 specific) PPC features. Rosetta is not present in Lion and later, so PPC applications cannot be run under those versions of OS X.|$|E

50|$|The first widely {{deployed}} desktop SIMD {{was with}} Intel's MMX extensions to the x86 architecture in 1996. This sparked {{the introduction of}} the much more powerful AltiVec system in the Motorola <b>PowerPC's</b> and IBM's POWER systems. Intel responded in 1999 by introducing the all-new SSE system. Since then, there have been several extensions to the SIMD instruction sets for both architectures.|$|R

5|$|NeXT {{withdrew from}} the {{hardware}} business in 1993 and the company was renamed NeXT Software Inc; consequently, 300 of the 540 staff employees were laid off. NeXT negotiated to sell the hardware business, including the Fremont factory, to Canon. Canon later {{pulled out of the}} deal. Work on the <b>PowerPC</b> machines was stopped, along with all hardware production. CEO of Sun Microsystems Scott McNealy announced plans to invest $10million in 1993 and use NeXT software (OpenStep) in future Sun systems. NeXT partnered with Sun to create OpenStep which was NeXTSTEP without the Mach-based kernel.|$|E
5|$|Norton Internet Security version 1.0 for Mac was {{released}} November 1, 2000. It can identify and remove both Windows and Mac viruses. Other features include a firewall, advertisement blocking in the browser, parental controls, {{and the ability}} to prevent confidential information from being transmitted outside the computer. Users are prompted before such information is able to be transmitted. The incorporation of Aladdin Systems' iClean allows users to purge the browser cache, cookies, and browsing history within Norton's interface. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS 8.1. Hardware requirements call for 24 MB of RAM, 12 MB of disk space, and a <b>PowerPC</b> processor.|$|E

Symantec also markets a bundle of Version 4.0 and the 2009 version for Windows, intended for users with both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installed. iClean was dropped from this release. The firewall now blocks access to malicious sites using a blacklist updated by Symantec. To prevent attackers from leveraging insecurities in the Mac or installed software, exploit protection was introduced in this release. Phishing protection was introduced in this release as well. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS X 10.4.11 or higher. A <b>PowerPC</b> or Intel Core processor, 256 MB of RAM and 150 MB of free space are required.|$|E
5000|$|... most {{commodity}} CPUs implement architectures {{that feature}} instructions for {{a form of}} vector processing on multiple (vectorized) data sets, typically known as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data).

25|$|PowerPC-only {{software}} is supported with Apple's official emulation software, Rosetta, though applications eventually {{had to be}} rewritten to run properly on the newer versions released for Intel processors. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both <b>PowerPC</b> and Intel. There is a performance penalty when <b>PowerPC</b> binaries run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some <b>PowerPC</b> software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs at all. Some <b>PowerPC</b> applications would not run on macOS at all. Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari, so when Safari is running on Intel, it requires plug-ins that have been compiled as Intel-only or universal binaries, so PowerPC-only plug-ins will not work. While Intel Macs are able to run <b>PowerPC,</b> Intel, and universal binaries; <b>PowerPC</b> Macs support only universal and <b>PowerPC</b> builds.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>PowerPC</b> {{emulator}} is SheepShaver, {{which has}} been around since 1998 for BeOS on the <b>PowerPC</b> platform, but in 2002 was open sourced, and efforts began to port it to other platforms. Originally it was not designed for use on x86 platforms and required an actual <b>PowerPC</b> processor present in the machine it was running on similar to a hypervisor. Although it provides <b>PowerPC</b> processor support, it can run only up to Mac OS 9.0.4 because it does not emulate a memory management unit.|$|E
5000|$|In the beginning, Parsytec {{had participated}} in the GPMIMD (General Purpose MIMD) project under the {{umbrella}} of the ESPRIT project, both being funded by the European Commission's Directorate for Science.However, after substantial divisions with the other participants, Meiko, Parsys, Inmos and Telmat, as regards the choice of a common physical architecture, Parsytec left the project and announced a T9000-based machine of their own, i.e. the GC. But due to Inmos' problems with the T9000, they were forced to change to the ensemble Motorola MPC 601 CPUs and Inmos T805. This led to Parsytec's [...] "hybrid" [...] systems (e.g. GC/PP) degrading transputers to communication processors whilst the compute work was offloaded to the <b>PowerPCs.</b>|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 27 - 30, 1997 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the development of a very high-speed instrumentation and digital data recording system. The system converts multiple asynchronous analog signals to digital data, forms the data into packets, transmits the packets across fiber-optic lines and routes the data packets to destinations such as high speed recorders, hard disks, Ethernet, and data processing. This system is capable of collecting approximately one hundred megabytes per second of filtered packetized data. The significant system features are its design methodology, system configuration, decoupled interfaces, data as packets, the use of RACEway data and VME control buses, distributed processing on mixedvendor <b>PowerPCs,</b> real-time resource management objects, and an extendible and flexible configuration...|$|R
5000|$|They also exhibit {{important}} differences. Unlike SSE2, VMX/AltiVec {{supports a}} special RGB [...] "pixel" [...] data type, {{but it does}} not operate on 64-bit double precision floats, {{and there is no way}} to move data directly between scalar and vector registers. In keeping with the [...] "load/store" [...] model of the <b>PowerPC's</b> RISC design, the vector registers, like the scalar registers, can only be loaded from and stored to memory. However, VMX/AltiVec provides a much more complete set of [...] "horizontal" [...] operations that work across all the elements of a vector; the allowable combinations of data type and operations are much more complete. Thirty-two 128-bit vector registers are provided, compared to eight for SSE and SSE2 (extended to 16 in x86-64), and most VMX/AltiVec instructions take three register operands compared to only two register/register or register/memory operands on IA-32.|$|R
25|$|In {{comparison}} with 68k-emulator development, <b>PowerPC</b> support {{was difficult to}} justify due to the anticipated wide performance overhead of an emulated <b>PowerPC</b> architecture. This would later prove correct with the PearPC project, despite the availability of 7th and 8th generation x86 processors employing similar architecture paradigms present in the <b>PowerPC.</b> Nevertheless, the PearPC emulator is capable of emulating the <b>PowerPC</b> processors required by newer versions of the Mac OS. However, {{it is no longer}} maintained, and like many emulators, it tends to run much slower than a native operating system would.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{discontinued}} {{the use of}} <b>PowerPC</b> microprocessors in 2006. At WWDC 2005, Steve Jobs {{announced this}} transition, revealing that Mac OS X was always developed to run on both the Intel and <b>PowerPC</b> architectures. This was done in order to modernize the company's computers, keeping pace with Intel's low power Pentium M chips, especially for heat-sensitive laptops. The <b>PowerPC</b> G5 chip's heavy power consumption and heat output (the Power Mac G5 had to be liquid-cooled) also prevented its use in Mac notebook computers (as well as the original Mac mini), which were forced to use the older and slower <b>PowerPC</b> G4 chip. These shortcomings of the <b>PowerPC</b> chips were the main reasons behind Apple's transition to Intel processors, and the brand was revitalised by the subsequent boost in processing power available due to greater efficiency {{and the ability to}} implement multiple cores in Mac CPUs.|$|E
25|$|Future rollouts under Rubinstein's {{management}} {{included all}} subsequent upgrades (the G4 and G5) of the Power Mac series. While they were technically powerful computers, the Power Mac series {{suffered from the}} perception that they were slower than their Intel-based counterparts because their <b>PowerPC</b> CPUs listed slower clock speeds. Rubinstein and Apple popularised a term known as the Megahertz myth, to describe how the <b>PowerPC</b> architecture could not {{be compared to the}} Intel architecture simply on their clock speeds (the <b>PowerPC</b> CPUs, despite their lower clock speeds, were generally comparable to Intel CPUs of the era).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the design and}} {{validation}} of a high performance simulation is discussed that is of critical value to the feasibility study of the GRAIL project, the aim {{of which is to}} build a gravitational radiation antenna. Two relatively simple simulation models of this antenna are shown to be too restrictive for our purposes, necessitating the development of a simulation program that utilizes an explicit finite element kernel. The computational complexity of this simulation kernel requires the power that is offered by high performance computing methodology. Therefore it is tailored for execution on parallel systems. Since it is developed from scratch, we can circumvent notorious parallel programming pitfalls that usually are present in code migration. The simulation program is validated for its physical correctness as well as its performance gain.

40|$|Rapid {{progress}} in digital electronics allows digitisation of monitor signals {{at a very}} early stage of the signal pro-cessing chain, providing optimum performance and max-imum flexibility for today’s accelerator instrumentation. While the analog front-ends of such systems are usually specific for each monitor type, the subsequent digital part of the processing chain can be unified for many differ-ent measurement tasks. The “generic VME PMC Carrier board ” (VPC) [1] was developed to achieve this unifica-tion for the PSI electron and proton accelerator diagnostics and fast data acquisition and feedback systems. The core of the VME 64 x board consists of two Virtex 2 Pro FPGAs with two <b>PowerPCs</b> each, a floating point DSP and RAM. The FPGAs can acquire and process measurement data from the VMEbus P 0 /P 2 connectors or from two application-dependent PMC mezzanine modules. Two 2 GBaud fibre optics transceivers may also be used to acquire or distribute measurement data. Envisaged applications include digi-tal beam position (DBPM) and current monitors for pro-ton beams, data processing for a muon decay experiment, and general beam diagnostics as well as global feedbacks at SLS accelerators and beamlines...|$|R
40|$|This {{version of}} the SpaceCube will be a full-fledged, onboard space {{processing}} system capable of 2500 + MIPS, and featuring a number of plug-andplay gigabit and standard interfaces, all in a condensed 3 x 3 x 3 form factor [less than 10 watts and less than 3 lb (approximately equal to 1. 4 kg) ]. The main processing engine is the Xilinx SIRF radiation- hardened-by-design Virtex- 5 FX- 130 T field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Even as the SpaceCube 2. 0 version (currently under test) is being targeted as the platform of choice {{for a number of}} the upcoming Earth Science Decadal Survey missions, GSFC has been contacted by customers who wish to see a system that incorporates key features of the version 2. 0 architecture in an even smaller form factor. In order to fulfill that need, the SpaceCube Mini is being designed, and will be a very compact and low-power system. A similar flight system with this combination of small size, low power, low cost, adaptability, and extremely high processing power does not otherwise exist, and the SpaceCube Mini will be of tremendous benefit to GSFC and its partners. The SpaceCube Mini will utilize space-grade components. The primary processing engine of the Mini is the Xilinx Virtex- 5 SIRF FX- 130 T radiation-hardened-by-design FPGA for critical flight applications in high-radiation environments. The Mini can also be equipped with a commercial Xilinx Virtex- 5 FPGA with integrated <b>PowerPCs</b> for a low-cost, high-power computing platform for use in the relatively radiation- benign LEOs (low-Earth orbits). In either case, this {{version of the}} Space-Cube will weigh less than 3 pounds (. 1. 4 kg), conform to the CubeSat form-factor (10 x 10 x 10 cm), and will be low power (less than 10 watts for typical applications). The SpaceCube Mini will have a radiation-hardened Aeroflex FPGA for configuring and scrubbing the Xilinx FPGA by utilizing the onboard FLASH memory to store the configuration files. The FLASH memory will also be used for storing algorithm and application code for the <b>PowerPCs</b> and the Xilinx FPGA. In addition, it will feature highspeed DDR SDRAM (double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory) to store the instructions and data of active applications. This version will also feature SATA-II and Gigabit Ethernet interfaces. Furthermore, there will also be general-purpose, multi-gigabit interfaces. In addition, the system will have dozens of transceivers that can support LVDS (low-voltage differential signaling), RS- 422, or SpaceWire. The SpaceCube Mini includes an I/O card that can be customized {{to meet the needs of}} each mission. This version of the SpaceCube will be designed so that multiple Minis can be networked together using SpaceWire, Ethernet, or even a custom protocol. Scalability can be provided by networking multiple SpaceCube Minis together. Rigid-Flex technology is being targeted for the construction of the SpaceCube Mini, which will make the extremely compact and low-weight design feasible. The SpaceCube Mini is designed to fit in the compact CubeSat form factor, thus allowing deployment in a new class of missions that the previous SpaceCube versions were not suited for. At the time of this reporting, engineering units should be available in the summer 2012...|$|R

25|$|System 7.5 {{introduces}} {{a large number}} of new features, many of which are based on shareware applications that Apple bought and included into the new system. On the newer <b>PowerPC</b> machines, System 7.5 may have stability problems partly due to a new memory manager (which can be turned off), and issues with the handling of errors in the <b>PowerPC</b> code (all <b>PowerPC</b> exceptions map to Type 11). These issues do not affect 68k-architecture machines. System 7.5 is contemporary with Apple's failed Copland effort as well as the release of Windows 95, which coincides with Apple's purchase of several shareware system enhancements to include as new system features.|$|E

40|$|A {{software}} {{framework for the}} parallel execution of sequential programs using C++ classes is presented. The functional language Concurrent ML is used to implement the underlying harness and to design the programming interfaces. The hardware-independent harness promises a composable multi-paradigm, unified approach to parallelism across different technologies: <b>PowerPCs,</b> DSPs and FPGAs. Performance results for an image processing case study are given. 1 A Parallel Framework This paper presents a {{software framework}} currently under development for the parallel execution of applications. The source of the application remains in a sequential form such as C++ with no annotations, language extensions, or library calls for parallelism. A framework {{in this context is}} defined to be the the totality of the software infrastructure that maps this sequential expression to parallel execution. The framework consists of application class hierarchies, a pre-compiler and an underlying “harness ” which is the executable code for controlling the parallel application. Only the bottom layers of the harness are hardware dependent. The resulting application code can run on any conventional serial machine, or on any parallel machine for which a suitable harness has been written, because the form is uncommitted to any type of parallel hardware. The multi-paradigm nature of the harness enables the simultaneous exploitation of various common forms of parallelism (e. g. data, pipeline and algorithmic parallelism) as well as less regular parallelism via inherent extensibility. The programmer is thus unrestricted and may use different composable parallel paradigms. The harness dynamically monitors performance and optimises parallelisation parameters such as granularity during execution, and thus may be described as “self-tuning”...|$|R

Each mission has had varying degrees of data processing complexities, performance requirements, and external interfaces. We will show the methodology used to minimize the changes required to the physical hardware, FPGA designs, embedded software interfaces, and testing. This paper will summarize significant results as they apply to each mission application. In the HST-SM 4 application we utilized the FPGA resources to accelerate portions of the image processing algorithms more than 25 times faster than a standard space processor {{in order to meet}} computational speed requirements. For the ISS radiation on-orbit demonstration, the main goal is to show that we can rely on the commercial FPGAs and processors in a space environment. We describe our FPGA and processor radiation mitigation strategies that have resulted in our eight <b>PowerPCs</b> being available and error free for more than 99. 99 of the time over the period of four years. This positive data and proven reliability of the SpaceCube on ISS resulted in the Department of Defense (DoD) selecting SpaceCube, which is replacing an older and slower computer currently used on ISS, as the main avionics for two upcoming ISS experiment campaigns.
