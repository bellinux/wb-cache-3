5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo,</b> when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the International Journal of Otolaryngology, Jeremy Hornibrook {{discussed}} the inner ear disorder Benign paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> (BPPV). BPPV {{is the most common}} cause of vertigo, a problem attributed to a detached otoconia in one of the semicircular canals. Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Magic Wand to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.|$|E

25|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> (BPPV) is {{a disorder}} arising from {{a problem in}} the inner ear. Symptoms are repeated, brief periods of vertigo with movement, that is, of a spinning sensation upon changes in the position of the head. This can occur with turning in bed or changing position. Each episode of vertigo typically lasts less than one minute. Nausea is commonly associated. BPPV {{is one of the most}} common causes of vertigo.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} {{that result in}} vertigo are benign paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> (BPPV), Ménière's disease, and labyrinthitis. Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the middle ears. Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning with the eyes closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo {{is a problem in}} a part of the vestibular system. Other causes of dizziness include presyncope, disequilibrium, and non-specific dizziness.|$|E
25|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> is {{more likely}} in someone who gets repeated episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. The episodes of vertigo should last less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as nystagmus in this condition. In Ménière's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes. In labyrinthitis the onset of vertigo is sudden and the nystagmus occurs without movement. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered. This is especially true if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur.|$|E
40|$|One {{person out}} of two has {{experienced}} (or will experience) dizziness at least once, and one out of seven acute vertigo. 5 % of the patients seen by a GP have vertigo and/or disequilibrium. In 37 % of the cases, patients are referred to a specialist. In 2 %, a serious disorder is diagnosed: an embolic transient ischemic attack due to vertebral artery dissection, or basilar trunk dissection, affecting the posterior fossa. During diving, aero-embolic accidents affect more electively the inner ear, but sometimes severe medullary lesions may be associated. In fact, most of vertiginous patients coming to emergency departments present with benign <b>positional</b> paroxysmal <b>vertigo</b> (35 %), first manifestations of a Ménière's disease (6 %), or vestibular neuritis (6 %); more rarely temporal bone fracture, or infectious complications such as the rare and severe infectious labyrinthitis. Knowing how to diagnose a transient ischemic attack of the posterior fossa, and being aware of adequate therapeutic strategies {{for each of the}} main causes of vertigo, are essential for the emergency doctor. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the nature and prevalence of audiovestibular disturbances in mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MC), 32 consecutive MC patients were studied by a wide audiological and vestibular examination. Pure tone audiometry, impedance audiometry, brainstem response audiometry and vestibular function were performed. Patients with a previous history of ear damage due to other well-known agents {{were excluded from the}} study. In MC patients we found a rather frequent audiovestibular involvement (34. 3 %). Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was found in seven MC patients (22 %) and altered vestibular function test values in other seven subjects (22 %). Moreover, anamnestic and clinical data revealed a high incidence of benign <b>positional</b> paroxysmal <b>vertigo</b> in our MC series. We can suppose that immune complex-mediated microvascular involvement of the labyrinthine vessels may be responsible for inner ear damage in MC. Thus, audiovestibular disturbances may be included among various organ involvement of the MC. KEY WORDS: Mixed cryoglobulinaemia, Hepatitis C virus, Audiovestibular disturbances, Cupulolithiasis.

2500|$|Benign Paroxysmal <b>Positional</b> <b>Vertigo</b> (BPPV) {{is caused}} by {{misplaced}} crystals within the ear.

The most common cause is benign paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> (BPPV), which accounts for 32% of all peripheral vertigo. Other causes include Ménière's disease (12%), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, labyrinthitis, and visual vertigo. [...] Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient vertigo if it involves the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e.g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e.g., skull fractures).

2500|$|Benign Paroxysmal <b>Positional</b> <b>Vertigo</b> (BPPV) – The {{most common}} cause of vertigo. [...] It is {{typically}} described as a brief, intense sensation of spinning that occurs when there are changes in the position of the head with respect to gravity. An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right, upon getting {{out of bed in the}} morning, or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is the presence of normal but misplaced calcium crystals called otoconia, which are normally found in the utricle and saccule (the otolith organs) and are used to sense movement. If they fall from the utricle and become loose in the semicircular canals, they can distort the sense of movement and cause a mismatch between actual head movement and the information sent to the brain by the inner ear, causing a spinning sensation.|$|E
40|$|National and {{international}} evidence and guidelines on falls prevention and management in community-dwelling elderly adults recommend that falls services should be multifactorial and their interventions multicomponent. The way that individuals {{are identified as}} having had or being at risk of falls {{in order to take}} advantage of such services is far less clear. A novel multidisciplinary, multifactorial falls, syncope, and dizziness service model was designed with enhanced case ascertainment through proactive, primary care–based screening (of individual case notes of individuals aged ≥ 60) for individual fall risk factors. The service model identified 4, 039 individuals, of whom 2, 232 had significant gait and balance abnormalities according to senior physiotherapist assessment. Significant numbers of individuals with new diagnoses ranging from cognitive impairment to Parkinson's disease to urgent indications for a pacemaker were discovered.

40|$|Background: Non-pharmacological {{interventions}} {{have been}} shown to have some effectiveness in adults with dizziness; however, the effectiveness of these interventions in older people is unknown. Purpose: To determine the effects of conservative non-pharmacological interventions for dizziness in older people. Data Sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL, AMED, Index to Chiropractic Literature, PsychINFO and MANTIS were searched from inception to May 2014. Study Selection: Two investigators independently screened controlled trials with dizzy participants over 60 years of age. Dizziness from a specific diagnosis such as Meniere&# 039;s disease and benign <b>positional</b> paroxysmal <b>vertigo</b> were excluded. Outcome measures from included studies included self-reported dizziness and postural balance. Data Extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data on participants, interventions, comparison group, outcome measures and results. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed with the Cochrane Handbook 12 -item risk of bias, and Cochrane Back Group 5 -item clinical relevance assessment. Data Synthesis: Seven articles consisting of seven controlled trials were included. All studies utilized some form of exercise as the main intervention including vestibular rehabilitation exercises, postural balance exercises, and Tai-Chi exercise. Studies had a high risk of bias with a lack of adequate randomization and allocation concealment, reporting on co-interventions, reporting on reasons for drop-outs, and reporting on participant compliance. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for dizziness in older people. Current evidence suffers from high risk of bias and future well- designed trials are needed with adequate blinding, randomization and compliance...|$|R
40|$|Vertigo {{is a very}} {{frequent}} disorder, {{associated with}} highly disabling symptomatology. Since the aetiology cannot always be easily identified, treatment is often addressed to the symptoms. Betahistine, a drug characterized by a multi-factorial mode of action of the modulatory type, has been widely employed {{in the management of}} various vertiginous syndromes. Its use in Italy is, currently, authorized to treat the vertiginous symptoms related to Ménière’s disease. A meta-analysis has, therefore, been carried out to assess, the efficacy of betahistine in the treatment of other vertiginous syndromes, such as <b>positional</b> paroxysmal <b>vertigo</b> (cupulo-canalolithiasis) and vertigo secondary to arterial deficiency of the vertebrobasilar area, regardless of the specific cause. A review has been made of the literature concerning clinical trials performed with betahistine versus placebo in a randomised double-blind, parallel-group or cross-over design. Only studies evaluating betahistine in patients with vertiginous symptomatology not related to Ménière’s disease were selected. Of the 104 publications, obtained from an analysis of “Medline”, “EMBASE” and “CINAHL” databases, 7 clinical studies, which met the selection criteria, for a total of 367 patients, were extrapolated and analysed. The meta-analysis was conducted using the “Cochrane Collaboration’s Review Manager” software in all the case series and in the sub-groups identified by the experimental design (parallel or crossover design), range of dosages (32 - 48 mg/day) and range of treatment duration (from 3 weeks to 4 months).

40|$|Dizziness {{is largely}} {{a problem in the}} elderly, being the most common reason {{patients}} over the age of 75 years seek medical attention. The term is used to describe many sensations, including vertigo, disequilibrium and light-headedness. There are different causes of dizziness in older people such as cardiovascular, neurological or locomotor disease, deterioration in sensory organs, vestibular dysfunction and adverse drug effects. Distinctions between the effects of aging and borderline pathology on instability and falls are not always clear-cut. The elderly's greater risk of balance disorders stems from a higher likelihood of impairments or diseases affecting the physiological subsystems underlying the complex skill of balancing. Diagnosing a specific cause of dizziness or vertigo in older people can be a challenge, since the symptom descriptions are often vague and examination findings overlap among potential causes. Once a differential diagnosis is formulated, {{it is not clear what}} tests – if any – will add clinical value. Intervention needs to be tailored to each patient to obtain the maximum effect, designing different exercises for individuals with different kinds of deficiency. Vestibular dysfunction in the elderly can be treated effectively with vestibular rehabilitation, which comprises both a ‘generic’ type and more specific protocols. Moreover, all the following interventions may have a role: exercises designed specifically to improve muscle function and to address sarcopenia, visual deficit treatment, pacemakers, vitamin D supplementation, gradual withdrawal of psychotropic medication, multifaceted podiatry and hip protectors, cognitive behavioural interventions, home safety assessment and modification interventions. In many cases, a multifactorial approach could be the best solution, as the elderly are frequently affected by multiple deficiencies. There is strong scientific evidence that rehabilitation has a significant role for multisensory dizziness, vestibular hypofunction and locomotor pathologies. More research is needed to evaluate the benefit of rehabilitation for neurological causes and benign <b>positional</b> paroxysmal <b>vertigo...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} {{this thesis is about}} investigation of the two less well understood mechanisms of balance system, namely utricular function and interactions of visual and vestibular system. Utricules are part of otolith apparatus and sense linear acceleration including gravity and lateral head tilts. Recent advances in rotational technology allow robust methods of assessment of unilateral utricular function using centrifugation techniques. Unilateral centrifugation generates substantial linear acceleration and the utricular response can be measured via tilt perception using subjective visual vertical (chapter 2). Utricular function was studied in common vestibular disorders seen in clinics, like chronic vestibular neuritis, benign <b>positional</b> paroxysmal <b>vertigo,</b> unilateral Ménière’s disease, migraine and bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Bilateral vestibular hypofunction produced significantly low utricular gain (chapter 3). A detailed study of the utricular function of larger group of unilateral Ménière’s disease showed significantly greater utricular asymmetry and lower utricular gain than normal controls. Interestingly, hearing loss was a predictor of utricular asymmetry (chapter 4). There was poor correlation between subjective measures and audiovestibular function. The chronic course of Ménière’s disease is well known with slow decline over years and absence of correlation between symptoms and function may point to ‘burn out’ as long term phenomenon (chapter 5). An investigation into visual dependence and vertigo was performed to understand the effect of visual dependence on tilt perception in chronic vertigo. Individuals with vestibular symptoms can have increased visual dependency and migraineurs can have a non-adaptable increase in visual dependency (chapter 6). In summary, we found that the unilateral centrifugation is a safe and well tolerated technique and provides additional, potentially useful information about utricular function. In future, the study of utricular function during acute phases of vertigo will further help overall understanding of otolith pathophysiology and mechanisms used for compensation. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{association}} between hearing and balance disorders with migraine is known since {{the times of}} the ancient Greeks, when Aretaeus from Cappadocia in 131 B. C, made an accurate and detailed description of this occurrence during a migraine episode. We present a broad review of migraine neurotological manifestations, using the most recent publications associated with epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnostic methods and treatment for this syndrome. Aimto describe the clinical entity: “Migraine associated with auditory-vestibular dysfunction” {{in order to help}} otorhinolaryngologists and neurologists in the diagnosis and management of such disorder. Final RemarksThere is a strong {{association between}} neurotological symptoms and migraine, and the auditory-vestibular dysfunction-associated migraine is {{the most common cause of}} spontaneous episodic vertigo (non-positional). Symptoms may vary broadly among patients, making it a diagnostic challenge to the otorhinolaryngologist. This entity usually presents with <b>positional</b> or spontaneous <b>vertigo</b> spells, lasting for seconds or days, associated with migraine symptoms. A better understanding of the relationship between central vestibular mechanisms and migraine mechanisms, besides the discovery of ionic channel disorders in some cases of migraine, ataxia and vertigo, may lead to a better understanding of migraine pathophysiology associated with audio-vestibular disorder...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar o diagnóstico otoneurológico de idosos com tontura e a interferência deste sintoma na qualidade de vida. MÉTODOS: Trata-se de um estudo transversal, realizado com 56 idosos com tontura, com média de idade de 71, 2 anos, submetidos à avaliação otoneurológica que envolveu: audiometria tonal, audiometria vocal, imitanciometria, provas de equilíbrio, pesquisa do nistagmo e vertigem de posição e posicionamento e vectoeletronistagmografia. Para avaliar a qualidade de vida, utilizou-se um questionário específico para tontura, o Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), que verifica os efeitos incapacitantes provocados por este distúrbio. RESULTADOS: A tontura rotatória foi referida por 29 pacientes (51, 8 %), 75 % apresentaram alguma queixa auditiva e 69, 6 % apresentaram audiometria alterada. Os pacientes com queixas {{vestibular}}es de tontura posicional apresentaram diferença significativa para o aspecto físico do DHI. Já os pacientes com queixas vestibulares de desequilíbrio apresentaram diferença significativa para os aspectos funcional e emocional. A vectoeletronistagmografia computadorizada esteve alterada em 47 pacientes (83, 9 %), indicando comprometimento vestibular periférico em todos os casos. No exame pós-calórico, a hiperreflexia foi a alteração mais prevalente e o diagnóstico mais frequente foi o de síndrome Vestibular Periférica Deficitária à Esquerda. Com relação à qualidade de vida, o aspecto funcional apresentou o maior escore médio entre os três aspectos avaliados, e observou-se diferença significativa entre os aspectos funcional e o emocional. CONCLUSÃO: Idosos com tontura apresentam, em sua maioria, alterações na audiometria e na vectoeletronistagmografia, indicando disfunção do sistema cócleo-vestibular; apresentam também qualidade de vida comprometida. PURPOSE: To {{verify the}} otoneurologic diagnosis of elderly individuals with dizziness and the interference of this symptom in {{their quality of}} life. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, conducted with 56 elderly individuals with dizziness. Subjects' mean age was 71. 2 years, and they were submitted to otoneurologic assessment, which involved: pure-tone, speech and impedance audiometry, balance assessment, testing for <b>positional</b> and positioning <b>vertigo</b> and nystagmus, and vectoelectronystagmography. A specific questionnaire for dizziness {{was used to assess}} the quality of life, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), which verifies the handicap effects provoked by this symptom. RESULTS: Rotatory dizziness was reported by 29 patients (51. 8 %), 75 % presented some hearing complaint, and 69. 6 % had altered results in audiometry. Patients with vestibular complaints of positional dizziness presented significant difference for the physical aspect of the DHI. Patients with vestibular complaints of imbalance showed significant difference for the functional and emotional aspects. The computerized vectoelectronystagmography was altered in 47 patients (83. 9 %), indicating peripheral vestibular disorder in all cases.
