40|$|Abstract: From {{the early}} 1990 s onwards, {{a number of}} {{countries}} emerging from civil conflict have undergone extensive democratic and economic liberal reform via a process of post-conflict peace-building. Underlying such a process is the hegemonic discourse of liberal peace that aims to reconstruct and develop post-conflict societies along the core ideas of democratization, economic liberalization, respect for human rights and rule of law. Its implementation is generally assumed to be universally beneficial and thus acceptable to all. However, this article suggests {{that this is not the}} case as such liberalization can produce inequality, exacerbate perceptions of relative depriva-tion that cause a resurgence in post-conflict interpersonal violence and crime. In order to shed light on the discrepancy between its normative positive assumptions with the contrasting reality of its outcomes, this article provides a necessary critique of liberal peace discourse by examining its liberal economic underpinnings. In doing so, this article proposes that the liberal peace agenda embodies inequalities and fails to consider the long-term impact of economic liberalization and its relationship with rising levels of post-war crime and violence. as such, the legitimacy of the liberal peace as a route to post-war development is <b>put</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> and subjected to theoretical scrutiny...|$|R

Whilst public housing has received special attention due to extensive coverage in the media, the quality of private housing has seldom been <b>put</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight,</b> thereby raising <b>the</b> question as to whether private sector works are of better quality than public sector works. Faced with this question and the increasing drive towards benchmarking in the construction industry, it appears that an objective measure of quality is necessary, both for providing feedback to designers and for raising the quality standards of construction works. Being inspired by the benefits brought about by the CONQUAS system in Singapore, the Housing Authority in Hong Kong had developed and implemented the PASS system for benchmarking workmanship quality in the public housing sector since 1990. As yet, there has not been any similar measure of construction quality in the private sector. Therefore, a recent survey was conducted in Hong Kong to evaluate the need for a quality assessment system for the private sector.

In the Saudi Arabian higher education sector, however, quality assurance is a relatively new concept. The National Commission for Academic Accreditation and Assessment (NCAAA) in 2009 developed a set of Standards for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, applied to all higher educational universities in Saudi Arabia, both public and private (NCAAA, 2009). This study aims to investigate the status quo of quality assurance in the Saudi Arabian higher education system by <b>putting</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>the</b> quality assurance practices of two specific Saudi Arabian universities (namely, Prince Sultan University [PSU] and King Abdulaziz University [KAU]), and thereby to contribute to both closing the literature gap on the Saudi Arabian higher education system and development of internal quality assurance model. This is a qualitative, multiple-case study that takes up data on the opinions and perceptions of university administrative staff and faculty at both KAU and PSU related to QA. Document analysis and semi-structured interview were collected to address the research questions, and relying on the insights of institutional theory, participants were divided into two groups to compare perceptions at the meso versus the micro level. Data analysis at each level elaborated thematic categories, subcategories, and key themes followed by sequence compressions analysis using two approaches to comparison, namely the vertical, within-case comparison and the horizontal, across-case comparison. In addition, textual verbatim excerpts from the interviews are included to highlight and clarify the key concepts (themes) revealed. NVivo 10 qualitative analysis software was used to assist in the coding and development of patterns from the data. From the elaboration of thematic categories and the comparison of elements and categories throughout the analysis, the overarching themes developed represent the perceptions of stakeholders at each level in each case institution in relation to the associated research questions.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Genetic {{studies have}} {{provided}} ample {{evidence of the}} influence of non-coding DNA polymorphisms on trait variance, particularly those occurring within transcription factor binding sites. Protein binding microarrays and other platforms that can map these sites with great precision have enhanced our understanding of how a single nucleotide polymorphism can alter binding potential within an in vitro setting allowing for greater predictive capability of its effect on a transcription factor binding site. RESULTS: We have used protein binding microarrays and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay-Sequencing (EMSA-Seq), a deep sequencing based method we developed to analyze nine distinct human Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) dimers. This family of transcription factors {{is one of the most}} extensively studied, but our understanding of its DNA binding preferences has been limited to the originally described consensus motif, GGRRNNYYCC. We highlight differences between NF-kappaB family members and also <b>put</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> non-canonical motifs that have so far received little attention. We utilize our data to interpret the binding of transcription factors between individuals across 1405 genomic regions laden with single nucleotide polymorphisms. We also associated binding correlations made using our data with risk alleles of disease and demonstrate its utility as a tool for functional studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms in regulatory regions. CONCLUSIONS: NF-kappaB dimers bind specifically to non-canonical motifs and these can be found within genomic regions in which a canonical motif is not evident. Binding affinity data generated with these different motifs can be used in conjunction with data from Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to enable allele-specific analyses of expression and transcription factor-DNA interactions on a genome-wide scale...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic brain {{injuries}} {{have recently been}} <b>put</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> {{as one of the}} most important causes of accidental brain dysfunctions. Significant experimental and modeling efforts are thus underway to study the associated biological, mechanical and physical mechanisms. In the field of cell mechanics, progress is also being made at the experimental and modeling levels to better characterize many of the cell functions, including differentiation, growth, migration and death. The work presented here aims to bridge both efforts by proposing a continuum model of a neuronal cell submitted to blast loading. In this approach, the cytoplasm, nucleus and membrane (plus cortex) are differentiated in a representative cell geometry, and different suitable material constitutive models are chosen for each one. The material parameters are calibrated against published experimental work on cell nanoindentation at multiple rates. The final cell model is ultimately subjected to blast loading within a complete computational framework of fluid-structure interaction. The results are compared to the nanoindentation simulation, and the specific effects of the blast wave on the pressure and shear levels at the interfaces are identified. As a conclusion, the presented model successfully captures some of the intrinsic intracellular phenomena occurring during <b>the</b> cellular deformation <b>under</b> blast loading that potentially lead to cell damage. It suggests, more particularly, that the localization of damage at the nucleus membrane is similar to what has already been observed at the overall cell membrane. This degree of damage is additionally predicted to be worsened by a longer blast positive phase duration. In conclusion, the proposed model ultimately provides a new three-dimensional computational tool to evaluate intracellular damage during blast loading...|$|R
40|$|Magnesium (Mg) alloys have {{recently}} been <b>put</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> for their specific strength, the highest among structural metals. Although the mechanical behavior of Mg alloys at quasi-static strain rates has been extensively modelled in the recent years, high strain rate studies have been much scarcer. This is mainly due to the rate dependent (RD) mechanical response of their hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystalline structure. As a result, existing RD models do {{not account for the}} differentiated rate sensitivities of each slip and twin systems. Instead, the rate dependency is often conceived as a numerical artefact utilised to smooth the elasto-plastic transition and facilitate the scheme convergence. We thus propose a novel efficient RD crystal plasticity model for hcp metals, applied here to a rolled Mg AZ 31 alloy sheet at room temperature. The constitutive RD equations are solved at each time step by either a Newton-Raphson based implicit scheme or an explicit scheme modified so as to ensure convergence independently of the stochastic bursts of slip systems inherent to such approach. Most of the model parameters are taken from the previously calibrated RI model of Fernandez et al. (2011), except for the new RD variables (strain rate sensitivity coefficients and reference shear strain rates), taken from the literature when available, or chosen so as to fulfill full compatibility with the <b>the</b> RI model <b>under</b> quasi-static conditions. <b>The</b> model is validated against uniaxial compression tests at high strain rate (10 ^ 3 s^- 1), in the rolling and normal directions. The results reveal the ability of the model to simulate the mechanical behavior of Mg AZ 31 alloy under a very large range of loading rates. To the best of the knowledge of the authors, the proposed model is the first RD continuum model for hcp metals involving physically accurate slip and twin system rate sensitivities, while ensuring convergence...|$|R

Can an urban textual sound identity be derived from these differences and similarities? The approach employed to answer these questions is a new, cross-disciplinary one to urban sound in literature, moving beyond reading the key sounds of the urban soundscape using urban musicology, sensorial anthropology and cultural poetics towards a literary contextualisation of the urban aural experience. The literary motifs of the symphony, the gramophone and urban noise are <b>put</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> through <b>the</b> analysis of a wide range of modernist works by authors who have a special relationship with music. At the centre of this analysis are the Kaffeehausliteratur authors Hermann Bahr, Alfred Polgar and Peter Altenberg, the then Munich-based author Thomas Mann and the lesser known René Schickele. The analysis of these particular works is framed in the music-geographical context of the Musikstadt and literary underpinnings of this topos, ranging from Ingeborg Bachmann to Hans Mayer and, once again, Thomas Mann. In analysing these texts, the methodological approach devised by Strohm, who identifies the blending of a range of urban sounds as a definition of urban space and identity, is applied. His ideas combine historical literary analysis, musical history and urban sociology. They are rarely used in the analysis of the auditory environment.
