40|$|Preliminary draft We {{study the}} impact of piracy on the quality choices of a {{monopolist}}. In the absence of piracy, the monopolist has no incentive to differentiate its products. With piracy the monopolist might instead produce more than one quality, hence differentiation arises as the optimal strategy. This is because the producer wants to divert consumers from the <b>pirated</b> <b>good</b> to the original one. Differentiation involves either producing a low-quality good such that piracy is eliminated or the monopolist can choose qualities such that piracy is still observed in equilibrium...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Copyright {{infringement}} {{in markets}} of information goods [...] -commonly known as piracy [...] -has remained amongst the top {{concerns for the}} manufacturers {{as well as for}} governments around the world. There exists an extensive body of literature that discusses the issue of piracy along with possible remedies and responses for the manufacturers and policymakers. In my dissertation, I intend to contribute to that stream. First, I study the economic impact of piracy on the supply chain of information goods. When information goods are sold to consumers via a retailer, in certain situations, a moderate dose of piracy seems to have a surprising positive impact on the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer, while, at the same time, enhancing consumer welfare. Clearly, such a "win-win-win" situation is not only good for the overall supply chain, but is also beneficial for the overall economy. I argue that the economic rationale for this surprising result is rooted in how piracy interacts with the problem of double marginalization. I explain this rationale and develop useful insights for management and policy. Moving on to the supply-side of piracy [...] -which has largely been abstracted away in prior literature [...] -I compare the effects of different types of anti-piracy policies. I propose a clear distinction between efforts that restrict supply of <b>pirated</b> <b>goods</b> (supply-side enforcement) and those that penalize illegal consumption (demand-side enforcement). In my effort to compare these two different types of enforcement, I construct a parsimonious model that endogenizes the supply of <b>pirated</b> <b>goods.</b> Specifically, I capture the reality that download activities generate ad revenues for the uploaders in the piracy ecosystem, and it is that mechanism that incentivizes the suppliers of <b>pirated</b> <b>goods</b> to upload illegal content. In my analyses, perhaps expectedly, I find the two types of anti-piracy measures to have similar impacts on the profit and welfares in the short-run, where the cost of development is sunk, and the decision of the firm is only about pricing the product. However, surprisingly, in the long-run [...] -where the manufacturer can respond to piracy by changing its product quality as well [...] -the two different enforcement measures may have contrasting socioeconomic implications. All in all, supply-side enforcement turns out to have a much more desirable impact in the long run. I provide explanations for my findings and discuss the implications from the perspectives of the manufacturer, consumers, and policymakers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the optimal choice of pricing schedules and technological deterrence levels {{in a market}} with digital piracy where sellers can influence the degree of piracy by implementing digital rights management (DRM) systems. It is shown that a monopolist’s optimal pricing schedule {{can be characterized as}} a simple combination of the zero-piracy pricing schedule and a piracy-indifferent pricing schedule that makes all customers indifferent between legal usage and piracy. An increase in the quality of <b>pirated</b> <b>goods,</b> while lowering prices and profits, increases total surplus by expanding both the fraction of legal users and the volume of legal usage. In the absence of price discrimination, a seller’s optimal level of technology-based protection against piracy is shown to be at the technologically maximal level, which maximizes the difference between the quality of the legal and <b>pirated</b> <b>goods.</b> However, when a seller can price discriminate, its optimal choice is always a strictly lower level of technology-based protection. These results are based on the following digital rights conjecture: that granting digital rights increases the incidence of digital piracy, and that managing digital rights therefore involves restricting the rights of usage that contribute to customer value. Moreover, if a digital rights management system weakens over time due to the underlying technology being progressively hacked, a seller’s optimal strategic response may involve either increasing or decreasing its level of technology-based protection. This direction of change is related to whether the DRM technology implementing each marginal reduction in piracy is increasingly less or more vulnerable to hacking. Pricing and technology choice guidelines are presented, and some welfare implications are discussed. Key words: piracy; digital piracy; piracy deterrence; copyright; digital rights management; DRM; nonlinear pricing; price discrimination; screening; intellectual property; enforcemen...|$|R

40|$|The {{counterfeiting}} and piracy phenomena {{have been}} investigated across a multitude of fields, from ethics to marketing, from law to business, from criminology to psychology. While the number of contributions has been substantial, the research on both demand and supply analyses have been fragmented and, at times, contradicting. Such inconsistencies emphasize how {{more research is needed}} to clarify the complexity of consumer complicity with counterfeit and <b>pirated</b> <b>goods</b> while systemizing the existing managerial solutions to fight against these instances. Such a clarification can help stem consumer demand and provide meaningful suggestions to companies. The fil rouge guiding the development of this thesis is that it is important to delve into both the demand-side and the supply-side of the phenomena, paying close attention to the areas that have been understudied in the reference literature. With this in mind, the objectives of this thesis are to answer the following research questions: 1. What has the research on counterfeiting and piracy covered and what is still lacking? Which are the areas of the phenomena that need to be further investigated? (Chapter 1) 2. What aspects of consumer complicity with illicit goods has the consumer behavior literature investigated? What are the main overarching frameworks employed? What future paths could research undertake to further delve into consumer attitudes and behaviors towards counterfeiting and piracy? (Chapter 2) 3. More in detail, is it possible to develop and validate a general model of consumer complicity with <b>pirated</b> <b>goods</b> that includes a variety of determinants and is valid across multiple countries? (Chapter 3) 4. Furthermore, how does consumers’ attitude toward online piracy influence their willingness to try legal alternatives to the phenomenon, such as subscription-based music services? (Chapter 4) 5. What anti-counterfeiting and anti-piracy strategies has the managerial literature put forth, both theoretically and empirically? What solutions could further be suggested to managers who fight against illicit trade every day? (Chapter 5) 6. Which strategies constitute a synthetic and practical brand protection/anti-counterfeiting framework? And how is this framework useful in the fight against the current challenges posed by the counterfeiting phenomenon, both offline and online? (Chapter 6) 7. What are managers’ perspectives on the causes of counterfeiting and how are they managed? In addition, what aspects of a brand protection/anti-counterfeiting framework require special, dedicated attention? (Chapter 7) The thesis is organized into three parts, and contains a total of seven chapters. Part I (Chapter 1) provides a comprehensive overview of the counterfeiting and piracy phenomena. Part II (Chapters 2 - 4) begins with a literature review of the academic research on consumer behavior with illicit goods, and then focuses strictly and quantitatively on consumers’ attitudes and intentions towards <b>pirated</b> <b>goods,</b> movies and music specifically, in both the offline and online context. Part III (Chapters 5 - 7) provides the supply-side perspective; after a literature review of the managerial literature on the anti-counterfeiting and anti-piracy solutions, this section employs a qualitative approach to examine corporate anti-counterfeiting strategies, offline and online, with specific reference to the fashion, luxury and non-luxury, industries.
