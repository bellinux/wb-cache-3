50|$|The {{extinction}} {{of nearly all}} animal species {{at the end of}} the Permian <b>Period</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> the radiation of many new lifeforms. In particular, the {{extinction of}} the large herbivorous pareiasaurs and carnivorous gorgonopsians left those ecological niches empty. Some were filled by the surviving cynodonts and dicynodonts, the latter of which subsequently became extinct.|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} the RP-77D made {{extensive}} use of glass-polyester plastic materials. The drone was launched using a rocket-assisted take-off system consisting of four Loki rockets, and was fitted with a radio control apparatus that, {{with the assistance of}} radar tracking, allowed the drone to be operated at a considerable distance from its launching point. In addition to equipment typically carried by target drones, the RP-77D could be equipped with reconnaissance or meteorological sensors, or with air sampling equipment. The RP-77D utilised the RPTA tracking system, developed by Radioplane, using audio frequency tones for control. Tip tanks <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>carriage</b> of additional fuel to extend the aircraft's range, and recovery {{at the end of the}} flight was by parachute.|$|R

50|$|The Japanese defense {{industry}} {{is the major}} supplier of the nation's own Self-Defense Forces. Production costs are high, due to several factors: the successful Japanese economy of the postwar <b>period</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> generous defense spending; few products are exported, keeping production numbers low; research and development is done independently where possible, securing national self-sustainability; public investment in Japan tends to be uneconomic, aimed largely at gaining local voter support.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} land {{sales in}} the suburb included the Palace Hotel and a Wesleyan Church, both acquired in 1879. In 1886, the borough had a population of approximately 6,000, with approximately 20 new buildings opening each month. Low-lying land {{in the south of}} the suburb, near the present-day JJ Holland Park, was filled in around the same <b>period,</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> the construction of the Gillespie Mill adjacent to the railway line.|$|R
50|$|This <b>period</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> {{the fusion}} of single protons and {{deuterium}} nuclei to form helium and lithium nuclei but was too short for every H+ ion to be reconstituted into heavier elements. In this case, helium, atomic number 2, remains the even numbered counterpart to hydrogen. Thus, neutral hydrogen - or hydrogen paired with an electron, the only stable lepton - constituted {{the vast majority of}} the remaining unannihilated portions of matter following the conclusion of inflation.|$|R

5000|$|Some breads begin {{mixing with}} an autolyse. This {{refers to a}} period of rest after the initial mixing of flour and water, a rest period that occurs {{sequentially}} before the addition of yeast, salt and other ingredients. [...] This rest <b>period</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> better absorption of water and helps the gluten and starches to align. The autolyse is credited to Raymond Calvel, who recommended {{it as a way}} to reduce kneading time and thereby improve the flavor and color of bread.|$|R
30|$|The control {{variables}} of algorithm 1 are continuous {{with respect to}} time, as such the algorithm approximates optimal control as constant for any given time step. However, each central iteration of Algorithm 2 will trigger optimal values to be updated by the local controller and so the control update rate is dependent only on the central coordinator’s update rate. This brief <b>period</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> regular corrections to the optimal control in response to system state changes which are assumed minimal within the update period.|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest a}} {{geometrical}} framework to discuss periodic layered {{structures in the}} unit disk. The band gaps appear when the point representing the system approaches the unit circle. We show that the trace of the matrix describing the basic <b>period</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> a classification in three families of orbits with quite different properties. The laws of convergence of the iterates to the unit circle can be then considered as universal features of the reflection. Comment: 3 pages, 2 eps-figures. To be published in Optics Letter...|$|R

5000|$|By {{the first}} half of September 2008, there was {{widespread}} speculation that the election could be again delayed to early 2009. Gbagbo said in mid-September that a delay to 15 December would be needed unless the <b>period</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> challenges to the electoral register was truncated; however, CEI President Robert Mambé said on 18 September that such a delay was [...] "out of the question" [...] for the time being, noting that the CEI considered meeting the 30 November date to be [...] "a moral obligation".|$|R
5000|$|In 150 AD, Caelia Macrina left {{money for}} the {{construction}} of a building in Tarracina, Italy and at the same time endowed an alimentary fund (to provide cash grants for food) for 200 children. Alimentary grants could either be private or governmental, and were customarily larger for boys than for girls. The shorter <b>period</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> girls to receive support reflects their younger age at marriage (often 13 or 14 years). Caelia followed this pattern but was more generous to girls than was usual.|$|R

50|$|Commercial vinegar is {{produced}} either by a fast or a slow fermentation processes. In general, slow methods {{are used in}} traditional vinegars where fermentation proceeds slowly {{over the course of}} a few months or up to a year. The longer fermentation <b>period</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> the accumulation of a non-toxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria. Fast methods add mother of vinegar (bacterial culture) to the source liquid before adding air to oxygenate and promote the fastest fermentation. In fast production processes, vinegar may be produced between 20 hours to three days.|$|R
50|$|Huntsman and Barber (1977) {{hypothesized}} that high productivity results from alternating upwelling events and relatively calm periods. Upwelling {{is necessary to}} bring the nutrients to the surface but if the event is sustained {{for a long period}} of time, it is tough for phytoplankton to remain in the euphotic zone. Calm <b>periods</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> stratification to develop, which means that phytoplankton can grow and multiply while held in the shallow mixed layer. In other words, there is a miniature spring bloom during each calm period (Mann & Lazier, 1996).|$|R
