The rates of transcription of the auxin-responsive sequences were 10 - to 100 -fold greater with nuclei {{isolated from}} auxin-treated <b>plumules</b> than with those from untreated <b>plumules.</b> The transcriptional response was also observed with hypocotyls of intact soybean seedlings and hypocotyl sections, {{as well as with}} green bean and mung bean <b>plumules</b> that were treated with 2, 4 -D. Other auxins, including 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid, and indole- 3 -acetic acid, also induced the transcriptional response. Increased transcription rates were observed within 5 min after application of auxins to excised <b>plumules,</b> and half-maximal to maximal transcription rates were achieved by 15 min after application of auxins. As little as 10 (- 7) to 10 (- 8) M 2, 4 -D induced a transcriptional response, but maximal transcription rates were achieved at 10 (- 3) M 2, 4 -D. Brief treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not inhibit the induction of transcription by auxins.

Synthesis of many polypeptides normally made under 2 ̆ 7 control 2 ̆ 7 conditions (25 dollar∘dollarC) is reduced and new and/or enhanced synthesis {{of a group}} of heat shock polypeptides (HSPs) is induced (108 kD, 89 kD, 84 kD, 76 kD, 73 kD, 23 KD and 18 to 19 kD). Certain heavy metals and the insecticide methomyl cause similar alterations in the patterns of polypeptide synthesis in maize <b>plumules</b> and/or radicles. Synthesis of 2 ̆ 7 control polypeptides, 2 ̆ 7 including a major 93 kD polypeptide, is reduced and new and/or enhanced synthesis of polypeptides with Mdollarlcub rrcubdollars and pIs similar to the maize HSPs is induced. Antibodies raised against the 18 to 19 kD maize HSPs recognize 18 to 19 kD polypeptides synthesized by <b>plumules</b> and/or radicles in response to treatment with the heavy metals, Cadmium, Zinc or Copper, or in response to methomyl treatment.;The intensity of the response generated in maize <b>plumules</b> or radicles depends on the stressor, the concentration used and on the tissue treated. No stressor used in this study induces the quantity of HSP synthesis induced by heat shock (a 25 dollar∘dollarC to 42 dollar∘dollarC shift).;Patterns of polypeptide synthesis in methomyl-treated <b>plumules</b> of maize seedlings that possess a normal mitochondrial genome or a mitochondrial genome encoding methomyl sensitivity (cytoplasmic male-sterile T; cms-T) are similar at all methomyl concentrations tested. Methomyl sensitivity of cms-T plants is due to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. The demonstration that possession of methomyl-sensitive mitochondria has no effect on induction characteristics of HSP-like polypeptides by methomyl, suggests that the uncoupling action of methomyl is not related to the induction of HSP-like polypeptide synthesis by methomyl.;A preliminary characterization of mRNAs encoding 18 to 19 kD HSPs in heat-shocked maize <b>plumules</b> by size fractionation and in vitro translation analyses reveals that the mRNAs encoding 18 to 19 kD HSPs are 0. 6 to 0. 95 kb in size...|$|R
25|$|Seed {{germination}} is {{a process}} by which a seed embryo develops into a seedling.

Just so may be seen--I have seen--a large flagstone lifted in a night by a crop of tiny soft toadstools which have suddenly blossomed up beneath it. The baby's finger protrudes at last, and curves upward toward the light, to commence the campaign of life: but it has meanwhile established, like a good strategist, a safe base of operations in its rear, from which it intends to draw supplies. Into the albuminous cream which lines the shell, and into the cavity where the milk once was, it throws out white fibrous vessels, which eat up the albumen for it, and at last line the whole inside of the shell with a white pith.

But there can be no doubt that embryonic, excluding larval characters, are of the highest value for classification, not only with animals but with plants. Thus the main divisions of flowering plants are founded on differences in the embryo--on the number and position of the cotyledons, and on the mode of development of the <b>plumule</b> and radicle.

Synthesis of some, but not all, 25 dollar∘dollarC (control) proteins is repressed in vivo. RNA blot and {{in vitro translation}} analyses of non-polyribosomal and polyribosomal RNP RNA suggest that repression ensues from either a decrease in mRNA levels or from the inefficient translation of control messages in heat-shocked cells (relative to heat shock mRNAs) due {{to changes in the}} rates of both initiation and elongation.;Hsp 70 and hsp 18 mRNAs (or heat shock-like mRNAs) are synthesized at low levels in nonstressed cells. During heat shock, the messages accumulate on polyribosomes within 5 to 10 minutes, are maximal within 1 to 2 h and decline thereafter (ie. maize <b>plumules</b> acclimate). The recovery profile is similar. Dissociation of message from the polyribosomes under these conditions is not accompanied by a re-association of heat shock mRNAs with non-polyribosomal RNPs suggesting that (1) the messages released from the polyribosomes are degraded and (2) the mechanism(s) governing these responses is independent of the incubation temperature. Acclimation and recovery are not characterized by a complete return to the control state as low molecular weight heat shock mRNAs continue to associate with the polyribosomal and non-polyribosomal fractions.;Heat shock and control mRNAs are differentially distributed in the non-polyribosomal RNP of control cells. However, messages active in translation at 25 dollar∘dollarC are primarily associated with cytoskeletally-associated polyribosomes. Heat shock results in a change in both the distribution of heat shock mRNAs on the ribosomes of polyribosomes and their non-polyribosomal to polyribosomal ratios. Heat shock mRNAs accumulate primarily in the free-cytoplasmic non-polyribosomal and polyribosomal fractions suggesting that translation and possibly transport of these messages during heat shock is largely independent of the cytoskeleton. The negligible changes in the equilibrium of membrane-derived non-polyribosomal fractions together with the accumulation of mRNAs destined for the endoplasmic reticulum in free-cytoplasmic non-polyribosomal RNP are consistent with this interpretation. Neither the distribution of 25 dollar∘dollarC mRNAs on polyribosomes nor their equilibrium between non-polyribosomal and polyribosomal RNP 2 ̆ 7 s is affected by the temperature shift.;The kinetics of association/dissociation of mRNAs with the non-polyribosomal and polyribosomal RNP indicate that heat shock messages associate with non-polyribosomal RNP prior to their integration into polyribosomes...|$|R

Embryos have been cryopreserved by preculture-dehydration for 24 h, 28 h, 30 h, 34 h, 38 h and 48 h on agar medium containing 600 g/L of glucose combined with silica gel. The <b>plumules</b> were cryopreserved by encapsulation dehydration on solid medium containing 0. 5 M, 0. 75 M and 1 M followed by dehydration with 40 g of silica gel for different durations before rapid freezing. This study indicates that the damages undergone by seed samples {{can be divided into}} three types. The first stage of changes concerned the plasmolysis of cells with small vacuoles, condensation of chromatin, changing in the conformation of the DNA and the nucleus and stopping of mitosis. These types of changes are described in general {{in the context of a}} desiccation tolerance. The second degree of the changes was the retraction of the cytoplasm inside the cell, the increase in the periplasmic volume. The third degree of modification concerned the deformation of the walls, the invagination or the lysis of the plasma membrane resulting in the observation of distorted cells and and the bursting of the nucleus. These two types of modifications are irreversible and correspond to an absence of regrowth of the samples. Understanding the damage or changes that occur in cryopreserved cells is an important part of understanding how dehydration and frozen affect the viability of recalcitrant plants cells. These changes are made by dehydration and accentuated by freezing...|$|R
