30|$|Congenital {{absence of}} the left {{pericardium}} results from the incomplete formation of the <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membrane,</b> which is caused by premature atrophy of the left duct of Moore [7]. Congenital pericardial defects occur in fewer than one in 10, 000 cases [8] and present three times more frequently in men than in women [9]. Complete left-sided pericardial defects are the most common, accounting for 70 % of all reported defects [10]. However, many asymptomatic cases of congenital pericardial defects escape detection, {{and a large number}} of these may involve partial left-sided defects that are small and difficult to diagnose even if they present as minor electrocardiogram abnormalities [11].|$|E
40|$|The <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membranes</b> are fibro-serous {{walls that}} {{separate}} the pericardial and pleural cavities and anchor the heart inside the mediastinum. Partial or {{complete absence of}} <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membranes</b> is a rare human disease, the etiology of which is poorly understood. As an attempt to better understand these defects, we wished to analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms directing the separation of pericardial and pleural cavities by <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membranes</b> in the mouse. We found by histological analyses that both in Tbx 18 - and Wt 1 -deficient mice the pleural and pericardial cavities communicate due to a partial absence of the <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membranes</b> in the hilus region. We trace these defects to a persisting embryonic connection between these cavities, the pericardioperitoneal canals. Furthermore, we identify mesenchymal ridges in the sinus venosus region that tether the growing <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membranes</b> to the hilus of the lung, and thus, close the pericardioperitoneal canals. In Tbx 18 -deficient embryos these mesenchymal ridges are not established, whereas in Wt 1 -deficient embryos the final fusion process between these tissues and the body wall does not occur. We suggest that this fusion is an active rather than a passive process, and discuss the interrelation between closure of the pericardioperitoneal canals, lateral release of the <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membranes</b> from the lateral body wall, and sinus horn developmen...|$|R
50|$|Initially the intraembryonic coelom is one {{continuous}} space. During development {{this space}} partitions {{to form the}} pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities. The diaphragm and the paired <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membranes</b> separate the coelomic cavity into four parts. From the splanchnopleura (the visceral mesodermal layer) develops the visceral pleura and from the somatopleura (parietal mesodermal layer) develops the parietal pleura.|$|R
50|$|The {{diaphragm}} {{divides the}} body cavity into the thoracic and peritoneal cavities. It develops from four components: the septum transversum (central tendon), the pleuroperitoneal membranes, the dorsal mesentery of the esophagus, and muscular components from somites at cervical levels {{three to five}} (C3-5) of the body wall. Since the septum transversum is located initially opposite cervical segments of three to five, and since muscle cells for the diaphragm originate from somites at these segments, the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, also arises from these segments of the spinal cord (C3, 4, and 5). The thoracic cavity is divided into the pericardial cavity and two pleural cavities for the lungs by the <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membranes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Rationale: The cardiac venous pole is {{a common}} focus of {{congenital}} malformations and atrial arrhythmias, yet {{little is known about}} the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate its development. The systemic venous return myocardium (sinus node and sinus horns) forms only late in cardiogenesis from a pool of pericardial mesenchymal precursor cells. Objective: To analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms directing the formation of the fetal sinus horns. Methods and Results: We analyzed embryos deficient for the Wt 1 (Wilms tumor 1) gene and observed a failure to form myocardialized sinus horns. Instead, the cardinal veins become embedded laterally in the <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membranes</b> that remain tethered to the lateral body wall by the persisting subcoelomic mesenchyme, a finding that correlates with decreased apoptosis in this region. We show by expression analysis and lineage tracing studies that Wt 1 is expressed in the subcoelomic mesenchyme surrounding the cardinal veins, but that this Wt 1 -positive mesenchyme does not contribute cells to the sinus horn myocardium. Expression of the Raldh 2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A 2) gene was lost from this mesenchyme in Wt 1 (-/-) embryos. Phenotypic analysis of Raldh 2 mutant mice rescued from early cardiac defects by retinoic acid food supply revealed defects of the venous pole and pericardium highly similar to those of Wt 1 (-/-) mice. Conclusions: Pericardium and sinus horn formation are coupled and depend on the expansion and correct temporal release of <b>pleuropericardial</b> <b>membranes</b> from the underlying subcoelomic mesenchyme. Wt 1 and downstream Raldh 2 /retinoic acid signaling are crucial regulators of this process. Thus, our results provide novel insight into the genetic and cellular pathways regulating the posterior extension of the mammalian heart and the formation of its coelomic lining.
