It allows a large quantity of cargo to be bundled into a single unit. Since this leads to fewer units to load, it saves ground crews time and effort and helps prevent delayed flights.

To address that, a new system is proposed to allow any number of different versions of packages to co-exist at any one time, and the importance of dynamic <b>packing</b> <b>lists</b> is discussed.

5000|$|American whiskey {{authority}} Charles Kendrick Cowdery believes Craig {{was making}} {{exactly the same}} kind of whiskey as most of his contemporaries, and historian Henry Crowgey calls his reputed invention of bourbon simply a [...] "charming legend". By 1785, when Bourbon County was formed, dozens (if not hundreds) of small farmer-distillers west of the Alleghenies made corn-based whiskies, which they called 'bourbon', to distinguish them from the rye-based whiskies commonly distilled in the East. No historical evidence indicates that Craig's whiskey was unique in its time, nor that he practiced charring of the aging barrels. The first known publication potentially alluding to Craig as bourbon's inventor was in 1874 (this includes a brief entry in a densely <b>packed</b> <b>list</b> without mentioning Craig himself or providing any documentation of the claim, and without any elaboration as to what distinguished the product as the first bourbon).|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a variant of}} the bin packing problem in which items may be fragmented into smaller size pieces called fragments. While there are a few applications to bin packing with item fragmentation, our model of the problem is derived from a scheduling problem present in data over CATV networks. Fragmenting an item is associated with a cost which renders the problem NP-hard. We study two possible cost functions and as a result get two variants of bin packing with item fragmentation. In the first variant, called bin packing with size-increasing fragmentation, we are asked to <b>pack</b> a <b>list</b> of items into a minimum number of unit capacity bins. Each item may be fragmented in which case overhead units are added to the size of every fragment. In the second variant we are asked to <b>pack</b> a <b>list</b> of items into a fixed number of unit capacity bins. Each item has a size and a cost and fragmenting an item increases its cost but does not change its size. The goal is to minimize the total cost. We call this variant bin packing with size-preserving fragmentation...|$|R

A bijection f from V_ 1 onto V_ 2 is a <b>list</b> <b>packing</b> of the triple (G_ 1, G_ 2, G_ 3) if uv ∈ E_ 2 implies f(u) f(v) ∉ E_ 2 and vf(v) ∉ E_ 3 for all v ∈ V_ 1. We extend the classical results of Sauer and Spencer and Bollobás and Eldridge on packing of graphs with small sizes or maximum degrees to the setting of <b>list</b> <b>packing.</b> In particular, we extend the well-known Bollobás [...] Eldridge Theorem, proving that if Δ (G_ 1) ≤ n- 2, Δ(G_ 2) ≤ n- 2, Δ(G_ 3) ≤ n- 1, and |E_ 1 | + |E_ 2 | + |E_ 3 | ≤ 2 n- 3, then either (G_ 1, G_ 2, G_ 3) packs or is one of 7 possible exceptions.
