40|$|We {{examined}} the lipid peroxidative potency and photohemolytic activity of thiazide diuretics, especially <b>penflutizide</b> (PFZ), {{to determine the}} molecular mechanism of thiazide phototoxicity. Ultraviolet A irradiation of squalene {{in the presence of}} PFZ, hydrochlorothiazide, methiclothiazide, benxylhydrochlorothiazide, or trichlormethiazide induced in vitro peroxidation as measured by production of the hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. Among the thiazides, PFZ showed the highest potency to photooxidize lipds. PFZ-photosensitized peroxidation of squalene was repressed by the presence of sodium azide or 2, 5 -dimethylfuran and was accelerated in a D 2 O suspension. These findings suggest the participation of singlet oxygen in PFZ phtoperoxidation of squalene (type II mechanism). PFZ-photosensitized lysis of red blood cells (RBC) accompanied by formation of hydroperoxides in RBC membrand lipids was also noted. These results suggest that membrane lipids {{can be one of the}} target molecules of thiazide phototoxicity...|$|E
