40|$|Informal {{workplace}} {{learning has}} become a prominent reality in the knowledge society of today. For this reason, developing appropriate learning conditions {{in order to enhance}} workplace learning is dominating organisational agendas. However, research that investigates the relationship between important learning conditions and learning outcomes resulting from informal learning is scarce. Therefore, the main {{purpose of this study is}} to explore how the learning conditions in the workplace are related to these informal learning outcomes of <b>police</b> <b>inspectors</b> in particular. A mixed method study, including a survey among 390 <b>police</b> <b>inspectors</b> and interviews with 9 <b>police</b> <b>inspectors,</b> was set up to explore this relation. Overall, the results of the survey study suggest that the learning conditions ‘information’, ‘feedback’, ‘reflection’ and ‘coaching’ are good predictors for the acquirement of ‘generic learning outcomes’ and ‘organisational level learning outcomes’. The learning condition ‘coaching’ is also strongly associated with ‘job-specific learning outcomes’.

40|$|Informal {{workplace}} {{learning has}} become a prominent reality in the knowledge society of today. For this reason, developing appropriate learning conditions {{in order to enhance}} workplace learning is dominating organisational agendas. However, research that investigates the relationship between important learning conditions and competences acquired through informal learning is scarce. Therefore, the main {{purpose of this study is}} to explore how the learning conditions in the workplace are related to the informal learning outcomes. A second goal is to gain insight into how the learning conditions are realised in the workplace. The current goals were achieved by means of a mixed method study with <b>police</b> <b>inspectors.</b> The national competency profile of <b>police</b> <b>inspectors</b> was a starting point of this study. In total 390 <b>police</b> <b>inspectors</b> completed a survey on informal learning conditions and the acquirement of their competences. After analysing these quantitative data, 9 <b>police</b> <b>inspectors</b> were interviewed. Within these interviews the results of the quantitative study as well as the practical realisation of the learning conditions were discussed. Overall, the results suggest that the learning conditions ‘access to information’, ‘feedback’, ‘opportunities for reflection’ and ‘coaching’ are good predictors for the acquirement of ‘generic learning outcomes’ and ‘organisational level learning outcomes’. The learning condition ‘coaching’ is also strongly associated with ‘job specific learning outcomes’.

40|$|Using {{rich and}} {{extensive}} {{data collected from}} <b>police</b> <b>Inspectors</b> {{over an extended period}} (2011 – 2014), this study explores two research questions that seek to (1) define extreme work in policing and (2) understand how it is maintained and reproduced. For some, by definition, the work of the emergency services is understood to be extreme, but the urgent and dangerous elements of policing form {{only a small part of}} an Inspector’s job and for these incidents they are well-trained in advance and well-cared for afterwards. When <b>police</b> <b>Inspectors</b> describe their work in times of austerity, it is not the emergency aspects that they experience as extreme work. Rather, it is the intensity of work over long hours above contract, which are both involuntary and unrewarded. In seeking to understand what drives extreme work and why it is accepted, especially when it is not preferred, not paid for and has detrimental effects on health and wellbeing, we uncover a process of institutional maintenance through which over-work: (1) is intensified via the extra demands imposed by austerity; (2) is maintained through work practices, a strong professional identity and a masculine police culture; but (3) is not ‘normalized’ in the sense of being embraced or celebrated by <b>police</b> <b>Inspectors...</b>|$|R
