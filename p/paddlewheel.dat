5|$|The {{company was}} granted a 20-year charter on March 18, 1840, by the Maryland {{legislature}} and then acquired three of the former Maryland & Virginia's steamboats: Pocahontas, Georgia, and Jewess. The company began overnight <b>paddlewheel</b> steamship passenger and freight service daily except Sundays between Baltimore and Norfolk. By 1848, the company's steamship Herald was making the trip in less than 12hours, a time which the line would maintain until the end in 1962. An affiliate, the Powhatan Line, started service between Norfolk and Richmond in 1845, interchanging freight and passengers with the Old Bay Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{hull and}} single funnel {{amidships}} were both finished in black paint, {{with a single}} white stripe running {{the length of the}} hull highlighting a row of false gunports. The hull was flat-bottomed, with no external keel, and with bulges low on each side amidships which continued toward the stern in an unusual implementation of tumblehome—a result of the late decision to install propeller engines, which were wider at the base than the originally planned <b>paddlewheel</b> engines.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Cedar Point added Dinosaurs Alive!, a {{walk-through}} exhibit featuring approximately 50 life-size animatronic dinosaurs.

Cedar Point also introduced Fast Lane, their version of a fast-pass system, and a new nighttime show, Luminosity– Ignite the Night!. Cedar Point also removed WildCat for the 2012 season to make room for Luminosity. This was the first time since 1978 that a roller coaster was removed from Cedar Point.|$|E
5|$|The Swedes were {{building}} three additional hemmemas at the shipyards within the fortress of Sveaborg {{when it was}} surrendered to the Russians in 1808, and all three were incorporated in the Russian Navy. Shortly afterward, the Russian Navy built its own 32-gun versions, with the final vessel launched as late as 1823. Two more were built in Sweden in 1809, Birger Jarl and Erik Segersäll. Birger Jarl sank in an accident in 1813 and Erik Segersäll was planned for conversion as a <b>paddlewheel</b> steam battery for coastal defense, though the idea was eventually abandoned and the ship scrapped in 1826.|$|E

5|$|Tolls on the Witham had {{gradually}} risen as improvements {{had been}} made. £263 {{was raised in}} 1763-4, and had reached £898 by 1790. In 1819, income exceeded £4,100 for the six months from March to September, and a five per cent dividend was paid in the following year. By 1826, over £!80,000 had been spent on improvements, and another £40,000 was needed. However, the proprietors were still optimistic, and commissioned Sir John Rennie to investigate an extension to link the Witham to the River Ancholme, but although he made two proposals, neither was implemented. Most traffic was carried by sailing vessels of in barges hauled by horses, but in March 1816, the first steam packet boat arrived on the river. It was named Witham and had been built by Shuttleworth and Robinson, whose yard was on Sincil Dyke. Despite a boiler explosion in March 1817, fortunately without causing injury {{to any of the}} crew or the 30 passengers, a second steam packet was operating by July 1817, and they soon displaced the sailing packet boats. During a flood in 1828, one of them lost power when a floating hedge became jammed in the paddle wheels. In the following year, a Lincoln man, William Pool invented a new type of <b>paddlewheel,</b> which resulted in the boats travelling faster, and in 1836, wooden vessels were superseded by iron packet boats.|$|E

50|$|From {{the early}} 1820s, the British Navy began {{building}} {{a number of}} small steam warships, and by the 1830s many navies were experimenting with steam-powered warships. This first generation of steam warships, termed 'paddle warships' (in the categories of frigate, sloop, gunvessel or other), used <b>paddlewheels</b> mounted on either the sides or in the center. The ships were equipped with large guns, generally mounted on one deck (although some larger paddle warships carried guns on two deck levels). <b>Paddlewheels</b> were proven in a number of Admiralty trials to be less efficient than the propeller or 'screw', and more vulnerable to damage, and from the late 1840s onwards navies began to build screw-driven steam warships.|$|R
50|$|Screw {{propulsion}} {{had some}} obvious potential advantages for warships over paddle propulsion. Firstly, <b>paddlewheels</b> {{were exposed to}} enemy fire in combat, whereas a propeller and its machinery were tucked away safely well below deck. Secondly, the space taken up by <b>paddlewheels</b> restricted the number of guns a warship could carry, thus reducing its broadside. These potential advantages were well understood by the British Admiralty, {{but it was not}} convinced that the propeller was an effective propulsion system. It was only in 1840, when the world's first propeller-driven steamship, , successfully completed a series of trials against fast paddle-wheelers, that the Navy decided to conduct further tests of the technology. For this purpose, the Navy built Rattler.|$|R
50|$|A {{steamboat}} is a {{boat that}} is propelled primarily by steam power, typically driving propellers or <b>paddlewheels.</b> Steamboats sometimes use the prefix designation SS, S.S. or S/S (for 'Screw Steamer') or PS (for 'Paddle Steamer'), however these designations are most often used for Steamships.|$|R
