5|$|Between 70K {{and room}} temperature, {{berkelium}} behaves as a Curie–Weiss paramagnetic material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69Bohr magnetons (µB) and a Curie temperature of 101K. This magnetic moment is almost {{equal to the}} theoretical value of 9.72µB calculated within the simple atomic L-S coupling model. Upon cooling to about 34K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state. Enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −600kJ/mol−1, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Bk3+ ions is obtained as −601kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Bk3+/Bk0 is −2.01V. The ionization <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neutral berkelium atom is 6.23eV.|$|E
5|$|Fears grew {{about the}} threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were particularly concerned about the <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French raid on the city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich {{and the experience of}} Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated by a French attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the recent events of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E

A library consultant was appointed the following month to advise on the planning of the new building.|$|E
5|$|The main {{difference}} between eukaryotic and prokaryotic oxidative phosphorylation is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under {{a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In E. coli, for example, oxidative phosphorylation can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The midpoint <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} hurricanes, it was {{hypothesized}} that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide, latent heat would be released. This would promote the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure gradient. Even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane's winds would be beneficial: since the damage <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed, a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{overwhelming}} British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian Edward Ingram noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue {{the war in the}} Middle East and later to return to Europe personally unscathed. The <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful engagement at sea to change the course of history is underscored by the list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Auguste de Marmont, Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, Louis Desaix, Jean Reynier, Antoine-François Andréossy, Jean-Andoche Junot, Louis-Nicolas Davout and Dumas were all passengers on the cramped Mediterranean crossing.|$|E
5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Iron Mountain Mine, {{the most}} {{productive}} copper mine in California {{in at least one}} point along its history, operated along the banks of two Spring Creek tributaries, upstream from the current dam site, from 1879 to the 1960s. The mine extracted iron ore, silver, gold, copper sulfide ore, and pyrite from a rock formation dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mine at the site was discovered in 1860, when two men, surveyor William Magee and settler Charles Camden, discovered an extensive iron ore deposit along one of the tributaries of Spring Creek. In 1879, silver was also discovered at the site, and the mine was begun. The ownership was transferred to Mountain Mines Ltd., a London company, in 1894. At {{the very end of the}} 19th century, Iron Mountain Mine took blames for several fish kills in the Sacramento River. Nevertheless, mining activity continued, and by 1928, 600 tons of ore were being extracted from the site per day.|$|E

5|$|The first National Hurricane Center {{forecast}} on Nicole {{noted the}} development of convection over the western portion of the center, and that if the trend continued, transitioning into a tropical cyclone would be possible. The first discussion also predicted a peak intensity of 65mph (105km/h). A mid-level trough turned the storm northeastward, and early on October 11 it passed about 60miles (95km) northwest of Bermuda. Shortly after passing Bermuda, Nicole developed persistent deep convection near the center, while Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit overpasses indicated the <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warm core within the system. Though Nicole attempted to acquire tropical characteristics, strong upper-level wind shear prevented the transition. As the storm accelerated northeastward {{under the influence of}} a large extratropical storm south of Nova Scotia, it briefly reached peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). Subtropical Storm Nicole lost its circulation as it was absorbed by the larger extratropical storm on October 11.|$|E

In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the use of drugs. The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even ammunitions were given codes such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature.
