50|$|Also the Volcanic Plateau {{region has}} the largest area of man made forest in the Southern Hemisphere. Nearly all the trees are Pinus radiata which were bought in for trials at Rotorua in 1899 from Kew Gardens,London. The tree, a native of Monterey, California, grew very fast in the poor soils. Mass {{planting}} was initially carried out by prisoners in the 1920s {{and then by the}} unemployed on a large scale during the Great Depression. After World War II scientists from Norway settled in the region and helped develop ways of treating the soft pine to prevent rotting using pressure treatment with chemicals. They also introduced selective breeding methods which was the standard way of improving the trees until tissue culture was introduced in the 1990s. Trees take 25-30 years to reach full height. Most plantations use growth factor (GF) trees to guarantee very high quality (straight and knot-free) timber, however treatment by chemical salts is still required to stop rotting.This is done by either dipping or more usually, pressure treatment. New Zealand has pioneered the use of Radiata timber and plywood in small craft boatbuilding. Untreated clear timber or plywood is used that is then encapsulated in epoxy resin after construction. The key reason is the low cost of the wood rather than any inherent properties of the wood which is of moderate weight but fractures easily when bent, when dried to 12% moisture. One of the largest ply factories in New Zealand is located on the Volcanic Plateau at Tokoroa. Although <b>planting</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> is still done on steeper land, most seedlings are now planted with the help of machines.|$|E
40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} of six field experiments designed {{to compare the}} effects of various planting procedures and materials on the early development of the plant xop under rainfed conditions. Planting by machine in moist soil increased germination, tillering and stalk elongation compared to the standard procedure of drawing furrows and <b>planting</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> some hours later in soil that had dried. A delay in <b>planting</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> after opening the furrows substantially reduced germination and wbsequent tillering. When planting into dry soil germination, tillering and stalk elongation was increased by planting with 40 t/ha filtercake in the furrow or by pouring 2 to 3 1 water per metre of row {{on top of the}} setts prior to covering. A liquid copolymer sprayed over the row after covering marginally increased shoot population and stalk elongation in two of the four experiments...|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} uses {{a series of}} similar {{experimental}} hybrid poplar plantations, planted in May 2000 for a study on hybrid poplar establishment and growth at eight sites across the Eastern Townships (Truax et al., 2012).

The plantations were all established on privately-owned fields that had been used for either grazing or crops, and subsequently abandoned. The vegetation before planting ranged from herbaceous to mixed herbaceous - shrub communities. Sites were prepared for planting in the fall of 1999 by ploughing and disking, and re-sprouting or germinating vegetation was eliminated in June 2000 by an application of glyphosate herbicide over the entire plantation area. Following this treatment, 2  m long rooted cuttings of nine different hybrid poplar clones were <b>planted</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> at each site at a stem density of 833  ha- 1 (4  m between rows and 3  m between stems along the row).

The reserve is an unproductive basin of limestone debris. Originally {{set up to}} protect the Castle Hill buttercup, Ranunculus crithmifolius var. paucifolius, the reserve also offers protection for nationally endangered species: Myosotis colensoi and Lepidium sisymbrioides. Our aim was to investigate whether removal of introduced plants increased the cover of remaining native species.

50|$|Mandinka are rural {{subsistence}} {{farmers who}} rely on groundnuts, rice, millet, and small-scale husbandry for their livelihood. The oldest male {{is the head of}} the family. Small mud houses with conical thatch or tin roofs make up their villages, which are organized on the basis of clan groups of related individuals. During the rainy season men plant peanuts as their main cash crop; peanuts are also a staple of the Mandinka diet. Men also plant millet and corn, mostly for family consumption. Women work in the rice fields, tending the <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> This is extremely labour-intensive and physically demanding work. Only about 50% of the rice consumption needs are met by local planting; the rest is imported from Asia and the United States. While farming is the predominant profession among the Mandinka, men also work as tailors, butchers, taxi drivers, woodworkers, metalworkers, soldiers, nurses, and extension workers for aid agencies. However, most women, probably 95%, remain in the home as wives and mothers because their labor is integral to the survival of families.|$|R
