6000|$|About {{this time}} I was amusing myself trying to guess {{where he would}} be most likely to cut me this time, but he got ahead of me, and sliced me {{on the end of the}} chin before I had got my mind made up. He {{immediately}} sharpened his razor--he might have done it before. I do not like a close shave, and would not let him go over me a second time. I tried to get him to put up his razor, dreading that he would make for the side of my chin, my pet tender spot, a place which a razor cannot touch twice without making trouble; but he said he only wanted to just smooth off one little roughness, and in the same moment he slipped his razor along the forbidden ground, and the dreaded pimple-signs of a close shave rose up smarting and answered to the call. Now he soaked his towel in bay rum, and slapped it all over my face nastily; slapped it over as if a human being ever yet washed his face in that way. Then he dried it by slapping with the dry part of the towel, as if a human being ever dried his face in such a fashion; but a barber seldom rubs you like a Christian. Next he poked bay rum into the cut place with his towel, then choked the wound with <b>powdered</b> <b>starch,</b> then soaked it with bay rum again, and would have gone on soaking and powdering it forevermore, no doubt, if I had not rebelled and begged off. He powdered my whole face now, straightened me up, and began to plow my hair thoughtfully with his hands. Then he suggested a shampoo, and said my hair needed it badly, very badly. I observed that I shampooed it myself very thoroughly in the bath yesterday. I [...] "had him" [...] again. He next recommended some of [...] "Smith's Hair Glorifier," [...] and offered to sell me a bottle. I declined. He praised the new perfume, [...] "Jones's Delight of the Toilet," [...] and proposed to sell me some of that. I declined again. He tendered me a tooth-wash atrocity of his own invention, and when I declined offered to trade knives with me.|$|E

The original design for each type of candy is carved into plaster by an artist, then duplicated by a machine and used to create the starch molds for the production line.|$|E
5000|$|Food {{thickeners}} {{frequently are}} based on either polysaccharides (starches, vegetable gums, and pectin), or proteins. A flavorless <b>powdered</b> <b>starch</b> {{used for this purpose}} is a fecula (from the Latin faecula, diminutive of faex, [...] "dregs"). This category includes starches as arrowroot, cornstarch, katakuri starch, potato starch, sago, tapioca and their starch derivatives. Vegetable gums used as food thickeners include alginin, guar gum, locust bean gum, and xanthan gum. Proteins used as food thickeners include collagen, egg whites, and gelatin. Sugars include agar and carrageenan. Other thickening agents act on the proteins already present in a food. One example is sodium pyrophosphate, which acts on casein in milk during the preparation of instant pudding.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the cariogenic {{potential}} of a typical cassava flour (CF) with sucrose and starch, using a severe cariogenic challenge model in rats. Thirty Wistar female pups with their dams (mutans streptococci free) were infected by Streptococcus sobrinus 6715, desalivated when aged 25 days, and placed in a Konig-Hofer programmed feeder at age 26 days. They received 17 meals daily at hourly intervals for 21 days as follows: group (1) powdered plain sucrose and sterile distilled water ad libitum (sdwal); (2) Lf and Sdwal (3) <b>powdered</b> <b>starch</b> and sdwal. Essential nutrition was administered by gavage. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. The percentage of S. Sobrinus related to the total flora and the number of this microorganism were higher in the sucrose and CF groups than starch group. Smooth-surface and [sulcal] caries scores for the groups were: (1) 105. 5 [48. 0]; (2) 34. 1 [39. 2]; (3) 10. 2 [18. 1]. All the groups were statistically significantly different from each other (p < 0. 01), although the result for sulcal score for CF was very close to the sucrose group. It is concluded that cassava flour, the main source of carbohydrate for the Amazonian population of Brazil, has moderate cariogenic potential...|$|E

50|$|Though cooked custard is a weak gel, viscous and thixotropic, a {{suspension}} of uncooked custard <b>powder</b> (<b>starch)</b> in water, {{with the proper}} proportions, has the opposite rheological property: it is negative thixotropic, or dilatant, {{which is to say}} that it becomes more viscous when under pressure. This suspension is termed oobleck and often used in science demonstrations of non-Newtonian fluids. The popular-science programme Brainiac: Science Abuse demonstrated dilatancy dramatically by filling a swimming pool with this mixture and having presenter Jon Tickle walk across it.|$|R

25|$|A light batter {{is made of}} {{cold water}} (sometimes {{sparkling}} water is used to keep the batter light) and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour). Eggs, baking soda or baking <b>powder,</b> <b>starch,</b> oil, and/or spices may also be added. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|R
40|$|Phagocytosis of starch {{granules}} in ascitic fluid was {{sought in}} guinea-pigs 1 to 10 days after i. p. injection of a suspension of <b>starch</b> <b>powder.</b> <b>Starch</b> phagocytosis occurred in 75. 9 % of control animals with free peritoneal fluid. It probably represents a nonspecific {{reaction to the}} particulate nature of starch granules. Guinea-pigs sensitized to starch by nuchal inoculation of an emulsion of Freund's adjuvant and starch showed no increase in frequency or intensity of ascitic starch phagocytosis beyond that seen in control animals. Since only sensitized animals develop granulomatous peritonitis, ascitic starch phagocytosis is thus not indicative of granulomatous hypersensitivity peritonitis. This experimental model suggests that examination of ascitic fluid is not a reliable clinical investigation to establish a diagnosis of human granulomatous starch peritonitis...|$|R

40|$|Water caltrop {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{ingredients}} used in making Chinese dishes. Due to its fresh, crispy and cook-tolerance characteristics, it is deeply preferred by consumers. It contains abundant starch and can be used as ingredients for making viscosity increaser and various kinds of desserts. This study examines the physicochemical properties and gelatinization of water caltrop <b>powder</b> and <b>starch,</b> so as to provide the characteristics of the raw materials and references for product development. The water caltrop powder contains 78. 2 % starch, while the rest consists of crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber and ash, which is higher than that of water caltrop starch. The brightness (L value) and whiteness of water caltrop starch are higher than that of water caltrop powder. The particles are oval in shape. The particle size is between 7 - 25 μm. Due to the adhesiveness of the composition of water caltrop powder, some objects easily adhere to the outer surface of the particles. The gelatinization temperature (T 0), of water caltrop powder is higher but the peak viscosity and final viscosity, viscosity setback are lower than that of water caltrop starch. Both the water caltrop <b>powder</b> and <b>starch</b> belong to the A group of cereal starch; there is an increasing trend in the swelling power and solubility rate along with an increase in temperatures. When the temperature is above 75 ℃, there is more increase in these two trends. In future, water caltrop <b>powder</b> and <b>starch</b> can be used as ingredients to make nutritious powder and to develop various cereal products. 菱角是中式菜餚的主要原料之一，鮮、脆、耐煮為其特色，深受消費者喜愛；其富含澱粉，可供作增黏劑及各式點心之材料，本研究探討菱角粉及澱粉之理化性質及糊化特性，以供菱角粉加工利用及菱角系列產品研發之參考。菱角粉較菱角澱粉含有較高之粗蛋白、粗脂肪、粗纖維及灰分。菱角澱粉之色澤亮度（L值）及白色度較菱角粉高，兩者顆粒均呈橢圓形，粒徑大小在(7 ~ 25 μm) ，屬A型穀類澱粉。菱角粉因有組成分黏著，易在外表有沾附物，其糊化溫度T 0 較菱角澱粉高，糊化尖峰黏度及最後黏度、黏度回升值則均低，膨潤力及溶解度兩者均隨溫度升高呈增加趨勢，高於 75 ℃時更呈顯著增加。兩者未來可供營養粉及各式穀類製品研發、應用之材料...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} various textural properties of heat-induced gels prepared from wheat and potato starch suspensions (10 %) treated with tribomechanical micronisation and activation (TMA). Particle size measurements showed that the TMA treatment caused a significant decrease in particle size and change in particle size distribution of <b>powdered</b> <b>starches.</b> Scanning electron microphotographs showed an obvious impact on the structure and size of starch granules. The effect of TMA treatment on the texture profile of wheat and potato starch gels was assessed by measuring their textural properties, such as hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, springiness and gumminess. The texture profile analyses of the TMA-treated wheat and potato starch gels showed lower hardness and gumminess; however, adhesiveness, cohesiveness and springiness were higher when compared with untreated suspensions. TMA treatment caused no significant lowering of the initial gelatinization temperatures. Results of differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed a decrease in the enthalpy of gelatinization. This can be explained by the disruption of starch granules by mechanical forces during the TMA treatment, which made the granules more permeable to water during the heating step of differential scanning calorimetry analysis...|$|R
