The poppet valve is operated by the piston and gas pressure only.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} performance for a cam transmission of an engine valve train operating with a mechanical spring and with a return spring device that uses a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spring.</b> Dynamic analysis of the cam mechanism is performed in the frequency and time domains employing a combined lumped-distributed parameter model capable of predicting {{the effects of the}} higher harmonics of the cam lift profile on system performance, in particular of the return spring device. Dynamic stiffness of the transmission in the frequency domain and time history of the contact force between cam and follower are evaluated. The limits of the traditional mechanical spring-closing system at high-speed camshaft operations are investigated, highlighting that they are mainly imposed by the internal resonances of the spring. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spring</b> is an improved replacement of the steel spring, because of better dynamic behavior.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{design of a}} magneto-rheological fluid embedded pneumatic vibration isolator (MrEPI) considering practical constraints and optimal performance is proposed. The design procedure basically consists of three steps, i. e. system level design, component level design and practical realization. The system level design involves synthesizing appropriate non-dimensional system parameters of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spring</b> and MR damper elements based on parameter sensitivity analysis considering requirements for compact and efficient hardware utilization. The component level design involves optimal design of the MR valve by minimizing an objective function in terms of non-dimensional geometric, material and excitation parameters, and guaranteeing required performance in the worst cases. Then practical realization involves determining actual plant parameters from the non-dimensional analysis in system and component level designs with the considerations of practical requirements/constraints. To verify {{the effectiveness of this}} optimization procedure, the semi-active vibration control performance of the optimized MrEPI subject to harmonic disturbances is evaluated, which shows good isolation performance in all tested cases. This study actually provides a systematic method for the optimal analysis and design of all those nonlinear vibration isolators consisting of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spring</b> and MR damper elements. This is achieved firstly by developing effective sensitivity analysis of dominant design parameters upon the adjustable stiffness and damping capacity irrespective of bulky or small system mass configuration and subsequently via a systematic realization design with the consideration of practical constraints in applications.

40|$|The {{sliding contact}} between {{pantograph}} and catenary {{is used to}} collect the current fed by the electrical trains for running. A good quality of current collection, i. e. a sliding contact with a low percentage of contact losses, is then essential to assure the regular run of the electrical railway vehicles. In some cases, multiple pantographs to collect current for a railway vehicle are used: this configuration represents a critical condition, even to relatively low vehicle speeds, due to the dynamic interaction among the contact wire motion produced by the first pantograph passage and the trailing pantographs that are subject to an high probability of contact loss between the collector strip and the contact wire. This paper deals with an active control acting on the articulated frame of a pantograph by means of its <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spring</b> in order to study {{the effect on the}} current collection quality, when a double pantograph configuration with a close distance is used. Experimental tests aimed at the definition of the transfer function between the air pressure of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spring</b> acting on the articulated frame, and the contact force have been carried out in order to define the possibility to use the air spring as actuator for control at low frequency. Finally the numerical simulation of two pantographs in standard configuration and with the application of active control has been performed to preliminarily verify the advantages on the current collection quality...|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} several decades there have been many {{attempts}} to improve suspension performance due to its importance within vehicle dynamics. The suspension system main functions are to connect the chassis to the ground, and to isolate the chassis from the ground. To improve upon these two functions, large amounts of effort are focused on two elements that form the building blocks of the suspension system, stiffness and damping. With the advent of new technologies, such as variable dampers, and powerful microprocessors and sensors, suspension performance can be enhanced beyond the traditional capabilities of a passive suspension system. Recently, Yin et al. [1, 2] have developed a novel dual chamber <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spring</b> that can provide tunable stiffness characteristics, which is rare compared to the sea of tunable dampers. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a controller {{to take advantage of the}} novel pneumatic spring’s functionality with a tunable damper to improve vehicle dynamic performance. Since the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spring</b> is a slow-acting element (i. e. low bandwidth), the typical control logic for semi-active suspension systems are not practical for this framework. Most semi-active controllers assume the use of fast-acting (i. e. high bandwidth) variable dampers within the suspension design. In this case, a lookup table controller is used to manage the stiffness and damping properties for a wide range of operating conditions. To determine the optimum stiffness and damping properties, optimization is employed. Four objective functions are used to quantify vehicle performance; ride comfort, rattle space (i. e. suspension deflection), handling (i. e. tire deflection), and undamped sprung mass natural frequency. The goal is to minimize the first three objectives, while maximizing the latter to avoid motion sickness starting from 1 Hz and downward. However, these goals cannot be attained simultaneously, necessitating compromises between them. Using the optimization strength of genetic algorithms, a Pareto optima set can be generated to determine the compromises between objective functions that have been normalized. Using a trade-off study, the stiffness and damping properties can be selected from the Pareto optima set for suitability within an operating condition of the control logic. When implementing the lookup table controller, a practical method is employed to recognize the road profile as there is no direct method to determine road profile. To determine the road profile for the lookup table controller, the unsprung mass RMS acceleration and suspension state are utilized. To alleviate the inherent flip-flopping drawback of lookup table controllers, a temporal deadband is employed to eliminate the flip-flopping of the lookup table controller. Results from the semi-active suspension with tunable stiffness and damping show that vehicle performance, depending on road roughness and vehicle speed, can improve up to 18 % over passive suspension systems. Since the controller does not constantly adjust the damping properties, cost and reliability may increase over traditional semi-active suspension systems. The flip-flopping drawback of lookup table controllers has been reduced through the use of a temporal deadband, however further enhancement is required to eliminate flip-flopping within the control logic. Looking forward, the novel semi-active suspension has great potential to improve vehicle dynamic performance especially for heavy vehicles that have large sprung mass variation, but to increase robustness the following should be considered: better road profile recognition, the elimination of flip-flopping between suspension states, and using state equations model of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>spring</b> within the vehicle model for optimization and evaluation...|$|E
