40|$|The work {{tasks of}} {{industrial}} <b>process</b> <b>operators</b> can have far reaching implications {{for both the}} safety of personnel and protection of the environment. The training of these operators to be competent in their work tasks, therefore, attains {{a high level of}} importance. The control of industrial <b>processes</b> often requires <b>operators</b> to undertake complex dynamic tasks. Cognitive science is attempting to explain the cognitive processes that underlie the behaviour of operators when carrying out these tasks. This paper will investigate the current theories concerning these cognitive processes and will discuss their implications toward the training of industrial <b>process</b> <b>operators.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|An {{automatic}} trip is {{an action}} performed by some system, usually a Safety Instrumented System, Programmable Logic Controller, or Distributed Control System, {{to put an}} industrial process into a safe state. It is triggered by some parameter going into a pre-determined unsafe state. It is usually preceded by an alarm to give a <b>process</b> <b>operator</b> a chance to correct the condition to prevent the trip, since trips are usually costly because of lost production.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the basic}} sanity {{properties}} of a behavioural semantics is that it constitutes a congruence with respect to standard <b>process</b> <b>operators.</b> This issue has been traditionally addressed {{by the development of}} rule formats for transition system specifications that define process algebras. In this paper we sug-gest a novel, orthogonal approach. Namely, we focus on a number of <b>process</b> <b>operators,</b> and for each of them attempt to find the widest possible class of congruences. To this end, we impose restrictions on sublanguages of Hennessy-Milner logic, so that a semantics whose modal characterization satis-fies a given criterion is guaranteed to be a congruence with respect to the operator in question. We investigate action prefix, alternative composition, two restriction operators, and parallel composition. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{framework}} {{to model the}} effects of stress on a <b>process</b> control <b>operator</b> is proposed. There exists many cognitive models, each of which attempts to model a specific class of human behaviour. One major effect of stress {{is the cause of}} errors, both physical and cognitive. In order to model the effects of stress, two cognitive models, a cognitive model of human errors and a cognitive model of <b>process</b> control <b>operators</b> are examined in detail. In this thesis, the basic functions of the human cognitive system, its organization and a cognitive model of error commission are first examined. The behaviour of a <b>process</b> control <b>operator</b> and a cognitive model of the behaviour of the operator are then discussed. The known effects of stress on the <b>process</b> control <b>operator's</b> behaviour are described and {{a framework}} for modelling the behaviour of <b>process</b> control <b>operators</b> under stress is proposed. The inadequacies associated with existing cognitive models for <b>process</b> control <b>operators</b> are explained and a modified cognitive model is proposed, which takes into account the cognitive model of error. Finally, an architecture design for the implementation of the cognitive model is provided and suggestions for the next step forward are proposed...|$|R

50|$|In {{an ironic}} twist, another {{occupation}} that is vanishing due to advanced technology, is {{the profession of}} semiconductor manufacturing <b>process</b> <b>operator.</b> Improvements in technology have made integrated circuits increasingly tiny, essentially invisible to the naked eye. Because the components are so small, it has become impossible for humans to handle these semiconductor chips in production, since the chips are so sensitive to dust and other particles. As a result, {{there has been a}} decline in semiconductor processor employment for many years, as robots and automation have taken over the jobs once held by humans. Thus, the process operators responsible for building the electronic components that have antiquated the electronic equipment service industry and other professions (e.g. telephone operators, camera repairmen, watch repairmen, etc.), are poised themselves to eventually become displaced workers.|$|E
