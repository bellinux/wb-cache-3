5|$|Slipknot's {{first annual}} music festival, called Knotfest, {{was held on}} August 17, 2012, at Mid-America Motorplex near Pacific Junction, Iowa, and on August 18, 2012, in Somerset, Wisconsin. Deftones, Lamb of God, Serj Tankian also {{performed}} at the festival. The festival shows also debuted a Slipknot museum. On 14, June 2013, Slipknot headlined the Download Festival for a second time. The band performed to roughly 90,000 people and was twice forced to stop the set—once {{in the middle of}} a song—to allow the front barricade, which had split open under crowd <b>pressure,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repaired.|$|E
5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{increasing}} role on {{the world}} stage strained his relationship with the USSR, now under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the Third World. Diverting from Soviet Marxist doctrine, he suggested that Cuban society could evolve straight to pure communism rather than gradually progress through various stages of socialism. In turn, the Soviet-loyalist Aníbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow. However, recognising Cuba's economic dependence on the Soviets, Castro relented to Brezhnev's <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> obedient, and in August 1968 he denounced the leaders of the Prague Spring and praised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Influenced by China's Great Leap Forward, in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great Revolutionary Offensive, closing all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denouncing their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries. The severe lack of consumer goods for purchase led productivity to decline, as large sectors of the population felt little incentive to work hard. This was exacerbated by the perception that a revolutionary elite had emerged consisting of those connected to the administration; they had access to better housing, private transportation, servants, and the ability to purchase luxury goods abroad.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} epinephrine, pitressin, and Arfonad on portal {{pressure}} {{has been studied}} in dogs with special emphasis {{on the role of}} the liver in determining pressure changes. The use of dogs with portacaval transposition allowed portal <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> studied with the exclusion of any hepatic vascular factor. With this preparation, vena caval pressures were brought under the influence of changes in hepatic vascular resistance. By this technique, the action of epinephrine in raising portal <b>pressure</b> primarily seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due <b>to</b> an increase in hepatic vascular resistance. The action of pitressin in reducing portal <b>pressure</b> appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due <b>to</b> a combination of reduction of splanchnic blood flow and a reduction in hepatic vascular resistance. The effect of Arfonad in lowering portal <b>pressure</b> appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unrelated <b>to</b> any changes in the liver itself. © 1962...|$|R

25|$|Bumpy torus: A {{number of}} {{magnetic}} mirrors are arranged end-to-end in a toroidal ring. Any fuel ions that leak {{out of one}} are confined in a neighboring mirror, permitting the plasma <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> raised arbitrarily high without loss. An experimental facility, the ELMO Bumpy Torus or EBT was built and tested at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Variable {{positive}} airway pressure (VPAP) (also {{known as}} bilevel (BiPAP or BPAP)) uses an electronic circuit {{to monitor the}} patient's breathing, and provides two different pressures, a higher one during inhalation and a lower pressure during exhalation. This system is more expensive, and is sometimes used with patients who have other coexisting respiratory problems and/or who find breathing out against an increased <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> uncomfortable or disruptive to their sleep.|$|E
25|$|Unlike beta {{blockers}}, {{calcium channel}} blockers do not decrease the responsiveness {{of the heart}} to input from the sympathetic nervous system. Since moment-to-moment blood pressure regulation is {{carried out by the}} sympathetic nervous system (via the baroreceptor reflex), calcium channel blockers allow blood <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> maintained more effectively than do beta blockers. However, because dihydropyridine CCBs result in a decrease in blood pressure, the baroreceptor reflex often initiates a reflexive increase in sympathetic activity leading to increased heart rate and contractility.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{replicate}} the Dual Pathway Model (DPM) of bulimia nervosa (BN) symptoms prospectively, {{and to assess}} whether a revised version of the DPM that included the variables social comparisons made on Facebook and sociotropy influenced the DPM. Method Participants were 245 females who completed baseline measures (T 1) that assessed the DPM, {{as well as the}} constructs social comparisons made on Facebook, and sociotropy, and a follow-up questionnaire, which assessed symptoms of depression, bulimia, and dietary restraint, one month later (T 2). Results Path analysis revealed that the original and the revised DPMs had excellent fit once modifications to the respective models were made. In both DPMs, T 1 <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thin and T 1 thin ideal internalization <b>were</b> related <b>to</b> T 1 body dissatisfaction. T 1 body dissatisfaction prospectively predicted T 2 depressive symptoms and T 2 bulimic symptoms, but not T 2 dietary restraint. Furthermore, T 2 dietary restraint, but not T 2 depressive symptoms, predicted T 2 BN symptoms. Results also showed that T 2 dietary restraint was associated with T 2 depressive symptoms. In the revised DPM, T 1 social comparisons made on Facebook were associated with T 1 body dissatisfaction, T 1 <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thin, and T 2 bulimic symptoms. T 1 sociotropy <b>was</b> related <b>to</b> T 1 social comparisons on Facebook, T 1 <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thin, T 1 body dissatisfaction, and T 2 bulimic symptoms. Conclusions Findings suggest the BN preventative efforts might benefit from addressing appropriate forms of social comparisons, especially those made on Facebook, and the personality trait sociotropy...|$|R
25|$|A {{mixture of}} 5% water with 95% {{tetrahydrofuran}} {{is an example}} of an azeotrope that can be economically separated using a pressure swing – a swing in this case between 1 atm and 8 atm. By contrast the composition of the water to ethanol azeotrope discussed earlier is not affected enough by <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easily separated using pressure swings and instead, an entrainer may be added that either modifies the azeotropic composition and exhibits immiscibility with one of the components, or extractive distillation may be used.|$|E

50|$|Many modern cars {{now come}} with {{built-in}} tire pressure sensors that allow all four tire <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> read simultaneously {{from inside the}} car. In 2005, most on-board Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) used indirect pressure monitoring. The anti-lock brake sensors detect one tire rotating faster than the rest and indicate a low tire <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> the driver. The problem with this method was that if tires all lost the same pressure then none would show up against the others to indicate a problem.|$|R

The eight ships between them were given four different boiler installations for comparative purposes; New Zealands outfit of 12 (or 18, according to some sources) Niclausse boilers and three cylindrical boilers allowed her to exceed her designed speed on trials, but installation of oil sprayers was impractical in Niclausse boilers.|$|E
25|$|Both free-flow {{and demand}} {{regulators}} use mechanical feedback of the downstream pressure {{to control the}} opening of a valve which controls gas flow from the upstream, high-pressure side, to the downstream, low-pressure side of each stage. Flow capacity must be sufficient to allow the downstream <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> maintained at maximum demand, and sensitivity must be appropriate to deliver maximum required flow rate with a small variation in downstream pressure, and for a large variation in supply pressure. Open circuit scuba regulators must also deliver against a variable ambient pressure. They must be robust and reliable, as they are life-support equipment which must function in a relatively hostile environment (sea water).|$|E
