25|$|In 1913, two of Berg's Five Songs on <b>Picture</b> <b>Postcard</b> Texts by Peter Altenberg (1912) were premièred in Vienna, {{conducted}} by Schoenberg in the infamous Skandalkonzert. Settings of aphoristic poetic utterances, {{the songs are}} accompanied by a very large orchestra. The performance caused a riot, {{and had to be}} halted. This was a crippling blow to Berg's self-confidence: he effectively withdrew the work, which is surely one of his most innovative and assured first orchestral compositions in the literature, and it was not performed in full until 1952. The full score remained unpublished until 1966.|$|E
500|$|Jab Tak Hai Jaan {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics overseas. Priya Joshi of the website Digital Spy gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "The film is invested {{with a healthy}} dose of Shah Rukh, the very heart and saans of Yash Chopra and the message which he lived and breathed through his films: that love is eternal." [...] Simon Foster of Australia's Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, calling it [...] "a grand cinematic work boasting all {{the pros and cons of}} the genre." [...] He observed: [...] "Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer-director had become mired in a rut, or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music (here, a typically string-heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman) and over-active camerawork. One could argue that it's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy, even when the dialogue (at times, awful) and plotting (rarely based in logical realism) can test one's patience." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80-year-old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone, a certainty about itself even at its most audacious, that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master...Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra." [...] Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Director-producer Yash Chopra's film, his final project before he died, delivers not only the romance and human touch, but also reflects a modern sensibility." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties." [...] Mazhar Farooqui of Dubai's the Gulf News wrote: [...] "Despite its inherent flaws, JTHJ comes across as a beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst <b>picture</b> <b>postcard</b> locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra. In his swan song, the celebrated director once again proved why his legacy will be hard to match." ...|$|E

[...] He also rated the film the maximum five stars. The News of the World (London) {{followed}} suit by rating the film with five stars, the reviewer Robie Collin praised the casting and camerawork; [...] "The jaw-dropping, <b>picture</b> <b>postcard</b> camerawork, that will have your eyes scouring each scene for every last delicious detail. The uproarious comic interludes (Nicole’s rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow, and the build-up to it, is one of the best-played comic set pieces of the year). The magnetic and irksomely handsome Hugh Jackman, the undisputed star of the show." [...] Anne Barrowclough of The Times (London) gave the film four out of five stars, and states the film defies expectation and [...] "in what {{turns out to be a}} multi-layered story it describes an Australia of the 1940s that is at once compellingly beautiful and breathtakingly cruel". Bonnie Malkin of The Daily Telegraph (London) stated: [...] "Local critics had worried that the much-anticipated film Australia would present to the world a series of time-honoured Antipodean clichés. Their fears were well founded".|$|E

40|$|This article focusses on in situ {{photography}} {{of public}} sculpture as used on belle époque <b>picture</b> <b>postcards</b> of Brussels. The subject is approached from a dual angle. First, the proper {{conventions of the}} in situ photography of public sculpture as a genre are examined {{in the light of}} its reliance on traditional photographic and painterly visual traditions, as well as on novel genres like amateur and snapshot photography. Second, we look at whether the photographic mise-en-scène to be found on <b>picture</b> <b>postcards</b> of public statues demonstrates a particular perspective on the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century public monument and cityscape. The close analysis of a selection of <b>picture</b> <b>postcards</b> demonstrates that (1) the in situ photography of urban statues for <b>picture</b> <b>postcards</b> can be regarded as a photographic genre in its own right, lying at the intersection of documentary art reproduction practices (e. g., a preference of plain backgrounds) and amateur photography of the city (e. g., snapshot features such as the chance presence of passers-by and carriages). Moreover, (2) the <b>picture</b> <b>postcards</b> under discussion confirm and propagate dominant discourses on the monument and the cityscape, even if at the same time such visions were challenged. In the case of Brussels, the <b>picture</b> <b>postcards</b> demonstrate a preference for a monumental, impressive cityscape, worthy of representing the nation {{and at the same time}} legitimising it, and a preference for views of sculpture as a grand art, serving the worship of grands hommes. With this article, the authors are contribution to the recent scholarship on in situ photography of public sculpture as well as to research on <b>picture</b> <b>postcards</b> as an aesthetical and cultural phenomenon. status: publishe...|$|R

60|$|The Bisse of Leysin is one {{of those}} {{artificial}} water-courses which bring water from some distant source to pastures that have an insufficient or uncertain supply. It is a little better known than most because of a certain exceptional boldness in its construction; for a distance of a few score yards it runs supported by iron staples across the front of a sheer precipice, and for perhaps half a mile it hangs like an eyebrow over nearly or quite vertical walls of pine-set rock. Beside it, on the outer side of it, runs a path, which becomes an offhand gangway of planking at the overhanging places. At one corner, which gives the favourite <b>picture</b> <b>postcard</b> from Montana, the rocks project so sharply above the water that the passenger on the gangway must crouch down upon the bending plank as he walks. There is no hand-hold at all.|$|E

He was marking time; not restless, not bored, just waiting--but for what, he had no notion. And Sylvia, at any rate, was happy, blooming in these old haunts, losing her fairness in the sun; even taking again to a sunbonnet, which made her look extraordinarily young. The trout that poor old Gordy had so harried were left undisturbed. No gun was fired; rabbits, pigeons, even the few partridges enjoyed those first days of autumn unmolested. The bracken and leaves turned very early, so that the park in the hazy September sunlight had an almost golden hue. A gentle mellowness reigned over all that holiday. And from Ireland came no further news, save one <b>picture</b> <b>postcard</b> with the words: [...] "This is our house.--NELL." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{whatever}} be the pathos of the London poor, it {{has nothing}} to do with being uneducated. So far from being without guidance, they are guided constantly, earnestly, excitedly; only guided wrong. The poor are not at all neglected, they are merely oppressed; nay, rather they are persecuted. There are no people in London who are not appealed to by the rich; the appeals of the rich shriek from every hoarding and shout from every hustings. For it should always be remembered that the queer, abrupt ugliness of our streets and costumes are not the creation of democracy, but of aristocracy. The House of Lords objected to the Embankment being disfigured by trams. But most of the rich men who disfigure the street-walls with their wares are actually in the House of Lords. The peers make the country seats beautiful by making the town streets hideous. This, however, is parenthetical. The point is, that the poor in London are not left alone, but rather deafened and bewildered with raucous and despotic advice. They are not like sheep without a shepherd. They are more like one sheep whom twenty-seven shepherds are shouting at. All the newspapers, all the new advertisements, all the new medicines and new theologies, all the glare and blare of the gas and brass of modern times--it is against these that the national school must bear up if it can. I will not question that our elementary education is better than barbaric ignorance. But there is no barbaric ignorance. I do not doubt that our schools would be good for uninstructed boys. But there are no uninstructed boys. A modern London school ought not merely to be clearer, kindlier, more clever and more rapid than ignorance and darkness. It must also be clearer than a <b>picture</b> <b>postcard,</b> cleverer than a Limerick competition, quicker than the tram, and kindlier than the tavern. The school, in fact, has the responsibility of universal rivalry. We need not deny that everywhere there is a light that must conquer darkness. But here we demand a light that can conquer light.|$|E
