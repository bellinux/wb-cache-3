40|$|The authors {{state the}} {{hypothesis}} that the reindustrialisation tends to be globally understood as having different features for every country. The industrial <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> each state to reindustrialize the national economy determines these special features. The methodology of the research is presented by the wide range of different tools and methods. It includes the systematic approach to the interpretation of reindustrialisation, structuring the existing interpretations of reindustrialisation, criteria-based analysis of broader concepts, historical analysis of statistic data. Furthermore, we used basic scientific methods of analytical summary, quantitative analysis, deduction and abstraction. To prove the suggested hypothesis, the authors have compared key trends in the global economy with the existing theoretical approaches to reindustrialization in national and foreign economic research. We have analyzed the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>reindustrialization</b> as a global economic trend and as a specific state policy. The main features <b>of</b> <b>reindustrialization</b> process and its difference from reshoring- are examined. We have classified the key interpretations of “new industrialization” and “reindustrialization” terms tacking into account their correlation. To identify the common and specific features of the new industrialization and reindustrialization processes, the author used the criteria-based analysis. This allowed us to determine the most important qualitative and quantitative features <b>of</b> <b>reindustrialization</b> as a global tendency.

The reversal of the latter perception is crucial to the Taula del Sénia's efforts, for they blame their present status of disinvestment, unemployment and general economic neglect to being far away from the centres of power and decision of each of the three Autonomous Communities in question.|$|R
40|$|Most {{accounts}} of business coordination assume historically given conditions {{for this to}} emerge. Business coordination is therefore difficult, perhaps impossible, to construct endogenously. This paper examines a process of ‘endogenous coordination’ through an analysis <b>of</b> <b>reindustrialization</b> and industrial upgrading in Central Europe during the 2000 s. Because of its recent post-communist history, during which existing institutions of economic governance were dismantled wholesale, Central Europe is a particularly unlikely place for complex forms of business coordination to emerge. Demonstrating the empirical possibility of endogenous coordination, and identifying conditions under which it has emerged thus shifts the debate from pessimistic fatalism to a more optimistic world of possibility. The paper identifies three conditions for business coordination to emerge. One, a pattern of industrialization that combines sophisticated skills and capital goods, leading to higher asset specificity and fixed costs; two, bottlenecks {{in the production of}} collective goods associated with these assets against the background of potentially high returns in investment; and, three, the existence of a third party, which provides a forum for deliberation and strategic coordination while holding effective sanctioning capacity. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the role of}} a secondary co-operative in the supply of an input key to delivering a product by a co-operative movement focused on manufacturing. This study bases its focus on sewing co-operatives and uses the supply of fabric as an example that relates to a proposed secondary co-operative that would be established within a township community of South Africa to supply fabric to clothing manufacturing cooperatives. A literature grid specifying references and concepts used to arrive at the suggested model is also presented on the paper. Secondary co-operatives in supply chain management are key to inter-cooperation of manufacturing co-operatives and to sourcing quality inputs at reasonable rates. In conclusion it is specified that empirical studies could be done to improve and develop further the suggested model of supply chain management through a secondary co-operative structure. Policy makers in the areas <b>of</b> <b>reindustrialization</b> through co-operatives especially in emerging countries may consider secondary supply cooperatives to be drivers of inter co-operative cooperation and as providers of strategic operational support to the manufacturing co-operative movement particularly in clothing manufacturing which is a sector confronted with cheap clothing imports from low cost producing countries...|$|R

Therefore, it is necessary for the Republic of Serbia to turn to reindustrialization and implement structural changes in this sector {{given the fact that the}} levels of the development and competitiveness of the industry are correlated to the intensity of industrialization.

40|$|The article explores {{key issues}} in {{reaching}} {{a balance of}} funding resources, needed for fulfilling strategic goals for scientific-technological development ofRussia. Shared forecasts predict that in 2016, Russia's share of the global budget for Research and Development (R&D) will amount to less than 2 %, whereas the share of only three countries – the USA, China and Japan, will amount to 55, 6 %. The six leading countries investing heavily state funded in R&D in 2016, will be theUSA,China,Japan,Germany,South KoreaandIndia. The accumulative share of investments in R&D in 2016, will amount to 68, 5 %. Comparing the investment volumes of leading countries',Russia's expected national investment in R&D might be non-competitive. It is noted that the needed resources for increasing volumes of state funding in Russian scientific-technological field in the midterm perspective are already exhausted. Therefore, the single opportunity for reaching the goal of Russian President's Order № 599 for increasing internal spending on R&D, so it amounts 1, 77 % of GDP is to dramatically increase the volume of extra-budgetary financing in the domestic R&D sector. Special {{attention is paid to}} the disproportion of the budget spending on R&D and the number of people employed in R&D, which leads toRussiahaving one of the lowest indicators among developed countries for «internal expenditure on R&D per researcher». It is concluded that without a clear strategic answer to the posed question about how the Russian industrial sector will be able to increase internal spending on R&D from current 1, 15 % to 1, 77 % and how will it accommodate the 4 th biggest corpus of scientists in the world in the processes <b>of</b> <b>reindustrialization</b> <b>of</b> the country, strategic targets for becoming a global technological leader risk to remain in the status of «ambitious goals».  </p...|$|R
40|$|Deindustrialization is {{a natural}} process in the {{developed}} countries, which takes place {{under the influence of}} external and internal factors and occurs as a result of economic growth. It is marked by the decline in the share of industry in GDP and employment with a simultaneous increased importance of the service sector. Considering the complexity of the concept, there are many theoretical approaches of deindustrialisation. In this paper the analysis of deindustrialization in the EU was conducted. The research results indicate the existence of relative deindustrialization in the EU, which is characterized by reduced share of agriculture and industry and increased share of the service sector in GDP. Also, {{it was found that the}} decrease in employment in the industry was not created as a result of a decrease in industrial production. The EU economy, including the industrial sector, is heavily influenced by the globalization process, while the process of deindustrialization is significantly impacted by the increased volume of foreign direct investment.

However, time is running out, and the country needs to prepare itself for this possible next phase in its development and its reindustrialization alongside other European countries. First, however, it might be better to start from national economic interests i. e. from the reconciliation of issues, such as those of the Socialist industrialization, and from the subsequent transition to a market economy, with a special focus on how this transition has taken place in pure economic terms. Indeed, one might ask if {{it would have been better}} to “consult” an economist such as Friedrich List, rather than leave everything to the “mercy” of democratic euphoria, the “invisible hands” and political divisions. Perhaps, a golden opportunity to deploy the different assets of the country’s actual industrial sector has been lost. That being said, this paper does not aim to enter into issues of evaluation or defense, nor even less to evoke nostalgia for the Communist regime. Forcing a connection between Socialist industrialization and the “infant industry argument” would be stretching things theoretically, and perhaps even “politically incorrect”, too. That being said, maybe such an economic doctrine could have been at least “been asked for” when engaging the “heavy” industrial legacy of the Communist regime in Bulgaria...|$|R
