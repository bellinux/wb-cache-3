On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been <b>pushed</b> back against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships <b>pushed</b> through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E

5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let {{themselves}} into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer <b>pushed</b> Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said {{she had not been}} <b>pushed</b> but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such a verdict would mean Cynthia had been <b>pushed,</b> but perhaps accidentally.|$|E

5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic {{the western}} edge of the North American {{continent}} was <b>pushed</b> against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a subduction zone.

The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E
5|$|LI Infantry Corps were {{tasked with}} attacking towards Maribor then driving towards Zagreb, while the XLIX Mountain Corps was to capture Dravograd then force a {{crossing}} on the Sava. On {{the first day}} of the invasion, LI Infantry Corps captured the Mura bridges at Mureck and Radkersburg (opposite Gornja Radgona) undamaged. In the sector of the 38th Infantry Division Dravska, one German column <b>pushed</b> towards Maribor from Mureck, and the other <b>pushed</b> on from Gornja Radgona through Lenart towards Ptuj. Some time later, other elements of LI Infantry Corps attacked the area between Sveti Duh and Dravograd. Border troops met these attacks with fierce resistance, but were forced to withdraw due to German pressure. The 183rd Infantry Division captured 300 prisoners. A bicycle-mounted detachment of the 183rd Infantry Division reached the extreme right flank of the 7th Army at Murska Sobota without striking any resistance. The 132nd Infantry Division also <b>pushed</b> south along the Sejanski valley towards Savci.|$|E
40|$|Shear wave elastography is {{a medical}} imaging {{modality}} in which tissue elasticity is estimated by measuring the speed of ultrasound-induced shear waves. This study aimed to implement four shear wave generating <b>pushes</b> and compare their performance according to chosen metrics. The focused <b>push,</b> unfocused <b>push,</b> unfocused comb <b>push</b> and line <b>push</b> were implemented on a Verasonics ultrasound system and tested on a polyvinyl alcohol phantom. Shear wave propagation was imaged using angle-compounded ultrafast imaging. Axial particle velocities were estimated using a 2 D autocorrelator and then cross-correlated to obtain local shear wave speed estimates. The focused <b>push</b> and line <b>push</b> were found to generate shear waves with 1 [...] 3 times higher peak axial particle velocity, implying better signal-to-noise ratios. The focused <b>push,</b> unfocused <b>push</b> and line <b>push</b> were found to exhibit areas 7 mm wide around the <b>pushing</b> beams in which shear wave speed cannot be estimated, whereas the unfocused comb <b>push</b> has no such blind area...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to analyze the external forces and biomechanical loading on the musculoskeletal system during wheelchair <b>pushing,</b> in relation to different <b>push</b> handle heights. In addition, recommendations for wheelchair <b>pushing</b> in accordance with <b>push</b> handle height are made. Eight young, female subjects carried out three different wheelchair transport tasks at five different <b>push</b> handle heights in a standardized laboratory setting. Five <b>pushing</b> heights were selected {{as a percentage of the}} subjects shoulder height (61, 69. 5, 78, 86. 5 and 95 %). All three wheelchair transport tasks investigated required higher <b>pushing</b> handles in order to minimise net shoulder moments and external vertical forces on the hands. When <b>pushing</b> a wheelchair on to a pavement, net moments around wrists, elbows, shoulders compression and shear forces at L 5 -S 1 and external vertical forces were lower using higher <b>pushing</b> heights. When low <b>pushing</b> handles are used, elderly female attendants are at risk of L 5 -S 1 low back pain when lifting and <b>pushing</b> the wheelchair on to a pavement. A recommendation is made to reconsider height and position of the <b>pushing</b> handles of attendant propelled wheelchairs.
