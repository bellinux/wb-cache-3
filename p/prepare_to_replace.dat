50|$|Slide in {{floor in}} place: By sliding the floor into the Cloake board, the single {{functioning}} colony is now {{divided into two}} parts - a queenright lower colony and a queenless upper colony. The lower entrance is re-opened, allowing bees in the queenright section to exit the hive. When those bees return, they will do so to the upper entrance, but {{not be able to}} enter the lower colony. This results in a higher population of bees in the upper colony. The upper colony is typically left alone for 24 hours for a settling period, in which the bees determine that they are queenless, and <b>prepare</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> their missing queen.|$|E

25|$|The {{uprising}} {{was planned}} {{in a series}} of meetings held between 18–22 February by Mitsugi Nishida, Yasuhide Kurihara, Teruzō Andō, Hisashi Kōno, Takaji Muranaka and Asaichi Isobe. The plan decided upon was relatively simple. The officers would assassinate the most prominent enemies of the kokutai, secure control of the administrative center of the capital and the Imperial Palace, then submit their demands (the dismissal of certain officers and the appointment of a new cabinet led by Mazaki). They had no longer-term goals, believing that those should be left to the Emperor. It is believed that they were <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> Hirohito with Prince Chichibu if necessary, however.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though many}} Labour MPs {{supported}} the reforms, most weren't <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> the charismatic and witty Lange for Douglas, {{who was a}} wooden speaker lacking the common touch. This resulted in Lange defeating Douglas {{by a wide margin}} of 38-15. Lange commented that he never felt threatened that Douglas would defeat him and as expected, only the most loyal of Douglas' following supported him, such as Richard Prebble and Trevor De Cleene (The two of them with Douglas would later become known as the Three Musketeers). Lange's victory can be summed up by a quote from Geoffrey Palmer who said that he regarded both as essential to the government's well-being.|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} area {{that must be}} considered concerns the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. Because {{the strength of a}} phalanx depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in the front ranks. If a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times, would lead to a quick defeat. This then implies that the hoplites ranks closer to the front must be mentally <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> their fallen comrade and adapt to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.|$|R
50|$|On 21 December 2010, a {{statement}} to the effect that Amkar was voluntarily to join the First Division due to financial difficulties appeared on the club's official website.

However, the powers that be did not rate the actions of the supporters highly. Gennady Shilov stated that he was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> retiring Valery Chuprakov as club President. Shilov also stated an intent to approach the regional authorities for help and to look for sponsors. The Premier League gave Amkar until 15 January. On 25 January 2011 Amkar withdrew its request to leave the Premier League.|$|R
50|$|Multiple archaeological {{surveys have}} taken place at the Millville site. One such survey {{occurred}} when the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> an old bridge across the South Fork Apple River within the state park. An archaeological team, from the Resource Investigation Program at the University of Illinois, reported a buried layer of top soil about 70 - 80 cm beneath the surface with extensive 19th century ceramics and mortar {{as well as an}} area of stone that may have been part of a building foundation. The team determined that the building of the bridge would disturb the site and recommended further survey, no other work was done at the right-of-way, and IDOT approved the project in December 1991.|$|R
50|$|In 1943, Oldham Corporation {{investigated}} the anticipated growth of load on their distribution area, {{and so a}} scheme was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> the existing Slacks Valley station. The preparation plan, drawn up by Kennedy & Donkin, considered other sites for the replacement but decided that the existing site at Chadderton was the most suitable, with an envisaged capacity of 120,000 kW, using four 30,000 kW turbo-alternators, installed at intervals of two at a time. However following discussion with the then Central Electricity Board, this was revised to four 50,000 kW sets, giving the station a capacity of 200,000 kW. This was revised again with the standardisation of unit sizes and operating temperatures and pressures, meaning the sets ended up each being 60,000 kW in size.|$|R

30|$|In this work, the solution-processed CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite/copper indium {{disulfide}} (CuInS 2) planar heterojunction {{solar cells}} with Al 2 O 3 as a scaffold were fabricated at a temperature {{as low as}} 250 °C for the first time, in which the indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass instead of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass {{was used as the}} light-incidence electrode and the solution-processed CuInS 2 layer was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> the commonly used TiO 2 layer in previously reported perovskite-based solar cells. The influence of the thickness of the as-prepared CuInS 2 film on the performance of the ITO/CuInS 2 (n)/Al 2 O 3 /(CH 3 NH 3)PbI 3 /Ag cells was investigated. The ITO/CuInS 2 (2)/Al 2 O 3 /(CH 3 NH 3)PbI 3 /Ag cell showed the best performance and achieved power conversion efficiency up to 5.30 %.|$|R
50|$|Boyi and Shuqi lived {{during the}} reign of the last Shang ruler Di Xin, who at this point had become given over to drinking, women, sex, and a disdain for morals. His country was misruled, with high taxes, mass hunger, and {{arbitrary}} acts of violence and cruelty. Sima Qian provides lurid details of prolonged orgies of drunken sex and acts of violence and torture, during which he refused to heed the advice of his ministers. At the same time the leader of the Zhou clan, posthumously known as King Wen of Zhou, was <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> the Shang dynasty with the rule of his own clan (the subsequent Zhou dynasty), though at the time they were a vassal state to Shang. In contrast to Shang, the leadership of Zhou was famous for its provision of food and protection for its subjects, in part due to their advances in agricultural techniques.|$|R
5000|$|The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was {{interested}} in {{increasing the number of}} broadcasting outlets, and began licensing [...] "Apex" [...] stations, operating on higher transmitting frequencies than the original AM band. On January 29, 1936, the Detroit News activated its own Apex station, W8XWJ, initially broadcasting at 31.6 MHz and relaying WWJ's programs, although it would later adopt its own programming. As with WWJ, W8XWJ used amplitude modulation (AM), but it was also engineered to transmit in high-fidelity. The FCC ultimately decided that the second broadcast band would use frequency modulation (FM), so W8XWJ ceased operating in early 1940, as the [...] News <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> it with an FM station.

40|$|Contributory intent” {{refers to}} the {{situation}} where, besides the defendant being at fault and causing harm to the plaintiff, the plaintiff also intentionally causes harm to him- or herself. “Contributory intent” can {{have the effect of}} either excluding the defendant’s liability (on the ground that the plaintiff's voluntary assumption of risk or intent completely cancels the defendant's negligence and therefore liability), or limiting the defendant’s liability (where both parties intentionally cause the plaintiff's loss thereby resulting in the reduction of the defendant’s liability). Under our law the "contributory intent" of the plaintiff, can either serve as a complete defence in terms of common law or it can serve to limit the defendant's liability in terms of the Apportionment of Damages Act 34 of 1956.
