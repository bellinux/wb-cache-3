In late February 1919, civil unrest—including strikes and clashes between {{communist}} and anti-communist groups—took place in Heydrich's {{home town of}} Halle. Under Defense Minister Gustav Noske's directives, a right-wing paramilitary unit was formed and ordered to [...] "recapture" [...] Halle. [...] Heydrich, then 15 years old, joined Maercker's Volunteer Rifles (the first Freikorps unit). When the skirmishes ended, Heydrich {{was part of the}} force assigned to protect private property. Little is known about his role, but the events left a strong impression; it was a [...] "political awakening" [...] for him. He joined the Deutschvölkischer Schutz und Trutzbund (National German <b>Protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>Shelter</b> League), an anti-Semitic organisation.|$|E

40|$|Orphanages are {{the places}} where all needs of {{children}} in need of protection are met. The financial needs {{of children who are}} in need of protection are met by the government. But in addition to children’s <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheltering</b> needs, they are in need of socialization and taking an active role in society as well. Social integration of children in orphanages is a matter for all society. Accordingly it is possible to see social exclusion and antisocial behaviours when socialization does not occur. In this study, sense of exclusion of secondary school students living in orphanages was investigated. A total of 100 secondary school students living in Aksaray, Konya, Kayseri and Kırşehir orphanages are included in this descriptive survey model study. The data were collected via the scale developed by Öcal and Altınok (2011). Surveys were administered by the researchers themselves. SPSS was used to analyze the data. The findings of the study are important in terms of indicating social exclusion level of children living in orphanages...|$|R

[...] Dunn, acting under the orders of Doniphan, continued on to Adam-ondi-Ahman. [...] Although he was sympathetic to the Mormons' plight, Doniphan reminded the Latter-day Saints that the Caldwell County militia could not legally enter Daviess County, and he advised Mormons traveling there to go in small parties and unarmed. [...] Ignoring this counsel, Judge Higby, a Mormon judge in Caldwell County called out the Caldwell militia, led by Colonel George M. Hinkle. [...] Although county officials could only legally act within the county, this judge authorized Hinkle to defend Latter-day Saint settlements in neighboring Daviess County.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time after}} the start of Gheorghe Tătărescu's premiership and Ion Inculeț's {{leadership}} of the Internal Affairs Ministry, repression of the Legion ceased, a measure which reflected Carol's hope to ensure a new period of stability. In 1936, during a youth congress in Târgu Mureș, Codreanu agreed to the formation of a permanent Death Squad, which immediately showed its goals with the killing of Mihai Stelescu by a group deemed Decemviri (led by Ion Caratănase), neutralizing the Crusades campaign of exposing the Guard's weaknesses, and silencing Stelescu's claims that Codreanu was hypocritical in his official display of ascetism, politically corrupt, uncultured, and a plagiarist. In 1936, Codreanu published an essay entitled [...] "The Resurrection of the Race", where he wrote:"I will under underline this once again: we are not up against a few pathetic individuals who have landed here by chance and who now seek <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter.</b> We are up against a fully-fledged Jewish state, an entire army which has come here with its sights set on conquest. The movement of the Jewish population and its penetration into Romania are being carried out in accordance with precise plans. In all probability, the 'Great Jewish Council' is planning {{the creation of a new}} Palestine on a strip of land, starting out on the Baltic Sea, embraces a part of Poland and Czechoslovakia and half of Romania right across to the Black Sea...The worse thing that Jews and politicians have done to us, the greatest danger that they have exposed our people to, is not the way they are seizing the riches and possessions of our country, destroying the Romanian middle class, the way they swamp our schools and liberal professions, or the pernicious influence they are having on our whole political life, although these already constitute mortal dangers for a people. The greatest danger they pose to the people is rather that they are undermining us racially, that they are destroying the racial, Romano-Dacian structure of our people and call into being a type of human being that is nothing, but a racial wreck." [...] The year was also marked by the deaths and ostentatious funerals of Moța (by then, the movement's vice president) and Vasile Marin, who had volunteered on Francisco Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War and had been killed in the Majadahonda battle. Codreanu also published his autobiographical and ideological essay Pentru legionari ("For the Legionaries" [...] or [...] "For My Legionaries").|$|E

He girded on his rapier, and threw his cloak, or rather that which belonged to his borrowed suit, about him, bringing up the lower part so as to muffle the face and show only the eyes over it, which was a common way of wearing them in those days, both in streets, in the country, and in public places, when men had a mind to be private, and to avoid interruption from salutations and greetings in the market-place.

Three great apes accompanied them and to these was delegated the business of tracking the quarry, a feat beyond the senses of the Oparians. La commanded. She arranged the order of march, she selected the camps, she set the hour for halting and the hour for resuming and though she was inexperienced in such matters, her native intelligence was so far above that of the men or the apes that she did better than they could have done. She was a hard taskmaster, too, for she looked down with loathing and contempt upon the misshapen creatures amongst which cruel Fate had thrown her and to some extent vented upon them her dissatisfaction and her thwarted love. She made them build her a strong <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>shelter</b> each night and keep a great fire burning before it from dusk to dawn. When she tired of walking they were forced to carry her upon an improvised litter, nor did one dare to question her authority or her right to such services. In fact they did not question either. To them she was a goddess and each loved her and each hoped that he would be chosen as her mate, so they slaved for her and bore the stinging lash of her displeasure and the habitually haughty disdain of her manner without a murmur.|$|E

You could not go behind them and find her wanting in the social guarantees which women on steamers, if not men, exact of lonely birds of passage who are not mother-birds. One must respect the convention by which she safeguarded herself and tried to make good her standing; yet it did not lastingly avail her with other birds of passage, so far as they were themselves mother-birds, or sometimes only maiden-birds. The day had not ended before they began to hold her off by slight liftings of their wings and rufflings of their feathers, by quick, evasive flutterings, by subtle ignorances of her approach, which convinced no one but themselves that they had not seen her. She sailed with the sort of acquaintance-in-common which every one shares on a ship leaving port, when people are confused by the kindness of friends coming to see them off after sending baskets of fruit and sheaves of flowers, and scarcely know what they are doing or saying. But when the ship was abreast of Fire Island, and the pilot had gone over the side, these provisional intimacies of the parting hour began to restrict themselves. Then the Mother-Bird did not know half the women she had known at the pier, or quite all the men.|$|R

Calibration by means of a standard clothing set can demonstrate consistency among manikins but not absolute accuracy.
