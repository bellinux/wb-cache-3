40|$|Abstract Background Nowadays, mini screws {{are used}} in {{orthodontic}} tooth movement to obtain maximum or absolute anchorage. They have gained popularity among orthodontists for en masse retraction of anterior teeth after first premolar extraction in maximum anchorage cases. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the type of anterior tooth movement during the time when force was applied from different mini screw placements to the anterior <b>power</b> <b>arm</b> with various heights. Methods A finite element method was used for modeling maxillary teeth and bone structure. Brackets, wire, and hooks were also designed for modeling. Two appropriate positions for mini screw in the mesial and distal of the second premolar were designed as fixed nodes. Forces were applied from the mini screw to four different levels of anterior hook height: 0, 3, 6, and 9  mm. Initial tooth movement in eight different conditions was analyzed and calculated with ANSYS software. Results Rotation of anterior dentition was decreased with a longer anterior <b>power</b> <b>arm</b> and the mesial placement of the mini screw. Bodily movements occurred with the 9 -mm height of the <b>power</b> <b>arm</b> in both mini screw positions. Intrusion or extrusion of the anterior teeth segment depended on the level of the mini screw and the edge of the <b>power</b> <b>arm</b> on the Z axis. Conclusions According to the findings of this study, the best control in the sagittal plane during anterior en masse retraction was achieved by mesial placement of the mini screw and the 9 -mm height of the anterior <b>power</b> <b>arm.</b> Where control in the vertical plane was concerned, distal placement of the mini screw with the 6 -mm <b>power</b> <b>arm</b> height had minimum adverse effect on anterior dentition...|$|R

When orthodontic {{force is applied}} {{through the center of}} resistance (CR), then, tooth translation ensues. Forces applied at a distance from the CR create a moment that tends to rotate and tip the tooth. The tendency of tipping is increased in the bracket system lacking power arm, since, force is applied more occlusally. Hence, we have designed a chair side custom made jig to retract the canines individually...|$|E
30|$|Miniscrews {{placed into}} the maxillary or mandibular bone have {{recently}} been used for an orthodontic anchorage in the sliding mechanics [3 – 5]. This method, miniscrew sliding mechanics, eliminates anchorage problems and easily achieves en masse retraction of the anterior teeth. A most important problem in this method is {{the rotation of the}} occlusal plane of the entire dentition, which depends on the direction of the force applied from the miniscrew. This effect of the force direction has been clarified by a clinical study and also confirmed by a finite element study carried out by the authors [6, 7]. To move the teeth into the desired position, clinicians must select an appropriate force direction, which is achieved by a proper combination of miniscrew positions and <b>power</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
40|$|The porpose of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the optimal length of <b>power</b> <b>arms</b> for achieving controlled anterior tooth movement in segmented arch mechanics combined with power arm. A three-dimensional finite element method was applied for the simulation of en masse anterior tooth retraction in segmented power arm mechanics. The type of tooth movement, namely, the location of center of rotation of the maxillary central incisor in association with power arm length, was calculated after the retraction force was applied. When a 0. 017 ?×? 0. 022 -in archwire was inserted into the 0. 018 -in slot bracket, bodily movement was obtained at 9. 1 ?mm length of power arm, namely, at the level of 1. 8 ?mm above the center of resistance. In case a 0. 018 ?×? 0. 025 -in full-size archwire was used, bodily movement of the tooth was produced at the power arm length of 7. 0 ?mm, namely, at the level of 0. 3 ?mm below the center of resistance. Segmented arch mechanics required shorter length of <b>power</b> <b>arms</b> for achieving any type of controlled anterior tooth movement as compared to sliding mechanics. Therefore, this space closing mechanics could be widely applied even for the patients whose gingivobuccal fold is shallow. The segmented arch mechanics combined with power arm could provide higher amount of moment-to-force ratio sufficient for controlled anterior tooth movement without generating friction, and vertical forces when applying retraction force parallel to the occlusal plane. It is, therefore, considered that the segmented power arm mechanics has a simple appliance design and allows more efficient and controllable tooth movement. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 747 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 3 月 4 日Author: Hiroya Ozaki, Jun-ya Tominaga, Ryo Hamanaka, Mayumi Sumi, Pao-Chang Chiang, Motohiro Tanaka, Yoshiyuki Koga, Noriaki YoshidaCitation: Journal of Dental Biomechanics, 6, 1758736014566337; 201...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} tested the {{hypothesis}} that the type of anterior tooth movement is correlated with the height level of the power arm with respect to the center of resistance (CRe) of a tooth, but not with the power arm length itself in sliding mechanics using three-dimensional (3 D) model analysis. Materials and methods: Anterior teeth were retracted with sliding mechanics using <b>power</b> <b>arms</b> of different lengths in five subjects with maxillary protrusion. Anterior tooth movements during three months’ retraction were assessed by means of 3 D model analysis, and the relationship between the power arm length and the distance from the center of rotation (CRo) to CRe, and the relationship between the distance from the level of the power arm hook to CRe and the CRo-CRe distance were evaluated. Results: The height level of the power arm relative to CRe was significantly correlated with the CRo-CRe distance, but there was no significant correlation between the power arm length and the CRo-CRe distance. Conclusion: Anterior tooth movement during retraction varied with the anatomical parameters of individual patients, even if the same power arm length was employed. The present findings suggest that the height level of the power arm relative to CRe is the most influential factor determining the tooth movement, while the power arm length itself has less impact on subsequent tooth movement. Therefore, it is recommended that an optimal power arm length be calculated back from the location of CRe at the beginning of treatment and treatment progress be monitored using 3 D model analysis. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 799 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 9 月 2 日Author: Hiromi Rokutanda, Yoshiyuki Koga, Hiroko Yanagida, Jun-ya Tominaga, Yuji Fujimura, Noriaki YoshidaCitation: Orthodontic Waves, 74 (4), pp. 93 - 98; 2015 - 1...|$|E
