50|$|This chapel, {{belonging}} to the abbey of Saint-Jacques de Montfort-sur-Meu, is built from schist and <b>pudding</b> <b>stone.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{tower is}} at {{the west end of}} the nave. The base of the tower was built around 1200 to 1220. It is {{constructed}} of a type of flint and ore known as <b>pudding</b> <b>stone.</b> The upper part was completed around 1340.|$|E
50|$|Work on {{the current}} {{building}} {{began in the early}} 15th century, and grew from an earlier building dating back to about 1230. The church is built of limestone and decorated with Doulting stone, while the steps are an interesting example of Dolomitic Conglomerate (<b>pudding</b> <b>stone).</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present and test a model {{based on a}} Weak Continuity Representation to {{classify}} textures. In particular, the edges, extracted on windows having a given size and centered on the image, are an efficacious representation to design a neural network oriented to classify textures {{on the basis of}} their coarseness. The results obtained on real textures, relative to <b>pudding</b> <b>stones</b> having different grains, show that this kind of features constitute an efficacious approach for the material recognition...|$|R
50|$|The land is {{essentially}} composed of sandy-clay soils that {{date back to}} the last Ice Age, which lie on a clay and gravel substrate dating back to the Pliocene Epoch. The land in Béarn-Bellocq consists of the Gave de Pau terraces and gravelly hills. This soil is highly permeable, which allows excess water to drain, but it is limited by its mediocre fertility. The land in Jurançon consists of <b>pudding</b> <b>stones,</b> flysch and gravelly water tables, all formed by the debris of fallen rocks from the Pyrenees, carried there by the gaves. The land in Madiran consists of limestone bank molasse, nappes of pebbles, and boulbènes. These are fairly deteriorated, sedimentary rocks left from the rising Pyrenees.|$|R
30|$|A {{transitional}} zone {{with the}} marls, 20 – 50  m thick, mark {{the change in}} sedimentation from pelagic carbonate to a flysch succession of the Oligocene age, which form the overlying seal for the carbonate reservoirs of thrust and subthrust sheets. The flysch consists of intercalation of sandstones, siltstone and clays, as well as <b>pudding</b> <b>stones</b> and limestones olistoliths of the Upper Cretaceous-Eocene age. Its thickness varies from 1000 to 3000  m, which reduces from the east (Berati anticlinal belt) to the west (Cika anticlinal belt).The {{eastern part of the}} Ionian zone (Berati anticlinal belt) emerged from the end of Upper Oligocene, because the coastal line (Berati anticlinal belt), continues its regression westward. From the Oligocene to the Aquitanian, the sea regression is intensified, {{and at the end of}} Aquitanian, the western sector of the Ionian zone (Kurveleshi and Cika anticlinal belts) is tectonized and emerged. The tops of the anticlinal structures are eroded. The sedimentation continues without interruption in the synclines.|$|R
50|$|The single-arch bridge has {{a span of}} 17.1 m and a {{width of}} 5.9 m. The arch vault {{consists}} of large voussoirs and shows a comparatively flat profile (span to rise ratio 3:1). The facing was built of <b>pudding</b> <b>stone,</b> the spandrels filled with Roman concrete.|$|E
50|$|The parish {{comprises}} 45,771 statute acres, {{of which}} about 1,203 are bog. A peculiar kind of stone, called <b>pudding</b> <b>stone,</b> is {{found on the}} isolated mountain of Slieve Gouldry, on the southern confines of the parish, {{and there is a}} quarry of freestone, which was worked for flags.|$|E
50|$|In {{places the}} fissured {{red and green}} {{coloured}} sandstone is replaced by picturesque conglomerate with roundish stones varying in diameter from two to thirty centimetres (historically known as <b>pudding</b> <b>stone</b> in this region of Kincardineshire). In other places more greenish volcanic extrusions are evident as harder veins within the sandstone bluffs.|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the active recharge of karst aquifers is an important tool to estimate the groundwater resource availability in these complex hydrogeological systems, characterized by spatial and temporal variability of many hydrogeological factors, involved in groundwater flow. As a matter of fact, the rate of recharge is a key aspect for sustainable exploitation and management of these groundwater resources, as they represent {{one of the most}} important fresh-water supplies for human life and economic activities. This paper presents the results of the inverse hydrogeological water budget method application in the karst aquifer feeding Pertuso Spring, Central Italy, to evaluate the average annual groundwater recharge (i. e. the effective infiltration), supported by an open source GIS. This carbonate aquifer is {{one of the most important}} of Central Italy and Pertuso Spring is the main outlet of this karst system with an average rate of about 1. 7 m 3 /s. The study area lies in the Upper Valley of the Aniene River, in the south-east part of Latium Region, and is spread for about 50 km 2. Calculation of the effective infiltration was based on mean annual rainfall data, collected over 20 years (1992 - 2012), evapotranspiration and on hydrogeological settings of outcropping rocks, used for setting up potential infiltration coefficients. The inverse hydrogeological water balance has been applied to the study area, discretized in grid cells (EFQ), 6. 25 Ha each one. The results of the inverse hydrogeological water balance method applied to the karst aquifer feeding Pertuso Spring show an annual recharge of about 45 Mm 3 /year. The effective infiltration map shows that the highest values are related to the presence of karstified Cretaceous limestone, mainly outcropping in the north-east part of the basin. On the contrary, lower values of effective infiltration are generally due to the lower permeability, which characterizes the rest of the area (Triassic crystal dolomites, <b>pudding</b> <b>stones</b> and conglomerates). Results show that the annual active recharge of this karst aquifer (45 Mm 3 /year) is greater than the depletion volume of water coming from Pertuso Spring (25 Mm 3 /year). The {{evaluation of}} the active recharge is a useful tool to identify the priority protection measures for sustainable land use planning and groundwater management in the study area...|$|R

The mysterious <b>Pudding</b> <b>Stone</b> Lodge seems to harbor many secrets that {{have a lot to}} do with the cousins and are very important to Nancy. Nancy invite Ned and his friends to come to the lake to help.|$|E
5000|$|Three large monoliths of {{conglomerate}} stone, {{commonly referred}} to as <b>pudding</b> <b>stone,</b> are located in a field on {{the eastern side of the}} B4293 to the south of the village. (SO 498051) The stones, situated on publicly accessible land belonging to the Davies family of Crosshands Farm, are a scheduled ancient monument. The stones have been described as [...] "one of the more substantial megalithic monuments in Monmouthshire".|$|E
50|$|Hertfordshire puddingstone was {{credited}} in local folklore with several supernatural powers, including being a protective charm against witchcraft. Parish {{records from the}} village of Aldenham relate that in 1662 a woman suspected of having been a witch was buried with a piece of it laid on top of her coffin to prevent her from escaping after burial. In living memory a piece of <b>Pudding</b> <b>Stone</b> was given to a bride and groom, possibly as a fertility symbol.|$|E
50|$|The {{main house}} has three stories and a basement, 25 rooms, four {{chimneys}} and 17180 sq ft of space. The exterior walls are of <b>pudding</b> <b>stone,</b> granite and blue stone blocks. The walls {{have long been}} covered by vines. The hip roof is black slate with red copper pans with multiple dormers and skylights. A 10-room wing with elevator, designed by Chicago-based architect Solon Spencer Beman, {{was added to the}} main house in 1907-1908 in preparation for Mary Baker Eddy's occupancy.|$|E
50|$|In the 12th {{century the}} wooden parish church of Upton was {{replaced}} with a flint building. The tower and outside walls of the Norman building form part of the present church. Several of the walls are built of <b>pudding</b> <b>stone.</b> Two other Norman features survive: the ancient baptismal font and a piscina. In the English Reformation many of the ancient decorations were mutilated. A 13th-century Italian allegorical image of the Trinity - God Father, Son and Holy Spirit - survived and was reassembled in {{the restoration of the}} church.|$|E
50|$|Puddingstone, {{also known}} as either <b>pudding</b> <b>stone</b> or plum-pudding stone, is a popular name applied to a {{conglomerate}} that consists of distinctly rounded pebbles whose colors contrast sharply with {{the color of the}} finer-grained, often sandy, matrix or cement surrounding them. The rounded pebbles and the sharp contrast in color gives this type of conglomerate the appearance of a raisin or Christmas pudding. There are different types of puddingstone, with different composition, origin, and geographical distribution. Examples of different types of puddingstones include the Hertfordshire, Schunemunk, Roxbury, and St. Joseph Island (Drummond Island) puddingstones.|$|E
50|$|A {{long time}} admirer and {{collector}} of medals, by 1977, Gibran’s first significant effort relating to that medium was a bas relief portrait of his cousin for a monument sited in Copley Square {{across from the}} main branch of the Boston Public Library. Sculpting in wax led to several commissions, including bas reliefs Cardinal Richard Cushing, Amy Beach, Elliot Norton medal and portrait heads Karon, Najwa, Nureyev, Self Portrait.Finally he had the time and, as always, the passion to fulfill a childhood promise to honor his parents Rose Gibran (her maiden name) and Nicholas Gibran. In 1981, Gibran’s monumental sculpture the 12 foot bronze Lady of the Cedars of Lebanon was placed on a high Jamaica Plain hill on a Roxbury <b>pudding</b> <b>stone</b> ledge, {{at the site of}} the Maronite Church to which the family belonged.|$|E
50|$|Work on {{the current}} {{building}} {{began in the early}} 15th century, and grew from an earlier building dating back to about 1230. The church is built of limestone and decorated with Doulting stone, while the steps are an interesting example of Dolomitic Conglomerate (<b>pudding</b> <b>stone).</b> The crossing tower is over 100 ft high, and holds six bells, one of which dating from 1723 was made by Edward Bilbie of the Bilbie family. The statue on the east side is that of St John the Baptist. On the west side is a king — perhaps Henry VII, which would place it after 1485. The North aisle ceiling retains some mediaeval painted panels, and amongst the carved bosses is the head of a Green Man, with leaves sprouting around his face. The nave roof is Jacobean and dates from 1636. Restoration was undertaken in 1888 by J.D. Sedding, who contributed the fine parclose screens.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, an intense {{effort to develop}} {{techniques}} and methodologies that solve problems relative to the Cultural Heritage field has been made by many researchers. One {{of the most interesting}} tasks among such problems is the recognition of different kinds of material degradation. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the potential of the Haralick's textural features to characterize different types of material (in particular <b>pudding</b> <b>stone</b> with different grain) from digital images of historical buildings. Classification system prototypes were built for evaluation purposes. The performance of two classifier models was investigated: the maximum probability classifier and a multilayer perceptron. Experiments performed on Aosta Roman Theatre pictures indicated classification performance as good as 93 %. The use of Principal Component Analysis to reduce the redundancy in the Haralick's textural features allowed an expressive improvement in the classification performance...|$|E
40|$|Received Smith's {{letter of}} 24 April [1810]. Suffering from severe headaches, {{for which he}} has just {{returned}} from a retreat in the upper provinces; was unable to pursue any natural history inclinations and has become a "much worse botanist" than when he left England; preparing to visit the Cape [of Good Hope] or St Helena for the headaches, and will also visit England if they persist. Whilst at Cawnpore found 'Rhododendrun boorans' for Calcutta Botanic Garden and Marquis of Blandford [George Spencer-Churchill]; [William] Roxburgh sending drawing taken from dried specimen. Also found: 'Berberris ilicifolia', 'Rubus' with yellow fruit, a 'Quercus', 'Pinus longifolia', and a 'Betula'. Transplanted a tree from Cawnpore to Calcutta Botanic Garden, Roxburgh thinks it a 'Humea'; observations. Has a specimen of 'Breccia' or <b>pudding</b> <b>stone,</b> a mineral, for Sir Joseph Banks. Pleased to hear of Banks' desire to establish a Botanic Garden at Ceylon. Concerned to hear of [Robert] Brown's desertion of the Linnaean School...|$|E
40|$|Accessibility to {{cultural}} heritage {{is one of}} the most important factors in cultural heritage preservation, as it assures knowledge, monitoring, Public Administration management and a wide interest on cultural heritage sites. Nowdays 3 D surveys give the geometric basis for an effective artefact reconstruction but most of the times 3 D data are not completely and deeply investigated to extract other useful information on historical monuments for their conservation and safeguard. The Cultural Heritage Superintendence of Aosta decided to run a time continual project of monitoring of the Praetorian Roman Gate with the collaboration of the ITABC, CNR of Italy. The Praetorian Roman Gate in Aosta, Italy, of Augustus ages, {{is one of the}} most well-known roman monumental gates, it is a double gate with three arches each side, 12 meters high, 20 meters wide, made of <b>pudding</b> <b>stone</b> ashlars, Badoglio, travertine, marble blocks and other stone insertion due to restorations between 1600 and 1950. In years 2000 a final restoration intervention brought the gate at the present state of art, within the frame of a restoration and conservation building site with the purpose of treat the different decay pathologies and conditions. A complete 3 D geometric survey campaign has been the first step for the monitoring of the gate morphologic changes and decay progress in time. The main purpose is to collect both quantitative data, related to the geometry of the gate, and the qualitative data, related to the chromatic change on the surface due to the stone decay. The geometric data with colour information permits to associate materials and stone pathologies to chemical or mechanical actions and to understand and analyse superficial decay kinetics. The colours survey will also permit to directly locate on the 3 D model areas of different stratigraphic units. The project aims to build a rigorous quantitative-qualitative database so to be uploaded into a GIS. The GIS will become the monitoring main means. Considering the huge dimension of the gate and its urban location a multi-scale approach has been considered. Controlled and free images have been taken from the ground and the top of the gate so to reconstruct all the walls and the upper cover. A topographic survey has been done so to be able to control and relate all the different acquisitions. It has been chosen a Photo Scanner 3 D system. It is a photogrammetry-based survey technology for point clouds acquisition and 3 D models configuration, from digital images processing. This technology allows to obtain point clouds (xyz coordinates) with RGB information and geometries at different levels of complexity by processing a number of images taken with a limited set of constraints, with the use of a simple acquisition equipment and through an image matching algorithm (ZScan, by Menci Software). Due to the high walls of the arch gates, the higher part has been surveyed with a remote controlled drone (UAV Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) with a digital camera on it, so to take pictures up to the maximum altitude and with different shooting angles (90 and 45 degree). This is a new technology which permits to survey inaccessible parts of a high monument with ease and accuracy, by collecting redundant pictures later bound together by an image block algorithm. This paper aims to present the survey experience architectural monuments trough the application of a trifocal quick photogrammetric system, in surveying at different scales and for different purposes...|$|E
