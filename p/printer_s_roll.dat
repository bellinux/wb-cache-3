40|$|The {{assignment}} is designed as information material pertaining to controlled substances; addiction {{and a doctor}} <b>s</b> <b>roll</b> in situations involving substance abuse. The target group is medical students and doctors. In part 1 of the assignment we discuss different controlled substances, along with alcohol and potentially addictive medications. We include history, up-to-date statistics, types and routes of administration, pharmacology, short-term and long-term effects for each substance. Part 1 closes with a table describing symptoms of acute substance abuse. In part 2 we present an updated description of addition, while part 3 discusses a number of situations where one, as a doctor, must confront controlled substance abuse. There is focus on the doctor s role in prevention, role as a prescription drawer and the important support role in substitutions programs. Since alcohol is the most commonly abused psychoactive substance, the doctor <b>s</b> <b>roll</b> in alcohol abuse is discussed in sub-section in part 3. By reviewing The Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association (Tidskrift for den Norske Lægeforening), books and brochure material we have created {{a picture of what}} information is available and, more importantly, which information should have greater focus, especially concerning the Norwegian situation.

40|$|In 2004, Andy Paparozzi of the National Association of Printing Leadership (NAPL) {{reported}} {{that it was a}} good year for the U. S. printing industry, because it was the first year since 2001 in which the industry showed growth. However, this good news cannot appease the complaints from U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> who are concerned about losing their jobs to overseas printers. According to a survey conducted by the Printing Industries of America/Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (PIA/GATF), 40 % of printers think that their customers are seeking global sourcing for their printing needs. Offshoring is the new reality of globalization. Journalists constantly mention the benefits and dangers in offshoring. No one is really sure if offshoring is beneficial or not, or if it is just overwhelming the printing industry. For the following thesis, the researcher conducted two surveys. One targeted U. S. print buyers (buyers, brokers, and book publishers); the other survey targeted Chinese printers. This research discusses the following issues: • How do Chinese <b>printers</b> view U. <b>S.</b> offshore print buying trends? • How are Chinese printers planning to upgrade and to improve their capabilities to acquire and to handle offshore print jobs? • Is there a trend (an increase or a decrease) in offshore print buying from China? • How do U. S. print buyers evaluate the need to send print jobs to China? • What are the obstacles that prevent U. S. print buyers from buying print from China? The research findings will benefit the U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> by clarifying our understanding the print buyer’s behavior and reasons for purchasing their print offshore. With more accurate knowledge in this field, U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> will be in a better position to know what it will take to become more competitive...|$|R

Dunne produced the original design for Huntington during the winter of 1907-1908. Huntington built it {{over the next two years}} and in April 1910 he flew it for the first time, on the Aero Club's flying ground at Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey. Huntington experimented with a number of improvements over the next few years, notably the substitution of a Gnome rotary engine, and it was still flying well into 1914.|$|R
