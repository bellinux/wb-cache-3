Electromagnetic technology requires utter human docility and quiescence of meditation such as befits an organism that now wears its brain outside its skull and its nerves outside its hide. Man must serve his electric technology with the same servo-mechanistic fidelity with which he served his coracle, his canoe, his typography, and all other extensions of his physical organs.

2500|$|On 21 December 2007, {{organizers}} of the event announced that the tournament would be watched under the scrutiny of anti-corruption officials. A partnership was formed with Victoria Police. This announcement came {{in the wake of}} a series of scandals to hit the sport, including World No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko coming under suspicion of match fixing; with at least a dozen other players coming forward about having been approached to influence matches in an unethical manner. Tennis Australia chief executive Steve Wood commented that, [...] "Match-fixing and illegal gambling are a threat to the integrity of sport.

2500|$|Over {{the coming}} months, Petrelis led {{a small group}} of activists around the country, {{following}} the candidates to key primary states and successfully inserting the project's issues into the national debate. The project distributed condoms at campaign venues and offices, produced a thirty-second television ad, accusing the candidates of ignoring AIDS, that sparked controversy when WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire, refused to air it because the station objected to the images of same-sex couples kissing, challenged presidential hopeful Ross Perot's promise that his administration would not appoint homosexuals to cabinet posts, and encouraged lesbian and gay voters to be skeptical about then-candidate Bill Clinton. The pressure on Clinton resulted in sixteen AIDS-specific policy promises from the campaign. Ann Northrop, a New York City activist and journalist, later said of Petrelis' efforts, [...] "Michael did a great job <b>putting</b> <b>our</b> issues on the agenda during the campaign." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pop punk {{bands that}} achieve minimal {{mainstream}} success {{have seen a}} return to grassroots form, [...] "the micro-operation style that yielded the results that caught the mainstream’s attention in the first place." [...] New Found Glory has continued to tour on the Warped Tour, and had their own Pop Punks Not Dead Tour, a reworking of an [...] "old, defiant punk rock battle cry." [...] Chad Gilbert, the band's guitarist, wrote in an op-ed for Alternative Press entitled [...] "Why Pop-Punk's Not Dead—And Why It Still Matters Today": [...] "This isn't a dead genre, and just because there isn't a song on the radio to clarify that shouldn't matter. ... Pop-punk means something {{to a lot of}} people and to me, having success as a band in our genre is about longevity, touring a lot and staying true to your fans. It's about us <b>putting</b> <b>our</b> lives on a plate for our fans to take what they want and not jeopardizing our integrity for any reason." ...|$|E
2500|$|Free-to-play is newer {{than the}} pay to play model, and {{the video game}} {{industry}} is still attempting {{to determine the best}} ways to maximize revenue from their games. Gamers have cited the fact that purchasing a game for a fixed price is still inherently satisfying because the consumer knows exactly what they will be receiving, compared to free-to-play which requires that the player pay for most new content that they wish to obtain. The term itself, [...] "free-to-play", has been described as one with a negative connotation. One video game developer noted this, stating, [...] "Our hope—and the basket we're <b>putting</b> <b>our</b> eggs in—is that 'free' will soon be disassociated with [...] 'shallow' and 'cruddy'." [...] However, another noted that developing freeware games gave developers the largest amount of creative freedom, especially when compared to developing console games, which requires that the game follow the criteria as laid out by the game's publisher. Many kinds of revenue are being experimented with. For example, with its Free Realms game targeted to children and casual gamers, Sony makes money from the product with advertisements on loading screens, free virtual goods sponsored by companies such as Best Buy, a subscription option to unlock extra content, a collectible card game, a comic book, and micropayment items that include character customization options.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013, it was {{revealed}} that season two regular Meghan Ory (Red Riding Hood/Ruby) would be departing the show to star in CBS's upcoming sci-fi drama Intelligence. However, Ory stated that she would still be open for more episodes on the show as a guest member. Ory later made appearances in episodes twelve and thirteen of the season. The same month, it was announced that Michael Raymond-James (Baelfire/Neal Cassidy) had been promoted from a recurring cast member to a series regular for the season. In July 2013, it was reported that Giancarlo Esposito (The Genie/Magic Mirror/Sidney Glass) would be returning to the series, following his absence from season two. In the same month, it was announced that the role of Robin Hood had been recast from Tom Ellis to Sean Maguire. Adam Horowitz stated, [...] "Although we love Tom Ellis, unfortunately he wasn’t available. We remain huge fans of his, but because we have an arc planned for the character, we had to move forward." [...] British actor Robbie Kay played the role of the villain {{for the first half of}} the season: Peter Pan. On July 29, it was reported that Rose McIver had been cast as Tinker Bell. Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis teased an unexpected introduction for the well-known character, saying, [...] "It's taking the icon and <b>putting</b> <b>our</b> spin on it. How we introduce her, and who she is, is hopefully going to be surprising because we're going to find she has a surprising connection to someone." [...] For episode five, Bernard Curry played a guest role as Captain Hook's brother Liam, while a member of the Lost Boys called Devin was portrayed by Skyler Gisondo. Joanna Garcia was cast as Ariel from The Little Mermaid. On September 3, 2013, Gil McKinney was cast in the recurring role of Prince Eric. On October 18, 2013, it {{was revealed}} that the American musician Marilyn Manson would voice the character of The Shadow.
