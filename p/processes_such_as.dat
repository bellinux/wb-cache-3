5|$|Like rhenium and palladium, {{technetium}} {{can serve}} as a catalyst. In <b>processes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Piaget's {{theory is that}} culture and education exert stronger influences on a child's development than Piaget maintained. These factors depend on how much practice their culture provides in developmental <b>processes,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> conversational skills.|$|E

5|$|The encyclopedist Song Yingxing (1587–1666) {{documented}} a {{wide array}} of technologies, metallurgic and industrial processes in his Tiangong Kaiwu encyclopedia of 1637.

5|$|To {{increase}} the EROEI, several combined technologies were proposed.

5|$|A planet or moon's {{interior}} heat {{is produced}} from the collisions {{that created the}} body, by the decay of radioactive materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic <b>processes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact cratering.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} welding <b>processes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{gas metal arc}} welding, {{shielding}} gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E

5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary <b>processes,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|In the arts, {{silicon carbide}} {{is a popular}} {{abrasive}} in modern lapidary due to the durability and low cost of the material. In manufacturing, it is used for its hardness in abrasive machining <b>processes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> grinding, honing, water-jet cutting and sandblasting. Particles of silicon carbide are laminated to paper to create sandpapers and the grip tape on skateboards.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation <b>processes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E

5|$|Self-awareness {{appears to}} be a sign of {{abstract}} thinking. Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced <b>processes</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> metacognitive reasoning. The traditional method for measuring this is the mirror test, which determines if an animal possesses the ability of self-recognition. Mammals that have 'passed' the mirror test include Asian elephants (some pass, some do not); chimpanzees; bonobos; orangutans; humans, from 18 months (mirror stage); bottlenose dolphins killer whales; and false killer whales.|$|E
5|$|The {{deep vacuum}} of space could make it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial <b>processes,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> those that require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An {{important factor in the}} total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{is a key}} {{complex in}} {{cellular}} RNA quality control. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes possess highly active RNA surveillance systems that recognise unprocessed and mis-processed RNA-protein complexes (such as ribosomes) prior to their exit from the nucleus.
