50|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>bats</b> are an {{extremely}} popular type of bat {{that can also}} be called megabats. The bats originate from tropical regions of the Old World. They don't hibernate and since they dislike the cold, tropical regions suit them best. <b>Fruit</b> <b>bats</b> diet includes <b>fruit</b> and nectar. During their Circadian flight, <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> gather 1.5 to 3 times their body weight in food. Certain types of <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> have short jaws and powerful teeth to pierce into fruit. Others have long tongues and snouts to reach pollen and nectar. They can search up to 30 mi to find food. Some types of <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> can have a 5 feet wing span, the largest of all <b>bats.</b> Other <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> only have a 6 centimeter long wing span. All but a few types of <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> are nocturnal. The ones occupying The Monfort Bat Sanctuary are nocturnal. These bats are quite rare because they are killed for food. Other predators include crows, rats, 10 ft-long pythons, and lizards. Usually <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> can survive these creature attacks. Their major predators are feral dogs and cats.|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Fruit</b> <b>bats</b> {{are known}} to harbor {{zoonotic}} paramyxoviruses including Nipah, Hendra, and Menangle viruses. The {{aim of this study}} was to detect the presence of paramyxovirus RNA in <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> from Indonesia. Methods: RNA samples were obtained from the spleens of 110 <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> collected from four locations in Indonesia. All samples were screened by semi-nested broad spectrum reverse transcription PCR targeting the paramyxovirus polymerase (L) genes. Results: Semi-nested reverse transcription PCR detected five previously unidentified paramyxoviruses from six <b>fruit</b> <b>bats.</b> Phylogenetic analysis showed that these virus sequences were related to henipavirus or rubulavirus.

50|$|Megabats {{constitute}} the suborder Megachiroptera, and its only family Pteropodidae {{of the order}} Chiroptera (bats).

50|$|When captured, a Jamaican <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> will warn conspecifics with a {{distress}} call {{made of a}} long series of pulses typically lasting 15 kHz.

40|$|The last {{surviving}} Mauritian <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> species, Pteropus niger, although endangered, provides essential {{seed dispersal}} and pollination {{services for the}} threatened native flora. However, their foraging habitats in native forest remnants are dominated by alien invasive plants and are inhabited by invasive alien animals like long-tailed macaques. Competition for food resources and a decrease of native fruiting trees appear to force <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> to top up their diet with cultivated fruits. Consequently, a rapidly escalating conflict with local farmers resulted in a mass cull initiated by the Mauritian government that decimated around 50 % of the <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> population. Here, I investigate the impact of invasive alien plant control on the foraging habitat quality of <b>fruit</b> <b>bats,</b> by quantifying <b>fruit</b> production and <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> foraging intensity in weeded and non-weeded forest areas using ground quadrats. Moreover, I examine how native tree traits and fruit characteristics affect tree and fruit selection of flying foxes and long-tailed macaques. Weeding significantly increased both native fruit production and <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> foraging intensity. <b>Fruit</b> <b>bats</b> preferred to forage in weeded areas on tall trees with a large crown. In addition, <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> preferred large and ripe fruits, while long-tailed macaques more often used small unripe fruits. Peak of native fruit use by macaques coincided with lower use by <b>fruit</b> <b>bats,</b> suggesting resource competition. The results suggest that weeded forests provide a better foraging habitat for P. niger than non-weeded areas, and {{emphasize the importance of}} weeding for the recovery of native plant communities and their associated biodiversity. I conclude that weeding and controlling of the introduced long-tailed macaque population may be solutions to mitigate the current human-wildlife conflict. In the long term, failure to improve native foraging habitats of <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> is likely to increase their extinction risk on Mauritius...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the rarest}} <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> of the world, Salim Ali's <b>fruit</b> <b>bat,</b> Latidens salimali, (named after Indian ornithologist Salim Ali) is only {{found in this}} {{mountain}} range. Salim Ali's <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> is the only species in the genus Latidens. It is a medium-sized <b>fruit</b> <b>bat,</b> which lacks an external tail. The head is covered in blackish-brown fur which is paler at the base, the wing membrane and the long fur are light brown in colour, and the underparts are light grey-brown. The species was first collected in 1948 by a British naturalist called Angus Hutton, who misidentified the specimen as the common short-nosed <b>fruit</b> <b>bat.</b> The specimen was re-examined later by Kitti Thonglongya who recognised it as a new species. Very little is known of the ecology of this species, however all <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> play an extremely important role as pollinators and seed dispersal agents within their rainforest habitat. This species is entered in the Guinness Book of World Records in 1993 {{as one of the}} rarest bats of the world.|$|R
50|$|The Jamaican <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> is a frugivore. They eat {{a number}} of kinds of fruit but focus mostly on figs; at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, figs {{make up more than}} 78% of the <b>fruits</b> eaten. <b>Bats</b> will also {{supplement}} leaves of plants with high amounts of protein. Overall, the <b>fruit</b> <b>bat</b> consumes a diverse amount of plants but locally only eats certain types. A Jamaican fruit-eating bat plucks its food and carries it away with its mouth before eating it in its roosts. As such it can disperse seeds fairly far. <b>Fruit</b> <b>bats</b> have been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3 - 14 g or even as much as 50 g. Jamaican <b>fruit</b> <b>bats</b> rely on sight and smell to find fruit of certain colors and odors.|$|R
