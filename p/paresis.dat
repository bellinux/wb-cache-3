25|$|Contraindications include severe chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease, and <b>paresis</b> of the phrenic nerve on {{the opposite}} side as the block.|$|E
25|$|Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or {{weakness}} {{should be}} treated {{with the addition of}} hematin, heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to bulbar <b>paresis</b> and respiratory paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Horner's {{syndrome}} may {{be observed}} if the local anesthetic solution tracks cephalad and blocks the stellate ganglion. This may {{be accompanied by}} difficulty swallowing and vocal cord <b>paresis.</b> These signs and symptoms are transient however, and do not commonly result in any long-term problems, although they may be significantly distressing to patients until the effects subside.|$|E
25|$|LW6/8 is a para-Alpine and para-Nordic {{standing}} skiing sport class, {{a classification}} {{defined by the}} International Paralympic Committee (IPC) for people with an upper extremity issue who have paralysis, motor <b>paresis</b> affecting one arm, a single upper arm amputation or CP8 classified cerebral palsy. LW6/8 skiers use two skis and one pole in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the close}} {{proximity}} of the lung to the brachial plexus {{at the level of}} the clavicle, the complication most often associated with this block is pneumothorax — with a risk as high as 6.1%. Further complications of supraclavicular block include subclavian artery puncture, and spread of local anesthetic to cause <b>paresis</b> of the stellate ganglion, the phrenic nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
25|$|Temporary <b>paresis</b> (impairment of the function) of the {{thoracic}} diaphragm {{occurs in}} virtually all people who have undergone interscalene or supraclavicular brachial plexus block. Significant respiratory impairment can be demonstrated in these people by pulmonary function testing. In certain people — such as those with severe {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} — this can result in respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation until the block dissipates.|$|E
25|$|Other common neuropsychiatric {{manifestations of}} SLE include {{cognitive}} dysfunction, mood disorder, cerebrovascular disease, seizures, polyneuropathy, anxiety disorder, psychosis, depression, {{and in some}} extreme cases, personality disorders. Steroid psychosis can also occur {{as a result of}} treating the disease. It can rarely present with intracranial hypertension syndrome, characterized by an elevated intracranial pressure, papilledema, and headache with occasional abducens nerve <b>paresis,</b> absence of a space-occupying lesion or ventricular enlargement, and normal cerebrospinal fluid chemical and hematological constituents.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} months, Rainer {{diagnosed}} himself with lung cancer, which was another probable effect {{of his long}} exposure to formaldehyde fumes. He tried to hide this from {{his wife and his}} friends, claiming his problem was a mere case of <b>paresis.</b> His house was narrowly missed by the April 1944 bombardment, and he had to move into the house of a former assistant, Ion Țurai. He was later moved to Hospital No. 303, where he developed metastasis in the brain.|$|E
25|$|Edward Jarvis {{and later}} Francis Amasa Walker helped expand the census, from 2 volumes in 1870 to 25 volumes in 1880. Frederick H. Wines was {{appointed}} to write a 582-page volume called Report on the Defective, Dependent, and Delinquent Classes of the Population of the United States, As Returned at the Tenth Census (June 1, 1880) (published 1888). Wines used seven categories of mental illness: dementia, dipsomania (uncontrollable craving for alcohol), epilepsy, mania, melancholia, monomania and <b>paresis.</b> These categories were also adopted by the Association.|$|E
25|$|After Capone was {{released}} from prison, he was referred to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore {{for the treatment of}} <b>paresis</b> (caused by late-stage syphilis). Hopkins refused to admit him based solely on his reputation, but Union Memorial Hospital accepted him. Capone was grateful for the compassionate care that he received and donated two Japanese weeping cherry trees to Union Memorial Hospital in 1939. A very sickly Capone left Baltimore on March 20, 1940, after a few weeks inpatient and a few weeks outpatient, for Palm Island, Florida.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam was the top-selling {{pharmaceutical}} in the United States from 1969 to 1982, with peak {{sales in}} 1978 of 2.3 billion tablets. Diazepam, along with oxazepam, nitrazepam and temazepam, represents 82% of the benzodiazepine market in Australia. While psychiatrists continue to prescribe diazepam for the short-term relief of anxiety, neurology {{has taken the}} lead in prescribing diazepam for the palliative treatment of certain types of epilepsy and spastic activity, for example, forms of <b>paresis.</b> It is also {{the first line of defense}} for a rare disorder called stiff-person syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Complications {{associated}} with brachial plexus block include intra-arterial or intravenous injection, {{which can lead}} to local anesthetic toxicity. This may be characterized by serious central nervous system problems such as epileptic seizure, central nervous system depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects of local anesthetic toxicity include slowing of the heart rate and impairment of its ability to pump blood through the circulatory system, which may lead to circulatory collapse. In severe cases, cardiac dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death may occur. Other rare but serious complications from brachial plexus block include pneumothorax and persistent <b>paresis</b> of the phrenic nerve.|$|E
25|$|Paralysis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of damage to α-MNs. Because α-MNs provide the only voluntary innervation to extrafusal muscle fibers, losing α-MNs effectively severs the connection between the brainstem and spinal cord and the muscles they innervate. Without this connection, voluntary and involuntary (reflex) muscle control is impossible. Voluntary muscle control is lost because α-MNs relay voluntary signals from upper motor neurons to muscle fibers. Loss of involuntary control results from interruption of reflex circuits such as the tonic stretch reflex. A consequence of reflex interruption is that muscle tone is reduced, resulting in flaccid <b>paresis.</b> Another consequence is the depression of deep tendon reflexes, causing hyporeflexia.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of TTP is variable. The initial symptoms, which force {{the patient to}} medical care, are often the consequence of lower platelet counts like purpura (present in 90% of patients), ecchymosis and hematoma. Patients may also report signs and symptoms {{as a result of}} (microangiopathic) hemolytic anemia, such as (dark) beer-brown urine, (mild) jaundice, fatigue and pallor. Cerebral symptoms of various degree are present in many patients, including headache, <b>paresis,</b> speech disorder, visual problems, seizures and disturbance of consciousness up to coma. The symptoms can fluctuate so that they may only be temporarily present but may reappear again later in the TTP episode. Other unspecific symptoms are general malaise, abdominal, joint and muscle pain. Severe manifestations of heart or lung involvements are rare, although affections are not seldom measurable (such as ECG-changes).|$|E
25|$|The {{axillary}} {{block is}} particularly useful in providing anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgery to the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. The axillary block {{is also the}} safest of the four main approaches to the brachial plexus, as it does not risk <b>paresis</b> of the phrenic nerve, nor does it {{have the potential to}} cause pneumothorax. In the axilla, the nerves of the brachial plexus and the axillary artery are enclosed together in a fibrous sheath which is a continuation of the deep cervical fascia. The easily palpated axillary artery thus serves as a reliable anatomical landmark for this block, and the injection of local anesthetic close to this artery frequently leads to a good block of the brachial plexus. The axillary block is commonly performed due to its ease of performance and relatively high success rate.|$|E
25|$|GM1 Storage Disease, one of {{a family}} of {{conditions}} called GM1 gangliosidoses, is a recessive, genetic disorder that is inevitably fatal. It is caused by a deficiency of beta-galactosidase, with resulting abnormal storage of acidic lipid materials in cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems, but particularly in the nerve cells. Because PWDs are all rather closely related to one another and share a limited gene pool, PWDs who were GM1 Storage Disease carriers were able to be genetically identified, and the condition has now been almost entirely eliminated from the breed. All breeding stock should be tested for GM-1 storage disease or GM1 gangliosidoses, which is a fatal nerve disease that typically appears when a puppy is approximately six months of age. The affected puppy will show clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction including ataxia, tremors, <b>paresis,</b> and seizures. The pet may also exhibit a change in temperament. Lesions of the retina and clouding of the cornea may occur. GM-1 storage disease is a recessive deficiency of betagalactosidase. The condition has been genetically identified and is no longer common.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} radical {{physical}} therapies {{were developed in}} central and continental Europe in the late 1910s, the 1920s and most particularly, the 1930s. Among these we may note the Austrian psychiatrist Julius Wagner-Jauregg's malarial therapy for general <b>paresis</b> of the insane (or neurosyphilis) first used in 1917, and for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1927. This treatment heralded {{the beginning of a}} radical and experimental era in psychiatric medicine that increasingly broke with an asylum-based culture of therapeutic nihilism in the treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, most particularly dementia praecox (increasingly known as schizophrenia from the 1910s, although the two terms were used more or less interchangeably until at least the end of the 1930s), which were typically regarded as hereditary degenerative disorders and therefore unamenable to any therapeutic intervention. Malarial therapy was followed in 1920 by barbiturate induced deep sleep therapy to treat dementia praecox, which was popularised by the Swiss psychiatrist Jakob Klaesi. In 1933 the Vienna-based psychiatrist Manfred Sakel introduced insulin shock therapy and in August 1934 Ladislas J. Meduna, a Hungarian neuropathologist and psychiatrist working in Budapest, introduced cardiazol shock therapy (cardiazol is the tradename of the chemical compound pentylenetetrazol, known by the tradename metrazol in the United States), which was the first convulsive or seizure therapy for a psychiatric disorder. Again, both of these therapies were initially targeted at curing dementia praecox. Cardiazol shock therapy, founded on the theoretical notion that there existed a biological antagonism between schizophrenia and epilepsy and that therefore inducing epiletiform fits in schizophrenic patients might effect a cure, was superseded by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), invented by the Italian neurologist Ugo Cerletti in 1938.|$|E

500|$|From its {{inception}} until the 1980s, the Paralympic system for classifying athletes {{consisted of a}} medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment. An athlete's medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in. [...] For example, an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb <b>paresis,</b> would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above-knee amputation. [...] The fact that their disability caused the same impairment did not factor into classification determination, the only consideration was their medical diagnosis. [...] It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation {{to an end in}} itself, that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities of the athlete.|$|E
500|$|In 1946 Johnson {{left for}} Denmark {{to be with}} his wife's family. However, his {{behavior}} became increasingly erratic. [...] At Ullevål Hospital in Oslo in spring 1947, he was diagnosed as suffering from syphilis which had impaired both mental and motor function. As a U.S. citizen who was no longer considered mentally competent, he was sent back to New York by the U.S. Embassy in Oslo. An attorney was appointed by the court as his legal guardian, and his belongings were put into storage. He entered the Central Islip State Hospital on Long Island on December 1, 1947, where he was treated for syphilis-induced <b>paresis.</b> He spent the last twenty-three years of his life there. He no longer painted after 1955 and died on April 13, 1970, of hemorrhaging of the pancreas.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, the duo reunited {{again for}} three songs during Simon's two-night {{engagement}} at New York's Beacon Theatre. This led to meetings in 2008 and a reunion tour of Asia and Australia in June 2009. Their headlining {{set at the}} 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival {{was very difficult for}} Garfunkel, who was experiencing serious vocal problems. [...] "I was terrible, and crazy nervous. I leaned on Paul Simon and the affection of the crowd," [...] he told Rolling Stone several years later. Garfunkel was diagnosed with vocal cord <b>paresis,</b> and the remaining tour dates were postponed indefinitely. His manager, John Scher, informed Simon's camp that Garfunkel would be ready within a year, which did not happen, leading to poor relations between the two. Despite tensions, Simon continued to publicly wish his old friend Artie better health and gave him praises for his then angelic voice. Garfunkel regained his vocal strength {{over the course of the}} next four years, performing shows in a Harlem theater and to underground audiences.|$|E
500|$|Residual {{complications}} of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process. Muscle <b>paresis</b> and paralysis can sometimes result in skeletal deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once {{the muscles in}} the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is equinus foot (similar to club foot). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the Achilles tendons {{at the back of}} the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed. In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the other leg continues to grow normally. The result is that one leg is shorter than the other and the person limps and leans to one side, in turn leading to deformities of the spine (such as scoliosis). Osteoporosis and increased likelihood of bone fractures may occur. An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an epiphysiodesis on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of epiphyseal (growth) plate closure, the legs are more equal in length. Alternatively, a person can be fitted with custom made footwear which corrects the difference in leg lengths. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful. [...] Extended use of braces or wheelchairs may cause compression neuropathy, as well as a loss of proper function of the veins in the legs, due to pooling of blood in paralyzed lower limbs. Complications from prolonged immobility involving the lungs, kidneys and heart include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, paralytic ileus, myocarditis and cor pulmonale.|$|E

Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache, irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, hallucinations, stupor, apathy, psychomotor unrest, photophobia, tremor, ataxia, spastic <b>paresis,</b> fatigue, and depression. Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalophathy {{characterized by}} confusion, memory loss, and psychosis.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, the [...] (GNC), {{within the}} Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, was founded.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Ellen Gibbels (University of Cologne) had {{attributed}} the limb trembling in Hitler’s late years to Parkinson's disease, a widely held {{consensus in the}} research community. However, some researchers interpreted Hitler’s tremor as a symptom of advanced syphilis, most recently the American historian Deborah Hayden. Hayden links the general <b>paresis</b> from which Hitler in her opinion suffered since 1942, to the mental decline {{in the last years}} of his life, especially to his [...] "paranoid temper tantrums." [...] The physician Frederick Redlich however reported that there is no evidence that suggests that Hitler had syphilis.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1890s, the Bowery was {{a center}} for {{prostitution}} that rivaled the Tenderloin, and for bars catering to gay men and some lesbians at various social levels, from The Slide at 157 Bleecker Street, New York's [...] "worst dive", to Columbia Hall at 5th Street, called <b>Paresis</b> Hall. One investigator in 1899 found six saloons and dance halls, the resorts of [...] "degenerates" [...] and [...] "fairies", on the Bowery alone. Gay subculture was more highly visible there and more integrated into working-class male culture {{than it was to}} become in the following generations, according to the historian of gay New York, George Chauncey.|$|E
2500|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the scalp can produce an electric current within the brain that activates the motor pathways of the pyramidal tracts. [...] This technique is known as transcranial electrical motor potential (TcMEP) monitoring. [...] This technique effectively evaluates the motor pathways in {{the central nervous system}} during surgeries which place these structures at risk. [...] These motor pathways, including the lateral corticospinal tract, are located in the lateral and ventral funiculi of the spinal cord. [...] Since the ventral and dorsal spinal cord have separate blood supply with very limited collateral flow, an anterior cord syndrome (paralysis or <b>paresis</b> with some preserved sensory function) is a possible surgical sequela, so {{it is important to have}} monitoring specific to the motor tracts as well as dorsal column monitoring.|$|E
2500|$|The medical {{literature}} of the ancient Greeks discusses paralysis and weakness of the arms and legs; the modern word palsy comes from the Ancient Greek words παράλυση or πάρεση, meaning paralysis or <b>paresis</b> respectively. The works {{of the school of}} Hippocrates (460c. 370BCE), and the manuscript On the Sacred Disease in particular, describe a group of problems that matches up very well with the modern understanding of cerebral palsy. The Roman Emperor Claudius (10 BCE54 CE) is suspected of having CP, as historical records describe him as having several physical problems in line with the condition. [...] Medical historians have begun to suspect and find depictions of CP in much later art. Several paintings from the 16th century and later show individuals with problems consistent with it, such as Jusepe de Ribera's 1642 painting The Clubfoot.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the number of}} {{patients}} residing in mental hospitals increased significantly while {{little in the way of}} effective medical treatment was available. Lobotomy was one of a series of radical and invasive physical therapies developed in Europe at this time that signaled a break with a psychiatric culture of therapeutic nihilism that had prevailed since the late nineteenth-century. The new [...] "heroic" [...] physical therapies devised during this experimental era, including malarial therapy for general <b>paresis</b> of the insane (1917), deep sleep therapy (1920), insulin shock therapy (1933), cardiazol shock therapy (1934), and electroconvulsive therapy (1938), helped to imbue the then therapeutically moribund and demoralised psychiatric profession with a renewed sense of optimism in the curability of insanity and the potency of their craft. The success of the shock therapies, despite the considerable risk they posed to patients, also helped to accommodate psychiatrists to ever more drastic forms of medical intervention, including lobotomy.|$|E
