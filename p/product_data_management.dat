ES is a manufacturer of accounting and enterprise resource planning software based in the Netherlands. ES has combined <b>Product</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Management</b> (PDM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Software Configuration Management (SCM) {{in order to maintain the}} configuration at the customer site in a better and less complex way. ES has a module in its CRM software that contains all contracts of each customer. This is linked to their PDM system. Every contract corresponds to files that can be downloaded for a new version or update of a previous version. In the delivery phase this means that the customers are able to obtain all the products through an online connection. So ES sells contracts (licenses) and stores them into their CRM system, the delivery of the actual products can be done by the customers themselves completely automated requiring little effort. The PDM system is on its turn linked to the SCM system which keeps track of the configurations the customers are using. In the delivery phase this means that ES is able to automatically determine the customer needs whenever a customer does a request.|$|E

2500|$|The {{adjective}} [...] "open-source" [...] {{not only}} {{refers to a}} specific set of freedoms applying to a product, but also generally presupposes that the product is the object or the result of a [...] "process that relies on the contributions of geographically dispersed developers via the Internet." [...] In practice however, in both fields of open-source hardware and open-source software, products may either be the result of a development process performed by a closed team in a private setting or by a community in a public environment, the first case being more frequent than the second which is more challenging. Establishing a community-based product development process faces several challenges such as: to find appropriate <b>product</b> <b>data</b> <b>management</b> tools, document not only the product but also the development process itself, accepting losing ubiquitous control over the project, ensure continuity in a context of fickle participation of voluntary project members, among others.|$|E

In this paper, the aircraft product BOM layer and structure are analyzed in the "airframer-suppliers " development model, operations and changes during the BOM transition and reconstruction from engineering BOM to manufacturing BOM are illustrated. The differences between engineering BOM and manufacturing BOM which are generated during the BOM transition are classified into “normal inconsistencies ” and “erroneous inconsistencies”. For the erroneous inconsistencies inspection, a product structure relation based conformity inspection method is proposed. The corresponding algorithm is clarified, and its workflow is described in detail. The civil aircraft conformity inspection system is developed.
