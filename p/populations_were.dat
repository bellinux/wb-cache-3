5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, {{the anatomy}} of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian duck and the Mascarene coot, {{it appears that the}} Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both <b>populations</b> <b>were</b> said to be easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E

5|$|A 2008 genetic {{study showed}} {{that some of the}} woolly mammoths that entered North America through the Bering land bridge from Asia {{migrated}} back about 300,000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including the Hot Springs sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth <b>populations</b> <b>were</b> absent there.|$|E

The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. Monk seals have developed a fear of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 monk seals in total.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{recognition}} {{of more than one}} species, differences in population density were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near Ambanja. Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's giant mouse lemur was found in lower densities than the northern giant mouse lemur. The former range between 30 and 210individuals per square kilometer (250acres), with lower densities in open areas of the forest, while the latter has been recorded with 385 to 1,086individuals per km2. However, {{in the case of the}} northern giant mouse lemur, <b>populations</b> <b>were</b> found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of introduced cashew and mango help sustain these higher populations.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus fossils {{have been}} {{described}} from 10 US states, including Texas, Montana, and many along the East Coast. Fossils have also been found in northern Mexico. It lived {{on both sides of}} the Western Interior Seaway, and was an opportunistic apex predator in the coastal regions of eastern North America. Deinosuchus reached its largest size in its western habitat, but the eastern <b>populations</b> <b>were</b> far more abundant. Opinion remains divided as to whether these two populations represent separate species. Deinosuchus was probably capable of killing and eating large dinosaurs. It may have also fed upon sea turtles, fish, and other aquatic and terrestrial prey.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{were first}} {{studied in the}} wild by Petter and colleagues in 1971.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, major {{industries}} in the watershed of Roaring Creek included agriculture. However, the creek was also used as water power for a small gristmill. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Roaring Creek and Bear Gap. Their <b>populations</b> <b>were</b> 407 and 124, respectively. In the early 1900s, the only major industries in Franklin Township were gristmills on the creek {{on the border between}} it and Cleveland Township. There were historically proposals to use the creek as a water supply for Danville, transferring the water via pipes under the Susquehanna River. Andrew Trone once constructed a hotel on the creek.|$|E
5|$|In the {{preparation}} for possible entry into World War II, the Turkish government introduced a tax, the Varlık Vergisi, which disproportionately targeted Turkey's non-Muslim residents. Many Armenians, and other non-Muslim <b>populations,</b> <b>were</b> {{forced to sell}} their property at significantly reduced prices through public auctions {{in order to pay}} for the sudden tax hike or have the properties confiscated by the state. In addition, the law allowed authorities to confiscate the property of any relative of a taxed person in order to pay the tax. From this tax, the Turkish government collected 314,900,000 liras or about US$270 million (80% of the state budget) from the confiscation of non-Muslim assets.|$|E
5|$|Later, the cytological {{basis of}} the gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} extended from about 1900–1944 and was initiated by the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's (1822–1884) laws of plant heredity first published in 1866 in Experiments on Plant Hybridization and based on cultivated pea, Pisum sativum: this heralded the opening up of plant genetics. The cytological basis for gene-chromosome theory was explored through the role of polyploidy and hybridization in speciation and it was becoming better understood that interbreeding <b>populations</b> <b>were</b> the unit of adaptive change in biology.|$|E

5|$|Modern whaling {{was more}} {{efficient}} than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales, but as these <b>populations</b> <b>were</b> taken, sperm whaling increased.

In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales {{off the coast of}} Peru alone. After World War II, whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.|$|E
