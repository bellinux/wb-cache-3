Gimmicks included glow-in-the-dark, hologram-enhanced, die-cut, embossing, foil stamped or foil-embossed covers. Gimmicks were almost entirely cosmetic in nature, and almost never extended to improved content of the comics. However, many speculators would buy multiple copies of these issues, anticipating that demand would allow them to sell them for a substantial profit in the future.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{documents}} used in logistics. They are called: invoices, packing lists/slips/sheets (manifests), content lists, pick tickets, arrival acknowledgement forms/reports of many types (e.g. MSDS, damaged goods, returned goods, detailed/summary, etc.), import/export, delivery, {{bill of lading}} (BOL), etc. These documents are usually the contracts between the consignee and the consignor, so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary, like a third party logistics company (3PL) and governments. Document handling within logistics, supply chain management and distribution centers is usually performed manual labor or semi-automatically using bar code scanners, software and tabletop laser printers. There are some manufacturers of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed wallet/pouch to the shipping container (usually a flexible <b>polybag</b> or corrugated fiberboard/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems. Protection of Privacy and Identity Theft are major concerns, especially {{with the increase of}} e-Commerce, Internet/Online shopping and Shopping channel (other, past references are catalogue and mail order shopping) making it more important than ever to guarantee the correct document is married or associated to the correct order or shipment every time.

5000|$|After {{attending}} the School of Visual Arts, Jon Bogdanove's first work for Marvel Comics was Alpha Flight #32 (March 1986). He then became the regular artist on Power Pack as of #22 (May 1986) and would draw that {{title for the}} next four years. Bogdanove collaborated with writer Chris Claremont on the Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men limited series in 1987 and with Louise Simonson on the X-Terminators series the following year. In 1991, Bogdanove began drawing for DC Comics. He, Louise Simonson, and editor Mike Carlin launched a new Superman title, Superman: The Man of Steel — which Bogdanove would draw for nearly eight years until #85 (Jan. 1999). He contributed to the [...] "Panic in the Sky" [...] storyline in 1992. That same year, Bogdanove and Simonson (along with Carlin, Dan Jurgens, Roger Stern and others) were the architects of The Death of Superman storyline, in which Superman died and was resurrected. It was during that storyline, in The Adventures of Superman #500 (June 1993), that Simonson and Bogdanove introduced their character Steel, who graduated to his own title in February 1994. The character went on to feature in an eponymous feature film starring Shaquille O'Neal in 1997. The Bogdanove-drawn Superman: The Man of Steel #30 (Feb. 1994) had a variant edition packaged in a <b>polybag.</b> The logo and all cover copy were printed on the bag and vinyl clings (similar to Colorforms) were included for a do-it-yourself front and back cover. Bogdanove was one of the many artists who contributed to the Superman: The Wedding Album one-shot in 1996 wherein the title character married Lois Lane. After leaving the Superman: The Man of Steel title, Bogdanove drew two intercompany crossovers for DC Comics: Superman & Savage Dragon: Metropolis (Nov. 1999) co-published with Image Comics and Superman / Aliens II: God War (May 2002 - Nov. 2002) co-published with Dark Horse Comics. Bogdanove reunited with Louise Simonson for the DC Retroactive: Superman - The '90s one-shot in October 2011.|$|E

40|$|Reforestation {{is needed}} {{globally}} {{to help restore}} degraded sites, combat desertification, protect watersheds, and provide forest products. This involves planting forest tree seedlings grown in local nurseries, but technologies to produce quality seedlings are lacking in developing countries. Modern nursery containers used to propagate seedlings have internal-surface barriers (ribs or ridges) or side-slits to prevent root spiraling. These are cost prohibitive or unavailable in developing countries and so <b>polybags</b> (plastic bags) are more commonly used, despite their tendency to produce seedlings with deformed root systems that have less potential to establish on field sites. Discarded plastic bottles, which are readily available worldwide, may be a feasible alternative for seedling propagation. We conducted two experiments to assess the potential of repurposed plastic beverage bottles to grow quality trees: 1) Container Comparison-to evaluate Arizona walnut (Juglans major [Toor. ] Heller) and Afghan pine (Pinus eldarica Medw.) seedling root and shoot development in two plastic bottle types compared to modern nursery containers and <b>polybags,</b> and 2) Bottle Modification-to {{examine the effects of}} root spiraling prevention techniques (side-slits, internal-ridges, and control) and container opacity (green, black, and clear) on Afghan pine seedling morphological attributes. Nursery growth and first-year seedling field performance were evaluated for both experiments. In experiment one, seedlings of both species had fewer spiraled roots in bottle containers compared to <b>polybags.</b> Arizona walnut had more fibrous root systems in <b>polybags,</b> while Afghan pine root system fibrosity was greatest in bottle containers. First-year field performance of both species was not affected by container type. In experiment two, less spiraled roots occurred in containers with air-slits and interior-ridges compared to the control. The effects of container opacity on seedling morphology were inconsistent. Root spiral prevention and opacity had no influence on Afghan pine one-year survival, field height and diameter, with the exception of opacity for height growth, whereby seedlings grown in green containers were taller than those grown in black containers, but seedlings grown in clear containers were similar to both. Our results provide the first evidence that plastic bottle containers may provide an effective alternative for production of high quality seedlings, which may benefit agroforestry, reforestation, restoration, and conservation programs in developing countries...|$|R
