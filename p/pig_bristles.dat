5|$|Operation Pig Bristle was {{an unusual}} {{transport}} task conducted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in May 1946. The operation was ordered by the Australian Government {{in response to a}} national shortage of paint brushes, which was hindering house-building efforts. No. 38 Squadron of the RAAF was given the task of transporting 25 tonnes of <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> from Chongqing in China to Hong Kong, from where the bristles were shipped to Australia.

5|$|Bristle {{toothbrush}}: According to a Library of Congress website, the Chinese {{have used}} the bristle toothbrush since 1498, {{during the reign of}} the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644); it also adds that the toothbrush was not mass-produced until 1780, when they were sold by a William Addis of Clerkenwell, London, England. In accordance with the Library of Congress website, scholar John Bowman also writes that the bristle toothbrush using <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> was invented in China during the 1490s.

40|$|Throughout antiquity many {{materials}} {{have been used}} to approximate wounds. As early as 5000 - 3000 B. C. E., eyed needles were used to pass suture material through surgical wounds. By 2000 B. C. E. boned needles began usage in a fashion unsurpassed until Renaissance times. Materials connected to these needles included flax, hemp, fascia, hair, linen strips, <b>pig's</b> <b>bristles,</b> reeds, gras-ses, and other exotic materials available. Tying of locks of scalp hair into knots to close scalp wounds was com-mon djring battles and is still employed as a temporary measure in some busy emergency rooms. Perhaps the most legendary wound closure was the use of the mouth parts of the pincher ant. In all, natural products alone sufficed as suture material until the 1940 s.

60|$|The chief butler liked {{nothing better}} than to see people turned into swine, or making any kind of a beast of themselves; so he made haste to bring the royal goblet, filled with a liquid as bright as gold, and which kept {{sparkling}} upward, and throwing a sunny spray over the brim. But, delightfully as the wine looked, it was mingled with the most potent enchantments that Circe knew how to concoct. For every drop of the pure grape juice there were two drops of the pure mischief; and the danger of the thing was, that the mischief made it taste all the better. The mere smell of the bubbles, which effervesced at the brim, was enough to turn a man's beard into <b>pig's</b> <b>bristles,</b> or make a lion's claws grow out of his fingers, or a fox's brush behind him.|$|R
50|$|Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, {{a printer}} and {{bookseller}} by trade, was inspired when he happened to read about the anatomy of the human ear {{in the course of}} his business. His phonautograph was constructed as an analog of the ear canal, eardrum and ossicles. Scott created several variations of the device. The functions of the ear canal and eardrum were simulated by a funnel-like horn or a small open-ended barrel with a flexible membrane of parchment or other suitable material stretched over the small end. A <b>pig</b> <b>bristle</b> or other very lightweight stylus was connected to the membrane, sometimes by an indirect linkage which roughly simulated the ossicles and served as an amplifying lever. The bristle traced a line through a thin coating of lampblack—finely divided carbon deposited by the flame of an oil or gas lamp—on a moving surface of paper or glass. The sound collected by the simulated ear and transmitted to the bristle caused the line to be modulated in accordance with the passing variations in air pressure, creating a graphic record of the sound waves.|$|R
5|$|As the Chinese Civil War was raging at {{the time}} and Communist forces were attacking river boats {{travelling}} from Chongqing, it was judged necessary to transport the <b>pig</b> <b>bristles</b> from the city by air. The Kuomintang government agreed to allow RAAF and Royal Air Force aircraft to fly return flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing between 1 and 14 May only. After arriving in Hong Kong, the bristles would be shipped to Australia by sea. Both the Kuomintang government and the Communist forces were concerned about the presence of foreigners in China, and the Australian aircrew were warned that they would be imprisoned if they landed anywhere other than Chongqing or an emergency airstrip at Canton.|$|E

25|$|In Europe, William Addis of England is {{believed}} to have produced the first mass produced toothbrush in 1780. In 1770, he had been jailed for causing a riot.

After saving a small bone from a meal, he drilled small holes into the bone and tied into the bone tufts of bristles that he had obtained from one of the guards, passed the tufts of bristle through the holes in the bone and sealed the holes with glue. After his release, he became wealthy after starting a business manufacturing toothbrushes. He died in 1808, bequeathing the business to his eldest son. It remained within family ownership until 1996. Under the name Wisdom Toothbrushes, the company now manufactures 70 million toothbrushes per year in the UK.

A slaughter-house worker aged 47 attended the der-matological clinic with one month's history of wetness and irritation of the skin between the left middle and ring fingers. He was right-handed and did not wear a ring. The left ring finger had become inflamed six months previously, the inflammation subsiding towards the base of the digit and resulting in the gradual formation of a lump dorsally over a period of three months. On examination there was an interdigital sinus from which protruded two lengths of hard bristle 0 25 in. (0 - 63 cm.) long. The sinus when probed was found to extend towards a granulomatous plaque which was 0 5 in. (1 - 27 cm.) in diameter and situated dorsally I in. (2 ' 54 cm.) from the interdigital web. Under local anaesthesia the plaque and sinus were excised en bloc. Within this tissue about a dozen lengths of bristle were found. These were promptly identified by the patient himself as having come off a pig. He had worked for 20 years in a slaughter-house.
