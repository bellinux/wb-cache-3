5|$|He {{was born}} and raised in County Durham, {{attending}} Durham School, where he was head boy and excelled at many sports, especially rugby. He went on to study at Keble College, Oxford, playing rugby for the college and captaining the team in his final year. He played in the 1911 Varsity Match, in which he scored a try.

Once again despite Nathan's numbers, he was not <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> the All-Star team. Nathan finished the year by converting 37 of 41 save opportunities {{with a record of}} 4–2 and an ERA of 1.88. The Twins however had a disappointing season and missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The company {{behind the}} team, {{initially}} named Professional Cycling Denmark, {{was created in}} autumn 1996 by former amateur cycling world champion Alex Pedersen, Finn Poulsen (representing Bestseller), Torben Kølbæk and Johannes Poulsen (from Herning CK), and Bjarne Riis (then a Team Telekom rider).

5|$|Abdur-Rahim was {{selected}} third overall by the Vancouver Grizzlies in the 1996 Draft, behind Allen Iverson and Marcus Camby. He made an immediate impact {{playing for the}} Grizzlies, becoming the team's leading scorer while setting a franchise record of 18.7 ppg. He also averaged 6.9 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 35minutes per game. He finished third in balloting for the Schick NBA Rookie of the Year behind Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and Minnesota's Stephon Marbury, and he was <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> the All-Rookie First Team. By {{the end of the}} 1996–97 season, Abdur-Rahim led the team in scoring on 33 occasions, rebounding on 23 occasions.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 1,050runs (including six centuries) at {{an average}} of 75.00 in the 1940–41 season, Barnes played little cricket until 1945–46, when he scored centuries in five {{successive}} matches for New South Wales. He was <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> the 1945–46 Australian tour of New Zealand and played in the representative match that was later designated as the first Test match between the two countries: he made 54 as Australia won easily. The post-war period also saw a new approach to batting on the part of Barnes. He discarded his aggressive and flamboyant shot-making and re-invented himself as a watchful, more defensive player, which made his scoring more prolific, although less crowd pleasing.|$|E
5|$|Born near Te Awamutu, Cunningham {{originally}} played club rugby in Waihi, in the Coromandel region. Lying {{within the}} Auckland Rugby Football Union's boundaries, {{he was selected}} to play for Auckland province in 1899 and continued to represent the side {{until his retirement in}} 1913. He was first <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> New Zealand in 1901, and played against New South Wales that year, but was not selected again until the 1905 Originals' tour. After the tour he continued to represent New Zealand in both 1907 and 1908. Affiliating to Rongowhakaata, {{he was a member of}} the first ever New Zealand Māori team in 1910, and played for them again in 1912. On retirement in 1913 he had appeared for Auckland 45 times, and for New Zealand 39—both large numbers for the time.|$|E

5|$|He practiced at the Bhiwani Boxing Club, where former national-level boxer and Jagdish Singh {{recognised}} his talent. Working part-time, he {{even tried}} {{his hand at}} modelling to financially support his coaching. The first recognition for Vijender came when he won a bout in the state level competition. Vijender won a silver medal in his first sub-junior nationals in 1997 {{and went on to}} bag his first gold medal at the 2000 Nationals. In 2003, he became the all-India youth boxing champion. The turning point, however, came in the 2003 Afro-Asian Games. Despite being a junior boxer, Vijender took part in the selection trials and was <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> the meet where he fought valiantly to win a silver medal.|$|E
5|$|Nash was <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> Tasmania in two matches {{against the}} touring South Africans in January 1932. He failed {{to perform in}} the first match in Launceston, taking 1/68 and 2/45 and scoring 17 and 9. However, Nash had a lively bowling {{performance}} in the Hobart match, making the ball come off the wicket at a great pace and gaining match figures of 9/137, including two wickets in consecutive balls and breaking batsman Eric Dalton's jaw with a vicious bouncer on the hat-trick ball. South African captain Jock Cameron praised Nash for his performance as his bowling in the match {{was thought to be}} as quick and dangerous as any bowler in the world.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Britain, Horrocks took up the modern pentathlon.

5|$|Ray Mathias {{spent his}} entire playing career from 1964 to 1984 at Tranmere, making a record 637 {{appearances}} in all competitions. Mathias went on to manage the team in 2002. Harold Bell made a record 595 league appearances for Tranmere. Bell also holds {{the record for the}} most consecutive league appearances for a British team; he was <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> the first game after the Second World War in the 1946–47 season and did not miss a match until 30 August 1955, a total of 401 consecutive matches in the Third Division North.|$|E
5|$|Ring's war {{service in}} the Far East meant {{that he did not}} appear in the Australian Services XI that made such an impact in England. He resumed his state cricket career in 1946–47, and made the only century of his career, 145, against Queensland at Melbourne, sharing a sixth wicket {{partnership}} of 288 runs with Sam Loxton, who made 232. The batting success was offset by less effective bowling: he took just 18 Sheffield Shield wickets, barely half the number (33) achieved by Victoria's left-arm spinner George Tribe, who was <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> three Tests against England that season, but then turned his back on Australian cricket and moved to England.|$|E
5|$|She {{attended}} The British School in the Netherlands until 2006. It {{was in the}} Netherlands {{that she}} first started playing cricket, after being prevented from playing club football alongside boys beyond the age of 13. Turning to cricket instead, Westbury played boys cricket for The Hague Cricket Club, and was <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> the national side aged just 14, making her first appearance at the 2004 Women's European Under-21 Championships. At 15 she made her senior international debut at the 2005 Women's European Championship.

5|$|The at-large {{spot in the}} Orange Bowl {{was filled}} via a {{round-robin}} selection procedure defined by the other Bowl Championship series games (the Sugar, Fiesta, and Rose bowls) and the automatic bids. If a game's automatic bid team is selected for the BCS National Championship Game, it is allowed to select a replacement team. In the 2010 season, teams otherwise designated for the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl were <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> the national championship game. Following the two compensatory selections are the at-large picks. The order of at-large selections rotates annually among the BCS bowls.|$|E
5|$|The summer {{transfer}} {{window at}} Real Sociedad saw {{the arrival of}} Alonso's childhood friend Mikel Arteta. Arteta was ecstatic {{at the prospect of}} partnering Alonso in midfield but his excitement was short lived. Alonso was not <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> Real Sociedad's pre-season friendlies, signalling that an offer by Liverpool was being treated seriously. The Basque side announced on 20 August 2004 that they had made a deal worth £10.7million with Liverpool and Alonso had agreed terms with the Merseyside team. Alonso did not lament the fact that a move to Real Madrid had not materialised. Instead, he concentrated on integrating with the new Spanish contingent at Liverpool under the guidance of former Valencia manager Rafael Benítez.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the squads <b>picked</b> <b>for</b> the 2007 Cricket World Cup. This was {{the ninth}} Cricket World Cup tournament and was held between 14 March and 28 April 2007.

Changes were allowed after this deadline at the discretion of the ICCs Technical Committee in necessary cases, such as due to player injury. In order to aid the teams to select the final fifteen, teams were given the option to announce a thirty-man squad by mid-January, with the understanding that the final squad would be picked from within these thirty players. However this was not strictly adhered to—several of England's final fifteen came from outside the initial thirty, for example.|$|E
