5000|$|In telecommunication, {{the term}} RF <b>power</b> <b>margin</b> has the {{following}} meanings: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{an optical}} {{communications}} link, the optical <b>power</b> <b>margin</b> {{is the difference}} between the optical power that is launched by a given transmitter into the fiber, less transmission losses from all causes, and the minimum optical power that is required by the receiver for a specified level of performance. An optical <b>power</b> <b>margin</b> is typically measured using a calibrated light source and an optical power meter.|$|E
5000|$|The optical <b>power</b> <b>margin</b> {{is usually}} {{expressed}} in decibels (dB). At least several dB of optical <b>power</b> <b>margin</b> {{should be included}} in the optical power budget. The amount of optical power launched into a given fiber by a given transmitter depends on the nature of its active optical source (LED or laser diode) and the type of fiber, including such parameters as core diameter and numerical aperture.|$|E
30|$|Fast-fading {{effects in}} the {{propagation}} are not included. This is consistent with their reduced values in the final coverage due to the terminal interleaver and the existent time and <b>power</b> <b>margins</b> for mobility and cell reselection.|$|R
30|$|Initially, {{and at the}} end of each {{iteration}} step, each residual {{base station}} updates its collected CQI data, interference <b>power</b> <b>margins</b> and channel gain matrices and computes the marginal interference power level for its critical client nodes.|$|R
30|$|Numerical {{results will}} show that the SU network (SN) {{throughput}} depends on the additional separation radius which is used for protection of PUs. The SN consists of SB and SU terminals. For example, without the additional separation radius, the transmit <b>power</b> <b>margins</b> are significantly increased. This fact implies an existence of optimal additional separation radius, and this will also be confirmed by the numerical results.|$|R
5000|$|In telecommunication, the <b>power</b> <b>margin</b> is the {{difference}} between available signal power and the minimum signal power needed to overcome system losses and still satisfy the minimum input requirements of the receiver for a given performance level.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to transmission loss, {{including those of}} any splices and connectors, allowance should be made for at least several dB of optical <b>power</b> <b>margin</b> losses, to compensate for component aging and to allow for future splices {{in the event of}} a severed cable.|$|E
5000|$|System power [...] {{reflects}} the excess signal level, {{present at the}} input of the receiver, that is available to compensate for (a) the effects of component aging in the transmitter, receiver, or physical transmission medium, and (b) a deterioration in propagation conditions.

40|$|The {{communications}} {{performances of}} laser intersatellite links {{for a future}} NASA data-relay system are analyzed, and block diagrams of necessary optical terminals are generated based on technology projected to be available by 1992. Direct-detection optical communications subsystems are selected to interconnect two geosynchronous (GEO) satellites separated by 160 deg along the GEO arc and to interconnect a low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite and either of the GEO satellites. The terminal designs are based on power budget calculations performed for the various links with and without an optical background in either the receiver or transmitter fields of view (FOVs). Optical antennas with 18 -cm and 30 -cm primary mirror diameters on the LEO and GEO satellites can achieve a 0. 000001 average bit error rate during normal operations {{in each of the}} forward and return optical links with beginning-of-life (BOL) <b>power</b> <b>margins</b> of approximately 7 dB. With an optical background in the receiver FOV, communications in the GEO-GEO return link are interrupted, the LEO-GEO return link is undegraded, and the GEO-GEO and LEO-GEO forward links remain functional with reduced BOL <b>power</b> <b>margins.</b> With an optical background in the transmitter FOV, the GEO-GEO forward and return links are noticeably degraded, the LEO-GEO return link is only slightly degraded, and the LEO-GEO forward link remains undegraded...|$|R

5000|$|Bell 47 {{helicopters}} {{were the}} first, lightweight aerial cranes {{to be used}} in the early 1950s. Unfortunately, due to the helicopter's limited power, it was never capable of carrying more than just a few hundred pounds of cargo. In the 1960s, the Sikorsky S-58 replaced the Bell 47 because of its larger <b>power</b> <b>margin.</b> Even today, S-58s can be found carrying medium-size loads. The 1960s also brought the Bell 211 HueyTug, a specially produced commercial version of the UH-1C for lifting medium loads, and even the popular Bell 206 was used for light loads. But there continued to be a demand for aircraft able to lift even larger loads ...|$|E
50|$|Enhanced Uplink adds a new {{transport}} channel to WCDMA, called the Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH). Further it features several improvements {{similar to those}} of HSDPA, including multi-code transmission, shorter Transmission Time Interval (TTI) enabling faster link adaptation, fast scheduling and fast Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) with incremental redundancy making retransmissions more effective. Similarly to HSDPA, HSUPA uses a packet scheduler, but it operates on a request-grant principle where the UEs request a permission to send data and the scheduler decides when and how many UEs will be allowed to do so. A request for transmission contains data {{about the state of the}} transmission buffer and the queue at the UE and its available <b>power</b> <b>margin.</b> However, unlike HSDPA, uplink transmissions are not orthogonal to each other.|$|E

The tool analyzes and displays the impacts of uncertainties in forecasts of loads and renewable generation on: (1) congestion, (2) voltage and transient stability margins, and (3) voltage reductions and reactive <b>power</b> <b>margins.</b> The impacts are analyzed in the base case and under user-specified contingencies.

50|$|Link adaptation, or {{adaptive}} coding and modulation (ACM), {{is a term}} used in wireless communications to denote the matching of the modulation, coding and other signal and protocol parameters to the conditions on the radio link (e.g. the pathloss, the interference due to signals coming from other transmitters, {{the sensitivity of the}} receiver, the available transmitter <b>power</b> <b>margin,</b> etc.). For example, WiMAX uses a rate adaptation algorithm that adapts the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) according {{to the quality of the}} radio channel, and thus the bit rate and robustness of data transmission. The process of link adaptation is a dynamic one and the signal and protocol parameters change as the radio link conditions change—for example in High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) this can take place every 2 ms.|$|E
5000|$|Technology scaling {{has enabled}} to design very {{powerful}} and versatile computing systems on smaller chips. As the smaller feature size allows more functions {{to be implemented}} in the same area, there is an escalation in current density and the associated power dissipation. As the demands for high processing power and clock-rates are ever increasing due to the higher integration, the power consumption and thermal performance of Integrated circuit is emerging as the limiting factor for high performance processor systems. Also the need for reducing the self-heating of the processor chips operating in automotive temperature environments enhances the need for solutions that reduce power dissipation [...]A lot of techniques {{can be used to}} transform a high-performance system into a low power system.However,minimizing power consumption in digital CMOS circuits requires a lot of design effort at system, architectural, circuit and device levels. Supply Voltage reduction technique {{is one of the most}} effective ways of reducing the power consumption.Nevertheless, one direct consequence of static supply voltage scaling is performance degradation.To maintain the desired throughput, Dynamic voltage scaling systems are used to adjust the supply voltage according to the throughput requirements [...] But there is still a large amount of <b>power</b> <b>margin</b> wasted in the Open-loop DVS systems and to overcome this AVS systems are being examined.|$|E
50|$|The {{architecture}} of generic Dynamic Voltage Scaling system has a performance manager, a Phase-locked loop and a Voltage regulator.The performance manager block uses a software interface {{in order to}} predict the performance requirements of the next task.Once {{the determination of the}} power requirement is done, the voltage and frequency are set by the performance Manager in order to finish the task.The Phase-locked loop accomplishes the frequency scaling depending on the target frequency set by the performance manager.Similarly the Voltage regulator is programmed to scale the supply voltage so as to achieve the target voltage for the task.Thus, the characterization of the systems employing DVS requires characterization at at least two ends of operating range.In fact the characterization of DVS systems depends on the underlying voltage scaling methodology. The basic operation of both open loop DVS systems (the conventional DVS systems) and the closed loop DVS systems (Adaptive voltage systems) is same with the difference lying in the selection of the target voltage-frequency relationship.The Open-loop DVS systems employ the one-to-one mapping of the voltage to frequency to perform the voltage scaling.The frequency-voltage pairs are stored in Lookup table and are obtained as per the determined task needs.In case of the Open-loop DVS systems the frequency-voltage relationship is determined by considering the chip characterization at worst case conditions so as to guarantee the robust operation under the temperature and process variations.Thus in order to accommodate for the worst case variations {{there is a lot of}} <b>power</b> <b>margin</b> left by the open loop DVS systems for power scaling.This margin is not lost in closed loop systems because they employ a feedback mechanism that keeps probing the actual on chip conditions and according to that the target voltage and frequency are determined.The most important design parameters are to be considered while choosing between the Open-loop and closed loop configurations is stability against temperature fluctuations.The temperature stability is guaranteed in the conventional Open-loop systems because they are chosen for worst case conditions.But the energy savings are drastically reduced due to the large margins considered.|$|E

Sometimes field performance falls short of design and customer expectations. Recent flight tests conducted by the tri-service Advanced Range Telemetry (ARTM) project confirm that the dominant source of bit errors and short term link failures are “clusters” of severe error burst activity produced by flat fading, dispersive fading and poor antenna patterns on airborne vehicles. This paper introduces the techniques used by ARTM to measure bit error performance of aeronautical telemetry links...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a complete fade countermeasure system, designed for thin route user-oriented and fully meshed satellite networks. The signal degradation {{due to the}} residual uplink attenuation after up-power control intervention, plus the down-link attenuation, is compensated for by varying the FEC coding and bit rates of the data. Down and up-link signal degradations are evaluated separately: the former by collecting statistics of quantised levels of the demodulated PSK signal, and the latter by using a narrow band signal level estimator. Measurement times are optimised using a model to evaluate the scintillation variance. The performance evaluation of the whole system {{in the presence of}} additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), shows that very small link <b>power</b> <b>margins</b> can be adopted...|$|R
5000|$|Quoted from Status Report - October 13, 1994Communication {{with the}} Magellan {{spacecraft}} was lost early Wednesday morning, following an aggressive series of five Orbit Trim Maneuvers (OTMs) on Tuesday, October 11, which took the orbit {{down into the}} upper atmosphere of Venus. The Termination experiment (extension of September [...] "Windmill" [...] experiment) design was expected to result in final loss of the spacecraft due to a negative <b>power</b> <b>margin.</b> This {{was not a problem}} since spacecraft power would have been too low to sustain operations {{in the next few weeks}} due to continuing solar cell loss.Thus, a final controlled experiment was designed to maximize mission return. This final, low altitude was necessary to study the effects of a carbon dioxide atmosphere.The final OTM took the periapsis to 139.7 km where the sensible drag on the spacecraft was very evident. The solar panel temperatures rose to 126 deg. C. and the attitude control system fired all available Y-axis thrusters to counteract the torques. However, attitude control was maintained to the end.The main bus voltage dropped to 24.7 volts after five orbits, and it was predicted that attitude control would be lost if the power dropped below 24 volts. It was decided to enhance the Windmill experiment by changing the panel angles for the remaining orbits. This was also a preplanned experiment option.At this point, the spacecraft was expected to survive only two orbits.Magellan continued to maintain communication for three more orbits, even though the power continued to drop below 23 volts and eventually reached 20.4 volts. At this time, one battery went off-line, and the spacecraft was defined as power starved.Communication was lost at 3:02 AM PDT just as Magellan was about to enter an Earth occultation on orbit 15032. Contact was not re-established. Tracking operations were continued to 11:00 AM but no signal was seen, and none was expected. The spacecraft should land on Venus by 1:00 PM PDT Thursday, October 13, 1994.|$|E

Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of precipitation on the earth-space path, including rain attenuation, and rain and ice-particle depolarization. Sky noise, antenna gain degradation, scintillations, and bandwidth coherence are also discussed. The impact of the various propagation factors on communications system design criteria is presented.
