40|$|This study {{represents}} part of {{a broader}} investigation into novel seed broadcasting methodologies as a means to optimize rehabilitation techniques following sand mining. Specifically, the study investigated the use of <b>polymer</b> <b>seed</b> coatings, time of sowing application, and in situ raking of the topsoil to optimize seedling recruitment to site. For <b>polymer</b> <b>seed</b> coatings, an ex situ trial was undertaken to evaluate seed coating effects on seedling emergence. Results demonstrated that seed coatings did not significantly inhibit maximum emergence percentage of 10 Banksia woodland species (out of 11 evaluated), but coated seeds from four species were on average 2 – 6 days slower to emerge than noncoated seeds. Seed coatings were found to have a greater effect in situ, with more coated seeds emerging than noncoated seeds. Topsoil raking (following seed sowing) and time of sowing were found to have the greatest impact on seedling emergence, with higher emergence following topsoil raking (5 - to 90 -fold increase) and sowing in May (late autumn) (1. 4 - to 12 -fold increase) rather than in July (mid-winter). The implications for mining rehabilitation are discussed, and areas for further research are considered...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the effect of three seed application rates (265, 395 and 530 mL 100 kg seeds - 1) of polymer based mixture of Copper (Cu), Manganese (Mn) and Zinc (Zn) micronutrients on dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) near Blackville, SC from 2010 to 2012. Compared to untreated control, seed coating significantly increased grain yields by 5. 0 and 2. 1 % with seed applications at 530 and 395 mL 100 kg seeds - 1, respectively. Dry matter yield improved over control by 13. 4, 22. 6 and 20. 7 %, N uptake by 13. 9, 24. 6 and 19. 3 % and P in plant biomass by 16. 0, 23. 3 and 21. 3 % with seed applications at 265, 395 and 530 mL 100 kg seeds - 1, respectively. Coating application of 265 mL 100 kg seeds - 1 increased grain N content by 5. 0 % compared to control. Grain P uptake was greater with seed application rates of 265 and 395 mL 100 kg seeds - 1 (0. 415 and 0. 399 %, respectively) than 530 mL 100 kg seeds - 1 (0. 385 %). Significantly higher grain Cu uptake was observed at rate of 395 mL 100 kg seeds - 1 than 265 and 530 mL 100 kg seeds - 1. Based on significant linear relationships, increasing dry matter yield and N uptake by 1 kg ha - 1, Zn content in plant biomass and grain Cu content by 1 ppm and plant height by 1 cm, increased grain yields by 2. 6, 369. 3, 27. 8, 18. 3 and 58. 3 kg ha - 1, respectively. Grain yields improved by 706. 4, 357. 4 and 436. 2 kg ha - 1 with increasing plant Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by 0. 1 unit at 16, 18 and 21 weeks after planting.

40|$|Chemically {{anisotropic}} dumbbell-shaped colloids {{are prepared}} starting from cross-linked <b>polymer</b> <b>seed</b> particles {{coated with a}} chlorinated outer layer. These chlorinated seeds are swollen with monomer. Subsequently, a liquid protrusion is formed {{on the surface of}} the seed particle by phase separation between the monomer and the swollen polymer network. Solidification of these liquid lobes by polymerization leads to the desired dumbbell-shaped colloids. The chlorine groups remain confined on the seed lobe of the particles, ensuring chemical anisotropy of the resulting particles. Exploiting the asymmetric distribution of the chemically reactive surface chlorine groups allows for site-specific surface modifications. Here we show that the geometry of the resulting chemically anisotropic dumbbells can be systematically tuned by a number of experimental parameters including the volume of styrene by which the seeds are swollen, the cross-link density of the chlorinated seeds and chemical composition/thickness of the chlorinated coating deposited on the seed particles. Being able to control the particle geometry, and therefore the Janus balance of these chemically anisotropic particles, provides a promising starting point for the synthesis of sophisticated building blocks for future (self-assembly) studies...|$|E
40|$|Simulation {{modeling}} is {{a useful}} tool for identifying the potential impacts of technology innovations. The use of simulation modeling in this capacity is illustrated for the case of a temperature-sensitive <b>polymer</b> <b>seed</b> coating that has recently been introduced. This information is important both to a company who is trying to market the new technology and to the potential users of the technology. For this analysis, the perspective of a typical farmer as a potential user of the technology is taken. Simulation modeling is used in three ways in the analysis. The effect of random weather events and cropping system are used in the EPIC simulation model to: 1) identify field conditions that determine when the technology can be used and 2) identify crop yields and production costs that quantify what happens when the technology is used. Finally, an economic model is constructed using a decision-tree approach to 3) incorporate the when and what into the user’s management plan to see how the technology will be used. Integrating these three components provides a framework for predicting the extent to which this new technology will be used, the effect of the technology on cropping practices, and the economic value of the technology to crop producers...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis examines if water dynamics {{before and during}} seedling emergence after autumn and summer direct seeding can be controlled in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seeds by hydrophobic polymer coating and hydrophilic (hydrogels) polymer packages. A method was created by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate {{the quality of the}} <b>polymer</b> <b>seed</b> coating. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and germination tests indicated that the critical moisture content of Scots pine seeds under freezing conditions was between 15 %- 20 %. After autumn seeding, the coating (Ethocel™ polymer) thickness that resulted in the highest seedling emergence was 2. 0 % weight gain. On three seeding sites this treatment resulted in seedling emergence of 33. 7 %, 30. 0 %, and 14. 1 %, whereas the uncoated seeds had values of only 12. 3 %, 0. 0 %, and 1. 0 %. Summer direct seeding was done with three different scarification techniques - organic removal, huminmix, and mounding. Seedling emergence was compared within each scarification type for different initial seed moistures (dry and invigorated 30 % moisture content, not re-dried), soil preparations (2 -cm indentation, 2 -cm wick and, 6 -cm wick), and polymer (hydrogel Ac-Di-Sol®) preparations (powder, gel, and gel/peat). The highest seedling emergence was associated with invigorated seeds prepared with gel/peat package and a 6 -cm wick for organic removal (32. 5 %), huminmix (30. 7 %) and mounding (18. 8 %). Invigorated seeds, regardless of treatment, had seedling emergence higher than dry seeds, and control values of dry seeds were significantly lower than for invigorated seeds. The delay of water uptake (probably in combination with sufficient snow cover insulation during winter months) made autumn direct seeding of coated seeds successful. The use of hydrogels, seed invigoration (not re-dried seeds), and soil preparation/wicks improved seedling emergence after summer direct seeding in dry conditions...|$|E

40|$|Permanent {{implantation}} of 125 I (iodine) or 103 Pd (palladium) {{sources is}} a popular treatment option {{in the management of}} early stage prostate cancer. New sources are being developed, some of which are being marketed for different clinical applications. A new technique of adjuvant stereotactic permanent seed breast implant, similar to that used in the treatment of prostate cancer, has been proposed by [N. Jansen et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 67, 1052 - 1058 (2007) ] with encouraging results. The presence of artifacts from the metallic seeds, however, can disturb follow-up imaging. The development of plastic seeds has reduced these artifacts. This paper presents a feasibility study of the advantages of palladium- 103 seeds, encapsulated with a biocompatible polymer, for future clinical applications, and on the effect of the gold marker on the dosimetric characteristics of such seeds. Experimental palladium seeds, OptiSeedexp, were manufactured by International Brachytherapy (IBt), Seneffe, Belgium, from a biocompatible polymer, including the marker. Apart from the absence of a gold marker, the studied seed has an identical design to the OptiSeed 103 [Phys. Med. Biol. 50, 1493 - 1504 (2005) ]; [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 63, 311 - 321 (2005) ]. Polymer encapsulation was preferred by IBt {{in order to reduce the}} quantity of radioactive material needed for a given dose rate and to reduce the anisotropy of the radiation field around the seed. In addition, this design is intended to decrease the interseed effects that can occur as a result of the marker and the encapsulation. Dosimetric measurements were performed using LiF thermoluminescent dosimeters (1 mm 3) in solid water phantoms (WT 1). Measured data were compared to Monte Carlo simulated data in solid water using the MCNP code, version 4 C. Updated cross sections [Med. Phys. 30, 701 - 711 (2003) ] were used. As the measured and calculated data were in agreement, Monte Carlo calculations were then performed in liquid water to obtain relevant dosimetric data as required by TG- 43 U 1 recommendations. Comparison of the results with previous studies of OptiSeed 103 [Phys. Med. Biol. 50, 1493 - 1504 (2005) ]; [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 63, 311 - 321 (2005) ], and of InterSource 103 [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 57, 805 - 811 (2002) ] showed very good agreement for the dose rate constant and for the radial dose function. With respect to the anisotropy function, the relative dose (anisotropy value relative to 90 degrees) from the <b>polymer</b> <b>seed</b> at a distance of 3 cm was close to unity (105 %) at 0 degrees, whereas the relative values for the OptiSeed 103 with a gold marker and the titanium-encapsulated InterSource 103 seed decreased to 70 % and 40 %, respectively. The interseed effect from one seed was negligible and in the order of calculation uncertainty, making calculation of the dose rate distribution of the studied seeds, according to TG 43 U 1 recommendations, more accurate and closer to reality. This feasibility study shows that due to the low energy of palladium- 103, the negligible interseed effect and the reduced artifacts in postimplant medical imaging, this experimental plastic seed would be a good source for breast brachytherapy. This feasibility study was carried out in collaboration with IBt and will be continued with a study of its visibility in different tissues...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Core tablets of mesalazine were prepared by wet granulation with starch paste and were compression coated with coating formulations containing different weight ratios of flax <b>seed</b> <b>polymer</b> and chitosan 2 : 3, 3 : 2 and 4 : 1. The tablets were subjected to invitro drug release studies in simulated colonic fluids(4 % w/v of rat cecal contents). The invivo evaluation was performed in 6 healthy human volunteers. Results: The compression coated flax <b>seed</b> <b>polymer</b> and chitosan tablets were found degraded by colonic bacteria of rat cecal contents in simulated colonic fluids {{at the end of}} 26 h indicating the susceptibilty of the formulation to the rat cecal contents. The invitro studies in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer containing 4 % w/v rat cecal 1 contents showed that the cumulative percentage of mesalazine after 26 h were 52. 16 ± 0. 06, 64. 10 ± 0. 08 and 98. 00 ± 0. 19 (mean ±s. d) respectively for tablets containing different weight ratios of flax <b>seed</b> <b>polymer</b> and chitosan 2 : 3, 3 : 2 and 4 : 1. The invivo studies conducted in six healthy male human volunteers for the various formulations revealed that the drug released was intiated only after 5 h (i. e) transit time of small intestine and the bioavailability (AUC 0 -t*) of the drug was found to be 196. 97 ± 3. 02, 245. 8 ± 5. 10 and 910. 51 ± 9. 61 (mean ± s. d) respectively for tablets containing different weight ratios of flax <b>seed</b> <b>polymer</b> and chitosan 2 : 3, 3 : 2 and 4 : 1. Formulation C 6 which contains 110 mg of chitosan when compared to formulation C 4 and C 5 contains 330 mg and 220 mg of chitosan is the suitable ratio for the better release of the drug which in turn having higher bioavailability.

We previously reported {{the creation of a}} tissue-engineered vascular graft by using vascular mixed cells. However, the cost and manpower for harvesting and culturing the cells was too burdensome. To {{overcome the}}se drawbacks, we have developed a new method for creating a tissue-engineered vascular graft by using bone marrow cells, which can be obtained easily and used immediately, without cell culture. MethodsBiodegradable <b>polymers</b> <b>seeded</b> with different types of cells (group V, cultured venous cells; group B, bone marrow cells without culture; and group C, non-cell-seeded graft [as control]) were implanted into the inferior venae cavae of dogs. The grafts were explanted at 4 weeks and assessed histologically and biochemically. ResultsIn the histologic examination, a regular layer of Masson-staining collagen fiber and a layer of factor VII-stained endothelial and ant-α-smooth muscle cell antigen-immunoreactive cells stained in groups V and B like native vascular tissue, whereas no such stained regular lining was detected in group C. A 4 -hydroxyproline assay in group C showed significantly lower levels than in groups V and B or native tissue (P <. 05). The DNA content of the tissue-engineered vascular graft tended to be higher in group C than in groups V and B or in native tissue.

We hypothesized that an omentum-based stem cell–supporting patch could provide adequate nutrients and microenvironment to prolong cell survival. We examined this hypothesis in rats with experimental myocardial infarction. MethodsThe omentum-based supporting patch was constructed by stitching polylactic acid-co-glycolic acid <b>polymer</b> <b>seeded</b> with mesenchymal stem cells from male Sprague–Dawley rats. Eight weeks after the experimental myocardial infarction, which was created by ligating the left coronary artery of female Sprague–Dawley rats, mesenchymal stem cells were transplanted with (n =  16) or without (n =  14) the supporting patch. After 4 weeks, transplanted mesenchymal stem cell survival, ventricular remodeling, and cardiac performance were examined. ResultsSignificantly more cells survived after 4 weeks in rats transplanted with mesenchymal stem cells on the supporting patch assessed by means of polymerase chain reaction detection of the Sry gene than seen in those without the supporting patch (2. 61  ± 0. 40 vs 1. 19  ± 0. 12, P < . 05). Rats with myocardial infarction that received mesenchymal stem cells with the patch also had significantly improved ventricular remodeling and cardiac function than those without the patch. Wrapping infarcted myocardium with omentum alone did not change the myocardial function. ConclusionsThe omentum-based cell-supporting patch provided a favorable microenvironment for transplanted mesenchymal stem cell survival, which resulted in favorable ventricular remodeling and restoration of cardiac function in rats with experimental myocardial infarction. Further validation of the technique in human subjects could make mesenchymal stem cell transplantation a viable therapeutic option for patients with cardiac disease...|$|R

Recently, employing concepts of tissue engineering in animals, cartilage-like constructs were transplanted in vivo. However, both the feasibility of fabricating tracheal replacements {{and the use of}} human tracheal chondrocytes (HTC) for tissue engineering are still under investigation. In this study, we optimized isolation and cultivation techniques for human tracheal cartilage, assessing the feasibility of seeding these cells onto a novel, three-dimensional (3 -D) polyester-urethane polymer (DegraPol®). Methods: Human tracheal cartilage was harvested from the trachea of lung donors, digested in 0. 3 % collagenase II, and the condrocytes serially passaged every 7 - 9 days. Cells were also cultivated over agar plate during the total 6 - 8 weeks expansion phase. Thereafter, chondrocytes were seeded onto DegraPol® (pore sizes 150 - 200 μm) with a seeding density of 2. 4 × 107 /ml, and chondrocyte-polymer constructs maintained during in vitro static culture. Results: HTC displayed stable proliferation kinetics in monolayer culture with positive expression of collagen type II. Following <b>polymer</b> <b>seeding,</b> both cellular proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) production, as measured by MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and glycosaminoglycan assays, continued over extended culture.

40|$|Tissue-engineered middle phalanx {{constructs}} of human digits were investigated {{to determine whether}} periosteum wrapped partly about model midshafts mediated cartilage growth plate formation. Models were fabricated by suturing ends of polymer midshafts in a human middle phalanx shape with <b>polymer</b> sheets <b>seeded</b> with heterogeneous chondrocyte populations from bovine articular cartilage. Half of each midshaft length was wrapped with bovine periosteum. Constructs were cultured, implanted in nude mice for up to 20 weeks, harvested and treated histologically to assess morphology and cartilage proteoglycans. After 20 weeks of implantation, chondrocyte-seeded sheets adjacent to periosteum-wrapped midshaft halves established cartilage growth plates resembling normal tissue in vivo. Sheets adjacent to midshafts without periosteum had disorganized cells and no plate formation. Proteoglycans were present at both midshaft ends. Periosteum appears to guide chondrocytes toward growth plate cartilage organization and tissue engineering provides means for carefully examining construct development of this tissue...|$|R
40|$|Passive {{sampling}} {{is a novel}} {{method of}} analyte concentration from the environment that strives to bring greater ease to field sampling regimes than traditional liquid-solid phase extractions (SPE). It is easier to deploy than a Niskin bottle or CTD rosette, and easier to recover than hoisting up dozens of liters of water. Passive sampling also offers the opportunity for wider exploratory studies, as compounds can be selectively extracted back in lab, {{rather than having to}} select a particular phase SPE and follow phase-specific elution methods. In this study, Ethylene Vinyl Acetate copolymer (EVA) was used as a marine sorption and collection media. Its efficacy was tested in both ambient munitions sampling for TNT and RDX, and for sulfate in porewaters. For the munitions subset of samples, the interaction between salinity, temperature, and percent acetate composition of the EVA samplers was explored. It was found that salinity had a large increase on Log KEVA from 0 - 5 PSU, then became nonlinear from 5 - 34 PSU. The initial increase was present for all EVA types, and the 5 - 34 PSU subset’s Log KEVA was affected in similar manner between EVA types. Increasing temperature was found to decrease munitions sorption over 5 - 25 ˚C, and it was found that EVA 80 was the most efficient sorption media out of the EVA subtypes. This is likely due to dipole interactions from the increase in the polar acetate group. An EVA <b>polymer</b> <b>seeded</b> with barium containing organic compounds was tested for efficacy in sulfate precipitation to the film for use in isotopic sulfur measurements. Out of the many barium containing organic compounds selected for testing, barium oxalate was chosen for its efficiency at precipitating and trapping sulfate from the marine environment, while being able to be easily purified by an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis procedure. It was also proven that the EVA sampler does not add an isotopic bias through fractionation during precipitation to the film from the environment. Overall, it was proven that the Ethylene Vinyl Acetate copolymer is an effective passive sorption media for marine systems, for both munitions compounds and inorganic sulfate...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Vascular-derived cells {{represent}} an established cell source for tissue engineering of cardiovascular constructs. Previously, cell isolation {{was performed by}} harvesting of vascular structures prior to scaffold seeding. Marrow stromal cells (MSC) demonstrate the ability to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal cell lineages and would offer an alternative cell source for tissue engineering involving a less invasive harvesting technique. We studied the feasibility of using MSC as an alternative cell source for cardiovascular tissue engineering. Methods: Human MSC were isolated from bone marrow and expanded in culture. Subsequently MSC were <b>seeded</b> on bioabsorbable <b>polymers</b> and grown in vitro. Cultivated cells and <b>seeded</b> <b>polymers</b> were studied for cell characterization and tissue formation including extracellular matrix production. Applied methods comprised flow cytometry, histology, immunohistochemistry, transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and biochemical assays. Results: Isolated MSC demonstrated fibroblast-like morphology. Phenotype analysis revealed positive signals for alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Histology and SEM of <b>seeded</b> <b>polymers</b> showed layered tissue formation. TEM demonstrated formation of extracellular matrix with deposition of collagen fibrils. Matrix protein analysis showed production of collagen I and III. In comparison to vascular-derived cell constructs quantitative analysis demonstrated comparable amounts of extracellular matrix proteins in the tissue engineered constructs. Conclusions: Isolated MSC demonstrated myofibroblast-like characteristics. Tissue formation on bioabsorbable scaffolds was feasible with extracellular matrix production comparable to vascular-cell derived tissue engineered constructs. It appears that MSC represent a promising cell source for cardiovascular tissue engineerin...|$|R
40|$|To better direct repair {{following}} {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI), we designed an implant modeled after the intact spinal cord consisting of a multicomponent <b>polymer</b> scaffold <b>seeded</b> with neural stem cells. Implantation of the scaffold–neural stem cells unit into an adult rat hemisection model of SCI promoted long-term improvement in function (persistent for 1 year in some animals) relative to a lesion-control group. At 70 days postinjury, animals implanted with scaffold-plus-cells exhibited coordinated, weight-bearing hindlimb stepping. Histology and immunocytochemical analysis suggested that this recovery might be attributable partly {{to a reduction in}} tissue loss from secondary injury processes as well as in diminished glial scarring. Tract tracing demonstrated corticospinal tract fibers passing through the injury epicenter to the caudal cord, a phenomenon not present in untreated groups. Together with evidence of enhanced local GAP- 43 expression not seen in controls, these findings suggest a possible regeneration component. These results may suggest a new approach to SCI and, more broadly, may serve as a prototype for multidisciplinary strategies against complex neurological problems...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} requires diagnostic {{tools for}} in-vitro monitoring of cell proliferation in three-dimensional scaffolds. Current methods are inaccurate, prohibitively expensive, or compromise sample integrity. This work presents a nondestructive {{system for the}} on-line measurement of cell concentration in micro-porous polymer scaffolds. The system is based on measuring the reflection coefficient of the sample with an open-ended coaxial probe over a frequency range of 10 - 200 MHz. An aperture admittance model is used to extract the complex permittivity from the reflection measurement. Then, effective medium approximation is used to relate the complex permittivity to the cell properties and concentration of the sample. The system detected the relative cell concentration differences between micro-porous <b>polymer</b> scaffolds <b>seeded</b> with progressively greater number of pre-osteoblast cells. Proliferation of pre-ostoblasts over 14 days was measured within 56 scaffolds by the system and a concurrent DNA assay. The recorded cell proliferation data corresponded well {{to each other and}} those found in literature. Thus, the system can be applied for on-line monitoring of cell proliferation within micro-porous polymer scaffolds...|$|R

For these reasons in the present work, we evaluated the feasibility of growth of zeolite membrane by second growth on this substrate. The effect of the support functionalization with three cationic <b>polymers</b> followed by <b>seeding</b> process on zeolite membrane formation was evaluated. The bioactivity of the zeolite membrane was evaluated by biomimetic method using a simulated body fluid. We proposed {{to take advantage of}} the properties of calcium silicate and W zeolite in order to generate a zeolite membrane with bioactive properties that can be useful for bone regeneration.|$|R

Healthy rabbits were subjected to repeated ocular instillations with either conventional gentamicin or ofloxacin or these agents viscosified with the tamarind seed polysaccharide. Administration of viscosified preparations produced antibiotic concentrations both in the aqueous humour and cornea that {{were significantly higher than}} those achieved with the drugs alone. The increased drug absorption and the prolonged drug elimination phase obtained with the viscosified formulations indicate the usefulness of the tamarind seed polysaccharide as an ophthalmic delivery system for topical administration of antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} software {{to simulate the}} development of non-equilibrium latex particle morphologies produced by seeded emulsion polymerization. The diffusion of second stage <b>polymer</b> radicals within <b>seed</b> particles controls the development of morphology in {{a large number of}} systems. Knowledge of the conditions present within the latex particles during the reaction is required in order to model this diffusion process, and this makes it necessary to first simulate the kinetics of the polymerization. The program considers both the water phase and particle phase reactions, and can simulate polymerizations carried out under either batch or semi-batch conditions. The model predictions agree well with experimental results both in terms of the polymerization kinetics and the development of particle morphology...|$|R
40|$|Small-angle neutron {{scattering}} experiments {{were carried out}} to examine the extent of monomer/ polymer spatial inhomogeneities in latex particles formed in an emulsion homopolymerization, using contrast variation and isotopic labeling systems {{to look at the}} morphology of swollen and two-stage latices. Samples covered a range of molecular weights including systems where the radius of gyration of the polymer chains was both comparable to and smaller than the particle size. The experiments were designed to test separately inhomogeneities arising from two different effects: (1) the "repulsive wall" (thermodynamic) effect arising from the decrease in entropy of a polymer chain confined near the surface of a particle (the experiments here examined polymer distribution in polystyrene particles swollen with toluene); (2) "surface anchoring" (largely kinetic) arising mainly because, with a water-soluble initiator, free radicals enter latex particles at the surface (here experiments examined the distribution of newly formed <b>polymer</b> in <b>seeded</b> growth; related to this are inhomogeneities arising from finite rates of diffusion of monomer and of polymer). Results support the conclusion that repulsive wall effects do not give rise to significant nonuniformities but that inhomogeneities may arise in the final product where the polymer chain dimensions are substantially less than the particle radius. The latter conclusion is consistent with predictions of the surface anchoring model...|$|R
40|$|HNSCC {{accounts}} for 7 {{percent of all}} new cancer occurrences. Despite currently available treatments, there {{continues to be a}} high mortality and recurrence rate in HNSCC. Well over 50 percent of all cancer patients receive chemotherapy as a standard treatment. However, only 5 percent of these cases have been shown to help with treatment of the disease. Formerly, two options were available for drug testing: in vivo animal models, and in vitro two-dimensional models. While in vivo models remain the most representative, their use is burdened by high costs, time constraints, and ethical concerns. 2 D models are simple to use and cost effective, although they have been shown to produce inaccurate data regarding chemotherapeutic drug resistance due to their 2 D arrangement and altered gene expression. Researchers for the past decade have been working to create 3 D models that more accurately represent in vivo systems in order to evaluate chemotherapeutic efficacy and improve clinical outcomes. In line with this agenda, novel 3 D head and neck cancer models were created out of electrospun synthetic <b>polymers</b> <b>seeded</b> with either HN 6 or HN 12 cancer cells. The models were then treated with chemotherapeutic drugs (either paclitaxel or cisplatin), and, after 72 hours, subjected to a live-dead assay {{in order to determine the}} cytotoxic effects of the drugs. 2 D cultures of HN 6 and HN 12 were also and subject to a WST- 1 assay after 72 hours. The results of the treated-scaffold assays were then compared to the results of the 2 D culture assays, and, as predicted, the cancer cells in a 3 D culture system proved to be more resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The underlying assumption for this study being that a 3 D culture system based on precisely defined structural parameters would provide a practical environment to screen therapeutics for anti-cancer efficacy. To prove this, 3 D scaffolds of three different fiber sizes were developed by electrospinning different concentrations of Poly(L-lactic acid) (“PLLA”) (55 mg/ml, 115 mg/ml, and 180 mg/ml) onto a mandrel that was perforated to allow for increased porosity. The resultant small, medium, and large scaffolds were then subjected to concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) pretreatment in order to make them less hydrophobic. Different fiber diameters represented different ECM environments for both HN 6 and HN 12. It was proven that both cell types thrived best in small fibers (55 mg/ml- 115 mg/ml) than in large fibers. It was also reaffirmed through live-dead anlaysis of cells seeded on 3 D scaffolds and treated with IC 90 values of cisplatin that the head and neck cancer cells were more resistant which is more representative to the 3 D environment of cancer cells in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{low-energy}} photon emitters for brachytherapy applications, as in {{the treatment}} of prostate or ocular tumours, has increased significantly over the last few years. Several new seed models utilizing 103 Pd and 125 I have recently been introduced. Following the TG 43 U 1 recommendations of the AAPM (American Association of Physicists in Medicine) (Rivard et al 2004 Med. Phys. 31 633), dose distributions around these low-energy photon emitters are characterized by the dose rate constant, the radial dose function and the anisotropy function in water. These functions and constants can be measured for each new seed in a solid phantom (i. e. solid water such as WT 1) using high spatial resolution detectors such as very small thermoluminescent detectors. These experimental results in solid water must then be converted into liquid water by using Monte Carlo simulations. This paper presents the dosimetric parameters of a new palladium seed, OptiSeed (produced by International Brachytherapy (IBt), Seneffe, Belgium), made with a biocompatible polymeric shell and with a design that differs from the hollow titanium encapsulated seed, InterSource 103, produced by the same company. A polymer encapsulation was chosen by the company IBt {{in order to reduce the}} quantity of radioactive material needed for a given dose rate, and to improve the symmetry of the radiation field around the seed. The necessary experimental data were obtained by measurements with LiF thermoluminescent dosimeters (1 mm 3) in a solid water phantom (WT 1) and then converted to values in liquid water using Monte Carlo calculations (MCNP- 4 C). Comparison of the results with a previous study by Reniers et al (2002 Appl. Radiat. Isot. 57 805) shows very good agreement for the dose rate constant and for the radial dose function. In addition, the results also indicate an improvement in isotropy compared to a conventional titanium encapsulated seed. The relative dose (anisotropy value relative to 90 degrees) from the seed at a distance of 3 cm is close to 70 % at 0 degrees whereas that for the titanium encapsulated InterSource 103 seed is close to 40 %. This paper also presents some new Monte Carlo calculations relating to shadowing produced by the seeds in an array implanted for a prostate cancer treatment. Recently, Mobit and Badragan (2004 Phys. Med. Biol. 49 3171) reported shadowing resulting in a 10 % decrease in dose from titanium encapsulated 125 I seed. We used Monte Carlo simulations (MCNP- 4 C) to evaluate shadowing for the InterSource 103 titanium encapsulated seed and the OptiSeed <b>polymer</b> encapsulated <b>seed.</b> For a specific geometry specified, dose decreases of 13 % and 7 % were found for the InterSource 103 titanium encapsulated and the OptiSeed <b>polymer</b> encapsulated <b>seed,</b> respectively...|$|R
