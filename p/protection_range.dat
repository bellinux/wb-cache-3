50|$|Vehicle Jammer System STAR V: Protective modular jamming system STAR V 740 is {{intended}} for a protection against RCIED. The system either prevents the activation of RCIED or it can significantly reduce the distance for a bomb activation. The system is used to protect the special EOD teams or for a convoy protection.The jamming is performed by random frequency sweeping in a few frequencies sub-bands at the same time. Each sub-band has a possibility to set up to two communication windows for mutual radio communication. The jamming system is equipped with 8 wideband transmitters, 3 low pass filters, 1 combiner, 6 Omni-directional antennas and 8 wide-band digital exciters. The higher level of jamming efficiency is accomplished by using more parallel subsystems and digital technology.The jamming system {{is intended}} as a mobile system which is installed in the vehicle. It is equipped with the Omni-directional antennas {{that are part of}} the system. The output power of the jammer is up to 740 W. The jamming system is easily controlled and the failures are easily diagnosed. It is controlled on the front panel. The operator can switch on/off particular transmitting systems and subsystems, set up to three jamming sub-bands in each. Dwell time in each sub-band can also be modified. Jammer is equipped with IP, RS 485 and USB interface. System is also equipped with special SW which can be installed on a notebook or a PC. Special remote control box is also included.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a novel approach}} to using multi-layered corrugated paperboard to provide improved protection against severe mechanical shocks and drops. Conventionally, cushion design requires {{the determination of the}} maximum expected shock levels or drop heights as well as their probability of occurrence. These are usually determined from statistical analysis of original field measurements or published drop height distribution data. With this approach, it is acknowledged that the cushioning element will provide adequate protection for statistically likely events but not for extreme, statistically unusual, events. A multi-layer cushioning system made entirely of corrugated paperboard, designed to extend the cushioning <b>protection</b> <b>range</b> to include these extreme events, has been investigated. The main feature of the cushion is the inclusion of a corrugated paperboard crumple element designed to provide the necessary energy absorption for high compression stress levels. The effect of the complex deceleration produced by the crumple element on the product is analysed by means of the shock response spectrum. Experiments have shown that the paperboard crumple insert dramatically extends the <b>protection</b> <b>range</b> of the cushioning system by generally lowering the shock response spectrum, thus extending the cushion curve static load range. This results in {{a significant increase in the}} allowable drop height for a limited number of extreme events.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) {{has been}} {{extensively}} used as an excellent corrosion protective coating for steel components in aerospace, automotive, electrical and fasteners industries. However, Cd is banned due to its toxic nature and strict environmental regulations. In this study, the electrodeposition mechanism and kinetics, coating morphology and corrosion resistance of alternative, electrodeposited Zinc-Cobalt (Zn-Co) and Zinc-Cobalt-Iron (Zn- Co-Fe) alloys have been investigated. Coatings with relatively high amounts of Co {{are very difficult to}} achieve due to anomalism associated with their deposition and are therefore not much reported so far. In this research Zn-Co and Zn-Co-Fe alloys with varying amount of Co (2 to 40 wt-%) and Fe (up to 1 wt-%) are electrodeposited and the effects of variation of process parameter settings (i. e. cathodic polarization, current density, temperature and electrolyte composition) on the electrodeposition mechanism and kinetics are investigated. The microstructure of the alloy coatings changed significantly with the variation in Co content in the deposits. The barrier and sacrificial corrosion protection provided by the coatings were investigated with a variety of electrochemical techniques and industrial accelerated tests. It was found that the sacrificial properties and the <b>protection</b> <b>range</b> decreases with increasing Co content in the alloy. For the highest Co content in the alloy, the coating may become more noble to steel and loses its sacrificial protection. The barrier resistance of the coatings increases with the increase of Co content in the alloy coating. Both Zn-Co and Zn-Co-Fe alloys with high Co content (> 32 wt-% Co) showed excellent barrier properties. An intermediate region of compositions can be distinguished in which the coatings would provide a good combination of sacrificial and barrier resistance properties and also a reasonable <b>protection</b> <b>range.</b> © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

40|$|PowerTech is {{the anchor}} {{conference of the}} IEEE Power & Energy Society in EuropeConventional {{overcurrent}} protection settings are fixed to detect faults. Power system operation mode varies while the settings of protection devices remain constant. As a result, overcurrent protection has a small <b>protection</b> <b>range</b> and a long operating time because it is incapable of adjusting its setting online. Wide Area Measurements System (WAMS) provides synchronized and real time data which can be utilized in new protection devices. This paper proposes a novel online setting scheme which utilizes online system data to calculate real-time system operation mode. Based on the real-time operation mode, real-time fault current is calculated before fault occurring. Settings of the protection devices are by this means adjusted in real time to expand the protection area and shorten the operating time. The calculation is expanded from single source model to multi-source with Π model. In addition, interval time of settings adjustment Tchange is proposed and calculated by using hyperbolic function model. Based on this method, power system real-time operation condition can be better monitored and the real-time short circuit current can be obtained to improve protection performance. © 2013 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

Methods Costs were measured locally or derived from existing studies {{and focused on}} the provider perspective, but included the direct costs of net purchases by users, and are reported in 2005 USD. Effectiveness was estimated by combining programme outputs with standard impact indicators. Findings Conventional ITNs: The cost per treated net-year of <b>protection</b> <b>ranged</b> from USD 1. 21 in Eritrea to USD 6. 05 in Senegal. The cost per child death averted ranged from USD 438 to USD 2, 199 when targeting to children was successful.

The cost per child death averted ranged from USD 502 to USD 692. IRS: The costs per person-year of protection for all ages were USD 3. 27 in KwaZulu Natal and USD 3. 90 in Mozambique. If only children under five years of age were included in the denominator the cost per person-year of protection was higher: USD 23. 96 and USD 21. 63.
