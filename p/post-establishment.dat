40|$|Research on <b>post-establishment</b> {{evolution}} in nonnative plant populations has focused {{almost exclusively on}} testing the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis, which posits {{that the lack of}} specialized herbivores in the invaded range drives {{evolution in}} nonnative plant populations. Fifteen years of conflicting EICA test results suggest that selection pressures other than specialized herbivory are important in driving <b>post-establishment</b> evolution in invasive species. Alternative hypotheses, such as the Evolution of Reduced Competitive Ability (ERCA) hypothesis, have been proposed but have received little attention or testing. We argue that the lack of consensus across studies that test EICA may be {{due in part to the}} lack of consistent definitions and varying experimental design parameters, and that future research in this field would benefit from new methodological considerations. We examined previous work evaluating <b>post-establishment</b> evolution and evaluated the range of study systems and design parameters used in testing the EICA hypothesis. Our goal was to identify where different uses of ecological terms and different study parameters have hindered consensus and to suggest a path forward to move beyond EICA in <b>post-establishment</b> evolution studies. We incorporated these methods into a design framework that will increase data harmony across future studies and will facilitate examinations of any potential selection pressure driving evolution in the invaded range...|$|E

40|$|Aims Our study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the dispersal dynamics and population genetic structure of the introduced golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei throughout its invaded range in South America and to determine how different dispersal methods, that is, human-mediated dispersal and downstream natural dispersal, contribute to genetic variation among populations. Location Paraná-Uruguay-Río de la Plata watershed in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Methods We performed genetic analyses based on a comprehensive sampling strategy encompassing 22 populations (N= 712) throughout the invaded range in South America, using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and eight polymorphic nuclear microsatellites. We employed both population genetics and phylogenetic analyses to clarify the dispersal dynamics and population genetic structure. Results We detected relatively high genetic differentiation between populations (F ST=- 0. 041 to 0. 111 for COI, - 0. 060 to 0. 108 for microsatellites) at both fine and large geographical scales. Bayesian clustering and three-dimensional factorial correspondence analyses consistently revealed two genetically distinct clusters, highlighting genetic discontinuities in the invaded range. Results of all genetic analyses suggest ship-mediated 2 ̆ 7 jump 2 ̆ 7 dispersal as the dominant mode of spread of golden mussels in South America, while downstream natural dispersal has had limited effects on contemporary genetic patterns. Main conclusions Our study provides new evidence that <b>post-establishment</b> dispersal dynamics and genetic patterns vary across geographical scales. While ship-mediated 2 ̆ 7 jump 2 ̆ 7 dispersal dominates <b>post-establishment</b> spread of golden mussels in South America, once colonies become established in upstream locations, larvae produced may be advected downstream to infill patchy distributions. Moreover, genetic structuring at fine geographical scales, especially within the same drainages, suggests a further detailed understanding of dynamics of larval dispersal and settlement in different water systems. Knowledge of the mechanisms by which <b>post-establishment</b> spread occurs can, in some cases, be used to limit dispersal of golden mussels and other introduced species. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E

We {{examined the relationship between}} habitat quality and reintroduction success in an experimental reintroduction of populations of water voles (Arvicola terrestris) in the UK. We released cohorts of 44 water voles into 12 replicate 800 m stretches of river, each supporting a different habitat abundance. Water voles initially established at nine sites, failing to establish at three sites due to predation from American mink (two sites) and atypically sever flooding post-release (one site). For sites where voles established, at those with higher vegetation abundance more of the release cohort survived (initial survival rates range 0. 43 - 0. 61), and <b>post-establishment</b> survival rates (range 0. 45 - 0. 80) and population densities (range 2. 1 - 5. 4 voles per 100 m of habitat) were higher. A further two populations were lost to American mink predation <b>post-establishment.</b> Reintroductions are commonly designated as either a 'success' or a 'failure'. The principal cause of a failed release in our study was insufficient mink control. However, whilst seven of our 12 reintroductions were 'successful', our results indicated substantial variation in the population densities and survival rates that the replicate habitats could support. This highlights the need to ensure that any habitat selected for a reintroduction is the best obtainable.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Understanding {{why some}} {{non-native}} plants become successful invaders while most fail to invade {{can help in}} assessing risks of invasion. Plants that have evolved defensive traits to resist and/or tolerate herbivory may be more successful invaders since herbivory can potentially prevent species from establishing or regulate existing populations. Plant-soil feedbacks may also enhance dominance of invasive species through allelopathy, changes in soil chemical properties, and interactions with soil biota that promote their own growth and suppress recruitment and growth of co-occurring species. I investigated herbivory as barrier to <b>post-establishment</b> invasion success by conducting three sets of experiments that compared invasive and non-invasive woody species in Hawaii. I measured: seedling acceptability to two generalist herbivores in laboratory no-choice feeding trials, foliar herbivory on seedlings in a field common garden, and seedling tolerance to simulated foliar herbivory in a greenhouse. I also investigated the role plant-soil feedbacks play in the dominance of an invasive tree in Hawaii, Ardisia elliptica, by conducting greenhouse soil feedback experiments to determine if A. elliptica positively impacts its own growth and suppresses growth of two co-occurring species. I found that: 1. There was no general difference in resistance to herbivores between invasive and non-invasive species in feeding trials or the common garden experiment. 2. There was no general difference in tolerance to simulated herbivory between invasive and non-invasive species. 3. There {{was no evidence of}} positive soil feedbacks promoting A. elliptica growth. 4. Soil taken from beneath A. elliptica did not suppress growth of two co-occurring species.

30|$|<b>Post-establishment,</b> {{the broad}} range of {{invasive}} species and the ecosystems they become established in, and the heterogeneous ways that humans value those ecosystems, means that few generalizations can be given for management and policy. That is, appropriate management and policy for harmful invasive species is highly context dependent. Options include poisoning (e.g. herbicides, pesticides, piscicides), manual removal (e.g. pulling plants), capturing and killing (e.g. trapping, shooting), and release of additional species that may provide biological control of the invader. As the applications of these methods are context dependent, and because different countries within Europe have different standards for the application of these methods, they are not explored further here. The general principle of prevention still applies, however, and efforts to slow or eliminate population spread will often be the most cost-effective ways to reduce total impacts.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to examine how substantive and procedural rights granted to foreign investors by Swiss bits are gradually being balanced with social and environmental provisions.

40|$|Questions: What {{types of}} pre-sowing {{disturbance}} are most suitable to establish specialist forbs of calcareous grassland at previously agriculturally improved restored sites? What impact does management regime have on <b>post-establishment</b> abundance-dynamics? Location: Pegsdon Hills, Bedfordshire, UK. Methods: We {{set up a}} 4 -yr experiment using a split-plot design to combine pre-sowing disturbance treatments at sub-plot level (undisturbed control, glyphosate spraying, harrowing, and creation of ridge-and-furrow features) with three <b>post-establishment</b> management regimes applied at main plot level in years 2 – 4, involving either summer cutting or summer cattle grazing, and {{presence or absence of}} spring sheep grazing, along with autumn cattle grazing in all regimes. After disturbance application, we sowed a seed mixture containing ten specialist species of calcareous grassland. Using quadrat-based methods, we monitored first-year establishment and subsequent dynamics, including reproductive status of species at quadrat level. Initial establishment and subsequent dynamics were analysed separately using LMM. Results: Initial establishment of sown species was promoted both by harrowing and by ridge-and-furrow creation. While some species were about equally promoted by both, several other species benefited more strongly or exclusively from ridge-and-furrow creation. Effects of disturbance largely persisted in subsequent years, but for some species, different dynamics were observed for harrowed and ridge-and-furrow treatments. Thymus pulegioides and Hippocrepis comosa gradually achieved higher abundances in the ridge-and-furrow treatment, in which notable levels of bare ground persisted for much longer than in the harrowed treatment. In contrast, Filipendula vulgaris and Pimpinella saxifraga achieved higher abundance in the harrowed treatment. Sown species tended to reach reproductive stage faster in the ridge-and-furrow treatment than in the harrowed treatment. By the end of the study, management regimes had resulted in few effects on species dynamics. Conclusions: Establishment of specialist species of calcareous grassland crucially depended on bare ground creation prior to sowing. Ridge-and-furrow creation resulted in more persistent reduction of competition than the standard practice of harrowing, provided more suitable conditions for low-statured specialist species, and generally enabled faster transition of introduced specialist species to reproductive stage. Our results thus illustrate potential benefits of using more severe disturbance when introducing specialist species of calcareous grassland at restored sites...|$|E
40|$|Mega-Regionals are {{transforming}} {{and shaping}} {{the future of}} international investment law, concerning both the settlement of investment disputes and the substantive disciplines governing investor-state relations. Focusing on the latter, the present article shows how Mega-Regionals depart from the so far dominant European model of investment protection by going beyond crudely worded <b>post-establishment</b> protections for foreign investment. Instead, Mega-Regionals pursue the twin policy goals of investment liberalization through greater market access commitments and strengthening state control by ensuring host governments sufficient policy space to regulate in the public interest. In light of these policy goals, and considering the deeper reasons for structural changes to the investment rules in Mega-Regionals, the article argues that the models and conceptual foundations of Mega-Regionals build on prototypes first developed {{in the context of}} U.

40|$|Biotic resistance, {{the process}} by which new colonists are {{excluded}} from a community by predation from and/or competition with resident species, can prevent or limit species invasions. We examined whether biotic resistance by native predators on Caribbean coral reefs has influenced the invasion success of red lionfishes (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles), piscivores from the Indo-Pacific. Specifically, we surveyed the abundance (density and biomass) of lionfish and native predatory fishes that could interact with lionfish (either through predation or competition) on 71 reefs in three biogeographic regions of the Caribbean. We recorded protection status of the reefs, and abiotic variables including depth, habitat type, and wind/wave exposure at each site. We found no relationship between the density or biomass of lionfish and that of native predators. However, lionfish densities were significantly lower on windward sites, potentially because of habitat preferences, and in marine protected areas, most likely because of ongoing removal efforts by reserve managers. Our results suggest that interactions with native predators do not influence the colonization or <b>post-establishment</b> population density of invasive lionfish on Caribbean reefs...|$|E
40|$|Invasive species {{represent}} a select subset of organisms that have successfully transitioned through {{each stage of}} the introduction process (transportation, establishment, and spread). Although {{there is a growing}} realization that behavior plays a critical role in invasion success, few studies have focused on the initial stages of introduction. We examined whether differences in the grouping tendencies and exploratory behavior of two sympatric lizard species could contribute to their divergent invasion success. While the nondirected activity of the two species did not differ, the invasive delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata) was found to be more exploratory than the congeneric noninvasive garden skink (L. guichenoti), which enabled it to more effectively locate novel environments and basking site resources. The delicate skink also exhibited a greater tendency to hide, which may act to enhance its probability of ensnarement in freight and cargo and decrease its likelihood of detection during transit. The grouping tendencies of the two species did not differ. Together, our results suggest that while the two species have an equivalent “opportunity” for unintentional human-assisted transportation, several pre-existing behavioral traits may enhance the success of the delicate skink in negotiating the initial stages of the introduction process, and subsequent <b>post-establishment</b> spread...|$|E
40|$|Bilateral {{investment}} treaties (BITs) {{are typically}} presented as vital risk-mitigating instruments providing foreign investors with “credible commitments” that their assets {{will not be}} expropriated, discriminated against, or otherwise maltreated <b>post-establishment.</b> Accordingly, developing countries wanting to attract foreign investment should become more attractive destinations for multinationals when signing the treaties.

Apart from reviewing such evidence, this chapter will discuss the feedback from a series of interviews. Firstly, BIT-negotiators from capital exporting states report that investors very rarely inquire about BITs, and when they do it is typically when disputes have arisen and not when they plan their investments. Secondly – and remarkably – the treaties have very little impact on political risk insurance (PRI) providers’ coverage and pricing policies. This is the case for both private companies as well as (almost) all public PRI programs, including the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

We focus on a quantitative evaluation, attempted {{here for the first}} time, of the individual roles and the mutual interactions of drivers and controls of the Mississippi-Missouri invasion. To this end, we use a multilayer network model accounting explicitly for zebra mussel demographic dynamics, hydrologic transport, and dispersal due to anthropic activities. By testing our results against observations, we show that hydrologic transport alone is not sufficient to explain the spread of the species at the basin scale. We also quantify the role played by commercial navigation in promoting the initial, selective colonization of the river system, and show how recreational boating may have determined the capillary penetration of the species into the water system. The role of <b>post-establishment</b> dispersal mechanisms and the effectiveness of possible prevention measures are also discussed in the context of model sensitivity and robustness to reparametrization.

40|$|Where {{one or a}} few {{tree species}} reach local high abundance, {{different}} ecological factors may variously facilitate or hinder their regeneration. Plant pathogens are thought {{to be one of those}} possible agents which drive intraspecific density-dependent mortality of tree seedlings in tropical forests. Experimental evidence for this is scarce, however. In an African rain forest at Korup, we manipulated the density of recently established seedlings (~ 5 - 8 wk old; low vs. high-density) of two dominant species of contrasting recruitment potential, and altered their exposure to pathogens using a broad-spectrum fungicide. Seedling mortality of the abundantly recruiting subcanopy tree Oubanguia alata was strongly density-dependent after 7 mo, yet fungicide-treated seedlings had slightly higher mortality than controls. By contrast, seedling mortality of the poorly recruiting large canopy-emergent tree Microberlinia bisulcata was unaffected by density or fungicide. Ectomycorrhizal colonization of M. bisulcata was not affected by density or fungicide either. For O. alata, adverse effects of fungicide on its vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizas may have offset any possible benefit of pathogen removal. We tentatively conclude that fungal pathogens are not a likely major cause of density dependence in O. alata, or of early <b>post-establishment</b> mortality in M. bisulcata.

40|$|Quantifying the {{relative}} importance of the multiple processes that limit recruitment may hold the key to understanding tropical tree diversity. Here we couple theoretical models with a large-scale, multi-species seed-sowing experiment to assess the degree to which seed and establishment limitation shape patterns of tropical tree seedling recruitment in a central African forest. Of five randomly selected species (Pancovia laurentii, Staudtia kamerunensis, Manilkara mabokeensis, Myrianthus arboreas, and Entandophragma utile), seedling establishment and survival were low (means of 16 % and 6 % at 3 and 24 months, respectively), and seedling density increased with seed augmentation. Seedling recruitment was best explained by species identity and the interaction of site-by-species, suggesting recruitment probabilities vary among species and sites, and supporting the role of niche-based mechanisms. Although seed augmentation enhanced initial seedling density, environmental filtering and <b>post-establishment</b> mortality strongly limited seedling recruitment. The relative importance of seed and establishment limitation changed with seed and seedling density and through time. The arrival of seeds most strongly affected local recruitment when seeds were nearly absent from a site (, 1 seed m 2), but was also important when seeds arrived in extremely high densities, overwhelming niche-based mortality factors. The strength of seed limitation and density-independent mortality decreased significantly over time, while density-dependent mortality showed the opposite trend.

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the genetic signature of the establishment of religious communities in a region where some of the most influential religions originated, using the Y chromosome as an informative male-lineage marker. A total of 3139 samples were analyzed, including 647 Lebanese and Iranian samples newly genotyped for 28 binary markers and 19 short tandem repeats on the non-recombinant segment of the Y chromosome. Genetic organization was identified by geography and religion across Lebanon in the context of surrounding populations important in the expansions of the major sects of Lebanon, including Italy, Turkey, the Balkans, Syria, and Iran by employing principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, and AMOVA. Timing of population differentiations was estimated using BATWING, in comparison with dates of historical religious events to determine if these differentiations could be caused by religious conversion, or rather, whether religious conversion was facilitated within already differentiated populations. Our analysis shows that the great religions in Lebanon were adopted within already distinguishable communities. Once religious affiliations were established, subsequent genetic signatures of the older differentiations were reinforced. <b>Post-establishment</b> differentiations are most plausibly explained by migrations of peoples seeking refuge to avoid the turmoil of major historical events.

The success of restoration programmes, however, is variable, and studies that provide evidence of long term outcomes are valuable for evaluation purposes. This study focused on the restoration of vegetation within a limestone quarry in Dorset, UK between 1997 and 2014. Using a randomised block design, the effect of seed mix and seed rate {{on the development of}} community assemblage was investigated in comparison to a nearby target calcareous grassland site. We hypothesised that seed mix composition and sowing rate would influence both the trajectory of the grassland assemblage and final community composition. We found that species composition (in relation to both richness and community assemblage) was strongly influenced by time and to some extent by seed rate and seed mix. However, no treatments achieved strong resemblance to the calcareous grassland target vegetation; rather they resembled mesotrophic communities. We conclude that (as with previous studies) there is no ‘‘quick fix’’ {{for the establishment of a}} grassland community; long-term monitoring provides useful information on the trajectory of community development; sowing gets you something (in our case mesotrophic grassland), but, it may not be the target vegetation (e. g., calcicolous grassland) you want that is difficult to establish and regenerate; it is important to sow a diverse mix as subsequent recruitment opportunities are probably limited; <b>post-establishment</b> management should be explored further and carefully considered as part of a restoration project...|$|E

Fields with low initial switchgrass stand frequencies showed a linear relationship between initial switchgrass stands and second year stands and biomass yields. Results from the 10 field, three-state study indicated that establishment year stand frequency level of 40 % or greater, determined by a frequency grid, can be considered an establishment year stand threshold for establishment success and subsequent post-planting year biomass yields for switchgrass.

After assessing and ruling out the presence of consequential spatial correlation effects, the analysis consisted of analyzing the relationship between mean dominant height and initial planting density within 28 Nelder plots located in the central portion of the Canadian Boreal Forest Region. Employing remeasurement data obtained at periodic intervals (16, 20 and 40 – 41 years <b>post-establishment)</b> across a stand density gradient ranging from a minimum of 1425 stems/ha to a maximum of 28, 621 stems/ha, graphical and simple linear regression analyses were used to quantify the stand height–density relationship by species, plot and measurement year.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of non-native species {{is the second}} most important anthropogenic threat to global biodiversity, with the first being habitat destruction. Caprella mutica is a native of the Sea of Japan area, but has subsequently been identified as introduced in several globally distributed locations. This thesis first establishes the current global distribution of C. mutica and uses molecular evidence to suggest global introduction pathways. A study of <b>post-establishment</b> (secondary) vectors and the environmental tolerance of C. mutica provide information regarding the modes of dispersal and potential future range of this and other non-native species. Information regarding the biology and ecology of C. mutica was collected through a study of its seasonal population dynamics. C. mutica has several traits attributed as being characteristics of successful non-native species, such as an abundant and widespread distribution in the native range, broad physiological tolerances, broad food preferences, short lifespan and generation times and high fecundity and growth rate. Enhanced food supply, availability of space, and intensity, timing and sequence of disturbance events contributed to the relative success of C. mutica at several sites. Species native to cold temperate regions, with similar life-history characteristics to C. mutica and exposed to human dispersal mechanisms have the potential to be introduced to the UK.   Once established, there are several effective dispersal mechanisms that can rapidly spread species along the coastlines. Given the widespread distribution of C. mutica in the UK, eradication is not an option. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Agronomic and {{microbiological}} {{studies were}} conducted on "Anchor" alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) established from uninoculated seed on three Aridisols in central Oregon. Significant responses to 230 Kg N per ha (NH₄NO₃), which was applied in mid-April and after each first and second harvests, were observed in yield parameters of the third harvest in five of seven <b>post-establishment</b> cuttings. Of the isolates of Rhizobium meliloti obtained from nodules of ten-week old plants {{at one of the}} sites 20 % were ineffective, 16 % were of intermediate effectiveness and 64 % were highly effective. In the second <b>post-establishment</b> season no ineffective nodule isolates were recovered, but nodule numbers declined from 66 to 11 per plant between the first and third harvests. All isolates recovered from plants at the third harvest were of intermediate effectiveness. Microbiological studies were focused on the development of methods to discriminate between and identify R. meliloti isolates occupying nodules of alfalfa at one of these field sites. A collection of 300 field isolates of R. meliloti were subdivided into seven groups based on intrinsic antibiotic resistance characteristics. Two hundred and four and 55 isolates were placed into two groups, C and F, respectively. Group C isolates dominated the root nodule population in all but one of nine quadrants analyzed. Antiserum raised to a group C isolate, # 31, cross agglutinated with 46 of 55 group C isolates. There were no cross reactions between isolates from any of the other six groups. Thirty three of 35 cross agglutinating field isolates from group C had the same sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) protein profile pattern as isolate # 31 whereas non-agglutinating isolates had different protein profiles from the latter. Further analysis of 32 isolates obtained from ten-week old plants in one replicate plot by SDS-PAGE showed that 12 and 6 isolates were represented by two protein profiles, gel types A and B, respectively. The remaining 14 isolates were represented by unique gel types. Antiserum raised to # 31, a gel type A isolate, cross agglutinated with the 12 gel type A isolates and only with two of the other 20 isolates, each of which was represented by a distinct gel type. Gel-immune-diffusion analysis showed that 9 of the 12 gel type A isolates were antigenically identical to # 31. Analysis of 79 nodule isolates obtained from a systematic sampling of plants from the same replicate plot during the second postestablishment season showed that 53 % of these isolates were identical to # 31 and were distributed in nodules of plants growing throughout the plot. Isolates identical to # 3] by serological and SDS-PAGE methodologies could still be subdivided further into two symbiotic effectiveness classes. The data suggest the need for complementary methods to identify unequivocally field isolates of R. meliloti, that some members of the diverse indigenous population are more dominant nodule occupants than others, and that turnover and change of nodule occupants may be a factor in limiting symbiotic N₂ fixation, and in the yield potential of alfalfa {{in the latter part of}} the growing season in this region of Oregon...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} spatial and {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} macroscopic charcoal record in 11 forested peat basins in a boreal forest landscape in southeast Norway. The areas of the basins ranged from 200 to 6400 m 2 and our study is based on 247 peat sequences that were sampled from randomly selected positions. In total we found 1228 charcoal layers in these peat sequences, which altogether had a length of 551 m. The number of charcoal layers per sequence ranged from 0 to 31 and {{the average number of}} charcoal layers per sequence was 3. 99 / 0. 3 SE, giving a mean fire frequency of one per 475 years. The average charcoal layer contained 170 charcoal particles / 0. 28 mm per 10 cm 2, of which 30 were / 1 mm. Peat sequences that totally lacked macroscopic charcoal were found at all sites. Nonetheless, all sites have burned recurrently during the Holocene, since at least one sequence from each site had seven or more charcoal layers. Neither the number of layers nor particle size decreased with increasing distance to the surrounding forests, indicating an in situ charcoal production and deposition. The charcoal record was characterized by a striking spatial variability. Geostatistical analyses revealed a strong spatial structuring on fine scales, ie, c. 0. 251. 5 m, but there was no evidence for spatial structuring at between-site scales, demonstrating that the sites have idiosyncratic fire histories. The rate of charcoal deposition was greater for the period prior to establishment of Picea abies than for the <b>post-establishment</b> period...|$|E
40|$|Cultural expansions, {{including}} of religions, frequently leave genetic {{traces of}} differentiation and in-migration. These expansions may {{be driven by}} complex doctrinal differentiation, together with major population migrations and gene flow. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the genetic signature of the establishment of religious communities in a region where some of the most influential religions originated, using the Y chromosome as an informative male-lineage marker. A total of 3139 samples were analyzed, including 647 Lebanese and Iranian samples newly genotyped for 28 binary markers and 19 short tandem repeats on the non-recombinant segment of the Y chromosome. Genetic organization was identified by geography and religion across Lebanon in the context of surrounding populations important in the expansions of the major sects of Lebanon, including Italy, Turkey, the Balkans, Syria, and Iran by employing principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, and AMOVA. Timing of population differentiations was estimated using BATWING, in comparison with dates of historical religious events to determine if these differentiations could be caused by religious conversion, or rather, whether religious conversion was facilitated within already differentiated populations. Our analysis shows that the great religions in Lebanon were adopted within already distinguishable communities. Once religious affiliations were established, subsequent genetic signatures of the older differentiations were reinforced. <b>Post-establishment</b> differentiations are most plausibly explained by migrations of peoples seeking refuge to avoid the turmoil of major historical events.

40|$|Living organisms respond both {{to current}} and {{previous}} environments, which can have important consequences on population dynamics. However, {{there is little}} experimental evidence based on long-term field studies {{of the effects of}} previous environments on the performance of individuals. We tested the hypothesis that trees that establish under different environmental conditions perform differently under similar <b>post-establishment</b> conditions. We used the slow-growing, evergreen Mediterranean oak Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia as target species. We analyzed the effects of previous environments, competition effects and tradeoffs among life-history traits (survival, growth, and reproduction). We enhanced seedling establishment for three years by reducing abiotic environmental harshness by means of summer irrigation and artificial shading in 12 experimental plots, while four plots remained as controls. Then these treatments were interrupted for ten years. Seedlings under ameliorated environmental conditions survived and grew faster during early establishment. During the post-management period, previous treatments 1) did not have any effect on survival, 2) experienced a slower above-ground growth, 3) decreased root biomass as indicated from reflectivity of Ground Penetration Radar, 4) increased acorn production mostly through a greater canopy volume and 5) increased acorn production effort. The trees exhibited a combination of effects related to acclimation for coping with abiotic stress and effects of intra-specific competition. In accordance with our hypothesis, tree performance overall depended on previous environmental conditions, and the response was different for different life-history traits. We recommend early management because it increased plot cover, shortened the time to attain sexual maturity and increased the amount of acorn production. Plots such as those assessed in this study may act as sources of propagules in deforested agricultural landscapes thus aiding natural establishment of new plants...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} an acute assessment unit (AAU) on length of hospital stay (LOS), emergency department (ED) waiting times, direct discharge rate, unplanned readmission rate and all-cause hospital mortality of general medical patients. Design and setting: Retrospective comparison of data for general medical patients admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital in Adelaide, South Australia, {{before and after the}} establishment of an AAU (reference years, 2003 [before] and 2006 [after]). Main outcome measures: Mean LOS, ED waiting times and all-cause hospital mortality during calendar years 2003 (pre-establishment) and 2006 (<b>post-establishment).</b> Results: Following the establishment of an AAU, the mean LOS shortened (from 6. 8 days in 2003 to 5. 7 days in 2006; P < 0. 001) despite a 50. 5 % {{increase in the number of}} admissions (from 2652 to 3992). The number of admitted patients waiting in the ED more than 8 hours for a hospital bed decreased (from 28. 7 % to 17. 9 %; P < 0. 001), as did the number waiting more than 12 hours (from 20. 2 % to 10. 4 %; P < 0. 001). The rates of unplanned readmission within 7 and 28 days did not change. The all-cause hospital mortality for general medical admissions was 4. 6 % in 2003 v 3. 7 % in 2006 (P = 0. 056). Conclusion: The establishment of an AAU within the general medical service coincided with decreases in both LOS and ED waiting times, despite a 50 % increase in admissions. This structural reform in the process of acute medical care may have contributed to the improvement in these key health care performance indices without compromising the quality of patient care.

40|$|Much of {{the forest}} cover in {{southern}} Sumatra, Indonesia has been cleared since the early 1970 s, but accurate estimates of the scales and rates of loss are lacking. This study combined high-quality remote sensing applications and extensive field surveys, both to provide an accurate picture of deforestation patterns across an area of 1. 17 million ha in southwest Sumatra and to assess whether southwest Sumatra's Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP) has halted forest loss and logging, and promoted re-growth, since its creation in 1984. Of the single large (692, 850 ha) contiguous area of forest standing across our study area in 1972, nearly half (344, 409 ha) has been cleared from 1972 to 2002, at an average rate per original forest cover of 1. 69 % y(- 1). In Gunung Raya Wildlife Sanctuary (GRWS) and Hydrological Reserves (HR), forests have shrunk by 28, 696 ha and 113, 105 ha, at an average rate of 2. 74 % y(- 1) and 2. 13 % y(- 1), respectively In contrast, forests in BBSNP have reduced four times more slowly than those in GRWS and HR, and have shrunk by 57, 344 ha, at an average rate of 0. 64 % y-. Nevertheless, the forests within BBSNP were cleared almost as rapidly during the post- establishment, as during the pre-establishment, period (0. 6 S% y(- 1) and 0. 63 % y(- 1), respectively) despite the introduction of protection measures during the <b>post-establishment</b> period, following the government's pledge to expand and protect Indonesia's network of Protected Areas (PAS) at the 1982 Bali World Parks Congress. While these protection measures failed to slow down rates of forest loss caused by agricultural encroachments they reduced large-scale mechanised logging {{by a factor of}} 4. 2 and stabilized some 8610 ha of agricultural encroachments, enabling forest re-growth...|$|E
