40|$|Many {{problems}} arising {{in different}} areas of mathematics, such as optimization, variational analysis, and differential equations, can be modeled as equations of the form Tx=x, where T is a given mapping {{in the framework of}} a metric space. However, such equation does not necessarily possess a solution if T happens to be nonself-mapping. In such situations, one speculates to determine an approximate solution x (called a best proximity point) that is optimal {{in the sense that the}} distance between x and Tx is minimum. The aim of best <b>proximity</b> point <b>analysis</b> is to provide sufficient conditions that assure the existence and uniqueness of a best proximity point. This special issue is focused on the latest achievements in best <b>proximity</b> point <b>analysis</b> and the related applications.

In contrast, citation-based document similarity measures, tended to be more suitable for recommending more broadly related documents, meaning citation-based approaches may be more suitable for generating serendipitous recommendations, as long as documents to be recommended contain in-text citations.|$|E

50|$|Co-citation <b>Proximity</b> <b>Analysis</b> was {{conceived}} by B. Gipp in 2006 and {{the description of}} the document similarity measure was later published by Gipp and Beel in 2009. The similarity measure rests on the assumption that within a document’s full-text, the documents cited in close proximity to each other tend to be more strongly related than those documents cited farther apart. The figure to the right illustrates the concept. The CPA approach to document similarity assumes the documents B and C to be more strongly related than the documents B and A, because the citations to B and C occur within the same sentence, whereas the citations to B and A are separated by several paragraphs.|$|E
5000|$|The CPA {{similarity}} measure builds {{upon the}} co-citation document similarity approach with the distinctive addition of <b>proximity</b> <b>analysis.</b> Therefore, the CPA approach {{allows for the}} calculation of a more granular resolution of overall document similarity. CPA {{has been found to}} outperform co-citation analysis, especially when documents contain extensive bibliographies and in cases where documents have not been frequently cited together (i.e. have a low co-citation score). Liu and Chen found that sentence-level co-citations are potentially more efficient markers for use in co-citation analysis in comparison to the loosely coupled article-level only co-citations, since sentence-level co-citations tend to preserve the essential structure of the traditional co-citation network and also form a much smaller subset of all co-citation instances.|$|E
