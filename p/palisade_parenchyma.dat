40|$|Objective: Chilling {{tolerance}} of salicylic acid (SA) in banana seedlings (Musa acuminata cv., Williams 8818) was investigated {{by changes in}} ultrastructure in this study. Methods: Light and electron microscope observation. Results: Pretreatment with 0. 5 mmol/L SA under normal growth conditions (30 / 22 °C) by foliar spray and root irrigation resulted in many changes in ultrastructure of banana cells, such as cells separation from <b>palisade</b> <b>parenchymas,</b> the appearance of crevices in cell walls, the swelling of grana and stromal thylakoids, {{and a reduction in}} the number of starch granules. These results implied that SA treatment at 30 / 22 °C could be a type of stress. During 3 d of exposure to 7 °C chilling stress under low light, however, cell ultrastructure of SA-pretreated banana seedlings showed less deterioration than those of control seedlings (distilled water-pretreated). Conclusion: SA could provide some protection for cell structure of chilling-stressed banana seedling...|$|R

Seaweed extract (SWE) represents an important category of plant biostimulants able to improve crop tolerance to abiotic stresses, such as salinity. The current research aimed at elucidating the physiological and anatomical effects as well as the changes in mineral composition of greenhouse zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) treated with Ecklonia maxima SWE. Plants were sprayed every 2 weeks with a solution containing 3 mL L− 1 of SWE. Zucchini squash plants were supplied with four nutrient solutions: 1 (non-salt control), 20, 40, or 60 mM NaCl. Increased salinity in the nutrient solution triggered a decrease in marketable yield, shoot biomass, Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) index, net CO 2 assimilation rate (ACO 2), transpiration rate (E), and leaf macronutrient concentration (P, K, Ca, and Mg), whereas it augmented Na and Cl concentrations in leaf tissue without altering PSII photochemistry.
