25|$|LTC Caslon is a {{digitisation}} of the Lanston Type Company's 14 <b>point</b> <b>size</b> Caslon 337 of 1915 (itself {{a revival}} of the original Caslon types). This family include fonts in regular and bold weights, with fractions, ligatures, small caps (regular and regular italic only), swashes (regular italic weight only), and Central European characters. An notable feature is that like some hot metal releases of Caslon, two separate options for descenders are provided for all styles: long descenders (creating a more elegant designs) or short (allowing tighter linespacing).|$|E
500|$|This claim {{has been}} criticised as a {{misinterpretation}} of how typefaces are actually measured and what printing methods are desirable. Monotype Garamond, the version bundled with Windows, has a generally smaller design {{at the same}} notional <b>point</b> <b>size</b> compared to Times New Roman and quite spindly strokes, giving it a more elegant but less readable appearance. To make letters, especially the lower-case, as high as in an equivalent setting of Times New Roman, the text size must be increased, counterbalancing any cost savings. Thomas Phinney, an expert on digital fonts, noted {{that the effect of}} simply swapping Garamond in would be compromised legibility: [...] "any of those changes, swapping to a font that sets smaller at the same nominal <b>point</b> <b>size,</b> or actually reducing the <b>point</b> <b>size,</b> or picking a thinner typeface, will reduce the legibility of the text. That seems like a bad idea, as the percentage of Americans with poor eyesight is skyrocketing." [...] Professional font designer Jackson Cavanaugh commented [...] "If we're actually interested in reducing waste, just printing less – using less paper – is obviously more efficient." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Garamond uses much less ink than Times New Roman {{at a similar}} <b>point</b> <b>size,</b> so {{changing}} to Garamond could be a cost-saver for large organizations that print large numbers of documents, especially if using inkjet printers.

50|$|Among {{the most}} {{successful}} contemporary adaptations are the ones drawn by Adrian Frutiger for the Linotype foundry, and by Jonathan Hoefler for H&FJ. Hoefler's design anticipates the degradation of hairline in smaller <b>point</b> <b>sizes</b> by employing heavier weighted strokes in the smaller <b>point</b> <b>sizes.</b> Frutiger's Didot revival, which is bundled with OS X, was specifically intended for display use and not for body text, and adds in addition an even more delicate headline font.|$|R
2500|$|The {{distinction}} between font and typeface {{is that a}} font designates a specific member of a type family such as roman, boldface, or italic type, while typeface designates a consistent visual appearance or style {{which can be a}} [...] "family" [...] or related set of fonts. For example, a given typeface such as Arial may include roman, bold, and italic fonts. [...] In the metal type era, a font also meant a specific <b>point</b> <b>size,</b> but with digital scalable outline fonts this distinction is no longer valid, as a single font may be scaled to any size.|$|E
50|$|An em is a unit in {{the field}} of typography, equal to the {{currently}} specified <b>point</b> <b>size.</b> For example, one em in a 16-point typeface is 16 points. Therefore, this unit is the same for all typefaces at a given <b>point</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E
50|$|In metal type, the <b>point</b> <b>size</b> of the font {{described}} {{the height of}} the metal body on which the typeface's characters were cast. In digital type, letters of a font are designed around an imaginary space called an em square. When a <b>point</b> <b>size</b> of a font is specified, the font is scaled so that its em square has a side length of that particular length in points. Although the letters of a font usually fit within the font's em square, there is not necessarily any size relationship between the two, so the <b>point</b> <b>size</b> does not necessarily correspond to any measurement {{of the size of the}} letters on the printed page.|$|E

5000|$|In typography, {{the point}} is the {{smallest}} unit of measure. It is used for measuring font size, leading, and other items on a printed page. The <b>size</b> of the <b>point</b> has varied {{throughout the history of}} printing. Since the 18th century, the <b>point's</b> <b>size</b> has varied from 0.18 to 0.4 millimeters. Following the advent of desktop publishing in the 1980s and 1990s, digital printing has largely supplanted the letterpress printing and has established the DTP point (desktop publishing point) as the de facto standard. The DTP point is defined as [...] of an international inch (about 0.353 mm) and, as with earlier American <b>point</b> <b>sizes,</b> is considered to be [...] of a pica.|$|R

50|$|Letter-spacing {{may also}} {{refer to the}} {{insertion}} of fixed spaces, as was commonly done in hand-set metal type to achieve letter-spacing. This is a more mechanical method which relies less upon spacing and kerning tables resident in each typeface and accessed and used when letterspacing is applied universally. Fixed spaces include a hair space, thin space, wordspace, en-space, and em-space. An en-space is equal to half the current <b>point</b> <b>size,</b> and an em-space is the same width as the current <b>point</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the size}} of the em {{ultimately}} depends on the <b>point</b> <b>size,</b> or height of the metal body of a letter, it is also used as a measure of horizontal spacing relative to the type size, with vertical spacing being measured in picas or points. One em was traditionally defined as the width of the capital M in the current typeface and <b>point</b> <b>size,</b> because the M was commonly cast the full-width of the square blocks, or em-quads (also mutton-quads), which are used in printing presses.|$|E
50|$|Some later phototypesetters utilize a CRT {{to project}} the image of letters onto the {{photographic}} paper. This creates a sharper image, adds some flexibility in manipulating the type, and creates the ability to offer a continuous range of <b>point</b> <b>sizes</b> by eliminating film media and lenses. The Compugraphic MCS (Modular Composition System) with the 8400 typesetter {{is an example of}} a CRT phototypesetter. This machine loads digital fonts into memory from an 8-inch floppy disk. Additionally, the 8400 is able to set type-in <b>point</b> <b>sizes</b> between 5- and 120-point in 1/2-point increments. It is extremely fast and was one of the first output systems (the other was also a Compugraphic machine, the 8600) that is able to create camera-ready output with a maximum width of 12 inches.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Object {{points is}} a new {{software}} size metric that has emerged to cope with recent developments in software engineering, and to overcome the deficiencies of the traditional lines of code and function <b>points</b> <b>size</b> metrics. Moreover, object points has been utilized {{as the basis for}} several software cost estimation models with promising improvements in the accuracy of estimates. However, the infancy of the object <b>points</b> <b>size</b> metric means that {{there is a shortage of}} object points based software historical projects, on which to base the empirical validation of the new object points based software cost estimation models. Hence, the relationship between the extensively used function points and newly invented object <b>points</b> <b>size</b> metrics have been conceptualized and utilized in a novel forward approach to convert the function points projects data into their equivalent object points data. Empirical investigations of 66 function points projects have shown high correlation and significance, 88 % and 0. 33, respectively, between the resulting object points effort estimates and the actual function points effort. Furthermore, the resulting object points data have been utilized to model the embodied function points-object points relationship in two specialized productivity factors and function points type dependent linear models. The resulting models have shown high fitness, R 2, values of 0. 95, for both models...|$|R
