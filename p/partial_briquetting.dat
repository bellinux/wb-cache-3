40|$|Abstract: The {{density of}} the coal charge plays an {{important}} role in the coke quality. The increase of the bulk density usually improves the coke strength due to increased coal particle contact and increased coke density. There are a few possibilities to increase the coal charge bulk density: adjusting the grain size distribution or moisture content (drying), oil addition and mechanical treatment (e. g., <b>partial</b> <b>briquetting</b> or stamping). A renewed interest in stamp charging cokemaking technology has been observed in recent years, especially in Asia, but also in Europe (Poland, Germany and Ukraine). The paper presents the results of studies on the effects of selected factors on the coal cake density and mechanical strength i. e. stamping energy, coal type, water content and crushing fineness. There is possibility to influence these parameters in industrial conditions. The investigations were carried out with use of mechanical stamping apparatus and strength testing machine specially designed for this purpose...|$|E

The effect of increasing the bulk density was evaluated by comparison with direct addition. Two briquettes of different composition were studied. The influence of the briquettes on the Gieseler plasticity of the coals was determined. It was found that the effect of the binder was not enough to compensate for the decrease in plasticity produced by the inert components of the briquettes. Carbonizations were carried out in a movable wall oven of 17 kg capacity {{and the quality of the}} cokes produced was tested by evaluating their mechanical strength, coke reactivity to CO 2 and post-reaction strength. In addition, the porosity and ash chemistry of the cokes was determined and an attempt was made to establish a relation between these results and the quality of the cokes. Coke quality results suggest that 10 â€“ 15 wt. ...|$|E
