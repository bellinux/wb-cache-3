25|$|Stacey {{returned}} for a short stint between 7 February 2014 and 25 March 2014 when she turned herself in to the police for Archie's murder. After reappearing for another short stint between 5 August 2014 and 11 August 2014, Stacey later appealed, and returned permanently on 1 September 2014. Since then, Stacey's storylines include her friendship with Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar), a relationship with Martin Fowler (James Bye), a fling with Shabnam's fiancé Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami), possessing a mystery key, being electrocuted, giving birth to a son, Arthur, developing a rare mental illness known as <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis</b> and discovering her deceased father had another family. Stacey has proven popular with fans and critics, and Turner has won multiple awards for her portrayal.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{distinct}} forms of psychosis which start during pregnancy (prepartum) or after delivery (postpartum). In Europe and North America, only one - polymorphic <b>psychosis</b> (<b>postpartum</b> psychosis)- is commonly seen. Postpartum bipolar disorder, {{referred to in}} the DSM-5 as bipolar, peripartum onset, is a separate condition with no psychotic features. Historically, about one quarter of psychoses after childbirth were 'organic' and would now be classified as a form of delirium. [...] This means that a severe mental disturbance, usually in the form of delirium, develops as a complication of a somatic illness.|$|R
40|$|<b>Postpartum</b> (or puerperal) <b>psychosis</b> (PP) occurs {{shortly after}} {{childbirth}} in 0. 1 – 0. 2 % of women, and is characterised by delusions, mood swings, confused thinking, and disorganised behaviour. The condition is disturbing for {{patients and their}} family members and loved ones, and affected individuals may be at increased risk of harming themselves or their offspring. The features of PP indicate a substantial biological basis to its pathogenesis, although currently {{little is known about}} possible risk factors. Based on recent results from animal model and human studies, I propose that reduced function of the enzyme steroid sulfatase in the mother represents a unifying and physiologically plausible candidate mechanism for the neural and endocrinological disturbances seen in cases of PP...|$|R
25|$|Andrea Pia Kennedy Yates (born July 2, 1964) is {{a former}} {{resident}} of Houston, Texas, who confessed to drowning her five children in their bathtub on June 20, 2001. She had been suffering for some time with very severe postpartum depression and <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis.</b> She was represented by Houston criminal defense attorney George Parnham. Chuck Rosenthal, the district attorney in Harris County, asked {{for the death penalty}} in her 2002 trial. Her case placed the M'Naghten Rules, along with the Irresistible Impulse Test, a legal test for sanity, under close public scrutiny in the United States. She was convicted of capital murder. After the guilty verdict, but before sentencing, the State abandoned its request for the death penalty in light of false testimony by one of its expert psychiatric witnesses. She was {{sentenced to life in prison}} with the possibility of parole after 40 years. The verdict was overturned on appeal.|$|E
25|$|Stacey helps Belinda {{out at her}} new {{salon and}} Belinda is {{impressed}} with her. Martin's daughter Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield) confides in Stacey about her boyfriend Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) wanting sex with her and asks for advice. When Bex's mother Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) leaves, Bex moves in with the Fowlers, leaving the flat overcrowded, so they move into Sonia's old house. Max returns to Walford after being wrongly imprisoned for murdering Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), and Stacey is happy that he is back. Stacey is upset when Martin {{is involved in a}} bus crash but he recovers and agrees to having a baby with Stacey. Stacey and Martin decide to keep their distance from the Kazemis following Bex's bullying ordeal, caused by an explicit photo of Shakil being distributed from Bex's phone. Arthur's grandmother, Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford), is hurt with being excluded from Arthur's life and Stacey and Carmel fight when Carmel makes remarks about Stacey's mental health, so Stacey bans her from seeing Arthur. However, Max persuades Stacey to let Carmel be involved with Arthur. Stacey tells Martin that she is pregnant and they agree to seek medical advice because she is worried about her <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis</b> returning. In July 2017, Stacey goes for a job interview at The Queen Vic and is accepted as a barmaid there once again.|$|E

The law temporarily addressed the nursing shortage by providing non-immigrant visas for qualified foreign nurses in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago and was reauthorized in 2005. Rush {{sponsored the}} Melanie Blocker-Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act, named for Melanie Blocker-Stokes, a Chicago native who jumped {{to her death}} from a 12th-story window due to postpartum depression. The bill would provide for research on <b>postpartum</b> depression and <b>psychosis</b> and services for individuals suffering from these disorders.

40|$|Pregnancy and the {{postpartum}} period {{are recognized}} as times of vulnerability to mood disorders, including <b>postpartum</b> depression and <b>psychosis.</b> Recently, changes in sleep physiology and sleep deprivation have been proposed as having roles in perinatal psychiatric disorders. In this article we review {{what is known about}} changes in sleep physiology and behaviour during the perinatal period, with a focus on the relations between sleep and postpartum “blues,” depression and psychosis and on sleep-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of perinatal mood disorders. The interaction between sleep and perinatal mood disorders is significant, but evidence-based research in this field is limited. Studies that measure both sleep and mood during the perinatal period, particularly those that employ objective measurement tools such as polysomnography and actigraphy, will provide important information about the causes, prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Pulmonary {{thromboembolism}} occurs {{usually by}} running a thrombus {{from the deep}} veins of the legs rarely periprostatic or periuteric veins. Virchow's triad of necessary conditions for the occurrence of thrombosis involves disruption of blood flow, disruption of blood chemistry and damage to the vessel wall. Venous thrombosis {{is often associated with}} the implementation of antipsychotic therapy. Case report. We reported two cases of sudden death of psychiatric patients who were in both cases fixed during hospitalization. The first case was a 26 -year-old woman treated a year with the diagnose of <b>postpartum</b> reactive <b>psychosis.</b> She was hospitalized because of mental state worsening with a dominant depressed mood, visual and auditory hallucinations. Her therapy was determined by diazepam, clozapine, haloperidol and lamotrigine. Suddenly, the patient died on the fifth day of hospitalization. The autopsy showed massive thromboembolism of the pulmonary artery branches. Toxicological analysis revealed the presence of therapeutic doses of antipsychotics. The second case was a- 45 -yearold men, a long-time alcoholic. On admission, the diagnosis of delirium tremens was established, and diazepam and haloperidol were administered. On the fifth day of hospitalization, he suddenly died. The autopsy showed thromboembolism of the branch of the pulmonary artery. Toxicological analysis established the presence of nordiazepam in urine (0. 06 mg/L). Both patients were fixed during hospitalization. Conclusion. Both presented psychiatric patients were younger than 50 years, were not overweight, did not have changes of the venous blood vessels. Nowadays, when the issue of medical responsibility often arises in these and similar cases of sudden death in patients treated in psychiatric clinics, the questions on medical malpractice could be expected...|$|R

2500|$|FBI {{profiler}} Robert K. Ressler mentioned Wuornos {{only briefly}} in his autobiographical {{history of his}} 20 years with the FBI. Writing in 1992, he said he often does not discuss female serial killers {{because they tend to}} kill in sprees instead of in a sequential fashion. He noted Wuornos as the sole exception. Ressler, who allegedly coined the phrase [...] "serial killer" [...] to describe murderers seeking personal gratification, does not apply it to women killing in <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis</b> or to any murderer acting solely for financial gain, such as women who have killed a series of boarders or spouses.|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{range of}} {{psychological}} disorders occur in {{women in the}} postpartum period apart from the traditional blues, <b>postpartum</b> depression and <b>psychosis.</b> These include obsession of infanticide, PTSD, morbid preoccupations regarding child birth and disorders of mother-infant relationships, though they are under emphasized. Methods: it is a cross-sectional study conducted in the tertiary maternity care hospital. A total of 152 study subjects were interviewed on MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory) and GAF (Global Assessment of Functioning) within 2 weeks after delivery. Results: The psychiatric morbidity was seen in 67 (44 %) of the study subjects. About 26 % of subjects had Depressive disorder NOS. Obsessive harm to the child, Panic disorder, Social phobia were the other disorders identified. There were no cases of Mania, Bipolar disorder, psychosis, post traumatic stress disorder or substance use disorder diagnosed across the sample. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score averaged 87. 8. Statistically significant association was seen to be present between psychiatric illness and number of previous still births and dead children before this delivery (P = 0. 045). Conclusions: The study reveals that psychiatric co-morbidity is very common in the postpartum period and can be detected as early as first week after delivery. Social phobia identified as a common association is a new finding and needs further replication. It needs a larger sample with a prospective assessment to generalize the findings of our study...|$|R

Methods: A total of 136 women were enrolled, who had an active mental disorder, were taking medication to prevent a relapse, or had a history of <b>postpartum</b> depression or <b>psychosis.</b> Medication use was evaluated for the three trimesters and during labor. Based on the defined daily dose, medication use was classified into three groups. Primary outcome variables included the infant gestational age at birth, birth weight, and Apgar scores at one and 5 minutes. Results: Our study showed a significantly higher incidence of Apgar score ≤ 7 at 5 minutes in women taking psychotropic drugs as compared with the group taking no medication, respectively (16. 3 % versus 0. 0 %, P= 0. 01). There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups in Apgar score at one minute or in gestational age and birth weight. The results showed no significant differences in gestational age, birth weight, or Apgar scores for a low–intermediate or high dose of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and for a low or intermediate dose of an antipsychotic. Conclusion: This study does not indicate a relationship between doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antipsychotics and adverse neonatal outcomes.

40|$|During {{the first}} month postpartum, 85 % of women {{experience}} some form of mood disorders. The most common are: postpartum blues, non-psychotic <b>postpartum</b> depression, puerperal <b>psychosis.</b> Delivery of a child can be traumatic for some women. Several authors have found that women could get symptoms of one form of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childbirth. However, etiology of established postpartum disorders is still unknown. The {{aim of this study}} is to detect symptoms of acute stress reaction and acute depressive state as a consequence of peripartal complications, as early as three days postpartum using Impact of Events Scale revised (IES-R) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) questionnaires and to demonstrate their potential usage for the early detection of vulnerable mothers with greater risk to develop any of postpartum psychiatric disorder, including PTSD. For that purpose 103 subjects, without previous medical history of psychiatric illness, were included in the investigation. Long duration of delivery (ł 12 h), very painful delivery, complication and illness of mother during and after delivery as a consequence of delivery, preterm delivery (before week 36) and/or illness of the child (as a consequence of delivery or congenital) are considered to be risk factors for acute stress reaction and acute depressive state after delivery. Sixty one out of 103 investigated mothers had one or more researched peripartal complications. A statistically significant difference has been found between the control (n= 42) and the peripartal complications (n= 61) groups in both the mean IES-R (4. 67 ± 5. 43 and 13. 50 ± 14. 12, respectively, p< 0. 01) as well as in the mean EPDS (3. 85 ± 2. 76 and 7. 03 ± 3. 90, respectively, p< 0. 01) scores. Additionally, while there were 4 cases of acute stress reactions and 3 cases of acute depressive state in the peripartal complications group there were no cases of these states in the control group. Based on our findings we conclude that using IES-R and EPDS questionnaires as early as three days after delivery could provide an early detection of previously healthy mothers with greater risk for development of postpartum psychiatric disorders...|$|R

2500|$|After {{the birth}} of their sixth child in 1771, Patrick's wife Sarah Henry began to exhibit {{symptoms}} of mental illness, and one reason for the move from Louisa County to Scotchtown was so they could be near family members. Henry's biographer, Jon Kukla believed her to be the victim of <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis,</b> [...] for which there was then no treatment. At times, she was restrained in a form of straitjacket. Although Virginia had opened the first public mental facility in North America in 1773, Henry decided that she was better off at Scotchtown, and prepared a large apartment for her there. She died in 1775, after which Henry avoided all objects that reminded him of her, and sold Scotchtown in 1777.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of Charlie's funeral, Stacey is {{convinced}} that Martin is a demon who {{is working with the}} devil. Eventually, Martin convinces her that he is not a demon and that a hospital is the safest place for her and Arthur. However, she is then sectioned after refusing to voluntarily admit herself, because she will be separated from Arthur. Stacey tells the doctor she has been hearing God's voice since Arthur's birth at Christmas, so the doctor suspects she is suffering from <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis.</b> Martin apologises to her and promises to make things right, determined {{to find a way to}} bring her back together with Arthur. Shabnam soon realises that Stacey wants to see Arthur, so goes to Martin with the idea of getting Stacey and Arthur taken to a mother and baby care unit. When Shabnam decides to leave Walford, Stacey finally admits that Kush is Arthur's father, showing that she is starting to recover. Martin finds a mother and baby unit for Stacey in Essex, and takes her and Arthur there. Stacey writes Martin a letter revealing that Arthur is Kush's son, but decides not to send it, however a nurse finds it and gives it to Martin; Martin is heartbroken. Stacey begs for his forgiveness, but he goes to America, returning a few weeks later and they reunite. Stacey is allowed a home visit, where she meets Kyle again. He explains that he is transgender and he used to be her sister but is now her brother. Stacey accepts and supports him and allows him to stay at her and Martin's flat. Stacey says she no longer wants to be Martin's [...] "not-wife" [...] and proposes to him, which he accepts, and tells Kush he can be part of Arthur's life, but Kush later decides he does not want to be Arthur's role model. Stacey is discharged from the mother and baby unit.|$|E
5000|$|Symptoms include mood lability, agitation, confusion, thought disorganization, hallucinations, and {{disturbed}} sleep. The risk {{of developing}} <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis</b> is increased by a history of bipolar disorder, previous episodes of <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis,</b> {{a family history of}} bipolar disorder, and the current pregnancy being a woman's first. [...] Consequences of <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis</b> can be significant, including suicide, infant neglect, and infanticide, so women with this condition are generally hospitalized. [...] Acute treatment includes the use of a mood stabilizer, and antipsychotic, and if necessary a benzodiazepine for agitation.|$|E
50|$|Postpartum {{psychiatric}} disorders typically {{divided into three}} categories: (1) postpartum blues (2) postpartum depression and (3) <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis.</b> It {{may be useful to}} conceptualize these disorders as existing along a continuum, where postpartum blues is the mildest and <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis</b> the most severe form of postpartum psychiatric illness.|$|E
50|$|For women taking {{psychiatric}} medication, {{the decision}} as to whether continue during pregnancy and whether to take them while breast feeding is difficult in any case; there is no data to guide this decision with respect to preventing <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis.</b> There is no data to guide a {{decision as to whether}} women at high risk for <b>postpartum</b> <b>psychosis</b> should take antipsychotic medicine to prevent it.
