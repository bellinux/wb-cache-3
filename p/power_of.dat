40|$|AbstractIn 1988, Golumbic and Hammer {{characterized}} the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> cycles, relating them to circular arc graphs. We extend their results and propose several further structural characterizations for both <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> cycles and <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> paths. The characterizations lead to linear-time recognition algorithms of these classes of graphs. Furthermore, as a generalization <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> cycles, <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> paths, {{and even of}} the well-known circulant graphs, we consider distance graphs. While the colorings of these graphs have been intensively studied, the recognition problem has been so far neglected.
