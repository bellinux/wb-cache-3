We also estimate WTP using other methods of response recoding found in the literature.

The test is based on comparing (a smoothed version of) the link functions of the parametric <b>polychotomous</b> model under consideration with a nonparametric estimate. If the parametric model is correct the nonparametric estimates should differ from (the smooth of) the hypothesized links only by random sampling error.

In this paper, a {{brief review of}} multilinear formula scoring (MFS) is given, with specific emphasis on estimating option characteristic curves (OCCS). MFS was used to estimate OCCS for the Arithmetic Reasoning subtest of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. A close match was obtained between empirical proportions of option selection for examinees in 25 ability intervals and the modeled probabilities of option selection. In a second analysis, accurately estimated OCCS were obtained for simulated data. To evaluate the utility of modeling incorrect responses to the Arithmetic Reasoning test, the amounts of statistical information about ability were computed for dichotomous and <b>polychotomous</b> scorings of the items.

40|$|AbstractIn {{spite of}} the {{popularity}} of Fisher discriminant analysis {{in the realm of}} feature extraction and pattern classification, it is beyond the capability of Fisher discriminant analysis to extract nonlinear structures from the data.

In this article, a new trail is blazed in developing innovative and effective algorithm for <b>polychotomous</b> kernel Fisher discriminant with the capability in estimating the posterior probabilities, which is exceedingly necessary and significant in solving complex nonlinear pattern recognition problems arising from the real world. Different from the conventional ‘divide-and-combine’ approaches to <b>polychotomous</b> classification problems, such as pairwise and one-versus-others, the method proposed herein synthesizes the multi-category classifier via the induction of top-to-down binary tree by means of kernelized group clustering algorithm.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how firms' modal choice {{is influenced by}} their exposure to dissemination risks, need for strategic control and possession of global management skills. A probabilistic model is specified. The following hypotheses are incorporated in the model: the probability of choosing a more advanced entry, ceteris paribus, {{is a function of}} (1) the risk-adjusted expected net benefits of a firm's possession of certain types of intangible, transportable assets; (2) parent company attributes that necessitate control over its strategic resources overseas; and (3) possession of certain global resources that are specific to the firm such that their effective internalization calls for higher entry mode. The models are estimated using <b>polychotomous</b> regression analysis. Results generally confirm that size and possession of some knowledge-based, firm-specific strategic assets, are significantly related to advanced entry modes. They also confirm that firms opt for higher entry mode to gain control of competitive pricing in the foreign markets.

40|$|We {{consider}} the penalized likelihood method with smoothing spline ANOVA for estimating nonparametric functions to data involving a <b>polychotomous</b> response. The fitting procedure involves minimizing the penalized likelihood in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. One Step Block SOR-Newton-Raphson Algorithm {{is used to}} solve the minimization problem. Generalized CrossValidation or unbiased risk estimation is used to empirically assess the amount of smoothing (which controls the bias and variance trade-off) at each one-step Block SOR-Newton-Raphson iteration. Under some regular smoothness conditions, the one-step Block SOR-Newton-Raphson will produce a sequence which converges to the minimizer of the penalized likelihood for the fixed smoothing parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to examine {{the performance of the}} algorithm. The method is applied to <b>polychotomous</b> data from the Wisconsin Epidemiological Study of Diabetic Retinopathy to estimate the risks of cause-specific mortality given several potential risk factors {{at the start of the}} study. Strategies to obtain smoothing spline estimates for large data sets with <b>polychotomous</b> response are also proposed in this thesis.
