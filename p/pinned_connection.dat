It has since been surpassed by three bridges, making it the sixth-longest cantilever {{bridge in the}} world in 2013. It is a suspension type balanced cantilever bridge, with a central span 1,500 ft between centers of main towers and a suspended span of 564 ft. The main towers are 280 ft high above the monoliths and 76 ft apart at the top. The anchor arms are 325 ft each, while the cantilever arms are 468 ft each. The bridge deck hangs from panel points in the lower chord of the main trusses with 39 pairs of hangers. The roadways beyond the towers are supported from ground, leaving the anchor arms free from deck load. The deck system includes cross girders suspended between the pairs of hangers by a <b>pinned</b> <b>connection.</b> Six rows of longitudinal stringer girders are arranged between cross girders. Floor beams are supported transversally on top of the stringers, while themselves supporting a continuous pressed steel troughing system surfaced with concrete.|$|E

The observed differences in the probability of exceeding the limit state as well as the parameters contributing to seismic safety were discussed.

40|$|Abstract. An {{innovative}} dissipative (INERD <b>Pin)</b> <b>connection</b> system, {{which was}} previously developed for seismic resistant X-braced steel frames, {{was applied to}} retrofit existing precast industrial buildings designed only for gravity loads. Nonlinear dynamic analyses were carried out {{and the effectiveness of}} the dissipative connection system was evaluated. The INERD <b>Pin</b> <b>connection</b> system increased both the deformation capacity and the stiffness of the buildings, reducing damage of the structural elements. In case of low seismic actions, the INERD <b>Pin</b> <b>connection</b> system especially enhanced the stiffness of the structure, causing only small reductions of column rotations and top displacements. In case of severe seismic actions, the addition of the dissipative connections showed all its effectiveness particularly for low rotation capacity at column base, increasing the energy dissipation capacity and reducing the displacements of the structure. The results of the numerical investigations demonstrated the possibility to reduce the seismic vulnerability of existing precast buildings by means of dissipative connection systems...|$|R

The applicability of the loading parameter Φ to <b>pinned</b> <b>connections</b> with small to relevant initial clearances is explored.

40|$|Spacecraft {{designs are}} a result of system {{properties}} and design variables that ensure the spacecraft will operate to mission objectives. The focus of this effort is a set of global system properties for frequency, length, total mass and the ratio between the payload mass and the support structure mass. These variables were determined by investigating the individual payload and support components and relating these to the overall global prop-erties that describe the system behavior. A one-dimensional system is defined by a string and a beam to represent the payload and support structures. The payload and support structures are connected on each end with a <b>pinned</b> <b>connection</b> and an arbitrary number of intermediate ties for given requirements. Through this approach several relationships are developed between the system properties and the natural frequency. These results were then compared to those of a derived analytical model to determine if a closed-form solution could be used to predict system behavior over the same range of structural characteristics. This closed form solution proved to correlate well to analytical predictions only for the case of low mass ratios where the support structure dominates total system mass, and thus the structural system performs like a beam under compression...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{study was}} done on the {{macroscopic}} effects on a frame's behavior when cladding panels are structurally incorporated into the analysis. The following is {{a report on the}} effects of cladding panels on the natural vibration frequencies of a structural frame. The microscopic effects of the panel's inclusion, i. e. the stresses internal to the panel itself, are not studied. A two story, one bay frame with a single cladding panel at mid-height was used throughout the analysis. The cladding panel was represented by five different models; 4 noded, 16 DOF (degrees-of-freedom) rectangular finite element, 4 noded, 12 DOF rectangular finite element, 4 and 8 noded quadrilateral plane stress elements with only two translational DOF at each node, and an analogous frame model. To analyze the effect of discretization on the results with each model, the cladding panel was subdivided into meshes varying from 1 to 16 elements. The results of each model with the various meshes were compared. Frame behavior as a function of panel height was also studied. Ratios of panel height to story height of 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 % were used. The degree of fixity of the elements connecting the panel to the frame varied from a <b>pinned</b> <b>connection</b> to full fixity.
