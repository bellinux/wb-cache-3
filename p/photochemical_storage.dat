40|$|The {{importance}} of sunlight {{in bringing about}} not only photosynthesis in plants, but also other photochemical effects, is reviewed. More effort should be devoted to <b>photochemical</b> <b>storage</b> of the sun's energy without the living plant. There is no theoretical {{reason to believe that}} such reactions are impossible. Ground rules for searching for suitable solar photochemical reactions are given, and a few attempts are described, but nothing successful has yet been found. Future possibilities are suggested. Photogalvanic cells which convert sunlight into electricity deserve further research. Eugene Rabinowitch has been an active pioneer in these fields...|$|E
40|$|An intense {{interest}} and activity {{in studies of}} Ru(bpy) 32 + and related complexes has been sustained for over two decades because of their utility in addressing many fundamental photochemical and photophysical issues and, more importantly, because of their potential value as useful components in practical solar energy conversion devices. In this work the fundamental issues {{as well as the}} practical applications of Ru(II) -polypyridine complexes as components of the Y-zeolite based photocatalytic systems are investigated. A series of complexes, Ru(bpz) 2 L 2 +, was prepared wherein the donor strength of the spectator ligand, L, was varied in a systematic manner. Analysis of excited state lifetime data, acquired over wide range of temperatures, revealed a quantitative dependence of the relative importance of two competing thermally activated decay pathways on the donor strength of the spectator ligand. The nature and extent of interactions between Ru(bpy) 32 + molecules entrapped within the supercages of Y-zeolite have been studied by employing a series of zeolitic samples with different loads of the entrapped complex. Analysis of lifetime measurements as a function of concentration and power revealed the effect of interactions of the excited state *Ru(bpy) 32 + with both ground and excited state species in adjacent cages. A novel method for the construction of zeolite entrapped molecular assemblies, in which two different Ru(II) -polypyridine complexes are immobilized in adjacent supercages of Y-zeolite, has been developed. The two complexes forming the assembly are chosen so that one of them can act as photosensitizer and one as an electron donor. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the synthetic method developed is efficient in forming adjacent cage assemblies and that the entrapped complexes are strongly coupled with respect to electron transfer. The applicability of the above mentioned zeolite entrapped molecular assemblies to the <b>photochemical</b> <b>storage</b> of light energy has been investigated. Photoredox studies of system comprised of donor (Z-Ru(mmb) 32 +) :sensitizer (Z-Ru(bpy) 2 bpz 2 +) :relay (diquat) and extrazeolitic acceptor (propylviologen sulfonate), have shown that a significant improvement in net charge separation efficiency can be attained for the adjacent cage assemblies relative to a simple reference system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a new, highly sensitive, method for in vivo studies of photosynthesis {{based on the}} ‘mirage effect’ in which thermal energy dissipation from intact leaves, illuminated with intensity-modulated light, is sensed through the periodic deflection of a laser beam propagating along the leaf surface. The photothermal deflection technique allows one to rapidly estimate the gross efficiency of <b>photochemical</b> energy <b>storage</b> by comparing the heat emission signal with and without an additional strong, photosynthetically saturating, non-modulated light. In pea leaves, the maximal storage efficiency at low light intensities was shown to approach 55 %. The general utility of this simple photothermal method is illustrated by examining the variation of the deflection signal under different conditions. The spectral resolution of this new method is shown to be much {{higher than that of}} the photoacoustic method...|$|R
40|$|The first {{artificial}} donor–sensitizer–acceptor {{compound in}} which photoinduced long-range electron transfer is coupled to donor deprotonation and acceptor protonation is reported. The long-lived photoproduct stores {{energy in the}} form of a radical pair state in which the charges of the donor and the acceptor remain unchanged, much in contrast to previously investigated systems that exhibit charge-separated states comprised of electron–hole pairs. This finding is relevant for light-driven accumulation of redox equivalents, because it exemplifies how the buildup of charge can be avoided yet light energy can be stored. Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions at a phenol donor and a monoquat acceptor triggered by excitation of a Ru(II) sensitizer enable this form of <b>photochemical</b> energy <b>storage.</b> Our triad emulates photosystem II more closely than previously investigated systems, because tyrosine Z is oxidized and deprotonated, whereas plastoquinone B is reduced and protonated...|$|R
40|$|A slow {{water stress}} over several days was imposed on tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. var. Xanthi) by {{withholding}} {{water from the}} soil. Photosynthesis was measured in leaves from those water‐stressed plants by the photoacoustic method. Slow drought induced marked changes in the photoacoustic signals, which were largely similar to those observed previously in leaves subjected to rapid desiccation in air (over 3 – 4 h), reflecting two simultaneous changes: 1) Modification of the heat and oxygen diffusion characteristics of the leaves due to changes in their anatomical structure [shown by {{the change in the}} slope of the plot of the oxygen (AOX) to photothermal signal (APT) ratio vs the square root of the modulation frequency]; 2) Inhibition of gross photosynthesis measured by the extrapolation of the AOX/APT ratio to zero frequency. However, in contrast to rapid water stress in detached leaves, where it was shown that mainly the oxidizing side of photosystem II (PS II) was damaged, we found a slower and more complex phenomenology having largely biphasic kinetics. During the first 6 days, there was a strong reduction in the <b>photochemical</b> energy <b>storage,</b> but the inhibition of oxygen evolution was relatively mild. The Emerson enhancement in state 1 dropped considerably, indicating lowering of the apparent absorption cross‐section of PS II. Fluorescence measurements suggest that PS II reaction center itseIf may be the primary site of the damage. PS I activity, judged by cytochrome f photooxidation, remained largely intact. The subsequent days were associated with a further spectacular decrease in the oxygen evolution quantum yield with both photosystems damaged. The <b>photochemical</b> energy <b>storage</b> continued to decrease further. The Emerson enhancement ratio of the remaining activities in both State 1 and 2 showed a marked increase, indicating the reestablishment of a strong imbalance in the distribution of excitation energy within the photochemical apparatus in favor of PS II. All the photoacoustic changes observed in response to drought were completely reversible within 2 – 3 days upon rewatering of the soil. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

40|$|<b>Photochemical</b> energy <b>storage</b> in {{isolated}} bundle sheath cells from Zea mays was examined. Photoacoustic spectroscopy {{was used in}} this study to monitor energy storage processes. The presence of methyl viologen or addition of substrates which activated carbon fixation, prevented energy storage processes through the electron transport system. The energy storage was inhibited completely by dibromothymoquinone (DBMIB) and DCMU, inhibitors of noncyclic electron flow. However, the reductants such as dithiothreitol and ascorbate increased the energy storage. It was concluded that photosystem (PS) I may be reduced by some electron donor(s) other than water and that PSII only partially participates in PSI reduction. It is postulated that the role of PSII is to regulate PSI electron transport and prevent its overoxidation. In the presence of high level of malate, photoacoustic spectroscopy indicated a low energy storage which may be due to induction of energy utilization in carbon assimilation...|$|R
40|$|Short-term (4 hours) {{effect of}} {{different}} concentrations of SO 2 fumigation on in vivo photochemical activities of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) leaves was investigated using photoacoustic spectroscopy. The relative quantum yield of O 2 evolution (ratio of O 2 {{signal to the}} photothermal signal) and <b>photochemical</b> energy <b>storage</b> are increased by 0. 05 microliter per liter of SO 2. This increase is more pronounced in 5 to 7 year old saplings than in 3 month old seedlings. Both oxygen-relative quantum yield and energy storage of seedlings are inhibited by increased concentrations of SO 2 and the inhibition is concentration dependent. The inhibition is greater in seedlings than in saplings at 2 microliters per liter of SO 2, indicating the more susceptible nature of seedlings. The present study indicates a concentration dependent differential effect of SO 2 on photochemical activities of sugar maple leaves...|$|R
40|$|Photoacoustic {{spectroscopy}} {{was used}} to monitor Cu damage to photosynthesis by measuring <b>photochemical</b> energy <b>storage</b> (PES) at high frequency of 600 Hz and yield of O 2 evolution (Aox/Apt) at low frequency of 19 Hz in intact leaves of a Cu-tolerant (Silene compacta) and a non-Cu-tolerant (Alyssum montanum) species. The results indicated that Cu affected root growth (RRG), more severely than photoacoustic parameters in both species. Plants of S. compacta grown in lower Cu concentration revealed an enhancement phenomenon on RRG, PES and Aox/Apt, in contrast, plants of A. montanum revealed a slight decrease in the above mentioned parameters. A remarkable decline of PES and Aox/Apt for both species, was observed, at higher Cu concentrations, a fact considered to reflect inhibition of the photsynthetic e- flow in thylakoids. PES was less affected by Cu stress than O 2 evolution showing a differential sensitivity of two photosystems in Cu. Photosystem II (PSII) {{seemed to be more}} sensitive because of degradation and leakage of chloroplasts membranes, inducing a decline in yield of O 2 evolution. On the other hand, PES was appreciable because of cyclic e- transfer around the intact or less inhibited photosystem I (PSI). © 1993. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{conversion}} of norbornadiene to quadricyclane by polychromatic radiation in a solar simulator was investigated. Parameters examined were photosensitizers, reactant and sensitizer concentrations,insolation power, and temperature. The {{rate of conversion}} and the efficiency of solar energy storage were measured and have been quantitatively correlated. The most efficient sensitizers were Michler's ketone, acetophenone, and benzophenone in that order. A mixture of the sensitizers performed worse than the less efficient sensitizer, perhaps due to a mechanism of intersensitizer energy transfer. Data have been obtained by exposing the system to the actual sunlight, and repeated cycles of photochemical conversion and thermal reversion of the reaction were made. The kinetics of the thermal reverse reaction were investigated and presented.

40|$|Preillumination of intact pea {{leaves with}} a strong blue-green light of 400 W m- 2 {{markedly}} inhibited both photoacoustically monitored O 2 -evolution activity and PS II photochemistry as estimated from chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. The aim of the present work was to examine, {{with the help of}} the photoacoustic technique, whether this high-light treatment deteriorated the in vivo PS I function too. High-frequency photoacoustic measurements indicated that photochemical conversion of far-red light energy in PS I was preserved (and even transiently stimulated) whereas <b>photochemical</b> energy <b>storage</b> monitored in light exciting both PS I and PS II was markedly diminished. Low-frequency photoacoustic measurements of the Emerson enhancement showed a spectacular change in the PS II/PS I activity balance in favor of PS I. It was also observed that the linear portion of the saturation curve of the far-red light effect in the Emerson enhancement was not changed by the light treatment. Those results lead to the conclusion that, in contrast to PS II, the in vivo PS I photofunctioning was resistant to strong light stress, thus confirming previous suggestions derived from in vitro studies. Estimation of the redox state of the PS I reaction center by leaf absorbance measurements at ca. 820 nm suggested that, under steady illumination, a considerably larger fraction of PS I centers were in the closed state in high-light pretreated leaves as compared to control leaves, presumably allowing passive adjustment of the macroscopic quantum yield of PS I photochemistry to the strongly reduced photochemical efficiency of photoinhibited PS II. © 1991, Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung.

40|$|The {{effect of}} leaf {{desiccation}} on the photosynthetic activities in vivo was probed by the photoacoustic method. The {{aim of this}} research was: (a) To study the photoacoustic signal per se in varied conditions {{in order to develop}} this tool as a probe for stress conditions in vivo. (b) To obtain results pertaining to electron transport activities in vivo, and confirm conclusions based on work with isolated chloroplasts, which could otherwise be the result of nonspecific damage occurring during their isolation. Leaf discs from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) were routinely used, with other species tested also for comparison. Rapid leaf desiccation caused changes in the low frequency photoacoustic signal, attributed both to the mechanism of signal transduction, influenced by changes in the structural parameters of the leaf, and to the direct (nonstomatal) inhibition of gross photosynthesis. The dependence of the photothermal part of the signal on the frequency indicated the presence of two photothermal components, one of which persisted only at low modulation frequencies (below about 100 Hz) and which largely increased with the desiccation treatment. This component was ascribed to a thermal wave which reaches the leaf surface. The other nonvariable photothermal component was ascribed to a thermal wave propagating from the chloroplasts {{to the surface of the}} mesophyll cell. Only this component is considered in the ratio of the O 2 signal to the photothermal signal, which is used to estimate the quantum yield of photosynthesis. The specific dependence of the latter ratio on the frequency yielded a comparative quantum yield parameter from its extrapolation to zero frequency, and also indicated stress induced changes in the diffusion of O 2 through the mesophyll cell, reflected by changes in its characteristic slope. The (zero frequency extrapolated) quantum yield was markedly reduced with the progression of the water stress, indicating the inhibition of (gross) phototosynthetic electron transport in vivo. This result was expressed even more emphatically by the stronger inhibition of the <b>photochemical</b> energy <b>storage,</b> obtained by photoacoustic measurements at a high modulation frequency...|$|R

The pyridinium electron acceptors are covalently attached to the iridium metal centers (donor) via a three atom hydrocarbon linker bound to the terminal phosphine ligands.

Additional donor-acceptor separations and orientations are available to the compounds in fluid solution through rotations about the Ir-P and linker group C-O, C- N, and C-C bonds. Steady state emission spectra show that the fluoresence and phosphoresence quantum yields in these compounds are substantially reduced relative to a appropriate model complex.
