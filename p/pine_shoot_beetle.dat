In the warmest areas of Sardinia, the dispersal phase of T. destruens immature adults started in late March and showed a single emergence peak in mid May. Conversely, in the mountain area of Tempio Pausania, adult emergence was delayed by one month. In Sardinia, T. destruens completed one generation per year, because also early-emerging adults were unable to oviposit before the beginning of summer.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{chemical}} {{ecology of}} host- and mate-finding in the <b>pine</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>beetles,</b> Tomicus minor and T. piniperda, was studied in southern Sweden. Beetles {{were collected in}} the field from defined attack phases on Scots pine. Using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, a number of oxygen-containing monoterpenes, e. g., 3 -carene- 10 -ol, myrtenol, trans-verbenol, and verbenone, were identified from hindgut extracts of both sexes of both species. Compared to T. minor, T. piniperda contained additional compounds and in larger amounts. The amounts were highest in both species {{at the time when}} the beetles had bored into contact with the resin-producing xylem-phloem tissue. The synthesis of (1 S, 6 R) - 3 -carene- 10 -ol by photooxidation of (+) -(1 S, 6 R) - 3 -carene is described. In comparative electroantennogram (EAG) measurements on males and females of both species, the most active of the tested compounds was trans-verbenol. Laboratory bioassays of walking beetles showed that T. piniperda was attracted to uninfested. Pine logs. T. minor was more strongly attracted to pine logs infested with females than to uninfested pine logs, indicating a female-produced aggregation pheromone. Field tests confirmed that 7 ". piniperda was strongly attracted to pine logs.

Despite its phytosanitary importance, some aspects of the life cycle of this bark beetle are still unclear. In this study, carried out in a pine forest of central Italy, traps baited with (-) -α-pinene were used to monitor adult flight and the wood colonized by the bark beetle was examined in order {{to find out more about}} the life cycle of the beetle and its voltinism. At the study site, the flight of adult beetles for reproduction takes place continuously from autumn to mid-spring of the follow-ing year, with a peak of activity in the middle of autumn. Therefore, a part of the adult beetles, of the developing larvae and of the pupae overwinter under the bark of attacked pines, while a part of the adult population overwinter in the <b>pine</b> <b>shoots.</b> Adult <b>beetles</b> of the new generation emerge from the colonized material during the spring and estivate in the <b>pine</b> <b>shoots.</b> The bark <b>beetles</b> never showed flight activity in summer, nor did adults reproduce on pines at that time.

Experiments with host log baits were done to develop a pest monitoring system using host tree kairomone. Five Yunnan pine logs (each 10 – 15 [*]cm diam. × 30 -cm long) in a trap-log bundle were treated by peeling periderm (outer bark) off to expose the phloem, and half of each log was covered with sticky adhesive to capture any attracted adult beetles.

40|$|International audienceAbstractKey messageThe <b>pine</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tomicus piniperda, is a {{potential}} vector of the pitch canker disease pathogen. The insect could transmit the pathogenic fungus during its maturation or regeneration feeding on the shoots of healthy pine crowns. ContextFusarium circinatum, the causal agent of pitch canker disease, currently affects Pinus radiata in northern Spain, causing pitch-soaked cankers and tree death. Although several species of the family Scolytinae have been reported as vectors of this pathogen, {{the role of the}} <b>pine</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>beetle</b> T. piniperda remains unclear. AimsThe general objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether T. piniperda is a vector for the pitch canker pathogen F. circinatum. For this purpose, Leach’s postulates (1) an association between T. piniperda and trees affected by pitch canker disease; (2) regular visits by T. piniperda to healthy P. radiata trees; (3) presence of the pathogen on the insect in nature; and (4) transmission of the pathogen to disease-free host material under controlled conditions. MethodsFresh green shoots with feeding galleries were collected from the ground, breeding galleries were collected from diseased trunks and insects were collected during their dispersion flights. A laboratory experiment was conducted in which specimens of T. piniperda were inoculated with the pathogen prior to feeding on shoots. ResultsIn the field, T. piniperda was found to be associated with both diseased and healthy P. radiata trees, and F. circinatum was found to be present, at low rates, on the exoskeleton of T. piniperda. In the laboratory experiment, evidence of the ability of T. piniperda to transfer the pathogen to healthy shoots was found. ConclusionsThe study findings indicate T. piniperda as a plausible vector of this pathogen.

40|$|Background: The <b>pine</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>beetle</b> Tomicus yunnanensis (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) is an {{economically}} important pest of Pinus yunnanensis in southwestern China. Developed resistance to insecticides due to chemical pesticides {{being used for}} a long time is a factor involved in its serious damage, which poses a challenge for management. In addition, highly efficient adaptation to divergent environmental ecologies results in this pest posing great potential threat to pine forests. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unknown as only limited nucleotide sequence data for this species is available. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we applied next generation sequencing (Illumina sequencing) to sequence the adult transcriptome of T. yunnanensis. A total of 51, 822, 230 reads were obtained. They were assembled into 140, 702 scaffolds, and 60, 031 unigenes. The unigenes were further functionally annotated with gene descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG). In total, 80, 932 unigenes were classified into GO, 13, 599 unigenes were assigned to COG, and 33, 875 unigenes were found in KO categories. A biochemical pathway database containing 219 predicted pathways was also created based on the annotations. In depth analysis of the data revealed a large number of genes related to insecticides resistance and heat shock protein genes associated with environmental stress.

Twelve Scotch pine, Pinus sylvestris, Christmas trees infested with overwintering T. piniperda beetles were cut in Indiana in early December 1993 and taken to Michigan. Four trees were dissected immediately, while the other 8 trees were taken indoors, placed in tree stands, and watered regularly. After 4 weeks indoors, 4 trees were dissected, and the other 4 were placed outdoors in Michigan for 7 weeks. Upon dissection, all overwintering sites occurred along the lower trunk within the first 40 em of the soil line; 81 % were found within 10 em of the soil line. Adults collected from the 4 trees dissected in December produced viable progeny adults when placed on Scotch pine logs in the laboratory. Overwintering beetles became active and laid eggs in 4 of the 8 trees that had been taken indoors. All adults and progeny found in the 4 trees that had been placed outdoors for 7 weeks during cold January and February temperatures were dead.

Three reference materials GBW 07602 Bush Branches and Leaves, GBW 07604 Poplar Leaves, and SRM 1575 Pine Needles were analysed with every batch of samples to ensure the accuracy and precision of the applied analytical procedures. The use of hydrofluoric acid in the digestion mixture leads to distinctly lower As values (down to 40 %) than actual concentrations in the investigated plant materials.
