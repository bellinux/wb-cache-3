40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of this work is {{to evaluate the use}} of two mix design procedures for designing bituminous pavement mixes with foamed bitumen. Mix design was carried out following the South African and Caltrans guidelines. The RAP materials used for mix design were collected from the NH- 5, Chennai-Tada section. Using foamed bitumen produced from Wirtgen WLB 10 foaming equipment, a mix with RAP material, virgin aggregate and active filler were produced in the <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> <b>mixer.</b> Marshall compaction effort was used for fabricating the samples. Using the indirect tensile strength test on dry and wet specimens, the optimum binder content was determined. It was seen that the two mix design procedure adopted showed different mix constituents despite using the same RAP source...|$|E
40|$|Research {{was done}} into {{identifying}} and sourcing the mechanical equipment required for manufacturing ceramic pot filters, specifically {{for use in}} the Pure Home Water factory in Northern Ghana. The pieces of equipment identified were a hammer <b>mill,</b> a <b>mixer,</b> a <b>pug</b> <b>mill,</b> and a mechanical press with molds for pressing the filters. Evaluative criteria for each machine were developed, and machines available from manufacturers and machines produced locally were evaluated based on these criteria. Several machines fit the evaluative criteria and were recommended for the Pure Home Water facility. The Meadows Model 5 hammer mill was recommended for purchase from the manufacturer. Of the mixers researched, the mixer made by RDI-C, the Bluebird 24 S mixer, and the mixer designed by Prof. Manny Hernandez all satisfy the requirements of Pure Home Water. The <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> recommended for Pure Home Water was the Venco 75 mm <b>pug</b> <b>mill.</b> The Mani Press and the paraboloid molds were also recommended for the Pure Home Water facility. by Julian Getachew.

50|$|Until the end {{of their}} useful life, the methods of {{production}} had not varied from Roman times, all the processes being carried out with no mechanisation or electrification. For example, the clay was always trodden by foot and not mixed in a <b>pug</b> <b>mill.</b> The wheel was turned by an assistant with a pole or handle, and the kilns were wood fired.

50|$|A pugmill or <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> is {{a machine}} in which clay or other {{materials}} are mixed {{into a plastic}} state or a similar machine for the trituration of ore. Industrial applications are found in pottery, bricks, cement and {{some parts of the}} concrete and asphalt mixing processes. A pugmill may be a fast continuous mixer. A continuous pugmill can achieve a thoroughly mixed, homogeneous mixture in a few seconds, and the right machines can be matched to the right application by taking into account the factors of agitation, drive assembly, inlet, discharge, cost and maintenance. Mixing materials at optimum moisture content requires the forced mixing action of the pugmill paddles, while soupy materials might be mixed in a drum mixer. A typical pugmill consists of a horizontal boxlike chamber with a top inlet and a bottom discharge at the other end, 2 shafts with opposing paddles, and a drive assembly. Some of the factors affecting mixing and residence time are the number {{and the size of the}} paddles, paddle swing arc, overlap of left and right swing arc, size of mixing chamber, length of pugmill floor, and material being mixed.|$|R
40|$|Many {{regional}} {{airports in}} Australia are constructed from marginal materials, which {{was appropriate for}} the aircraft operating {{at the time of}} their development. Since then, aircraft operating at regional airports across Australia has grown significantly. Also, the ability to close pavements for rehabilitation or upgrades works has significantly reduced across all airports. This has led to foamed bitumen stabilisation becoming a more attractive option for pavement improvement when compared to traditional methods of granular reconstruction, deep asphalt reconstruction or cement stabilisation. Three recent projects at Australian airports have utilised foamed bitumen stabilisation to achieve a range of goals. This technology has been employed insitu and exsitu. Exsitu works have utilised both on-and off-site <b>pug</b> <b>mills.</b> Foamed bitumen stabilisation has been employed to improve existing marginal pavement material as well as new fine crushed rock. The three recent projects have shown that almost any marginal material's properties can be significantly improved through foamed bitumen stabilisation and that foam stabilised layers make adequate temporary wearing surfaces for light aircraft traffic. Foamed bitumen stabilised material can be trafficked immediately after construction and is resistant to moisture during and after construction. In light of the significant regional airport upgrade demand in Australia in the coming years, foamed bitumen stabilisation is expected to gain popularity and may become the rehabilitation treatment of choice for Australian airports...|$|R
30|$|Ball milling {{procedures}} are {{often referred to}} as “milling at room temperature” [9, 10]. This term should be used carefully, as even within short milling times a temperature increase can be observed, if there are no precautions for temperature control. For example, it was shown that <b>milling</b> in a <b>mixer</b> ball <b>mill</b> (MBM) for 10  min with two milling balls in a 10  ml beaker raised the temperature from 25 to 30  °C, and Colacino and co-workers measured a temperature increase of approximately 14  K after 30  min milling in an MM 200 <b>mixer</b> <b>mill</b> [6, 11]. McKissic et al. observed a temperature of 50  °C after 1  h milling in a Spex <b>mixer</b> <b>mill</b> and Takacs and McHenry reported milling ball temperatures of 66  °C [12, 13]. Comparably higher temperatures can be reached in planetary ball mills (PBMs), where temperatures from 60 to 600  °C can be measured, {{depending on the type of}} PBM, the grinding stock, the grinding material and the filling degree [5, 13, 14].|$|R

40|$|Alumino-silicate {{fireclay}} material was {{found within the}} equatorial region of Ekiti state of Nigeria. From Ijero-Ekiti, fireclay samples were explored, exploited and developed into automobile brake pads. Eight samples were taken from 5 to 30 metres downward at various pits to prevent unwanted foreign materials. Specifically, these samples were examined and found to be characteristically homogeneous in physical, mechanical, mineralogical and chemical composition. 30 per cent of the unwanted foreign materials from the fireclay were technically removed with above 45 micron sieve using a wet sieving method. 70 per cent of the purified clay of less than 45 micron sieve was eventually used as beneficiated {{fireclay material}}. After the purification, sample clay obtained was finally calcined at 15000 C temperature for clay structural stability and prevention of excessive clay shrinkage.

40|$|AbstractThis study evaluates {{maintenance}} treatment followed by different Districts of New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT). In addition, two case {{studies on the}} use of old pavement materials, called the “millings”, in maintenance projects are reported. Based on this study, it is observed that none of the Districts have a written procedure for maintenance work. Rather Districts rely on the experience of the maintenance crew for conducting maintenance projects. All Districts prefer to use chip seal for maintenance irrespective of distress conditions of the pavements. Patching and crack sealing are usually done before chip sealing to extend the life of the chip seals. Sand seal, scrub seal, and slurry seal projects are not done by District maintenance crews but by outside contractors. It is also observed that all Districts are interested in using millings in maintenance projects and most have already used millings in at least one maintenance project with some success and failure. Most of the Districts have used coarse fraction of millings in chip seal projects successfully. However, they failed to find a proper way to process the fine fractions of millings. Case Study I shows that fine millings can be used to construct thin overlay when mixed with emulsion in <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> or hot drums.

40|$|This {{research}} program {{was based on}} laboratory and field studies. All work {{was limited to the}} use of a 10 -mesh crumb rubber in the dry process. An evaluation of the asphalt-rubber interactions indicated {{that there should be a}} reasonable level of interaction between the crumb rubber and the asphalt cement selected for the project. A suggested criterion for defining an acceptable level of interaction would be to establish a minimum viscosity of 15 Poise (Brookfield viscosity) for a neat asphalt cement modified with 20 percent crumb rubber. When designing a crumb rubber modified mixture, the aggregate gradation should be substantially gapped. The target gradation used in the construction of the Babbit, Minnesota test sections should be considered as a guideline for an acceptable gapped gradation. Stockpile gradations should be adjusted for crumb rubber gradations volumetrically; generally, 1 gram of crumb rubber occupies the same volume as 3 grams of aggregate for a given sieve size. The optimum asphalt content for CRM mixtures should be based on air voids from 1. 5 to 3 percent. During construction, the crumb rubber (supplied in 50 Ibs. bags) should be added through the recycled asphalt (RAP) hopper (drum plant) or directly into the <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> (batch plant). Laydown and compaction procedures should proceed as usual. Use of vibration on the rollers should be used at the discretion of the field engineer. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R
40|$|Adenylate energy charge (AEC) {{has been}} used as a {{practical}} index of the physiological status and health in several disciplines, such as ecotoxicology and aquaculture. This study standardizes several procedures for AEC determination in penaeid shrimp that are very sensitive to sampling. We concluded that shrimp can be frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at - 76 °C for up to two years for further analysis, or freshly dissected and immediately homogenized in acid. Other cooling procedures, such as immersion in cold water or placing shrimp on ice for 15 min resulted in 50 % and 73 % decreases in ATP levels, and 9 -fold and 10 -fold increases in IMP levels, respectively. Optimal values of AEC (0. 9) were obtained in shrimp recently transferred from ponds to indoor conditions, but decreased to 0. 77 after one month in indoor tanks when stocked at high densities; the AEC re-established to 0. 85 when the shrimps were transferred to optimal conditions (lower density and dark tanks). While the levels of arginine phosphate followed the same pattern, its levels did not fully re-establish.

Carbon nanotubes injection methods in the form of suspension in polar (acetone, cyclohexanone, butanol- 1, ethyl cellosolve) and non-polar (o-dimethylbenzene) solvents for alkyd primers and in the form of suspension in Р - 5 А solvent and curing agent for epoxy primer were examined. In all cases the carbon nanotubes suspension in curing agent and solvent was produced by previous dispersion in cell ultrasonic bath during 15 minutes with further mixture during 20 minutes on laboratory dissolver with <b>milling</b> <b>mixer.</b> The investigation showed that modification of the alkyd primer Belakor with carbon nanotubes suspension in polar solvents increases primer properties to a greater degree than carbon nanotubes suspension in non-polar solvents. For epoxy primers it was determined that modification with carbon nanotubes suspension in solvents is more effective than in curing agent. The modification of epoxy primer with carbon nanotubes suspension in curing agent decreases coating properties in many cases, probably because of functional groups adsorption on the surface of carbon nanotubes, which results in under-cured coatings; it can be seen from decreasing hardness, and consequently, protection properties...|$|R

30|$|Each {{sample was}} placed in a <b>mill</b> <b>mixer,</b> blended with water that had the same weight as the sample, and then {{compressed}} or centrifuged, which allowed the estimation of the level of and tendency toward water absorption and release in the mouth during food intake. The rate of increase in weight was used as an indicator of tendency for water absorption or release. When the ingredients tested were divided into the high water release, intermediate and high absorption groups, the rate of increase in weight was lowest in the high water release group, followed by the intermediate group, and highest in the high absorption group, regardless of whether the samples were chewed, mechanically compressed, or centrifuged. Ingredients in the high water release group can cause choking and aspiration due to water release in the mouth, while those in the high absorption group are difficult to swallow and will likely remain in the mouth due to absorption of saliva, and those in the intermediate group can be assessed as relatively adequate for swallowing with adequate water release. The method for measuring the rate of increase in weight {{used in the present study}} is considered to allow for proper evaluation of ease of swallowing, in particular water behavior in the mouth, including release of water from food and absorption of water into food during mastication and swallowing, by classifying food into high water release, intermediate, and high absorption groups based on their characteristics.|$|R

There was a major breakthrough in 1990, and since then, with significant support from DOE-PETC, the technology has progressed from the conceptual stage to a proven laboratory process. It is a simple process which involves the addition of a low cost specifically formulated reagent to wet fine coal by mixing the two in a <b>pug</b> <b>mill.</b> Although the converted material (Mulled Coal) retains some of its original surface moisture, it handles, transports, and stores like dry coal. But, unlike thermally dried fine coal Mulled Coal is not dusty, it will not rewet, and it causes no fugitive dust problems. This project was designed to advance the technology from the status of a process which works well in the laboratory to the status of a technology which is fully ready for commercialization. Project objectives were to: 1. Prove the concept that the technology can be used to produce Mulled Coal of a consistent quality, on a continuous basis, at a convincing rate of production, and at a major preparation plant which produces fine clean coal on a commercial basis. 2. Prove the concept that Mulled Coal, either as a blend with coarser clean coal or as a stand-alone fuel will successfully pass through a representative cross section of conventional coal storage, handling and transportation environments without causing any of the problems normally associated with wet fine coal. 3 Test the design and reliability of Mulled Coal circuit equipment and controls. 4.
