25|$|<b>Post-{{combustion}}</b> capture – This {{refers to}} capture of CO2 from exhaust gases of combustion processes, typically using sorbents, solvents, or membrane separations to remove CO2 from the bulk gases.|$|E
25|$|MOFs {{could be}} {{employed}} {{in each of the}} main three carbon capture configurations for coal-fired power plants: pre-combustion, post-combusiton, and oxy-combustion. However, since the <b>post-combustion</b> configuration {{is the only one that}} can be retrofitted to existing plants, it garners the most interest and research. In <b>post-combustion</b> carbon capture, the flue gas from the power plant would be fed through a MOF in a packed-bed reactor setup. Flue gas is generally 40 to 60°C with a partial pressure of CO2 at 0.13 - 0.16 bar. The main component CO2 must be separated from is nitrogen, but there are small amounts of other gasses as well. A typical flue gas composition is: 73-77% N2, 15-16% CO2, 5-7% H2O, 3-4% O2, 800 ppm SO2, 10 ppm SO3, 500 ppm NOX, 100 ppm HCl, 20 ppm CO, 10 ppm hydrocarbons, 1ppb Hg.|$|E
25|$|In Jänschwalde, Germany, a plan is in {{the works}} for an Oxyfuel boiler, rated at 650 thermal MW (around 250 {{electric}} MW), which is about 20 times more than Vattenfall's 30 MW pilot plant under construction, and compares to today's largest Oxyfuel test rigs of 0.5 MW. <b>Post-combustion</b> capture technology will also be demonstrated at Jänschwalde.|$|E
25|$|Pre-combustion CO2 removal is {{much easier}} than CO2 removal from flue gas in <b>post-combustion</b> capture due to the high {{concentration}} of CO2 after the water-gas-shift reaction and the high pressure of the syngas. During pre-combustion in IGCC, the partial pressure of CO2 is nearly 1000 times higher than in <b>post-combustion</b> flue gas. Due to the high concentration of CO2 pre-combustion, physical solvents, such as Selexol and Rectisol, are preferred {{for the removal of}} CO2 vs that of chemical solvents. Physical solvents work by absorbing the acid gases without the need of a chemical reaction as in traditional amine based solvents. The solvent can then be regenerated, and the CO2 desorbed, by reducing the pressure. The biggest obstacle with physical solvents is the need for the syngas to be cooled before separation and reheated afterwards for combustion. This requires energy and decreases overall plant efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The Saskatchewan Government's Boundary Dam Power Station Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project {{will use}} <b>post-combustion,</b> amine-based {{scrubber}} technology to capture 90% of the CO2 emitted by Unit 3 {{of the power}} plant; this CO2 will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields. However, only about a half of this CO2 will actually be permanently stored, the remainder is released into the atmosphere during capturing, and the processing in the oil field.|$|E
25|$|The Petra Nova {{project is}} a billion dollar {{endeavour}} taken upon by NRG Energy and JP Nippon to retrofit their jointly owned W.A Parish coal-fired power plant with <b>post-combustion</b> carbon capture. The plant, which is located in Thompsons, Texas (just outside of Houston), entered commercial service in 1977, and carbon capture began operation on January 10, 2017. The plant generates 240 MW and 90% of the CO2 (or 1.4 million tonnes) is captured per year. The carbon dioxide captured (99% purity) from the power plant is compressed and piped about 82 miles to West Ranch Oil Field, Texas, {{where it will be}} used for enhanced oil recovery. The field has a capacity of 60 million barrels of oil and is expected to increase oil production by a factor of 506. This project is expected to run for at least another 20 years.|$|E
25|$|CO2 {{can bind to}} the MOF surface through either {{physisorption}} or chemisorption, where physisorption occurs through van der Waals {{interactions and}} chemisorption occurs through covalent bonds being formed between the CO2 and MOF surface. Once the MOF is saturated with CO2, the MOF would then be regenerated (CO2 {{is removed from the}} MOF to be transported elsewhere for sequestration or enhanced oil recovery) through either a temperature swing or a pressure swing. In a temperature swing, the MOF would be heated up until CO2 desorbs; temperature swing regeneration is usually used in <b>post-combustion</b> configurations where the heat is supplied from heat exchangers with the power plant. To achieve working capacities comparable to the amine solvent process, the MOF must be heated up to around 200 C. In a pressure swing, the pressure would be decreased until CO2 desorbs; this would usually be used in a pre-combustion carbon capture configuration.|$|E
25|$|Cremation {{of bodies}} {{containing}} amalgam restorations results in near-complete emission of the mercury into the atmosphere, {{as the temperature}} in cremation is far greater than the boiling point of mercury. In countries with high cremation rates (such as the UK), mercury has become a great concern. Proposals to remedy the situation have ranged from removing amalgam-containing teeth prior to cremation to installing activated carbon adsorption or other <b>post-combustion</b> mercury capture technology in the flue gas stream. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, {{it is estimated that}} globally about 3.6 tonnes of mercury vapor was emitted into the air through cremation in 2010, or about 1% of total global emissions. Mercury emissions from cremation are growing in the US, both because cremation rates are increasing and because the number of teeth in the deceased are increasing due to better dental care. Since amalgam restorations are very durable and relatively inexpensive, many of the older deceased have amalgam restorations. According to work done in Great Britain, mercury emissions from cremation are expected to increase until at least 2020.|$|E

2500|$|Well-established {{types of}} [...] capture, such as {{pre-combustion}} and <b>post-combustion</b> capture from large point sources, {{are able to}} reduce {{the rate of increase}} of atmospheric [...] concentration. But to actually reduce this concentration, the direct removal of [...] from the air is required. This process is called “direct air capture” (DAC).|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} of the United Kingdom launched a first tender process for a CCS demonstration project in 2007. The project were to use <b>post-combustion</b> technology on coal-fired power generation at 300–400megawatts or equivalent. The project aimed to be operational by 2014. The Government announced in June 2008 that four companies had pre-qualified for the [...] competition: BP Alternative Energy International Limited, EON UK Plc, Peel Power Limited and Scottish Power Generation Limited. BP subsequently withdrew from the competition, claiming it {{could not find a}} power generator partner, and RWE npower sought a judicial review of the process after it did not qualify. This first CCS tender was cancelled in late 2011 when government could not reach agreement with the ScottishPower/Shell/National Grid consortium on terms and cost, for the project based on retrofitting the existing Longannet coal-fired power station in Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|Led by the provincially owned utility, SaskPower, {{one of the}} world's {{first and}} largest full {{production}} carbon capture facilities is operating at the coal fired Boundary Dam Power Station. With an initial investment of $1.5 to $1.6 billion. Of the 90% of CO2 emissions captured, about a half {{of this will be}} sold and permanently sequestered in enhanced oil recovery. The remainder is released into the atmosphere during capturing, and processing in the oil field. The project started in May 2011 and became operational in October 2014. The <b>post-combustion</b> full flue gas capture process was to capture 1 million tonnes of [...] a year. Since opening serious design issues were found in the carbon capture system, resulting in maintenance problems that led to operating only 40% of the time. In 2016 the contracts to sell CO2 were renegotiated to reflect the reduced sales.|$|E
2500|$|In {{oxy-fuel}} combustion the fuel is burned in oxygen instead of air. To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and {{injected into the}} combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored. Power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "zero emission" [...] cycles, because the [...] stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream (as in the cases of pre- and <b>post-combustion</b> capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A certain fraction of the [...] generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water. To warrant the label [...] "zero emission" [...] the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately. The technique is promising, but the initial air separation step demands a lot of energy.|$|E

50|$|The main {{technology}} for CO2 capture from biotic sources generally employs {{the same technology}} as carbon dioxide capture from conventional fossil fuel sources. Broadly, three different types of technologies exist: <b>post-combustion,</b> pre-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion.|$|E
50|$|Significant {{uncertainty}} exists {{around the}} total cost of <b>post-combustion</b> CO2 capture because full-scale demonstrations of the technology have yet to come online. Thus, individual performance metrics are generally relied upon when comparisons are made between different adsorbents.|$|E

50|$|The lance {{used for}} blowing has {{undergone}} changes. Slagless lances, {{with a long}} tapering copper tip, have been employed to avoid jamming of the lance during blowing. <b>Post-combustion</b> lance tips burn the CO generated during blowing into CO2 and provide additional heat. For slag-free tapping, darts, refractory balls and slag detectors are employed. Modern converters are fully automated with auto blowing patterns and sophisticated control systems.|$|E

Final technical, environmental, and financial challenges associated with new advanced coal technologies are overcome during full-scale testing so the technologies {{are ready for}} commercial deployment. The demonstrated technologies fall under four CO2 capture pathways, each followed by CO2 storage: pre-combustion, <b>post-combustion,</b> oxy-combustion, and industrial carbon capture and storage.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} to using concentrated piperazine (CPZ) as an additive had been confirmed through, for example, three pilot plants in Australia that are operated by CSIRO. This program was launched to explore remedies {{to the high}} costs of <b>post-combustion</b> carbon capture, and the results were positive. Using CPZ, which is more reactive and thermally stable than standard MEA solutions, capital and compression (energy) costs were lowered through size reductions in absorber columns and solvent regeneration at higher temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|Completed in January 2017, the <b>post-combustion</b> Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project became largest {{installed}} on an existing {{power plant in}} the world. [...] The system pumps 1.6 million tons of filtered CO2 from unit 8 to the West Ranch Oil Field 82 miles away in Jackson County. Overall as the system is powered by natural gas {{it will have a}} net effect of not releasing 785,000 tons of carbon annually. The system cost approximately $1 billion.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Post-combustion</b> capture {{refers to}} the removal of CO2 from power station flue gas prior to its compression, {{transportation}} and storage in suitable geological formations, as part of carbon capture and storage. A number of different techniques are applicable, almost {{all of which are}} adaptations of acid gas removal processes used in the chemical and petrochemical industries. Many of these techniques existed before World War II and, consequently, post combustion capture is the most developed of the various carbon-capture methodologies.|$|E
50|$|The CSIRO (Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) and its Chinese {{partners}} Huaneng Group and the Thermal Power Research Institute (TPRI) have officially {{launched a}} <b>post-combustion</b> capture (PCC) pilot plant in Beijing that strips carbon dioxide from power station flue gases {{in an effort}} to stem climate change.The project represents another first for the CSIRO PCC program - the first capture of carbon dioxide in China using a PCC pilot plant. It begins the process of applying the technology to Chinese conditions and evaluating its effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|A MOF {{could be}} {{specifically}} designed {{to act like a}} CO2 removal agent in <b>post-combustion</b> power plants. In this scenario, the flue gas would pass through a bed packed with a MOF material, where CO2 would be stripped. After saturation is reached, CO2 could be desorbed by doing a pressure or temperature swing. Carbon dioxide could then be compressed to supercritical conditions in order to be stored underground or utilized in enhanced oil recovery processes. However, this is not possible in large scale yet due to several difficulties, one of those being the production of MOFs in great quantities.|$|E
50|$|However, {{existing}} {{power plants}} require the <b>post-combustion</b> separation of CO2 from the flue gas with a scrubber. In such a system, fossil fuels are combusted with air and CO2 is selectively {{removed from a}} gas mixture also containing N2, H2O, O2 and trace sulphur, nitrogen and metal impurities. While exact separation conditions are fuel and technology dependent, in general CO2 is present at low concentrations (4-15% v/v) in gas mixtures near atmospheric pressure and at temperatures of approximately 40-60 °C. Sorbents for carbon capture are regenerated using temperature, pressure or vacuum, so that CO2 can be collected for sequestration or utilization and the sorbent can be reused.|$|E
