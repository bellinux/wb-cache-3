2500|$|He {{began writing}} his {{biography}} of Percy Shelley in 1845 corresponding with {{relatives and friends}} in England, including Percy Florence Shelley, the poet's son, and in 1846 he requested information from Mary Shelley. She was not co-operative, wishing to hinder {{the publication of a}} Shelley biography by Thomas Medwin and claiming that Medwin had attempted to bribe her for the sum of £250. The work took two years to conclude, appearing in September 1847. It was not a coolly dispassionate account of Shelley's life. It is passionate, opinionated with attacks on Medwin's personal enemies. There are numerous errors in date, fact and quotation, some of the later outright bowdlerising. (Most of these errors were removed by Harry Buxton Forman in 1913) [...] Whatever its manifest faults, it remains a major source for those interested in studying the poet's early life and work. Medwin is the main <b>provider</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on the childhood of Shelley, a major source of information of the events of 1821–1822 and a mine of personal recollections. It was also the major source of knowledge in Germany of Shelley's life and work. Shelley had become in the years since his death something of a divisive figure so criticism was to be expected. Medwin's biography duly came in for a withering attack in [...] The Athenaeum which opened thunderously its review [...] "We are not in any way satisfied with this book." [...] "The Spectator" [...] wrote 'Medwin's labours [...]. are chiefly remarkable for the art of stuffing [...]. nor does the author forget a scandal when he can pick any up'. Medwin was even more reviled by the remaining members of the Pisan circle. Mary Shelley's reaction was as expected given her antipathy towards him but Trelawney was equally cutting describing the work as 'superficial' as late as 1870 However, it was received better by some critics, including William Howitt and W. Harrison Ainsworth, who began their review in Howitt's Journal [...] with [...] "it could not possibly have fallen into more competent hands." ...|$|E
