5|$|On Baldwin's {{death the}} castle was {{inherited}} by his daughter, Adeliza, {{but the family}} appear to have taken {{little interest in the}} property. Okehampton Castle {{does not seem to have}} <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in the civil war from 1139 and 1153 known as the Anarchy.|$|E
5|$|Although England trailed behind other European {{powers in}} {{establishing}} overseas colonies, {{it had been}} engaged during the 16th century in the settlement of Ireland with Protestants from England and Scotland, drawing on precedents {{dating back to the}} Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. Several people who helped establish the Plantations of Ireland also <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the West Country men.|$|E

5|$|An {{expedition}} to Ross by King William {{and his brother}} Earl David in 1179 may have been related to Harald's activities. Two years later the rebellion of Domnall, son of Máel Coluim mac Uilleim, broke out in Ross and Moray, and it is presumed that Earl Harald <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in this. The rebellion was not finally suppressed until 1187.|$|E
5|$|Battleships <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> {{in major}} engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theaters; in the Atlantic, the Germans used their battleships as {{independent}} commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little strategic importance. The Battle of the Atlantic was fought between destroyers and submarines, {{and most of}} the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the genetic}} {{strength}} of the desert-bred Arabian horse, Arabian bloodlines have <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> {{in the development of}} nearly every modern light horse breed, including the Thoroughbred, Orlov Trotter, Morgan, American Saddlebred, American Quarter Horse, and Warmblood breeds such as the Trakehner. Arabian bloodlines have also influenced the development of the Welsh Pony, the Australian Stock Horse, Percheron draft horse, Appaloosa, and the Colorado Ranger Horse.|$|E

It was later reported, but not confirmed, that he published his pieces in newspapers and magazines of diverse backgrounds—Le Figaro, Le Gaulois, Gil Blas, L'Intransigeant and La Libre Parole among them. A lover and protector of actresses in both France and Switzerland, he also claimed to have <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in staging the first Genevan showing of Richard Wagner's Die Walküre.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva had <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in uncovering the conspiracy, {{perhaps in a}} fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, Presque Isle <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in {{the victory}} over the British in the Battle of Lake Erie. Oliver Hazard Perry, {{commander}} of the American fleet, made strategic use of the bay {{as a place to}} construct six of the nine ships in his fleet. Using this location protected the men by creating an obstacle, forcing potential attackers to circumnavigate the peninsula to reach them.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, his son Pierre Bouchard, also a defenceman, {{played for}} the Montreal Canadiens.

With Butch's four and Pierre's five they have the distinction of winning the most Stanley Cups of any father-son combination in NHL history.

5|$|In {{the early}} 9th century, Leo V reintroduced {{the policy of}} iconoclasm, but in 843 empress Theodora {{restored}} the veneration of icons {{with the help of}} Patriarch Methodios.

During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 the town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel Duke of Monmouth. Bridges Almshouses were built around 1685 and may have been for the widows of those killed in the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 World Championship was {{the final}} IndyCar race for Davey Hamilton, Alex Lloyd, Vitor Meira, Danica Patrick, Buddy Rice, Tomas Scheckter, and Paul Tracy.

For others Wheldon's crash <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in the {{decision}} to retire or move onto other forms of racing.

5|$|Throughout the 17th century Plymouth had {{gradually}} {{lost its}} pre-eminence as a trading port. By the mid-17th century, commodities manufactured elsewhere in England {{cost too much}} to transport to Plymouth, and the city had no means of processing sugar or tobacco imports, major products from the colonies.

5|$|After {{an early}} spell at Tavelsjö IK, Blomqvist signed for then {{recently}} formed Umeå FC in 1992. In the spring {{portion of his}} first season for the club, he helped them to the Division 2 Norra Norrland title, promoting the club to Division 1 Norra for the autumn. At the time {{this was the second}} tier of Swedish football. Subsequently, he signed for IFK Göteborg on 11 September 1993. Blomqvist <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in the club's Allsvenskan win that year. He scored eight goals in 24 league appearances en route to the league title in 1994. Furthermore, he <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> in Sweden's advance to the semi finals of the World Cup and scored in the club's 3–1 win over Manchester United in the Champions League, knocking them out of the competition. This performance caught the eye of United manager Alex Ferguson and helped the team qualify for the quarter-finals of the tournament. Another title followed in 1995, with Blomqvist's goal against Helsingborgs IF, when he performed a variant of the Pelé runaround move, voted goal of the season. In his last season for Göteborg, he played against former club Umeå, who had reached the Allsvenskan {{for the first time in}} their history. In 1996, Blomqvist was voted Fan's Player of the Year and Midfielder of the Year. At the end of the 1996 season, he signed for newly crowned Serie A champions Milan.|$|E
