40|$|Part 4 : Biometric ApplicationsInternational audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} lip print comparison and recognition. In the first stage the appropriate lip print features are extracted. Lip prints can be captured by police departments. Traces from lips may also found at a crime scene. The approach uses the well known DTW algorithm and Copeland vote counting method. Tests were conducted on 120 lip print images. The results obtained are very promising and suggest that the proposed recognition method can be introduced into <b>professional</b> forensic <b>identification</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{explaining}} how communication quality predicts TMS in multidisciplinary teams, we {{drew on the}} social identity approach to investigate the mediating role of team identification and the moderating role of <b>professional</b> <b>identification.</b> Recognizing that <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> could trigger intergroup biases among professional subgroups, or alternatively, could bring resources to the team, we explored the potential moderating role of <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> {{in the relationship between}} team identification and TMS. Using data collected from 882 healthcare personnel working in 126 multidisciplinary hospital teams, results supported our hypothesis that perceived communication quality predicted TMS through team identification. Furthermore, findings provided support for a resource view of professional subgroup identities with results indicating that high levels of <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> compensated for low levels of team identification in predicting TMS. We provide recommendations on how social identities may be used to promote TMS in multidisciplinary teams...|$|R

50|$|For over 50 years, {{researchers}} have studied whether professional employees' social identities influence their work behaviors. David R.

40|$|ABSTRACT Based on the {{principles}} of the Social Identity Theory this qualitative study examined how organisational <b>identification</b> and <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> relate to each other in times of an organisational merger. To understand the relationship between these two constructs this study focussed on the perceptions of academic staff members of a post-merger South African university. The method of research consisted of a combination of semi-structured interviews, a focus group session and document analyses. The most striking result is that for most of the academic staff members who have experienced a decrease in organisational identification {{as a direct result of}} the merger, their focus of identification has shifted towards their profession. In other words, their <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> is enhanced as a result of a decrease in organisational identification. This decrease in organisational identification can be explained by the negative influences of perceived pre-merger status differences and dominance. However, it appears that the amount of identification that is needed to legitimate the effort one puts into a job needs to come from some form of identification; either organisational <b>identification</b> or <b>professional</b> <b>identification.</b> Previous research only focussed on the influence of an increase in organisational <b>identification</b> on <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> and vice versa. What is renewing about the results of this study is the fact that <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> can even compensate for a decrease in organisational identification as well...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} when professional employees reciprocate perceived organizational treat-ment. In a large sample of physician employees, {{the association between}} perceived organizational support (POS) and employee work performance was (1) most positive when organizational identification was high and <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> was low and (2) least positive when organizational identification was low and <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> was high. We {{also found that the}} association between perceived psycho-logical contract violation (PPCV) and employee work performance was (1) most neg-ative when organizational identification was low and <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> was high and (2) least negative when organizational identification was high and profes-sional identification was low. Social exchange theory regards exchanges be-tween organization members that involve obliga-tions that are unspecified and implicit—and hence are “social, ” as opposed to economic, in nature (Blau, 1964; Emerson, 1972).

40|$|With the {{development}} of voice transformation and speech synthesis technologies, speaker <b>identification</b> <b>systems</b> are likely to face attacks from imposters who use voice transformed or synthesized speech to mimic a particular speaker. Therefore, we investigated in this paper how speaker <b>identification</b> <b>systems</b> perform on voice transformed speech. We conducted experiments with two different approaches, the classical GMM-based speaker <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> and the Phonetic speaker <b>identification</b> <b>system.</b> Our experimental results showed that current standard voice transformation techniques are able to fool the GMM-based system but not the Phonetic speaker <b>identification</b> <b>system.</b> These findings imply that future speaker <b>identification</b> <b>systems</b> should include idiosyncratic knowledge in order to successfully distinguish transformed speech from natural speech and thus be armed against imposter attacks...|$|R

40|$|Based on career {{construction}} theory, the {{predictors of}} human resource managers' strategic {{competence in the}} Chinese context were examined. Results from a survey administered to Chinese HR managers (N = 220) showed that <b>professional</b> <b>identification,</b> career variety and organizational support for strategic human resource management positively predicted Chinese human resource managers' strategic competence. In addition, career adaptability served as a significant mediator for the above relations. The results further showed {{that the effect of}} <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> on career adaptability was stronger among employees who perceived a higher (vs. lower) level of organizational support for strategic human resource management. The corresponding moderated mediation model was also supported such that the indirect effect of <b>professional</b> <b>identification</b> on strategic competence was stronger among employees who perceived a higher (vs. lower) level of organizational support for strategic human resource management. These findings carry implications for career construction theory and human resource managers' career development in China...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{effective}} national <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> is {{a necessity}} in any national government for the proper implementation and execution of its governmental policies and duties. This thesis aims at restructuring Nigeria national <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> {{so as to make}} it effective in addressing its political and civil problems, which ranges from manipulated census count figures and electoral fraud to economic fraud and civil problems. These problems are arguably due to Nigeria’s ineffective national <b>identification</b> <b>system.</b> We proposed in this thesis, a restructured Nigeria national <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> to help address these political and civil problems. The proposed <b>identification</b> <b>system</b> is designed such that it will help to address identification problems in general, reduce elections and census count fraud to a minimum and be useful for the execution of policies in sectors of the economy...|$|R
