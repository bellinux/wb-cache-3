5|$|Plymouth Argyle {{came close}} to making their opponents pay for their profligacy in front of goal with Evans lifting a volley over the crossbar. Darlington's captain Andy Crosby was <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{formidable}} figure {{at the heart of}} his team's defence, but Argyle fashioned another chance to open the scoring just before half-time. A flick on by Evans presented Adrian Littlejohn with the opportunity to redeem his earlier miss, but he dragged his shot wide.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl {{was portrayed}} by Dutch actress Carice van Houten in Race, a sports drama film {{directed}} by Stephen Hopkins about Jesse Owens. It {{was released in}} North America on February 19, 2016. To make her sympathetic portrayal acceptable to an American audience, the film dramatizes her quarrels with Goebbels over her direction of the film, Olympia, especially about filming the African American star who is <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> politically embarrassing refutation of Nazi Germany's claims of Aryan athletic supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{continues}} with Liz's love advice <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> disaster {{for most of}} her male co-workers, while she meets someone who could be her love interest (Michael Sheen), despite being reluctant about it. She also attempts to buy an apartment located above hers. Meanwhile, Jack falls for two women and is forced to choose one of them - his high school sweetheart (Julianne Moore), or someone who is similarly successful as him (Elizabeth Banks) while trying to impress the Kabletown executives.|$|E

5|$|Serbia's strongest {{exports to}} the United States include Fiat {{automobiles}} manufactured in Kragujevac. Fiat purchased Zastava Automobili in 2008 and subsequently managed the factory in Kragujevac {{so that it would}} produce new Fiat automobiles as opposed to Zastava models (the last Zastavas were produced in 2008); in May 2013 alone, 3,000 Fiat 500L units were shipped from Serbia to Baltimore for sale in the United States. The Fiat 500L is the first automobile to have been exported from Serbia to the United States since the Zastava Koral before 1992, and is <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> popular model with a large amount of advertising in the United States. Serbia is also the largest exporter of raspberries in the world (as of 2009), and much of the raspberries consumed in the United States are grown in Šumadija. In 2015, the two states discussed to find ways to increase investments in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved {{on toward the}} northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost parallel to the Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great scare for its residents as it reminded many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large number of farms in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his farmstead, leaving {{his wife and son}} gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and farms {{in the vicinity of the}} hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into Barron County, where the farming community of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord went {{straight}} to the Group stage of the Champions League after finishing second in the Eredivisie but were eliminated after only winning one game, and finishing six points behind Sparta Prague, and were consequently drawn against SC Freiburg of Germany in the third round of the UEFA Cup. Feyenoord won the first leg 1–0, after a late goal from Shinji Ono. The second leg was drawn 2–2, however Feyenoord came close to going out, as Freiburg took a 2–0 lead on 49 minutes with goals from Sebastian Kehl and Levan Kobiashvili, to make the aggregate score 2–1 in Freiburg's favour. But on 57 minutes, Pierre van Hooijdonk pulled a goal back, to make it 2–2 on aggregate, which would see Feyenoord going through due to the away goal rule. Feyenoord secured their place in the fourth round when Leonardo scored in the 86th minute. Feyenoord faced Rangers of Scotland in the fourth round with the tie <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> close affair. The first leg ended 1–1, in Glasgow, Feyenoord had gone ahead on seventy two minutes through Shinji Ono, but Rangers equalised after Peter Løvenkrands was brought down by Glenn Loovens on 81 minutes. Barry Ferguson scored the subsequent penalty. The second leg in Rotterdam ended 3–2 in Feyenoord's favor, the match was notable for the sending off of one player on each side Patrick Paauwe for Feyenoord and Neil McCann for Rangers.|$|E

25|$|As usual, Ćorluka {{consistently}} found {{a starting}} spot for his {{side in the}} Premier League. Despite a nightmare blunder during his side's shocking 6–0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, he remained strong during his first season in England as his side finished ninth {{in the league and}} gained entry to a UEFA Cup qualifying round via the UEFA fair play ranking. On few rare occasions, he was also used as a defensive midfielder during the season, <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor for opposing attackers.|$|E

In March 1995, he began a segment making editorial comment on the Nine Network's Today breakfast show. Jones continued to present this 7.15am editorial on Today until it was eventually cancelled in June 2007.|$|E

25|$|While the Lavi {{project had}} been {{terminated}} without any production aircraft being produced, the development represented an important opportunity to demonstrate and advance {{the capabilities of}} Israel's aerospace industry. Many of the aircraft's subsystems, avionics, and components went on to be developed and made commercially available, fueling defense export sales and <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lucrative business in its own right. The EL/M-2032 pulse doppler radar, which had originally been developed for use on the Lavi is one such example; it has since been exported and equipped upon {{a wide range of}} operational aircraft.|$|E

Inspired by Mortimer and led by Test captain George Peponis, the Bulldogs disposed of Cronulla, Wests and Parramatta to make the Finals with some of Mortimer's tries leaving the public in awe of his genius. St George won the Grand Final 17-13 with the Bulldogs staging a great second half comeback after being down 17-2 at the break.|$|E
25|$|Again, Staunton {{played in}} every Republic of Ireland {{game of the}} tournament, with the 1–1 group match draw against Germany on 5 June <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very special and {{historic}} occasion as {{he became the first}} Irishman to make 100 appearances for his country. Together with Gary Breen, he formed an impressive central defensive partnership in front of Shay Given. Staunton was the first footballer to have reached a century of caps for the Republic of Ireland national team, and as of the end of Ireland's qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup he was still the joint record holder with former teammates Shay Given and Kevin Kilbane, though both players (along with Robbie Keane) have since emulated Staunton's appearance record.|$|E

25|$|The key lies {{in strong}} {{institutions}} and cooperation. The Indus River Commission and the Indus Water Treaty survived two wars between India and Pakistan despite their hostility, <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> successful mechanism in resolving conflicts {{by providing a}} framework for consultation inspection and exchange of data. The Mekong Committee has also functioned since 1957 and survived the Vietnam War. In contrast, regional instability results {{when there is an}} absence of institutions to co-operate in regional collaboration, like Egypt's plan for a high dam on the Nile. However, there is currently no global institution in place for the management and management of trans-boundary water sources, and international co-operation has happened through ad hoc collaborations between agencies, like the Mekong Committee which was formed due to an alliance between UNICEF and the US Bureau of Reclamation. Formation of strong international institutions seems to be a way forward – they fuel early intervention and management, preventing the costly dispute resolution process.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} more {{powerful}} locomotives in the 1920s resulted in the introduction of twenty-five P class locomotives which provided a significant improvement in power, speed and economy over previous WAGR locomotives, quickly <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> highly successful design. The Great Depression of the 1930s, coupled {{with the effects of}} the Great War, thwarted the WAGR's later expansion and acquisition plans resulting in many obsolete locomotives remaining in operation into this period. As a result ten new P class locomotives featuring detail improvements to boilers, valves and bogies were introduced in 1938, a year before the outbreak of World War II. The new locomotives became the first WAGR engines to be given names, each bearing that of a prominent West Australian river. These 'River class' locomotives were very successful and proved so invaluable to the operation of the wartime WAGR that eight P class locomotives were modified to their standard. All eighteen locomotives were officially classified as the Pr class in 1946.|$|E
25|$|After {{an initial}} {{unsuccessful}} visit to leading doctors in Harley Street, Garrett decided to first spend six months as a surgery nurse at Middlesex Hospital, London in August 1860. On <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good nurse, she {{was allowed to}} attend an outpatients' clinic, then her first operation. She unsuccessfully attempted to enroll in the hospital's Medical School but was allowed to attend private tuition in Latin, Greek and materia medica with the hospital's apothecary, while continuing {{her work as a}} nurse. She also employed a tutor to study anatomy and physiology three evenings a week. Eventually she was allowed into the dissecting room and the chemistry lectures. Gradually, Garrett became an unwelcome presence among the male students, who in 1861 presented a memorial to the school against her admittance as a fellow student, despite the support she enjoyed from the administration. She was obliged to leave the Middlesex Hospital but she did so with an honours certificate in chemistry and materia medica. Garrett then applied to several medical schools, including Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews and the Royal College of Surgeons, all of which refused her admittance.|$|E
