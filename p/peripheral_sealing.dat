40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the use of}} a removable acrylic resin tray handle that can be easily attached to custom impression trays to produce an improved <b>peripheral</b> <b>sealing</b> zone. This device can be indicated to develop functional impressions for complete dentures using the patient-conducted muscular motion technique. In upper trays, the handle is fixed in the midline with acrylic resin, while in lower trays the centrally positioned handle is removed before border molding. This removable handle allows patient’s suction and free tongue movements. Final impression is carried out in two stages: <b>peripheral</b> <b>sealing</b> (low fusion compound) and recording of the main supporting region of the denture (zinc oxide and eugenol paste). All border records are obtained from the patient’s own movements (handle suction and tongue motion). The removable handle is simple to use, is reusable, can be adapted to any individual acrylic resin trays and allows accurate registration of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>sealing</b> zone (border tissues).

40|$|Introduction: Glass ionomer cement {{has been}} used for {{temporary}} restoration; however, several formulations are available. Objective: The aim of this study was compare the linear leakage of different types of glass ionomer cement – R, F, N and C. Material and methods: Forty-four third molars were used and prepared with standardized class I cavity preparations. By using gutta-percha, the cavity height was standardized in 5 mm. The samples were divided into 4 experimental groups (R, N, F and C), and 2 control groups (positive – not restored, and negative – restored using resin). The teeth were waterproofed and immersed in 2 % methylene blue. After 7 days, they were sectioned and the measurement of the dye leakage was performed by stereomicroscopy (40 X) using a calibrated periodontal probe. Results: Data were analysed by Kruskal Wallis and Dunn tests. There was statistically significant differences (p = 0. 002) between R and C, and R and N glass ionomer groups. C and N glass ionomer groups were similar. F glass ionomer group was similar to all other groups. Conclusion: It can be concluded that different types of glass ionomer formulations can influence the <b>peripheral</b> <b>sealing</b> of the restorative material. R glass ionomer was the most effective, while C and N glass ionomers were the least ones...|$|E

Enamel Bond The bond between resin and enamel is generally satisfactory. Most clinicians report {{that it is possible to}} achieve seemingly impeccable margins at the visible cavosurfaces when restoring posterior teeth with a direct composite-resin technique.

30|$|The {{difficulty}} of restoration with a maxillary obturator prosthesis {{depends on the}} extent of the surgical resection, with the acceptance that resections with an increasing horizontal component provide a much greater prosthodontic challenge. The number of remaining teeth is a key component in conventional obturator design [9] with the remaining dentition being used exclusively to retain the prosthesis by means of clasps which are often in the visual field and affect the resulting aesthetic outcome for the patient as well as placing significant forces onto them. In conventional maxillary defect preparation, the additional use of a split skin graft into the lateral aspect of the cheek is used to provide a scar band to aid with defect retention, and this brings added morbidity to the procedure especially for a paediatric patient. In conventional hemi-maxillectomy cases, gaining some form of retention from the defect is essential in providing the patient with confidence {{in the use of the}} prosthesis, and the discomfort associated with this can make paediatric patients anxious about placing and removing the obturator themselves. The advantages of providing “in-defect” support and retention by means of zygomatic implant placement addresses all of these potential difficulties and allows the construction of a simple highly polished acrylic prosthesis that does not require clasping of the teeth in the aesthetic zone, requires very little extension into the defect to affect a <b>peripheral</b> <b>seal</b> and most of all provides good support when the patient masticates on the defect side. No additional skin grafting is required, and the placement and retrieval of the prosthesis is comfortable and atraumatic. Maintenance of the prosthesis is simple with modifications to the <b>peripheral</b> <b>seal</b> as required at the chair side and replacement of the bar attachments from time to time.|$|R

Current technology uses a two-phase Li-alloy cathode, LiCl-LiBr-KBr electrolyte, and an upper-plateau (UP) FeS{sub 2 } anode for a battery operated at 440 C; the battery is in sealed bipolar form. The two-phase Li alloy ({alpha}+{beta} Li-Al and Li{sub 5 }Al{sub 5 }Fe{sub 2 }) cathode provides in situ overcharge tolerance {{that makes the}} bipolar design viable. The use of LiCl-rich LiCl-LiBr-KBr electrolyte in ``electrolyte-starved`` cells achieves low-burdened cells with low area-specific impedance, with MgO powder separator. Combining dense UP FeS{sub 2 } electrodes with a CuFeS{sub 2 } additive and a LiI-modified electrolyte produces a stable and reversible couple, with high power capabilities.

40|$|Conditions in the internal-air {{system of}} a high- {{pressure}} turbine stage are modelled using a rig comprising an outer pre-swirl chamber {{separated by a}} seal from an inner rotor-stator system. Pre-swirl nozzles in the stator supply the "blade cooling" air, which leaves the system via holes in the rotor, and disc-cooling air enters at {{the centre of the}} system and leaves through clearances in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>seals.</b> The experimental rig is instrumented with thermocouples, fluxmeters, pitot tubes and pressure taps enabling temperatures, heat fluxes, velocities and pressures to be measured at a number of radial locations. For rotational Reynolds numbers, the swirl ratio and the ratios of disc-cooling and blade-cooling flow rates are chosen to be representative of those found inside gas turbines. Measured radial distributions of velocity, temperature and Nusselt number are compared with computations obtained from an axisymmetric elliptic solver, featuring a low-Reynolds-number K-e turbulence model. For the inner rotor-stator system, the computed core temperatures and velocities are in good agreement with measured values, but the Nussel numbers are underpredicted. For the outer pre-swirl chamber, it was possible to make comparisons between the measured and computed values for cooling-air temperatures but not for the Nusselt numbers. As expected, the temperature of the blade-cooling air decreases as the swirl ratio increase, but the computed air temperatures are significantly lower than the measured ones.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study sample involved 30 subjects (10 males and 20 females) aged between 13 and 17 years who have been rehabilitated with FRC Maryland bridges to treat agenesis of maxillary incisors (for a total of 32 FRC-FPD). The observational study spans 5 years following the general rules coded by the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) system. RESULTS: After 5 years of follow-up of a sample of 32 FRC-FPD bridges, 30 were still in effective use (so 2 were excluded). All the bridges were FRC, replacing a missing lateral incisor, and had a double wing retention. All requirements of stability, <b>peripheral</b> <b>seal</b> and morphology preservation were well satisfied. The two failed bridges had a structural failure after about two years from placement. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In adolescents our orientation about the edentulous rehabilitation is towards solutions that, when possible, provide an acceptable aesthetic and functional restoration with fixed partial dentures, or removable dentures in cases of severe oligodontia. Obviously, techniques involving the placement of dental implants before the end of skeletal growth were never adopted. In our study FRC bridges showed a great functional performance and good compliance from young patients. Considering the positive cost-benefit ratio and the reversibility of the treatment in case of failure, such interventions can be considered a highly reliable early rehabilitation.

40|$|Achieving {{stability}} {{is a prerequisite}} for allowing bone to grow into the porous surface of non-cemented acetabular cups. The {{purpose of this study is}} to estimate the effects of interfacial characteristics on relative cyclical micromotion between cup and bone during gait in the immediate postoperative phase. The technique used is finite element analysis. Six models with different interfacial characteristics are created in order to study the effects of fixation technique. These include representation of a 1 mm press-fit, 2 mm press-fits (with and without an initial polar gap) and exact-fit conditions (with and without additional screw fixation). Although direct validation of the model has not been performed, the calculated micromotions under a static load of 1112 N are compared with appropriate experimental data. Generally, the model tends to underestimate micromotion and this underestimate is significant in the case of relative surface-normal micromotion in polar regions for models with low- and no-interference. The most likely cause of this significant underestimate is a failure of the model to accurately represent penetration of rough contacting surfaces under compression. Other types of micromotion, although low, are within standard deviations reported by Kwong et al. (1994 Journal of Arthroplasty 9, 163 - 170). Quasi-static joint contact and muscle forces, representative of the stance phase of gait are then applied and maximum micromotions are found to occur consistently prior to toe off: this being the point of maximum force. With regard to the press-fit simulations, good cup-bone contact in the superior region of the interface is required for stability and the greatest micromotions occur in the models with the larger interference and larger polar gaps. In contrast to the press-fit models, muscle activity in exact-fit models influences the calculations. Specifically, the early activity of m. semimembranosus modelled causes opening of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>seal.</b> Taken together it is found that polar gaps reduce the stability of the model and lack of pre-compresssion in the periphery allows this region of the interface to be opened up...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of edentulous patients {{are unable to}} afford anything other than mucosa-borne complete dentures, but the conventional methods of complete denture fabrication can be lengthy and expensive. Simplified techniques have been proposed {{to reduce the number}} of clinical visits as well as the laboratory time and costs. One such technique has advocated making the final heat-cured acrylic resin denture base after the first visit, which then requires a second processing cure for the artificial teeth. This dual-cure has been reported to cause distortion of the previously cured denture base. Purpose: To measure the amount of linear and three-dimensional distortion of an acrylic resin maxillary denture base following an additional curing cycle using different processing methods. Method and Materials: A standardised method was developed for fabricating a maxillary denture base with measuring pins, as well as a standardised method for waxing an arch of teeth to the base. The pins were used to make three-dimensional measurements using a Reflex Microscope. The resins used were from the same manufacturer. Four dual cure methods of varying temperature and time were used: 1. Place flask in boiling water for 20 minutes, remove and plunge into cold water for 20 minutes; 2. Place into cold water, heat up to 70 °C, leave for 1 hour, remove and bench cool; 3. Place into cold water, bring to 72 °C for 8 hours and bench cool; and 4. Place in cold water, bring to the boil for 40 minutes, bench cool for 45 minutes, then plunge into cold water for 20 minutes. For each method five models were fabricated, to give a total of 20 models. Results: Although there was an overall distortion of all denture bases following a second cure, the linear and 3 D differences were not statistically significant between and within the different dual cure methods tested. The mean percentage changes measured were translated into real changes in distances or angles between the pins, in order to ascertain the clinical relevance of these changes, for if they are too great, the distortion of the denture base will exceed the resilience of the mucosa as well as disrupt the <b>peripheral</b> <b>seal,</b> and the denture base will not be retentive. The largest mean change was seen in the three-dimension distance between the innermost pins in the posterior palate, but this was only 1. 3 mm. This also showed the worst change of all measurements, but it was still only 2. 0 mm. Conclusions: With the adaptive nature of the denture-supporting tissues, the changes described are unlikely to have any clinical significance. Although only one brand of denture base resin was used, it is representative of the modern rapid-cure resins, and so rapid cure methods can be advocated when a dual cure is required...|$|R

While viruses were shown to be the primary cause of the outbreaks, an immunotoxic action by organochlorine chemicals in affected animals could not be ruled out. We carried out a 2 1 / 2 -year immunotoxicological experiment in which two groups of 11 harbour seals each were fed herring from either the relatively contaminated Baltic Sea or the relatively uncontaminated Atlantic Ocean. Seals in the Baltic Sea group accumulated 3 - 4 times higher levels of Ah-receptor-mediated 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD Toxic Equivalents in blubber than did their Atlantic counterparts following 2 years on the respective diets. Blood was sampled a total of 17 times {{during the course of the}} experiment for immunological evaluation, during which time the natural cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from seals fed Baltic Sea herring declined to a level approximately 25 % lower than that observed in seals fed Atlantic herring (P < 0. 01).

As NK cells are leukocytes which play an important role in the first line of defence against viruses, the observed impairment of NK cell activity in the seals feeding on the Baltic Sea herring suggests that exposure to contaminants may have an adverse effect on the defence against virus infections in seals inhabiting polluted waters in Europe.

Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were isolated from the peripheral blood of either harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) or grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) captured in the St Lawrence Estuary. Cells exposed for 4 h to 10 - 4 M and 10 - 3 M HgCl 2 displayed lower phagocytic activity but this was related to a general cytotoxic effect of HgCl 2 as opposed to a specific effect on phagocytosis. Exposure of PBLs from either male or female PBLs to CdCl 2 had no effect on phagocytic activity at the concentrations tested except a significant decrease in cells from male harbour seals exposed to 10 - 4 M. Exposure to ZnCl 2 at physiologically relevant concentrations enhanced the phagocytic activity of PBLs from mature females of both species, whereas no effect was observed in cells from either males or immature females. In conclusion, we have developed an in vitro assay to test the effects of environmental contaminants on the phagocytic activity of seal PBLs. Our data indicate that exposure of PBLs to ZnCl 2 results in a sex-dependent response and that PBLs from mature female seals are more sensitive to ZnCl 2 than either male or immature seals.

The expression of cytokines (IL- 2, IL- 4 and TGF-β) was investigated in seal lymphocytes by RT-PCR and by real time quantitative PCR (n = 5) at methylmercury concentrations of 0. 2 and 1 μM. Finally, proteomics analysis was attempted on human lymphocytes (cytoplasmic fraction) in order to identify biochemical pathways of toxicity at concentration of 1 μM (n = 3). Results The results showed that the number of seal lymphocytes, viability, metabolic activity, DNA and RNA synthesis were reduced in vitro, suggesting deleterious effects of methylmercury concentrations naturally encountered in free-ranging seals. Similar results were found for human lymphocytes. Functional tests showed that a 1 μM concentration was the critical concentration above which lymphocyte activity, proliferation and survival were compromised. The expression of IL- 2 and TGF-β mRNA was weaker in exposed seal lymphocytes compared to control cells (0. 2 and 1 μM). Proteomics showed some variation in the protein expression profile (e. g. vimentin). Conclusion Our results suggest that seal and human PBMCs react in a comparable way to MeHg in vitro exposure with, however, larger inter-individual variations. MeHg could be an additional cofactor in the immunosuppressive pollutant cocktail generally described in the blood of seals and this therefore raises the possibility of additional additive effects in the marine mammal immune system. </p...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of morbillivirus in marine mammals as {{the etiology of}} several large scale mortality events {{raised questions about the}} role of immunosuppressive persistent organic pollutants and natural toxins in the severity, extent and duration of events. A morbillivirus of marine mammals, Phocine distemper virus (PDV), had devastating population level effects in Europe in 1988 and 2002. In 2006, a new isolate of PDV was determined to be responsible for mortality during the 2006 Northeast US Pinniped Unusually Mortality Event. The recent North American PDV mortality event provided a means to test several hypotheses designed to increase our overall understanding of different effects of PDV USA 2006 on harbor, harp and gray seals, and the relationship between PDV susceptibility and both natural and anthropogenic chemical stressors. The development of a sensitive duplex RT-qPCR assay utilizing the isolated North American strain, PDV USA 2006, allowed investigation into differences in species susceptibility in naturally infected as well as in-vitro infected host immune cells. In this study we demonstrated that species differences in susceptibility do exist in the quantity of virus produced during the course of infection. We also determined that differences in-vitro correlate with findings in seals naturally infected with PDV USA 2006. Furthermore, we described the effects of Aroclor 1260 on harbor <b>seal</b> <b>peripheral</b> blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) susceptibility in-vitro and show a disruption in the timing of the infection eventually resulting in more severe infection. In contrast, low levels of saxitoxin (STX) induced a transient increase in PDV replication during early infection and affected T cell proliferation. This is the first in-vitro exposure of immune cells of seals to STX to determine an immunomodulatory effect in a marine mammal, {{and this is the first}} documentation of an effect of exposure to STX and resultant change in quantity of morbillivirus after in-vitro exposure in harbor seal PBMCs. While it is impossible to assess all factors, this research contributes to the collective understanding of why different outcomes are observed in different seal species during PDV infection, with new insights into environmental factors that may influence those outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 151 The {{essential}} elements {{to be reviewed}} when considering a centrifugal pump application are highlighted. The purpose is to ensure the procurement and/or application of a centrifugal pump which optimizes reliability, energy usage, maintenance costs, and achieves this in a safe manner. The {{need to understand the}} system hydraulics and complete process requirements is emphasized, as is the impact each system parameter has on pump design. The test is broken into three basic areas: pump boundaries conditions, flow requirements, and pump specification ? key elements. Pump boundary conditions addressed NPSH considerations as they relate to flow requirements, potential for cavitation damage, suction specific speed, and mechanical seal temperature margin. This section also addresses system resistance variations, and addresses the effects of variations in dynamic and static system heads and the potential prime causes of variations in these heads. Flow requirements discusses the determination of normal, maximum (or rated), and minimum flow requirements. A method of approximation of a pump?s minimum acceptable flowrate is presented (based on the pump?s hydraulic specifications), which utilizes suction specific speed and moderating factors such as impeller head, NPSH margin, specific gravity, etc. Attention is paid to the effect of excessive specified flow on NPSHA, flow rangeability, and suction specific speed. Mechanical and hydraulic interrelationships are discussed to emphasize how flowrate variations affect radial and axial thrust, impeller suction and discharge recirculation, and potential for cavitation; also covered are the effect of variation in running clearances and changes in specific gravity. Critical aspects of both parallel and series pump application are addressed. The dangers of incorrect parallel pump application are highlighted and guidelines are offered for correct application of parallel pumps. Series pump operation is discussed primarily in terms of percentage split in pumps? combined total head, pump protection and system protection. Pump Specification ? Key Elements addresses communicating to prospective pump vendors the key parameters that may determine the metallurgy, mechanical seal design and mechanical <b>seal</b> <b>peripheral?s</b> design, and pump hydraulic design best suited to the user?s requirements. The liquid specification is highlighted, the important site and operating conditions are addressed, and the importance of clearly defining the key performance requirements in full is discussed. The wrong pump, operated incorrectly coupled with poor maintenance practices, results in unsatisfactory hydraulic performance, high energy costs, high maintenance costs, poor reliability, and increases the potential for an unsafe failure. Proper specification and selection principles, coupled with the implementation of correct operating and maintenance practices, will result in optimized centrifugal pump application. The net result will be a pumping application that meets all process demands, with a minimum of energy usage, and low frequency of repair (high reliability), low overall maintenance costs, and low process debits. Key hydraulic and Performance Criteria are addressed along with their effects on performance, energy, reliability, energy, reliability, maintenance costs, and safety. The interrelationships that exist between hydraulic characteristics and the mechanical reliability is highlighted to ensure that neither are treated separately...|$|R
