5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with a <b>polar</b> <b>body</b> to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|A 1981 {{study of}} a {{deceased}} triploid XXX twin fetus without a heart showed that although its fetal development suggested {{that it was an}} identical twin, as it shared a placenta with its healthy twin, tests revealed that it was probably a <b>polar</b> <b>body</b> twin. The authors were unable to predict whether a healthy fetus could result from a <b>polar</b> <b>body</b> twinning.|$|E
25|$|A <b>polar</b> <b>body</b> biospy is the {{sampling}} of a <b>polar</b> <b>body,</b> {{which is a}} small haploid cell that is formed concomitantly as an egg cell during oogenesis, but which generally {{does not have the}} ability to be fertilized. Compared to a blastocyst biopsy, a <b>polar</b> <b>body</b> biopsy can potentially be of lower costs, less harmful side-effects, and more sensitive in detecting abnormalities. The main advantage of the use of polar bodies in PGD is that they are not necessary for successful fertilisation or normal embryonic development, thus ensuring no deleterious effect for the embryo. One of the disadvantages of PB biopsy is that it only provides information about the maternal contribution to the embryo, which is why cases of maternally inherited autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders that are exclusively maternally transmitted can be diagnosed, and autosomal recessive disorders can only partially be diagnosed. Another drawback is the increased risk of diagnostic error, for instance due to the degradation of the genetic material or events of recombination that lead to heterozygous first polar bodies.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, a study {{reported}} {{a case of}} a pair of living twins, one intersex and one a phenotypical male. The twins were both found to be chimeras and to share all of their maternal DNA but only half of their father's DNA. The exact mechanism of fertilization could not be determined but the study stated that it was unlikely to be a case of <b>polar</b> <b>body</b> twinning.|$|E
25|$|By this time, the oocyte has {{completed}} meiosis I, yielding two cells: the larger secondary oocyte that contains {{all of the}} cytoplasmic material and a smaller, inactive first <b>polar</b> <b>body.</b> Meiosis II follows at once but will be arrested in the metaphase and will so remain until fertilization. The spindle apparatus of the second meiotic division appears {{at the time of}} ovulation. If no fertilization occurs, the oocyte will degenerate between 12 and 24 hours after ovulation. Approximately 1-2% of ovulations release more than one oocyte. This tendency increases with maternal age. Fertilization of two different oocytes by two different spermatozoa results in fraternal twins.|$|E
25|$|Triploidy may be {{the result}} of either digyny (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or diandry (the extra haploid set is from the father). Diandry is mostly caused by {{reduplication}} of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg. Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one meiotic division during oogenesis leading to a diploid oocyte or failure to extrude one <b>polar</b> <b>body</b> from the oocyte. Diandry appears to predominate among early miscarriages, while digyny predominates among triploid zygotes that survive into the fetal period. However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases <8.5 weeks gestational age or those in which an embryo is present. There are also two distinct phenotypes in triploid placentas and fetuses that are dependent on the origin of the extra haploid set. In digyny, there is typically an asymmetric poorly grown fetus, with marked adrenal hypoplasia and a very small placenta. In diandry, a partial hydatidiform mole develops. These parent-of-origin effects reflect the effects of genomic imprinting.|$|E

50|$|In {{parallel}} with this effort and a scientific first, Carson co-directed a research team by extracting information about gene expression from fertile human egg cells without hurting them. In this work {{the team was}} able to sequence the transcribed genetic material, or mRNA, in egg cells, in smaller structures pinched off from them called <b>polar</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>bodies</b> are nonfunctional and incapable of being fertilized.

500|$|The {{complex is}} found in {{cellular}} regions characterized by dynamic actin filament activity: in macropinocytic cups, in {{the leading edge of}} motile cells (lamellipodia), and in motile actin patches in yeast. In mammals and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum [...] it is required for phagocytosis. The complex has also been shown {{to be involved in the}} establishment of cell polarity and the migration of fibroblast monolayers in a wound-healing model. In mammalian oocytes, the Arp2/3 complex is involved in oocyte asymmetric division and <b>polar</b> <b>body</b> emission, which result from the failure of spindle migration (a unique feature of oocyte division) and cytokinesis. Moreover, enteropathogenic organisms like Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella use the Arp2/3 complex for actin-polymerization- dependent rocketing movements. The Arp2/3 complex also regulates the intracellular motility [...] of endosomes, lysosomes, pinocytic vesicles, and mitochondria. Moreover, recent studies show that the Arp2/3 complex is essential for proper polar cell expansion in plants. Arp2/3 mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana result in abnormal filament organization, which in turn affects the expansion of trichomes, pavement cells, hypocotyl cells, and root hair cells.|$|E

60|$|Section 4. After the ovum has {{finished}} its growth, and elaborated the yolk within itself, a peculiar change {{occurs in the}} small area free from yolk-- the animal pole, in which the germinal vesicle lies. This germinal vesicle divides, and one moiety is budded off from the ovum. The ovum has, in fact, undergone cell division into a very large cell containing most of its substance, and a small protoplasmic pimple surrounding half of its nucleus. The disproportion is so great between the two cells, that the phenomenon does not at first suggest the idea of cell division, and it is usually described as the extrusion of the first <b>polar</b> <b>body.</b> There follows a second and similar small cell, behind the first, the second <b>polar</b> <b>body.</b> Since {{the nucleus of the}} ovum has divided twice, it is evident that the nucleus remaining now in the ovum is a quarter of the original nucleus. Very little protoplasm is given off with the polar bodies; they play no further part in development, but simply drop off and disappear. Not only in the frog's ovum, but in all vertebrata, two polar bodies are given off in this way before the sexual process occurs. Their exact meaning has been widely discussed. It is fairly evident that some material is removed from the nucleus, which would be detrimental to further developments, and the point debated is what is the precise nature of this excreted material. This burning question we can scarcely deal with here.|$|E

Errors can occur during either of the two meiotic divisions that produce each <b>polar</b> <b>body,</b> but are more pronounced if they occur during the formation of the first <b>polar</b> <b>body,</b> because the formation of the first <b>polar</b> <b>body</b> influences the chromosomal makeup of the second.

40|$|The {{cytogenetic}} analysis of single cells, such as oocytes and <b>polar</b> <b>bodies,</b> is extremely challenging.

40|$|The {{current study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the aneuploidy rates in in vitro-matured meiosis II (MII) oocytes and corresponding first <b>polar</b> <b>bodies</b> in two dairy cattle (Bos taurus) breeds by using dual-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). A total of 159 and 144 in vitro-matured MII oocytes of the Italian Friesian and Italian Brown breeds, respectively, were obtained according to the standard methods and analyzed by FISH using "Xcen" and " 5 " chromosome-specific painting probes, produced by chromosome microdissection and Degenerate Oligonucleotide Primer- Polymerase Chain Reaction (DOP-PCR). Oocytes with unreduced chromosome number were 10. 1 % and 16. 7 % in the two breeds, respectively. To avoid bias due to possible artifacts, the aneuploidy rates were determined by analyzing only oocytes with the corresponding <b>polar</b> <b>bodies.</b> In the Italian Friesian, 100 of 143 (69. 9 %) secondary MII oocytes showed clear MII plates with corresponding first <b>polar</b> <b>bodies</b> and were scored for aneuploidy detection; one oocyte was "nullisomic" for chromosome X (1. 0 %) and one "disomic" for chromosome 5 (1. 0 %). In the Italian Brown, 100 of 120 (83. 3 %) MII oocytes with corresponding first <b>polar</b> <b>bodies</b> were analyzed; one oocyte was nullisomic (1. 0 %) and one was disomic (1. 0 %), both for chromosome 5. Totally, 303 oocytes were analyzed, 40 of which showed an unreduced chromosome complement (13. 2 %); of 200 MII oocytes with the corresponding first <b>polar</b> <b>bodies,</b> the aneuploidy rate (nullisomy+disomy) for the two chromosomes scored was 2 %. Assuming that each chromosome is equally involved in aneuploidy, it results that in cattle oocytes matured in vitro, at least 30 % of the oocytes (1 x 30 haploid chromosomes) should be aneuploid. Premature separation of sister chromatids (PSSC) was also observed in 2 % of the oocytes in the Italian Friesian breed involving chromosome 5 and in 1 % of the Italian Brown breed involving the X chromosome. Estimation of the "baseline" level of aneuploidy in the in vitro-matured oocytes of the various domestic animal species and breeds is, to our opinion, a useful reference for improving the in vitro production of embryos {{as well as for}} monitoring future trends of the reproductive health of the species/breeds engaged in zootechnical productions, especially in relation to management errors and environmental hazard...|$|R
