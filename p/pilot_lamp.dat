5000|$|A {{photoresistor}} is used {{to detect}} {{the light from the}} <b>pilot</b> <b>lamp.</b> When the pilot light goes out, electrical circuitry connected to the photoresistor shuts off the gas valve.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The [...] "California 3-way" [...] or [...] "Coast 3-way" [...] {{connection}} never {{connects the}} lamp socket shell {{to the line}} (hot) terminal. An optional additional lamp can be connected at Terminal A as a <b>pilot</b> <b>lamp,</b> or to illuminate a long corridor. An optional receptacle can be connected at Terminal B, since that terminal is always live.|$|E
5000|$|In a Weston pattern synchroscope, {{the moving}} element {{is not free}} to rotate {{continuously}} and oscillates back and forth slowly as the two sources are brought into synchronism. The moving pointer is illuminated by a <b>pilot</b> <b>lamp</b> connected to a three-winding transformer fed by both sources. The pointer is only illuminated at the in-phase condition, thereby distinguishing between in-phase and 180-degree out of phase conditions.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>lamps</b> that {{indicate}} the presence of electrical power in an appliance or instrument (e.g. an electric coffee pot or power supply).|$|R
50|$|Commercial flash pots include safety {{features}} such as warning <b>pilot</b> <b>lamps,</b> preignition grounding, and safing circuits. They also use isolated and low-voltage power sources, and have keyed power connections to help prevent accidental ignition.|$|R
50|$|Power cables may {{be either}} fixed or {{detachable}} from the appliance. In {{the case of}} detachable leads, the appliance end of the power cord has a female connector to link it to the appliance, to avoid the dangers from having a live protruding pin. Cords may also have twist-locking features, or other attachments to prevent accidental disconnection at one or both ends. A cord set may include accessories such as fuses for overcurrent protection, a <b>pilot</b> <b>lamp</b> to indicate voltage is present, or a leakage current detector. Power cords for sensitive instruments, or audio/video equipment may also include a shield over the power conductors to minimize electromagnetic interference.|$|E
5000|$|A {{soldering}} gun is an approximately pistol-shaped, electrically powered tool for soldering metals using tin-based solder {{to achieve a}} strong mechanical bond with good electrical contact. The tool has a trigger-style switch {{so it can be}} easily operated with one hand. The body of the tool contains a transformer with a primary winding connected to mains electricity when the trigger is pressed, and a single-turn secondary winding of thick copper with very low resistance. A soldering tip, made of a loop of thinner copper wire, is secured {{to the end of the}} transformer secondary by screws, completing the secondary circuit. When the primary of the transformer is energized, several hundred amperes of current flow through the secondary and very rapidly heat the copper tip. Since the tip has a much higher resistance than the rest of the tubular copper winding, the tip gets very hot while the remainder of the secondary warms much less. A tap on the primary winding is often used to light a <b>pilot</b> <b>lamp</b> which also lights the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Bajaj {{introduced}} {{another version}} of Pulsar (UG III). New features included: <b>pilot</b> <b>lamps</b> separated from the main headlamp, turn indicators with clear lenses and amber bulb, self-cancelling turn indicator switch, flush LCD screen with digital read-out of key vehicle data, non-contact speed sensor, non-contact backlit switches, twin-stripe LED tail-light assembly and side panels altered for a sharp, tapering-towards-the-rear look. The engine had increased torque availability, reduced vibration and improved gear shift feel. cc variants.|$|R
50|$|Each motor {{controller}} in an MCC {{can be specified}} {{with a range of}} options such as separate control transformers, <b>pilot</b> <b>lamps,</b> control switches, extra control terminal blocks, various types of thermal or solid-state overload protection relays, or various classes of power fuses or types of circuit breakers. A motor control center can either be supplied ready for the customer to connect all field wiring, or can be an engineered assembly with internal control and interlocking wiring to a central control terminal panel board or programmable controller.|$|R
50|$|Lutheran Association of Missionaries and <b>Pilots</b> (<b>LAMP)</b> is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is a cross-cultural ministry sharing Jesus Christ with First Nations people in remote areas of Canada. The organization has been providing spiritual witness and nurture to communities in northern remote areas of Canada since 1970, through the ministry of missionary/pilots, and short and long-term volunteers-in-mission. LAMP presently works in 60 communities, teaching Vacation Bible School, youth and adult Bible study, and leading soccer camps in the summer months.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2005 it has been realized Aladdin's <b>lamp,</b> <b>pilot</b> of the new series Aladdin's adventures (26 x 13'), co-produced by Rai-Fiction. Backgrounds and characters are inspired by Emanuele Luzzati's graphical work, by kind permission of the artist. The stories are inspired by the compilation of Eastern folk tales Arabian Nights. The drawings are animated thanks to the digital techniques that hark back to the traditional way of cut-out animation, as Luzzati and Gianini did in their works. The main characters are: Aladdin, a young boy {{in love with the}} Princess Budur, daughter of the Caliph Harun, and their friend the Genie. Their enemy is the wizard Kufor, that wills to grab Aladdin's magic lamp. Through the series, Aladdin and Budur will have to face lots of adventures, always winning thanks to their wit and reciprocal love. The telling is given to Sherazade's voice and the musical score composed and played expressly for each episode by Lorenzo Marini, in an ongoing dialogue with the graphic designer and animators.|$|R
40|$|Plating of Neurospora conidia or ascospores {{is often}} {{accomplished}} using a glass spreader to distribute suspended cells on the agar surface. See How to plate conidia and ascospores. Spreaders are commonly made of 3 mm diameter soft glass rod with a 70 Â° bend 50 mm {{from one end}} (Davis and de Serres 1970). These are sturdy and suitable for reuse. Common practice is to sterilize the spreader between using it for different spore samples by dipping it in alcohol and flaming to burn off the excess alcohol. This kills conidia. Ascospores, however, are large, thick-walled, and heat-resistant, and the procedure does not ensure that all ascospores adhering to the spreader will be killed (Newmeyer and Wallace 1971). It is imperative, therefore, that an already used spreader be replaced with a sterile spreader whenever ascospores from different crosses are to be plated one after another. Spreaders handmade from disposable Pasteur pipettes provide a convenient alternative to the conventional spreaders made of glass rod. Procedure Disposable Pasteur pipets 23 cm long are suitable. (VWR Scientific Catalog No. 14572 - 380. Flint glass. Outside dimension of body, 7 mm; OD of 12 cm-long capillary stem, ~ 1. 5 mm.) Pipets are sterilized in a hot-air oven. Each spreader is made just before use. A pipet is brought carefully toward a small flame (Bunsen Burner <b>pilot</b> or alcohol <b>lamp)</b> until the long, thin stem melts at a selected point and the distal portion bends downward {{as a result of}} gravity. The angle at which it solidifies depends on how the pipette is held. A second bend, made quickly and easily, can shape the capillary tip into a straight, 4 - or 5 -cm-long interval suitably angled for spreading. There is no need to dip in alcohol or to flame before using. Each newly made spreader is discarded after use. Because the capillary portion of the Pasteur pipet is thinner than the solid glass rod of conventional spreaders, cells are spread more evenly and are not concentrated in the water film that is formed by surface tension if a spreader is picked up before liquid has been completely imbibed...|$|R
