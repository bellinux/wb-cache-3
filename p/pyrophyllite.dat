5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a <b>pyrophyllite</b> tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center {{to the ends of the}} tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E

25|$|Cremo's central {{claim in}} Forbidden Archeology is that humans have lived on Earth for tens to {{hundreds}} of millions of years, and that the scientific establishment has suppressed the fossil evidence of extreme human antiquity. In case of grooved spheres from <b>pyrophyllite</b> mines of Ottosdal, South Africa, Cremo proposes that they might be man-made artifacts as much as 2.8 billion years old. Forbidden Archeology has been criticized by mainstream scholars from a variety of disciplines.|$|E
25|$|The kaolinite-serpentine group {{consists}} of T-O stacks (the 1:1 clay minerals); their hardness ranges from 2 to 4, as the sheets {{are held by}} hydrogen bonds. The 2:1 clay minerals (pyrophyllite-talc) consist of T-O-T stacks, but they are softer (hardness from 1 to 2), as they are instead held together by van der Waals forces. These two groups of minerals are subgrouped by octahedral occupation; specifically, kaolinite and <b>pyrophyllite</b> are dioctahedral whereas serpentine and talc trioctahedral.|$|E
500|$|The BARS {{apparatus}} is {{the most}} compact, efficient, and economical of all the diamond-producing presses. In {{the center of a}} BARS device, there is a ceramic cylindrical [...] "synthesis capsule" [...] of about 2cm3 in size. The cell is placed into a cube of pressure-transmitting material, such as <b>pyrophyllite</b> ceramics, which is pressed by inner anvils made from cemented carbide (e.g., tungsten carbide or VK10 hard alloy). The outer octahedral cavity is pressed by 8 steel outer anvils. After mounting, the whole assembly is locked in a disc-type barrel with a diameter about 1 meter. The barrel is filled with oil, which pressurizes upon heating, and the oil pressure is transferred to the central cell. The synthesis capsule is heated up by a coaxial graphite heater and the temperature is measured with a thermocouple.|$|E
500|$|Hall {{achieved}} the first commercially successful synthesis of diamond on December 16, 1954, {{and this was}} announced on February 15, 1955. His breakthrough was using a [...] "belt" [...] press, which was capable of producing pressures above [...] and temperatures above [...] The press used a <b>pyrophyllite</b> container in which graphite was dissolved within molten nickel, cobalt or iron. Those metals acted as a [...] "solvent-catalyst", which both dissolved carbon and accelerated its conversion into diamond. The largest diamond he produced was [...] across; it was too small and visually imperfect for jewelry, but usable in industrial abrasives. Hall's co-workers were able to replicate his work, and the discovery {{was published in the}} major journal Nature. He {{was the first person to}} grow a synthetic diamond with a reproducible, verifiable and well-documented process. He left GE in 1955, and three years later developed a new apparatus for the synthesis of diamond—a tetrahedral press with four anvils—to avoid violating a U.S. Department of Commerce secrecy order on the GE patent applications. Hall received the American Chemical Society Award for Creative Invention for his work in diamond synthesis.|$|E

These mines produce a very high quality <b>pyrophyllite,</b> which is a phyllosilicate mineral composed of aluminium silicate hydroxide: AlSi2O5OH. The <b>pyrophyllite</b> is a metamorphosed clay. The clay was formed by the alteration of volcanic ash, which apparently accumulated {{at the bottom of}} a quiet body of water. It forms a dense, but soft light grey, or darker, fine-grained stone, which splits into well-defined slabs.

50|$|Various {{professional}} geologists {{agree that}} the Klerksdorp spheres originated as concretions, which formed in volcanic sediments, ash, or both, after they accumulated 3.0 billion years ago. Heinrich argues that the wollastonite nodules formed by the metamorphism of carbonate concretions {{in the presence of}} silica-rich fluids generated during the metamorphism of the volcanic deposits containing them into <b>pyrophyllite.</b> It was also argued that the hematite nodules represent pyrite concretions oxidized by weathering of near surface <b>pyrophyllite</b> deposits. Below the near-surface zone of weathering, which has developed in the <b>pyrophyllite,</b> pyrite concretions are unaffected by weathering and, thus, have not been altered to hematite. The radial internal structure of these objects is a pseudomorph after the original crystalline structure of the original carbonate or pyrite concretion.|$|E
