40|$|Ecological {{communities}} {{are the result}} of not only present ecological processes, such as competition among species and environmental filtering, but also past and continuing evolutionary processes. Based on these assumptions, we may infer mechanisms of contemporary coexistence from the phylogenetic relationships of the species in a community. We studied the phylogenetic structure of plant communities in four cerrado sites, in southeastern Brazil. We calculated two raw <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>distances</b> among the species sampled. We estimated the phylogenetic structure by comparing the observed <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>distances</b> to the distribution of <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>distances</b> in null communities. We obtained null communities by randomizing the phylogenetic relationships of the regional pool of species. We found a phylogenetic overdispersion of the cerrado species. Phylogenetic overdispersion has several explanations, depending on the phylogenetic history of traits and contemporary ecological interactions. However, based on coexistence models between grasses and trees, density-dependent ecological forces, and the evolutionary history of the cerrado flora, we argue that the phylogenetic overdispersion of cerrado species is predominantly due to competitive interactions, herbivores and pathogen attacks, and ecological speciation. Future studies will need to include information on the phylogenetic history of plant traits...|$|R

However, if information about the rate of genetic mutation is available or geologic markers are present to calibrate evolutionary divergence (i.e. fossils), we have a timeline of evolution.

Further extensions of DTL models are being developed towards an integrated description of the genome evolution processes.

40|$|Community {{assembly}} {{has long}} been an important issue in community ecology. The study of community phylogenetic structure, which applies phylogeny to community ecology studies, has provided an effective way to disentangle the most important ecological processes that drive community assembly. Studying the phylogenetic structure of a community involves firstly the construction of a supertree representing the species pool of the community, then a calculation of <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>distances</b> between all species within the community, and finally an inference of phylogenetic structure (e. g., clustering, overdispersion) obtained by statistically testing whether the obtained <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>distances</b> are different from those expected under random model, hence revealing key ecological processes involved in community assembly (e. g., habitat filtering,competition exclusion). Community phylogenetic structure is different when studied at different taxonomic, spatial or temporal scales. At small spatial scales, community phylogenetic pattern tends to change from clustering to overdispersion with decreasing taxonomical scale or increasing tree age class, while the pattern tends to be tighter clustering at larger spatial scales. Phylogenetic information also indicates the influence of environmental factors and studying community phylogeny at the metacommunity level helps to understand regional ecological processes. In addition, phylogenetic structure can help to explore neutral theory, density-dependent hypothesis and other theories in ecology, and even to predict community dynamics and evolution under disturbance. The future application of phylogenetic structure to disclosing underlying causes of community assembly demands the joint analysis of ecological traits and environment factors and, the consideration of both local processes (e. g., microenviroment, biological interactions) and regional processes (e. g., geological history, speciation). In terms of methodological aspects, to construct a phylogenetic tree, appropriate gene segments should be used and the tree needs to be corrected using ecological traits inorder to reflect more exact <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>distances</b> among species. Furthermore, more effective statistical models and indices are needed to increase statistical power...|$|R

Ticks were historically considered as specialist parasites, but the range of sampled host species has been limited, infestation intensity has not been included in prior analyses, and <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>distances</b> between hosts have not been previously considered. We used a large dataset of 35 604 individual collections and two host-specificity indices to assess the specificity of 61 South African tick species, as well as distinctions between adult and juvenile ticks, for 95 mammalian hosts. When accounting for host phylogeny, most adult and juvenile ticks behaved as generalists, with juveniles being significantly more generalist than adults. When we included the intensity of tick infestation, ticks exhibited a wider diversity of specificity in all life stages.

The evolutionary rate was quite homogeneous at both intra-specific and congeneric level, and the lowest congeneric rates were found in cryptic (morphologically undistinguishable) and in morphologically very similar species pairs. Moreover, congeneric nonsynonymous rates (dN) were up to two orders of magnitude higher than in intra-species pairs. Overall, a clear-cut gap sets apart conspecific from congeneric pairs. These evolutionary peculiarities allowed easily identifying an extraordinary intra-specific variability in the model ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, where most pairs show a dN value between those observed at intra-species and congeneric level, yet consistently {{lower than that of}} the C. intestinalis cryptic species pair. These data suggest ongoing speciation events producing genetically distinct B. schlosseri entities.
