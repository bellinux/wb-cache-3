5|$|There are two {{widespread}} {{standards for}} pressure measurement of diving gas. In the USA and <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> other places {{the pressure is}} measured in {{pounds per square inch}} (psi), {{and the rest of the}} world uses bar. Sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units, such as kilopascal (kPa) or megapascal (MPa), or in atmospheres (atm, or ATA), particularly gauges not actually used underwater.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of ASV {{this was not a}} problem; {{aircraft}} would not approach a ship on the surface more closely than its altitude of <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand feet, so a longer pulse width was fine. But in the AI role, the minimum range was pre-defined by the pilot's eyesight, at 300m or less for night interception, which demanded sub-microsecond pulse widths. This proved very difficult to arrange, and ranges under 1,000feet were difficult to produce.|$|E
5|$|Soviet-oriented parties, {{backed by}} the Soviet Red Army and {{in control of the}} {{security}} forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Władysław Gomułka and Bolesław Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated {{at the time of the}} PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.|$|E

5|$|During Ezana's reign a {{major change}} in both the Aksumite kingdom and its coinage took place {{as a result of the}} change of the {{official}} religion to Christianity, one of the first states ever to do so. While Ezana's coins in the first half of his reign are almost identical to those of Aphilas, barring minimal weight reductions, those of his second half employ revolutionary designs. With his conversion to Christianity, Ezana began to feature the Cross on his coins, the first time the Christian cross had ever been featured in coinage in the world. Some of his gold Christian coins are of the weight before Constantine I's weight reform in 324, indicating a conversion before this date or <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years after, as the Aksumite coinage may not have changed weights immediately. Along with the adoption of the Cross on his coins came, of course, the abandonment of the star and crescent symbol on the coins. Later Christian coins reflect the adoptment of the 4.54 g standard by Constantine, with theoretical weights in Aksumite coins likewise dropping to 1.70 g for the gold coins.|$|E
5|$|When the Persians {{arrived at}} Thermopylae in mid-August, they {{initially}} waited {{for three days}} for the Allies to disperse. When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass, he sent his troops to attack. However, the Greek position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare, the Persian contingents being forced to attack the phalanx head on. The Allies thus withstood two full days of battle and everything Xerxes could throw at them. However, {{at the end of}} the second day, they were betrayed by a local resident named Ephialtes who revealed to Xerxes a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines. Xerxes then sent his elite guards, the Immortals on a night march to outflank the Allied. When he was made aware of this maneuver (while the Immortals were still en route), Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Allied army, remaining to guard the rear with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebians and <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred others. On the third day of the battle, the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians and slaughter as many as they could. Ultimately, however, the Allied rearguard was annihilated, and the pass of Thermopylae opened to the Persians.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree and}} depth of {{linguistic}} relativity. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> examples of superficial differences in language and associated behavior are enough to demonstrate the existence of linguistic relativity.

25|$|Freezes are an {{occasional}} occurrence in the Bartow area {{and can be}} a problem if temperatures remain below freezing for a sustained period of time.

25|$|The {{first known}} {{inhabitants}} of the district were probably members of the Tini o Toi people, who apparently derived from the Tākitimu waka which came to the Whakatane area from Taranaki. There followed, <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> generations later, the Tainui and Te Arawa people, from {{the first of which}} the present Ngaitai tribe claim direct descent. Also in this period were migrations by the Nukutere waka from Taranaki, and the Rangimatoru waka.|$|E
25|$|There {{are roughly}} two million Bolivian speakers, {{half a million}} Peruvian speakers, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{thousand}} speakers in Chile. At {{the time of the}} Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century, Aymara was the dominant language over a much larger area than today, including most of highland Peru south of Cusco. Over the centuries, Aymara has gradually lost speakers both to Spanish and to Quechua; many Peruvian and Bolivian communities that were once Aymara-speaking now speak Quechua.|$|E
25|$|Thin, rocky soil {{prevented}} {{the establishment of}} large farms in the Trapps. Families grew a few acres of corn, buckwheat, rye, oats, or potatoes; they kept a horse, cow or two, a handful of chickens, <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pigs. They supplemented their subsistence farm crops by selling butter, fruit, and eggs. Trapps men also shaved barrel hoops; peeled hemlock and oak bark for nearby leather tanneries; carved millstones from conglomerate rock; and burned charcoal. The Van Leuvens were a Trapps family widely known for burning Shawangunk charcoal.|$|E

25|$|According to Jürgen Zarusky (originally {{published}} in a 1997 article in Dachauer Hefte), 16 SS men were shot in the coalyard (one more killed by a camp inmate), 17 in Tower B, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more killed by U.S. soldiers in the incident. Anywhere from a few to 25 or 50 more were killed by inmates. Zarusky's research makes use of the detailed interrogation records contained in Whitaker's official May 1945 investigation report, which became accessible in 1992, {{as well as a}} collection of documents compiled by General Henning Linden's son.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{channel of}} the Illinois River was shaped {{in a matter}} of days by the Kankakee Torrent. During the melting of the Wisconsin Glacier about 10,000 years ago, a lake formed in present-day Indiana, {{comparable}} to one of the modern Great Lakes. The lake formed behind the terminal moraine of a substage of that glacier. Melting ice to the north eventually raised the level of the lake so that it overflowed the moraine. The dam burst, and the entire volume of the lake was released in a very short time, <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} the {{incorporation}} of Lesser Poland is also not completely resolved. Possibly Mieszko took the region before 990, which is indicated by the vague remark of Thietmar, who wrote of a country taken by Mieszko from Boleslav. In light of this theory, the conquest of Lesser Poland could be {{a reason for the}} war, or its first stage. Many historians suggested that the Czech rule over Lesser Poland was only nominal and likely limited to the indirect control of Kraków and <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> other important centers. This theory is based on the lack of archaeological discoveries, which would indicate major building investments undertaken by the Bohemian state.|$|E

25|$|Several factors make large tree holes more {{valuable}} to Megaloprepus than small ones. Not only can their greater volume accommodate more naiads at a time, {{they have a}} higher density of prey {{in the form of}} tadpoles and mosquito larvae; this allows the naiads to grow more rapidly and reach adulthood sooner. In forests with a dry season, larger tree holes can last nearly a month longer before drying out completely. As a result, large tree holes can produce three cohorts per season, totalling <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dozen new adults, while only one or two emerge from a small hole. Large tree holes also give Megaloprepus better chances of surviving to emerge if one of its slower-growing relatives in genus Mecistogaster is already present. In a tree hole small enough to be effectively patrolled by a single naiad, the first species to hatch is likely to eat all newcomers, but in a large one Megaloprepus can escape long enough to outgrow and eventually eat an older resident. Finally, probably due to the greater abundance of prey, larger tree holes produce larger males that will be better able to defend a territory themselves when they reach reproductive maturity.|$|E
25|$|Inside the lobby, Sweeny, District Engineer Farley and his firemen, Cain, and {{the other}} police {{officers}} eventually cleared the dress circle stairs {{to work their way}} up to the doors, where there was the connecting doorway to the family gallery stairway. They tried going up to the family gallery but were stopped by thick smoke. They heard no traffic on the stairway, heard no human sounds. They called up but received no response. Farley ordered one last inspection of the dress circle, but saw no activity. Nor was there any signs of life in the parquet and orchestra, below, now burning fiercely. To Farley the building seemed evacuated, barring, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> stragglers. Not wanting to subject himself or others to any further risk, he ordered his men to quit the building. Within minutes, cracks appeared on the exterior theatre walls facing Johnson street, where, within, the heart of the blaze raged. At 11:45pm, less than a half hour after J. W. Thorpe had spied a flame no larger than his hand, the Johnson Street end of the building collapsed and an intense rush of air was drawn in, feeding the flames. Anyone who could speak of events transpiring within the building had already left.|$|E
500|$|In Baley's opinion, Udell {{was right}} to be {{concerned}} about the road, and adds: [...] "although Beale had taken a few wagons over the route, [...] was little more than a survey trail marked only by faint wagon tracks, an occasional stone cairn, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> axe blazes on trees." [...] Portions of the road followed human and animal trails, and– although potable water was sporadically available– there were also long stretches called jornadas, where it was scarce. From the San Francisco Peaks to the Colorado River, vital resources were in short supply.|$|E

50|$|Oligosynthetic {{languages}} are a theoretical notion created by Benjamin Whorf with no known examples existing in natural languages.
