30|$|Black silicon was {{fabricated}} on n-type {{solar grade}} silicon wafers using an optimized MCCE method and passivated using an ALD-deposited Al 2 O 3 thin film, post-annealed. Spray method for the deposition of silver ions {{results in a}} single-side etching without using masks. After <b>post-etch</b> treatment, b-Si exhibits a low reflectance of 6 – 10 %. The use of NH 4 OH/H 2 O 2 /H 2 O in place of NaOH as <b>post-etch</b> treatment to smooth the surface not only achieves higher effective minority carrier lifetime of 333  μs but also {{eliminates the need for}} the Na+ removal step. At the same time, increasing the NH 4 OH content in the <b>post-etch</b> solution can improve the effective minority carrier lifetime without significantly increasing the reflectance. Also, an effective surface recombination velocity of 38  cm/s is achieved on sample <b>post-etch</b> treated by NH 4 OH/H 2 O 2 /H 2 O (volume ratio 1.0 : 1 : 5) mixed solution, while the value of polished reference is 22  cm/s. Moreover, by adding illumination during the etching process, the etching rate can be increased, and a finer uniform surface can be obtained, resulting in an improvement in both the numerical value and the uniformity of the effective minority carrier lifetime.|$|R

30|$|It is {{accepted}} that conditioning of lithium disilicate by HF-etching requires a shorter etching time and HF concentration (20  s, 5 % HF) possibly {{because of the}} reduced crystal size; the less glass in the ceramic to be removed and also since excessive etching might cause a weakening of the ceramic substrate [23]. Dissolution of the vitreous phase creates 5 – 20  µm-deep micro-retentions [22, 24, 32, 33] that can be resin-infiltrated [22]. Micromechanical retention generated by HF-etching {{seems to be the}} main mechanism for bonding to lithium disilicate ceramics [4]. Additional use of silane did not seem to bring any benefit, unless ultrasonic <b>post-etching</b> cleaning was used. Maybe the usage of the silane didn’t show statistical difference due to the presence of insoluble salts in the surface. Insoluble salts may interfere in the interaction between the silane and the silica, leading to lower bond strength values, not because the silane {{does not need to be}} used. So it will require an adequate cleaning of the surface before the use of the silane. The side effect of HF-etching is the formation of insoluble residual salts that precipitate and obliterate microretentions [18 – 20, 22], which may significantly influence the bond strength values [18, 22], confirming the need for <b>post-etching</b> cleaning [21, 22]. Most authors support the <b>post-etching</b> protocol used in this current study (ultrasonic distilled water bath for 2  min) to provide effective residue elimination [19, 21, 34]. One study failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>post-etching</b> ultrasonic cleaning [35], although this can be explained by the fact that specimens were placed in the ultrasonic bath for 20  min, which may have caused weakening or disaggregation of the etched porcelain. In another study, post-etch cleaning led to a 100 % increase in MTBS (24  MPa without cleaning vs. 50  MPa with cleaning). In the present study, the maximum gain from <b>post-etching</b> cleaning was only 30 % (from 14  MPa up to 21  MPa). This could be explained by the small amount of residue observed on the etched surface of lithium disilicate ceramics [22], possibly due to the reduced vitreous content [6, 36] and the reduced time for etching. The other <b>post-etching</b> cleaning techniques used in this present study (air/water spray, phosphoric acid or steam) performed similarly and did not improve or reduce bond strength, which is in agreement with Swift, Walls and McCabe [37].|$|E
40|$|Compound {{semiconductor}} processing often uses high density plasma etching to establish through-via metal contacts that typically stops on an inert metal such as gold (Au). The etch process may enter {{from the front}} or backside through the substrate and/or an organic dielectric such as polyimide or bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB). An inherent by-product of the etch process is the formation of <b>post-etch</b> residue containing a mixture of species stemming from the plasma ions, resist pattern, etched region, and lastly, material from the etch stop (Au) that impregnates and coats the residue. [1, 2] Common strippers are ineffective on Au impregnated <b>post-etch</b> residue, requiring a separate KI-leaching of the metal before the residue is removed.

30|$|Twenty-four slices (14  ×  16  ×  2  mm) of IPS e.max CAD LT A 2 /C 14 (EMAX; Ivoclar Vivadent, AG, Batch R 28294) were {{obtained}} by sectioning CAD/CAM blocks using a slow-speed diamond water-cooled saw (Isomet, Buehler). The slices were crystallized in a ceramic furnace (Austromat 624; DEKEMA Dental-Keramiköfen GmbH) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The slices were embedded in an acrylic resin positioning base (Palapress; Heraeus Kulzer, GmbH) and polished manually with 400 - and 600 -grit silicon carbide paper under water cooling. The surface of all specimens was then cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with distilled water for 5  min.

Four different <b>post-etching</b> cleaning methods were compared: AW—air/water spray, no <b>post-etching</b> cleaning; UB—immersion in ultrasonic bath with distilled water for 2  min; PA—application of phosphoric acid (37 %) for 30  s, followed by rinsing with water; or ST—steam cleaning (AX-SCA dental steam cleaner) for 10  s at 4 – 5 bars and a 10  cm distance. For each <b>post-etching</b> cleaning method, two silane application methods were used: E—no silane treatment; E/S—silane (Silane, Ultradent) applied for 20  s and air dried for 20  s, hot dried at 60  °C for 20  s; or E/S+—silane applied for 60  s, air dried for 20  s and hot air dried 60  °C for another 20  s (with hair dryer at 10  cm-distance), rinsed with boiling water for 15  s and hot air dried for 20  s.|$|E

Experiment results indicate the critical physical parameters of final sigma-shape silicon trench could be predicted by means of geometry analysis and monitoring dry etching related recess in bulk silicon. Besides, we also noticed the effect of pattern-dependent depth loading at dense areas. Organic polymer generated during etch process tends to introduce the trench depth variation. Polymer lean etch process has been proven as one of effective knobs to overcome such loading to some extent. In addition, the oxidation capacity of <b>post-etch</b> treatment can not be ignored.

Discs were cut from a feldspathic ceramic block (VitaMKII) and from a leucite reinforced glass ceramic (IPS EMPRESS CAD) for Cerec. 5 % and 9 % HF concentrations were used during 1 min and 2 min each. Afterwards samples were thoroughly water rinsed for 30 s. Half of the 9 % HF 1 min samples were subsequently submitted to a complex <b>post-etching</b> cleaning. All samples were observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The conventional feldspathic ceramic samples were built up on a refractory die and a platinum foil.

30|$|The {{fabrication}} process contains two steps, namely scratching and <b>post-etching</b> [11, 12]. With a 5 -μm radius diamond tip on the homemade multi-probe instrument [17], {{a series of}} grooves with the depth of about 7  nm were produced on a silicon surface. The applied normal load used for the scratching was 20  mN. Then, the samples were etched in 20  wt.% KOH aqueous solution at different temperatures of 0, 25, 40, 50, 60, and 80  °C. To improve the etching quality, isopropanol alcohol (IPA) {{was added to the}} KOH solution with the volume ratio of 1 : 5 [12]. The temperature was controlled via a thermostatic water bath with the accuracy of ± 0.5  °C. After the <b>post-etching,</b> the fabricated nanostructures on Si were detected by AFM scanning with a Si 3 N 4 tip (MLCT, Veeco Instruments Inc., Plainview, NY, USA) in vacuum. The nominal tip radius of the Si 3 N 4 tip is 20  nm.|$|E
30|$|The third {{process step}} is the <b>post-etching</b> of the InP membrane. This step is {{necessary}} because {{the width of}} the SCR is much larger during the anodic pore formation than at open-circuit conditions [9]. Thus, only anodic pore etching does not result in a porous InP layer with completely overlapping SCR. Therefore, the InP membrane is post-etched in an HF : HNO 3 : EtOH : HAc containing electrolyte under a cathodic potential for 48 h at 20 °C. The electrolyte was optimized to show isotropic etching behavior – especially along the full length of the high aspect-ratio pores – and to be self-limiting at the SCR surrounding each pore. A cathodic potential was chosen to artificially shrink the SCR around each pore and to expose more area unguarded by the SCR to the electrolyte for dissolution. As the <b>post-etching</b> electrolyte is self-limiting at the SCR, a strongly improved overlapping of the SCR is obtained under open-circuit conditions. The electrolyte is pumped through the complete membrane to ensure homogenous etching over the whole membrane thickness.|$|E
40|$|Process {{variation}} on lot-to-lot and wafer-to-wafer level {{has been well}} addressed using R 2 R control in advanced process control, however, to tackle the ever increasing die-to-die (i. e. across-wafer) level process variation at the 65 nm technology node and beyond, the process control must be extended into finer domain: across-wafer level. A novel model based process control approach [2] was proposed to reduce the critical dimension (CD) {{variation on}} across-wafer level. The central idea of the proposed approach is to compensate for upstream and downstream systematic CD variation by adjusting the across-wafer Post-Exposure Bake (PEB) temperature profile of a multi-zone bake plate. A temperature-to-offset model relating the PEB temperature profile of multi-zone bake plate to its heater zone offsets was constructed experimentally using wireless temperature sensors from OnWafer Technologies.

40|$|Since CMOS {{technology}} {{moved to}} sub 40 nm node and beyond, {{the limits of}} both pre-etch and <b>post-etch</b> process have posed the huge challenges to contact etch itself, contact etch is playing a more and more critical role in yield enhancement.
