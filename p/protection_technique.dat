50|$|The {{order of}} {{execution}} of Commodore BASIC lines was not determined by line numbering; instead, it followed {{the order in}} which the lines were linked in memory. Program lines were stored in memory as a singly linked list with a line number, a pointer (containing the address of the beginning of the next program line), and then the tokenized code for the line. While a program was being entered, BASIC would constantly reorder program lines in memory so that the line numbers and pointers were all in ascending order. However, after a program was entered, manually altering the line numbers and pointers with the POKE commands could allow for out-of-order execution or even give each line the same line number. In the early days, when BASIC was used commercially, this was a software <b>protection</b> <b>technique</b> to discourage casual modification of the program.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Designing storage {{systems to}} provide {{business}} continuity {{in the face}} of failures requires the use of various data <b>protection</b> <b>techniques,</b> such as backup, remote mirroring, point-in-time copies and vaulting, often in concert. Predicting the dependability provided by such compositions of techniques is difficult, yet necessary for dependable system design. We present a framework for evaluating the dependability of data storage systems, including both individual data <b>protection</b> <b>techniques</b> and their compositions. Our models estimate storage system recovery time, data loss, normal mode system utilization and operational costs under a variety of failure scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these modeling techniques through a case study using real-world storage system designs and workloads. ...|$|R

50|$|Tree injection, {{also known}} as trunk or stem injection, is a method of target precise {{application}} of pesticides, plant resistance activators, and fertilizers into the xylem vascular tissue of a tree {{with the purpose of}} protecting the tree from pests or nutrition for correction of nutrient deficiencies. This method largely relies on harnessing the tree’s vascular system to translocate and distribute the active compounds into the wood, canopy and roots where protection or nutrition is needed. Tree injection is currently the most popular method for control of damaging insects, pathogens, and nematodes in landscape tree care. It has been developed primarily for use on large size trees and in proximity of urban areas where ground- and air-spray applications are impractical due to substantial drift-driven pesticide losses or not allowed due to potential human exposure. However, the prime driver of tree injection use has been a wide spread need for control of many invasive tree pathogens and insects pests. The most infamous examples are that of Ophiostoma fungi that cause Dutch Elm Disease (DED) and insect Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) which have specific biologies that lead to severe internal damage of wood and thus tree death, and which make their management extremely difficult or inefficient with classical pesticide application methods. Trunk injection for tree protection is viewed as environmentally safer alternative for pesticide application since the compound is delivered within the tree, thus allowing for selective exposure to plant pests. In landscapes and urban zones trunk injection significantly reduces the non-target exposure of water, soil, air, and wildlife to pesticides and fertilizers. In the last 20 years, tree injection is gaining momentum with the development and availability of new, efficient injection devices and injectable and xylem mobile formulations of pesticides, biopesticides and nutrients. Further, a number of newly occurring and fast spreading invasive insect pests and diseases such as Polyphagous Shot Hole Borer (PSHB) Euwallacea, which vectors plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium euwallaceae, and Sudden Oak Death (SOD) caused by an Oomycete Phytophthora ramorum, establish the use of trunk injection as the most efficient tree <b>protection</b> <b>technique</b> in landscapes and urban forestry.|$|E
40|$|Generalized {{multiprotocol}} label switching (GMPLS) {{is a set}} of protocol extensions to MPLS {{that are}} essential for enabling next-generation IP-over-WDM networks [1]. IP routers (and other edge devices) communicate with one another in such networks though optical label-switched paths (optical-LSPs) which may pass through an optical cloud consisting of several optical crossconnects (OXCs). In an IP-over-WDM network, fault monitoring and management techniques are of two types: (a) protection and (b) restoration [2]. In protection, spare capacity is reserved during call setup. In restoration, the spare capacity that is available after the fault’s occurrence is utilized for rerouting the disrupted connections. Recently, there has been a considerable amount of standards activity within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) towards establishing a fault-management framework for MPLS [3]. So far, the standardization efforts have focused on <b>protection</b> <b>techniques,</b> because <b>protection</b> <b>techniques</b> allow service providers to offer “hard ” guarantees on the recovery time, e. g., 50 ms recovery time in SONET. However, many new data-centric services, such as virtual private network (VPN) services, may not require such “hard ” guarantees on the recovery time. Moreover, restoration techniques have many advantages over <b>protection</b> <b>techniques.</b> For example, restoration utilizes bandwidth more efficiently than protection because, in restoration, the resources for the backup connections are not committed until the fault actually occurs. Another important advantage of restoration is that it can naturally handle simultaneous multiple fiber failures, whereas <b>protection</b> <b>techniques</b> are designed for handling a preset number of simultaneous failures, typically single fiber failures. Thus, b...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel ANFIS controllable CBFT <b>protection</b> <b>technique</b> {{to protect the}} DFIG wind turbines grid connected during different faults. The studied system has a total capacity of 9  MW, where it consists of six wind turbine generators with a capacity of 1.5  MW for each of them. The proposed <b>protection</b> <b>technique</b> consists of three crowbar resistors, where each resistor {{is connected in parallel}} with a controllable single-phase CB and both of them are connected between the terminals of DFIG wind turbine and electrical grid. The ANFIS networks are used to detect and classify the fault types, then it sends a control signal to activate the specified CBs of faulted phases to protect the DFIG, DC-link capacitor, and converters from dangerous effects. The accuracy of proposed <b>protection</b> <b>technique</b> is investigated during different fault types such as single-phase to ground fault, double-phase to ground fault, and three-phase to ground fault. The variations of DC-link voltage, active power, and reactive power during occurrence of different fault types are investigated when the studied system is equipped with proposed <b>protection</b> <b>technique</b> and when it is equipped with classical outer crowbar <b>protection</b> <b>technique.</b> Also, a comparison with traditional parallel rotor crowbar <b>protection</b> <b>technique</b> is investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed technique. The simulation results show that, the variations of measured DC-link voltage, active power, and reactive power during fault periods are more stable and have little fluctuations when the wind turbine generators are equipped with proposed CBFT <b>protection</b> <b>technique.</b> The reduction of fluctuations when the studied system is equipped with proposed CBFT <b>protection</b> <b>technique</b> is more obvious in case of single-phase to ground fault considering this fault is the most frequently fault type that occurs in power systems. Also, the impacts of different crowbar resistance values on the behaviour of studied system and the accuracy of proposed <b>protection</b> <b>technique</b> are investigated. Finally, the results show that the proposed CBFT <b>protection</b> <b>technique</b> based on ANFIS has obvious effect for enhancing the stability of studied system.|$|E
