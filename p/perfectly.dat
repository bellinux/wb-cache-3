5|$|Kant {{believed}} that morality is the objective law of reason: just as objective physical laws necessitate physical actions (apples fall {{down because of}} gravity, for example), objective rational laws necessitate rational actions. He thus {{believed that}} a <b>perfectly</b> rational being must also be <b>perfectly</b> moral because a <b>perfectly</b> rational being subjectively finds it necessary {{to do what is}} rationally necessary. Because humans are not <b>perfectly</b> rational (they partly act by instinct), Kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with objective rational laws, which he called conformity obligation. Kant argued that the objective law of reason is a priori, existing externally from rational being. Just as physical laws exist prior to physical beings, rational laws (morality) exist prior to rational beings. Therefore, according to Kant, rational morality is universal and cannot change depending on circumstance.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist <b>perfectly</b> in God, and that, existing <b>perfectly,</b> God must be <b>perfectly</b> good. He concluded that God is goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E

5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being <b>perfectly</b> periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is <b>perfectly</b> periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} reciprocal lattice (the so-called Bragg peaks). In reality, however, crystals are not <b>perfectly</b> periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, {{and there may be}} disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and there may be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.|$|E

5|$|Bates leaves Obydos; {{he finds}} the people lazy, as {{otherwise}} they could easily become comfortable with mixed farming. They sail through a tremendous storm. He finds a Pterochroza grasshopper whose forewings <b>perfectly</b> resemble leaves, the Victoria waterlily, masses of ticks, the howler monkey and large Morpho butterflies. He meets Wallace again at Barra. Back in Para, he catches yellow fever.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral methods involve {{regulating}} the timing or method of intercourse to prevent introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract, either altogether or when an egg may be present. If used <b>perfectly</b> the first-year failure rate may be around 3.4%, however if used poorly first-year failure rates may approach 85%.|$|E
5|$|Cataclysmic events (meteorite/asteroid impacts, volcanism) {{that cause}} mass extinctions of species that, until the event, were <b>perfectly</b> adapted to their environment, {{such as the}} dinosaurs. The {{dramatic}} reduction of competition among the surviving species makes newly evolved species more likely to survive.|$|E
5|$|Crossing the Water {{is full of}} <b>perfectly</b> {{realised}} works. Its {{most striking}} impression is of a front-rank artist {{in the process of}} discovering her true power. Such is Plath's control that the book possesses a singularity and certainty which should make it as celebrated as The Colossus or Ariel.|$|E
5|$|However, Project Stormfury had {{positive}} results as well. Knowledge gained during flights proved invaluable in debunking its hypotheses. Other science {{resulted in a}} greater understanding of tropical cyclones. In addition, the Lockheed P-3's were <b>perfectly</b> suitable for gathering data on tropical cyclones, allowing improved forecasting of these monstrous storms. Those planes are still used by the NOAA today.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the tracks}} in Wipeout 64 feature {{mirrored}} layouts of circuits from select tracks in Wipeout and Wipeout 2097, set in different locations. Some conversions are not <b>perfectly</b> accurate, as some corners were eased or cut entirely, elevations were changed, {{and there were no}} split track sections.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA {{interference}} can be both systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually <b>perfectly</b> or nearly <b>perfectly</b> complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E
5|$|That man's a great director. He {{can make}} people feel <b>perfectly</b> natural. He's got what Chaplin did when he {{directed}} A Woman of Paris—he and Lewis Milestone and Mal St. Clair all have that same touch, they all belong to the new school of directors, it seems to me. They're not so busy thinking about technique that they have actors turning into marionettes.|$|E
5|$|The Green is not <b>perfectly</b> rectangular, as its {{southern}} border along Wheelock Street runs {{slightly to the}} northeast rather than due east-west. This irregularity {{is due to the}} Town of Hanover's 1873 seizure of part of the southeast corner of the Green, which it used to straighten Wheelock Street. The Green had previously extended 30 feet (nine meters) farther south on that corner.|$|E
5|$|The Tirreno–Adriatico ended as {{its parent}} race the Giro d'Italia {{had for the}} last three seasons, with an {{individual}} time trial. San Benedetto del Tronto in the Marche region played host to a <b>perfectly</b> flat out-and-back ride right along the Adriatic coast.|$|E
5|$|There's {{got to be}} {{a series}} of {{advantages}} all the way in the feather. If you can't think of one, then that's your problem not natural selection's problem... It's <b>perfectly</b> possible feathers began as fluffy extensions of reptilian scales to act as insulators... The earliest feathers might have been a different approach to hairiness among reptiles keeping warm.|$|E
5|$|We {{destroyed}} the aircraft and all munitions, everything. I {{sat in my}} fighter and fired the guns into the woods where all the fuel had been dropped, and then jumped out. We destroyed twenty-five <b>perfectly</b> good fighters. They {{would be nice to}} have in museums now.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying to}} {{photograph}} a hen partridge on her nest, Cott waited for {{hours for the}} bird to return, finally taking some pictures of the empty nest before giving up. On developing the photographs, he realized the bird had been there all along, <b>perfectly</b> camouflaged.|$|E

25|$|An {{alphabet}} {{is a set}} of symbols, each {{of which}} represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language.
