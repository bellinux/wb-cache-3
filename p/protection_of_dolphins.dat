40|$|Surveys were {{undertaken}} to identify common dolphin species landed by local fishers {{in the coastal}} waters of Ghana between 1998 and 2000. Altogether, 14 out of the known 18 dolphin species in the West African sub-region were identified. They were predominated by the clymene dolphin, Stenella clymene (35 %) followed by the pantropical spotted dolphin, Stenella attenuate (1 7 %), the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus (1 6 %), and Risso 's dolphin, Grampus griseus (7 %). Although some coastal communities traditionally revere dolphins, pressure from rapid population growth and declining fish catches have currently made them immediate food need because their meat is consumed fresh or smoked. The main threats of concern are unregulated directed or accidental killing by drift gill-nets (DGN), purse seine {{and use of the}} meat as baits for catching sharks whose fins attract scarce foreign exchange. The increasing pressures from these artisanalfisheries call for en forcement of existing national conservation legislation (Wildlife Conservation Regulation, 1971 or Legislative Instrument, 685) and adoption of new measures to address the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>dolphins.</b> In support of this effort, some short-term and long-term interventions needed to protect the dolphins are discussed for their conservation because they are considered a potential source of eco-tourism "dolphin-watching"...|$|E

40|$|Behaviour {{and social}} groupings of animals are often {{closely tied to}} habitat structure. Ecological factors (e. g., {{predation}} pressure, resource distribution) and social pressures profoundly influence behaviour and social organization. This study examined the socioecology of dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) off Kaikoura, {{one of the most}} productive submarine canyon habitats in the world, supporting marine mammal populations and a thriving tourism industry. Behavioural data were collected during 332 dusky dolphin group follows from a small research vessel and onboard 174 dolphin tours during 2006 - 2009. Continuous and interval sampling were used to document behavioural states, behavioural events, and changes in group composition. Data from small groups (n= 197) were compared with similar data collected from 67 small group encounters with Hector’s dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) in the same habitat. In winter, dusky dolphins formed larger groups that ranged more widely and small groups that primarily rested during the day near shore. Although resting, small groups increased dispersion and swam in parallel formation in winter. In summer, dolphins formed small groups for calf-rearing, mating and resting. Groups with calves were the largest and most stable of these small groups, and were found closest to shore, in relatively shallow water, often near river mouths. In mating groups, rapid chases decreased intromission rates as competition among males increased. Sexual selection may favour traits improving male success in behavioural contests as well as sperm competition in this species. Apparent mechanisms for female choice included ‘escape’ strategies that prolonged chases. Hector’s dolphins formed smaller groups with higher fission-fusion rates, less cohesion, and fewer social bond reinforcement behaviours than dusky dolphins. Interactions with tour vessels had short-term effects on the behavioural state, heading, dispersion, and leaping rate of large dusky dolphin groups. Resting was disrupted during tour interactions and dolphins increased travel away from approaching tour vessels following tour interactions. Assertive approach methods reduced the duration of swimmer-dolphin interactions, particularly in summer when dolphins may be sensitised to high levels of tourism. These large-brained, highly social mammals form intricate societies that are responsive to changes in habitat, predation pressure and resource distribution. Understanding these responses is vital for <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>dolphins</b> in the wild...|$|E
40|$|Riverine {{species are}} adapted to natural habitat changes caused by {{seasonal}} flood-pulses. However, abrupt river channel changes following flooding events intersect with social systems {{of land and}} water management (e. g. agriculture,fisheries) and in turn generate significant consequences for conservation of endangered aquatic species. We investigated trade offs between changing river habitat availability and exposure to fishing intensity for a small population <b>of</b> Ganges River <b>dolphins</b> Platanista gangetica gangetica in the Karnali basin of Nepal. A major natural flooding event in the Karnali basin in 2010 caused the river channel to shift from the Geruwa (flows through a protected area where fishing is restricted) to the Karnali channel (high fishing activity, agriculture-dominated), where dolphins moved in response. Based on our survey data (2009 – 2015) and long-term hydrological trends in the basin, we found that irrigation diversions since 2012 had aggravated fishing impacts on dolphins, suggesting that their new habitat had become an ‘ecological trap’. Regression models showed that at low river depths, fishing intensity negatively affected dolphin abundance, but at higher depths no effect of fishing was observed. Two records <b>of</b> <b>dolphin</b> by catch in gill nets confirmed this, as both events corresponded with periods of sudden increase in water abstraction for irrigation. Overall, dolphin distribution shifted downstream and the population declined from 11 in 2012 to 6 in 2015. Effective <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> this river <b>dolphin</b> population from extinction will require the Government of Nepal to prioritize ecologically adequate river flow regimes for implementing efficient irrigation schemes and adaptive fisheries regulations in the Karnali basi...|$|R
