40|$|Productivity {{growth is}} a key measure against which National Health Service (NHS) {{achievements}} are judged. We measure NHS productivity growth {{as a set of}} paired year-on-year comparisons from 1998 / 1999 – 1999 / 2000 through 2012 / 2013 – 2013 / 2014, which are converted into a chained index that summarises productivity growth over the entire period. Our measure is as comprehensive as data permit and accounts for the multitude of diverse outputs and inputs involved in the production process and for regular revisions to the data used to quantify outputs and inputs. Over the full-time period, NHS output increased by 88 : 96 % and inputs by 81 : 58 %, delivering overall total factor productivity growth of 4 : 07 %. Productivity growth was negative during the first two terms of Blair’s government, with average yearly growth rate of 1 : 01 % <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> (<b>pa)</b> during the first term (to 2000 / 2001) and 1 : 49 % pa during the second term (2000 / 2001 – 2004 / 2005).

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the health-care charges associated with monitoring and managing, over 1 year, {{the cases of}} elevated insulin concentration, elevated alanine aminotransferase concentration and dyslipidaemia due to overweight or obesity among 15 - 19 -year-old Australian males and females. METHODS: Fasting blood samples (n= 500) were collected in 2004 from a representative population sample of adolescents (n= 496; mean age 15. 3 years) attending schools in Sydney, Australia. Full service charges and Medicare expenditures for specialist medical and dietary consultations, pathology tests and radiological investigations, over 1 year, under efficient and inefficient health-care delivery models, including and excluding participants in the healthy body mass index (BMI) category. RESULTS: Under an inefficient delivery model and including all participants with elevated risk factors, the Medicare expenditure was $A 305. 1 million <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> (M <b>pa).</b> Exclusion {{of participants in the}} healthy BMI category resulted in an annual Medicare expenditure of $A 170. 0 M pa. Under an efficient delivery model and including all participants with elevated risk factors, the Medicare expenditure was $A 295. 5 M pa. Exclusion of participants in the healthy BMI category reduced annual Medicare expenditure to $A 164. 8 M pa. Medicare expenditure for 15 - 19 -year-olds would increase by 48 % if only cases among overweight and obese adolescents were treated and by 85 % if all cases were identified and treated. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term management of the health consequences of overweight and obesity among adolescents will increase Medicare expenditure on this group by at least 48 %.

Interrupted time series analysis, comparing readmission rates for COPD exacerbations at nine trusts that introduced the bundle, to two comparison groups; (1) other NHS trusts in London and (2) all other NHS trusts in England. Care bundles were implemented at different times for different NHS trusts, ranging from October 2009 to April 2011. Nine NHS acute trusts in the London, England. Patients aged 45 years and older admitted to an NHS acute hospital in England for acute exacerbation of COPD. Data come from Hospital Episode Statistics, April 2002 to March 2012. Annual trend readmission rates (and in total bed days) within 7, 28 and 90 days, before and after implementation.

30|$|Household {{access to}} credit is an {{important}} resilience factor in eastern India. For many households borrowing money is a major coping strategy during and after times of drought. In addition to what kind of security can be presented by a household, the determining factor {{of what kind of}} credit conditions a household has access to is its social networks and reputation within the village community. In the sphere of formal institutions, there is credit raising from the State Bank of India. For subsistence farmers who own land and have proof of this {{in the form of a}} land title, the interest rate <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> (<b>pa)</b> is 12 %, if the land functions as security for the credit. Households have potential access to this form of credit, if they own enough land for security. The land quality and fertility has to be sufficient to be hypothecated and a formal land property title is necessary. If formal credit raising fails, households are dependent on borrowing money based on informal institutions. Some households are in the position to borrow money from a relative outside the village, usually without interest to be paid. The rest of the informal sphere is dominated by local traders, whose interest rates are much higher than those of formal moneylenders. If the household can present a certain amount of gold as security, mostly in the form of jewelry worn by women, the interest rate is 3 % per month (pm); resulting in 36 % pa, if the interest is paid regularly each month. The situation for the household is worse if only agricultural tools or animals can be presented as security. In this case, an interest rate of 5 % pm/ 60 % pa has to be paid. However, particularly during droughts some households cannot present any security like gold, tools, or animals because they have already been sold to buy food. If no security is presented, the credit relation is based on trust and the borrower has to be known to the trader. The interest rate in that case is 10 % pm/ 120 % pa. To be dependent on such credits has to be seen as a sign of low social resilience. In the short term, these credits might help to cope with drought, but research indicates that, in the long term, they very often lead into overindebtedness (Jülich 2015). Such excessive indebtedness depletes future options for development and, as a consequence, the {{access to credit}} determines the risk of overindebtedness that comes with certain credit conditions and affects resilience. Credits by the State Bank of India, by traders with 3 % pm interest, and credit from relatives bear a relatively low risk of overindebting, at least compared to the other alternatives present in the region.|$|E
40|$|Wildlife and {{pastoral}} peoples have lived side-by-side in the Mara ecosystem of south-western Kenya {{for at least}} 2000 years. Recent changes in human population and landuse are jeopardizing this co-existence. The aim {{of the study is}} to determine the viability of pastoralism and wildlife conservation in Maasai ranches around the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR). A study area of 2250 km 2 was selected {{in the northern part of}} the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, encompassing group ranches adjoining the MMNR. Emphasis is placed on Koyake Group Ranch, a rangeland area owned by Maasai pastoralists, and one of Kenya's major wildlife tourism areas. Maasai settlement patterns, vegetation, livestock numbers and wildlife numbers were analysed over a 50 -year period. Settlement distributions and vegetation changes were determined from aerial photography and aerial surveys of 1950, 1961, 1967, 1974, 1983 and 1999. Livestock and wildlife numbers were determined from re-analysis of systematic reconnaissance flights conducted by the Kenya Government from 1977 to 2000, and from ground counts in 2002. Corroborating data on livestock numbers were obtained from aerial photography of Maasai settlements in 2001. Trends in livestock were related to rainfall, and to vegetation production as indicated by the seasonal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. With these data sets, per capita livestock holdings were determined for the period 1980 â€“ 2000, a period of fluctuating rainfall and primary production. For the first half of the twentieth century, the Mara was infested with tsetse-flies, and the Maasai were confined to the Lemek Valley area to the north of the MMNR. During the early 1960 s, active tsetse-control measures by both government and the Maasai led to the destruction of woodlands across the Mara and the retreat of tsetse flies. The Maasai were then able to expand their settlement area south towards MMNR. Meanwhile, wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) from the increasing Serengeti population began to spill into the Mara rangelands each dry season, leading to direct competition between livestock and wildlife. Group ranches were established in the area in 1970 to formalize land tenure for the Maasai. By the late 1980 s, with rapid population growth, new settlement areas had been established at Talek and other parts adjacent to the MMNR. Over the period 1983 â€“ 99, the number of Maasai bomas in Koyake has increased at 6. 4 % <b>per</b> <b>annum</b> (<b>pa),</b> and the human population at 4. 4 % pa. Over the same period, cattle numbers on Koyake varied from 20, 000 to 45, 000 (average 25, 000), in relation to total rainfall received over the previous 2 years. The rangelands of the Mara cannot support a greater cattle population under current pastoral practices. With the rapid increase in human settlement in the Mara, and with imminent land privatization, it is probable that wildlife populations on Koyake will decline significantly in the next 3 â€“ 5 years. Per capita livestock holdings on the ranch have now fallen to three livestock units/reference adult, well below minimum pastoral subsistence requirements. During the 1980 s and 90 s the Maasai diversified their livelihoods to generate revenues from tourism, small-scale agriculture and land-leases for mechanized cultivation. However, there is a massive imbalance in tourism incomes in favour of a small elite. In 1999 the membership of Koyake voted to subdivide the ranch into individual holdings. In 2003 the subdivision survey allocated plots of 60 ha average size to 1020 ranch members. This land privatization may result in increased cultivation and fencing, the exclusion of wildlife, and the decline of tourism as a revenue generator. This unique pastoral/wildlife system will shortly be lost unless land holdings can be managed to maintain the free movement of livestock and wildlife...|$|E
