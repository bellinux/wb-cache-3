5|$|Encounters with tawny nurse sharks {{underwater}} {{indicate a}} more docile demeanor than the similar nurse shark; usually divers {{are able to}} approach the sharks closely and even touch and <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> without incident. However, this species has been infrequently provoked into biting, and merits respect due to its strength, small but sharp teeth, and extremely powerful jaws. Tawny nurse sharks are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off Thailand, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed.|$|E
5|$|Jay Farrar, {{along with}} his {{brothers}} Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from Belleville, Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> for the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy {{played an important role}} in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.|$|E

25|$|Page and Robertson {{continued}} {{performing and}} also began writing songs together. The band's first tape, Buck Naked (1989), was recorded on a four-track recorder in basements and bedrooms. The pair became followers of comedy group Corky and the Juice Pigs, {{to whom they}} give credit for exposing them {{to the idea of}} comedic stage presence. Page and Robertson presented the group with their tape, and were invited to open for the Juice Pigs on their cross-Canada tour. One night, in Toronto, Page and Robertson invited their friends, brothers Andy Creeggan (percussion) and Jim Creeggan (bass), whom they knew from music camp, to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> at a Christmas time club show. Barenaked Lunch (a.k.a. The Pink Tape) was released in 1990, and featured the two new band members. The tape had problems, however, as it was mastered incorrectly and played too fast.|$|E
25|$|The Cherrys series {{consists}} of 14 books, published from 1952 to 1965, the last being published after Will Scott died. Numbers 1–12 {{in the series}} were illustrated by Lilian Buchanan who also illustrated some of Enid Blyton's children's books. Numbers 1–12 in the series contain various pictorial maps of the stories' fictional settings, for example Market Cray and River House, on the end papers. These twelve books are illustrated throughout with black and white drawings. The stories are about a family of children whose middle-class parents, especially the father, <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> and encourage adventures, {{some of which are}} imaginary. The series is aimed at a reading age of about 10 years in the middle classes of the 1950s to 1960s era. Many of the stories are set in the fictional village of Market Cray, which may have some reference to St Mary Cray, or even an indirect or hidden reference to St. Mary Mead, the fictional home of Agatha Christie's sleuth Miss Marple. The characters are: Captain and Mrs Cherry; Jimmy Cherry; Jane Cherry; Roy Cherry; Pam Cherry; Mr Watson the monkey; Joseph the parrot; Mr and Mrs Wilks the neighbours; Sally Wilks; Mr Wilks’ brother from the Isle of Wight; Mr and Mrs. Pringle; Joe Pringle; Betty Pringle; Mrs. Pearl the cleaner from Marigold Cottages; Mr Mount the baker. The fictional father Captain Cherry is a retired explorer whose name may be a reference to Apsley Cherry-Garrard.|$|E

500|$|Pixar, which {{produced}} short animated films {{to promote their}} computers, was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature after {{the success of their}} short film Tin Toy (1988), which is told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton and Docter wrote early story treatments which were thrown out by Disney, as they wanted the film to be edgier. After disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was re-written, better reflecting the tone and theme Pixar desired: that [...] "toys deeply want children to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> and that this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions". The studio, then consisting of {{a relatively small number of}} employees, produced the film under minor financial constraintsz ...|$|E
500|$|The breed {{is often}} {{described}} by the Latin phrase multum in parvo, or [...] "much in little" [...] or [...] "a lot of dog in a small space", alluding to the Pug's remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size. Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of children and sturdy enough to properly <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Depending on their owner's mood, they can be quiet and docile but also vivacious and teasing. Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of their owners and are usually eager to please them. Pugs are playful and thrive on human companionship. They also {{tend to have a}} snoozy nature and {{spend a lot of time}} napping. Pugs are often called [...] "shadows" [...] because they follow their owners around and like to stay close to the action, craving attention and affection from their owners.|$|E
500|$|The group {{organised}} several informal jam {{sessions in}} 2000, inviting local musicians to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> at Faiumu's home. These sessions led to four new members joining Fat Freddy's Drop: Warren Maxwell on tenor and alto saxophone, Tehimana Kerr on guitar, Iain Gordon on keyboards, and Joe Lindsay on trombone. Like the original three, the new members played {{with other groups}} in and around Wellington, and continued to for most of Fat Freddy's Drop's career. Iain Gordon was a fellow Bongmaster member with Faiumu and Tamaira. Gordon was {{also a member of}} the band Ebb which in 2001 performed an audiovisual concert and released an EP titled Plush Bomb, with Fat Freddy's Drop playing in support. Maxwell was in the reggaemusic group TrinityRoots. Maxwell and Joe Lindsay, who make up the horn section of Fat Freddy's Drop, were students at the Conservatorium of Music in Wellington in the mid-1990s.

500|$|The Little Fire Chief is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on a young boy, Willie Stone, who follows a parade of firemen and attempts to join them as their leader. The firemen find it humorous and allow him to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> The fire alarm sounds and Willie attempts to join them, but is too slow. On their way back, Willie holds them up and his sister appears. A fireman named Jack, who has affections for the woman, convinces Willie to be relieved of his [...] "command" [...] by promising to call him later. Marie Eline {{played the role of}} Willie Stone, but the other two credits are claimed to have been William Garwood and Mignon Anderson. The rest of the cast and credits are unknown. The film was released on November 8, 1910 and {{does not appear to have}} had any reviews in the usual trade publications. The film was advertised nationally and was claimed to have been popular in Vancouver, Canada. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, the NHL faced {{competition}} from the newly formed World Hockey Association (WHA). [...] The WHA lured many players away from the NHL, including Derek Sanderson, J. C. Tremblay and Ted Green. [...] The WHA's biggest coup was to lure Bobby Hull from the Black Hawks {{to play for the}} Winnipeg Jets. [...] Hull signed a 10-year deal: five years as a player for $250,000 per season, and five more for $100,000 per season in a front-office position. [...] It also included a $1million signing bonus. [...] The deal totaled $2.7million, and lent instant credibility to the new league. After Hull signed, several other players quickly followed suit. Bernie Parent, Gerry Cheevers, Johnny McKenzie and Rick Ley jumped to the WHA as the NHL suddenly found itself in a war for talent. By the time the 1972–73 WHA season began, 67 players had switched from the NHL to the WHA. [...] Defections continued following the season, and the WHA scored another major coup when it signed Gordie Howe's sons Mark and Marty. [...] The league then convinced Gordie to come out of retirement to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> on the Houston Aeros.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{treatment for}} Toy Story, drafted by Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter, had {{little in common}} with the eventually finished film. It paired Tinny, the one-man band from Tin Toy with a ventriloquist's dummy and sent them on a sprawling odyssey. Under studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg, Woody was the main villain, abusing the other toys until they rallied against him; however, after Disney executives saw the storyboards they relinquished creative control to Pixar. The core idea of Toy Story was present from the treatment onward, however: that [...] "toys deeply want children to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> and that this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions." [...] Katzenberg felt the original treatment was problematic and told Lasseter to reshape Toy Story as more of an odd-couple buddy picture, and suggested they watch some classic buddy movies, such as The Defiant Ones and 48 Hrs., in which two characters with different attitudes are thrown together and have to bond. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter emerged in early September 1991 with the second treatment, and although the lead characters were still Tinny and the dummy, the outline of the final film was beginning to take shape.|$|E
