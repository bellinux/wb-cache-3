40|$|As {{the average}} family income and living {{standard}} increase, both the people and governments {{are becoming more and}} more aware of the environmental issues. Hoping to be part of the solutions for ameliorating the environment issues, thus people and governments started purchasing green products or conducting green procurements. Many corporations saw this whole new green product consumption trend as a brand new opportunity for profit expansion, and started offering all kinds of green product as alternatives to traditional commercial goods. As a result, the number of the sales for green product or the demand for green product is increasing every year. However, the rate for the demand of green products is not climbing as fast as expected. There are many factors may accelerate the rate for demand of green products, for example financial incentives offered by either governments or retailers, and taxation on the non-green products. Whether these factors actually affect the demand is uncertain, which create uncertainties for the retailers to precisely predict the procurement quantity for green product to avoid inventory risk. In order to resolve the procurement problem caused by uncertainties, this thesis proposes using portfolio contracts to mitigate the inventory risk. The portfolio consists of three types of contract: structured (S), option, and short term (ST) contracts. The option contract is the key of this <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> where it uses the concept of real options to grants retailers the flexibility in adjusting order quantity for green products. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model is used to calculate the option price. Simulations are conducted to analyze effectiveness of the portfolio contracts. The simulation creates different green product demand lines bases on the data of historical sales of paper products of Cheng Loong Corporation. The total cost for procuring with portfolio contracts is compared with extreme case of only S contract to see the effectiveness. The simulation results found that (1) switching contract type from long-term only to a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> can lower procurement costs, (2) a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> generates even less procurement costs compare to a long-term contract only as market volatility increases to 80 %, (3) the unit price with option contract affects the overall procurement cost, (4) the simulation result indicates that, the S contract volume inside the portfolio should be around 96 % of the minimum demand of previous year to mitigate procurement cost, (5) increasing option contract volume inside the portfolio generates less procurement cost compare to a long-term contract only. However, the simulation result shows option contract volume exceeding 70 % wanes the cost benefit of a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> and (6) the minimum procurement cost can be achieved, if a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> has the appropriate contract volume and unit price of green product.

Abstract: This paper {{presents}} and analyzes {{the results of a}} recent field experiment in which residential electricity customers in Washington State with price-responsive in-home devices could use those devices to change their electricity consumption autonomously. Doing so also required an important institutional change: the regulatory institutions had to change to allow dynamic pricing. Customers could choose a retail pricing contract from a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> instead of the fixed, regulated retail rate. Here we focus on the results of the real-time contract, under which homeowners participate in a double auction with a market clearing occurring every five minutes. These customers saved money, and their peak demand (and pressure on infrastructure at peak capacity) fell by 15 percent. Moreover, this combination of technology and institutional design enabled decentralized coordination, and we use complexity science to interpret results that show that the real-time market outcomes were those of a self-organizing and scalable complex adaptive system.

40|$|The credit {{crisis and}} the ongoing European {{sovereign}} debt crisis have highlighted the native form of credit risk, namely the counterparty risk. The related credit valuation adjustment (CVA), debt valuation adjustment (DVA), liquidity valuation adjustment (LVA) and replacement cost (RC) issues, jointly referred to in this paper as total valuation adjustment (TVA), have been thoroughly investigated in the theoretical papers [7] and [8]. The present work provides an executive summary and numerical companion to these papers, through which the TVA pricing problem {{can be reduced to}} Markovian pre-default TVA BSDEs. The first step consists in the counterparty clean valuation of a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> which is the valuation in a hypothetical situation where the two parties would be risk-free and funded at a risk-free rate. In the second step, the TVA is obtained as the value of an option on the counterparty clean value process called contingent credit default swap (CCDS).

We examine a multi-period model where expected profit is optimized, and a single-period model where a mean-variance objective is considered.

40|$|Artículos en revistasWe {{present a}} new {{methodology}} {{to support an}} energy trading company (ETC) to devise contracting strategies under an optimal risk-averse renewable portfolio. The uncertainty in the generation of renewable energy sources is accounted for by exogenously simulated scenarios, as is customary in stochastic programming. However, we recognize that spot prices largely depend on unpredictable market conditions, {{making it difficult to}} capture its underlying stochastic process, which challenges the use of fundamental approaches for forecasting. Under such framework, industry practices make use of stress tests to validate portfolios. We then adapt the robust optimization approach to perform an endogenous stress test for the spot prices {{as a function of the}} buy-and-sell <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> and renewable energy generation scenarios. The optimal contracting strategy is built through a bilevel optimization model that uses a hybrid approach, mixing stochastic and robust optimization. The proposed model is flexible to represent the traditional stochastic programming approach and to express the ETC's uncertainty aversion in the case where the price distribution cannot be precisely estimated. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated with examples from the Brazilian market, where the proposed approach is contrasted to its stochastic counterpart and both are benchmarked against observed market variables. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{intends to}} lay down {{innovative}} foundations for valuing contracts or portfolios of contracts under counterparty risk and {{in the presence of}} netting agreements. The approach departs from the usual methods for pricing contracts, and portfolios of contracts, with counterparty risk found in the literature. In effect, typically, these models, first, do not account for either systemic effects or 'at first default' contagion, second, postulate that the contract value at default equals either the default-free value or the pre-default value, and third, do not take margin agreements into account. Instead, we propose a general framework which allows for examining the bilateral counterparty risk of a contract, or a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts,</b> in the presence of systemic and 'right or wrong way' risks, and under several settlement conventions, possibly with netting, and margin agreements. The methodology, which has been designed to cover a large class of financial instruments, is illustrated by means of numerous examples, such as an interest rate swap, a credit default swap, a collateralized debt obligation, and a credit index. In effect, suitable extensions of Kusuoka's models are constructed in order to present the approach as well as analyse the specifics of valuation and hedging under counterparty risk. The results are then leveraged so as to build an efficient and versatile model for pricing under counterparty risk, namely an affine Markov chain model which accounts for settlement convention, dependency of times of default, contagion effect at first default, right or wrong way risk, collateralization and systemic risk. Let us also emphasize that the pricing procedures are presented in detail, which should give readily implementable pricing algorithms for practitioners...|$|E
