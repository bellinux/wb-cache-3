40|$|An {{overview}} of pre-flight aerodynamic {{models for the}} Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) Supersonic Flight Dynamics Test (SFDT) campaign is presented, with comparisons to reconstructed flight data and discussion of model updates. The SFDT campaign objective is to test Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD) and large supersonic parachute technologies at high altitude Earth conditions relevant to entry, descent, and landing (EDL) at Mars. Nominal SIAD test conditions are attained by lifting a test vehicle (TV) to 36 km altitude with a large helium balloon, then accelerating the TV to Mach 4 and and 53 km altitude with a solid rocket motor. The first flight test (SFDT- 1) delivered a 6 meter diameter robotic mission class decelerator (SIAD-R) to several seconds of flight on June 28, 2014, and was successful in demonstrating the SFDT flight system concept and SIAD-R. The trajectory was off-nominal, however, lofting to over 8 km higher than predicted in flight simulations. Comparisons between reconstructed flight data and aerodynamic models show that SIAD-R aerodynamic performance was in good agreement with pre-flight predictions. Similar comparisons of <b>powered</b> <b>ascent</b> <b>phase</b> aerodynamics show that the pre-flight model overpredicted TV pitch stability, leading to underprediction of trajectory peak altitude. Comparisons between pre-flight aerodynamic models and reconstructed flight data are shown, and changes to aerodynamic models using improved fidelity and knowledge gained from SFDT- 1 are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Boeing-Canoga Park (BCP) and NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (NASA-MSFC) are {{developing}} an Advanced Health Management System (AHMS) {{for use on}} the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) that will improve Shuttle safety by reducing the probability of catastrophic engine failures during the <b>powered</b> <b>ascent</b> <b>phase</b> of a Shuttle mission. This is a phased approach that consists of an upgrade to the current Space Shuttle Main Engine Controller (SSMEC) to add turbomachinery synchronous vibration protection and addition of a separate Health Management Computer (HMC) that will utilize advanced algorithms to detect and mitigate predefined engine anomalies. The purpose of the Shuttle AHMS is twofold; one {{is to increase the}} probability of successfully placing the Orbiter into the intended orbit, and the other is to increase the probability of being able to safely execute an abort of a Space Transportation System (STS) launch. Both objectives are achieved by increasing the useful work envelope of a Space Shuttle Main Engine after it has developed anomalous performance during launch and the ascent phase of the mission. This increase in work envelope will be the result of two new anomaly mitigation options, in addition to existing engine shutdown, that were previously unavailable. The added anomaly mitigation options include engine throttle-down and performance correction (adjustment of engine oxidizer to fuel ratio), as well as enhanced sensor disqualification capability. The HMC is intended to provide the computing power necessary to diagnose selected anomalous engine behaviors and for making recommendations to the engine controller for anomaly mitigation. Independent auditors have assessed the reduction in Shuttle ascent risk to be on the order of 40 % with the combined system and a three times improvement in mission success...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} ascent guidance algorithm for rocket-powered launch vehicles is developed. The ascent guidance {{function is}} responsible for commanding attitude, throttle and setting during the <b>powered</b> <b>ascent</b> <b>phase</b> of flight so that the vehicle attains target cutoff conditions in a near-optimal manner while satisfying path constraints such as maximum allowed bending moment and maximum allowed axial acceleration. This algorithm cyclically solves the calculus-of-variations two-point boundary-value problem starting at vertical rise completion through orbit insertion. This is different from traditional ascent guidance algorithms which operate in an open-loop mode until the high dynamic pressure portion of the trajectory is over, at which time there is a switch to a closed loop guidance mode that operates under the assumption of negligible aerodynamic forces. The main contribution {{of this research is}} an algorithm of the predictor-corrector type wherein the state/costate system is propagated with known (navigated) initial state and guessed initial costate to predict the state/costate at engine cutoff. The initial costate guess is corrected, using a multi-dimensional Newtons method, based on errors in the terminal state constraints and the transversality conditions. Path constraints are enforced within the propagation process. A modified multiple shooting method is shown to be a very effective numerical technique for this application. Results for a single stage to orbit launch vehicle are given. In addition, the formulation for the free final time multi-arc trajectory optimization problem is given. Results for a two-stage launch vehicle burn-coast-burn ascent to orbit in a closed-loop guidance mode are shown. An abort to landing site formulation of the algorithm and numerical results are presented. A technique for numerically treating the transversality conditions is discussed that eliminates part of the analytical and coding burden associated with optimal control theory. Ph. D.

5000|$|When {{launching}} a spacecraft to orbit, a [...] "dogleg" [...] is a guided, <b>powered</b> turn during <b>ascent</b> <b>phase</b> that causes a rocket's flight path {{to deviate from}} a [...] "straight" [...] path. A dogleg is necessary if the desired launch azimuth, to reach a desired orbital inclination, would take the ground track over land (or over a populated area, e.g. Russia usually does launch over land, but over unpopulated areas), or if the rocket is trying to reach an orbital plane that does not reach the latitude of the launch site. Doglegs are undesirable due to extra onboard fuel required, causing heavier load, and a reduction of vehicle performance.|$|R

The latest in the POES series of spacecraft, named as NOAA-KLMNN, is in orbit and four more are in various phases of development. The NOAA-K spacecraft was launched on May 13, 1998.

40|$|Diving {{animals have}} to counter both drag and {{buoyancy}} when {{moving through the}} water column. The magnitude of these forces depends upon an animal's swim speed and current depth. Feet, fins or flippers create a motivating force, and different stroke strategies give a variable level of output power, providing both fast swim speeds and reduced travel times to any given target depth. However, while feet, fins or flippers may confer a real advantage, they also create considerable drag and engender high metabolic (oxygen consumption) costs. Consequently, {{there should be an}} optimal relationship between output power and stroke frequency during diving. Here we develop diving models to predict the optimal pattern of stroke frequency during both the descent and <b>ascent</b> <b>phase</b> of divers in water, while maintaining a minimum cost of transport (COT, J kg(- 1) m(- 1)). We also test predictions derived from these models using diving data for foot-propelled South Georgian shags Phalacrocorax georgianus diving to deeper than 80 m. Our predictions include: (1) output power (stroke frequency) should decline during the descent and <b>ascent</b> <b>phases</b> of a dive, but constant output power should be evident when the diving depth is shallow, (2) initial thrust for dives to deeper target depths should be smaller during the descent phase and greater during the <b>ascent</b> <b>phase,</b> and, (3) swim speed should be constant during the descent phase and should decrease first or remain constant, then increase during the <b>ascent</b> <b>phase</b> because of a declining output power strategy. Our empirical data on shags support only some of these predictions. Predictions (1) and (3) were supported by our observations, but Prediction (2) was not, possibly due to unknown but specific factors concerning diving seabirds. These findings suggest that diving seabirds adjust and control their stroke frequency pattern in order to minimize COT during diving, generating the observed changes in swimming speed...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{design of}} stratospheric balloon {{payloads}} usually {{focuses on the}} cruise phase of the missions, that is, the floating altitude conditions. The <b>ascent</b> <b>phase</b> usually takes between 2 and 4 h, a very small period compared to {{the duration of the}} whole mission, which can last up to 4 weeks. However, during this phase payloads are subjected to very harsh conditions due mainly to the convective cooling that occurs as the balloon passes through the cold atmosphere, with minimum temperatures in the tropopause. The aim of this work is to study the thermal behaviour of a payload carried by a long duration balloon during the <b>ascent</b> <b>phase.</b> Its temperature has been calculated {{as a function of the}} altitude from sea level to floating conditions. To perform this analysis it has been assumed that the thermal interactions (convection and radiation) depend on the altitude, on the environmental conditions (which in turn depend also on the altitude) and on the temperature of the system itself.
