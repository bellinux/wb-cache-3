5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E
5|$|This {{follows from}} the fact that finding Hamiltonian cycles in maximal planar graphs is NP-complete. In a maximal <b>planar</b> <b>graph,</b> the book {{thickness}} is two if and only if a Hamiltonian cycle exists. Therefore, it is also NP-complete to test whether the book thickness of a given maximal <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> is two.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the dual}} graph {{depends on a}} {{particular}} embedding, the dual graph of a <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> is not unique {{in the sense that}} the same <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> can have non-isomorphic dual graphs.

The upper red dual has a vertex with degree 6 (corresponding to the outer face of the blue graph) while in the lower red graph all degrees are less than 6.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA labeled graph G with {{chromatic}} number n {{is called}} uniquely n-colorable or simply uniquely colorable if every two partitions {{of the point}} set of G into n color classes are the same.

5|$|Historically, {{the first}} form of graph duality to be {{recognized}} was the association of the Platonic solids into pairs of dual polyhedra. Graph duality is a topological generalization of the geometric concepts of dual polyhedra and dual tessellations, and is in turn generalized algebraically by {{the concept of a}} dual matroid. Variations of <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> duality include a version of duality for directed graphs, and duality for graphs embedded onto non-planar two-dimensional surfaces.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> theory.|$|E
5|$|The duality between Eulerian and bipartite planar graphs can be {{extended}} to binary matroids (which include the graphic matroids derived from planar graphs): a binary matroid is Eulerian {{if and only if}} its dual matroid is bipartite. The two dual concepts of girth and edge connectivity are unified in matroid theory by matroid girth: the girth of the graphic matroid of a <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> {{is the same as the}} graph's girth, and the girth of the dual matroid (the graphic matroid of the dual graph) is the edge connectivity of the graph.|$|E
40|$|A $k$-subcoloring of a graph is a {{partition}} of the vertex set into at most $k$ cluster graphs, that is, graphs with no induced $P_ 3 $. 2 -subcoloring {{is known to}} be NP-complete for comparability graphs and three subclasses of <b>planar</b> <b>graphs,</b> namely triangle-free <b>planar</b> <b>graphs</b> with maximum degree 4, <b>planar</b> perfect <b>graphs</b> with maximum degree 4, and <b>planar</b> <b>graphs</b> with girth 5.

25|$|As well {{as being}} defined by {{recursive}} subdivision of triangles, the Apollonian networks have several other equivalent mathematical characterizations. They are the chordal maximal <b>planar</b> <b>graphs,</b> the chordal polyhedral <b>graphs,</b> and the <b>planar</b> 3-trees. They are the uniquely 4-colorable <b>planar</b> <b>graphs,</b> and the <b>planar</b> <b>graphs</b> with a unique Schnyder wood decomposition into three trees. They are the maximal <b>planar</b> <b>graphs</b> with treewidth three, a class of graphs that can be characterized by their forbidden minors or by their reducability under Y-Δ transforms. They are the maximal <b>planar</b> <b>graphs</b> with degeneracy three. They are also the <b>planar</b> <b>graphs</b> on a given number of vertices that have the largest possible number of triangles, the largest possible number of tetrahedral subgraphs, the largest possible number of cliques, and the largest possible number of pieces after decomposing by separating triangles.|$|R
40|$|In {{this and}} the next lecture, we will explore {{spectral}} properties of <b>planar</b> <b>graphs.</b> I’ll also spend some time telling you other important facts about <b>planar</b> <b>graphs.</b> <b>Planar</b> <b>graphs</b> relate {{to some of the}} most exciting parts of graph theory, and it would be a shame for you not to know something about them...|$|R
5|$|In {{directed}} planar graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, {{and in which}} every edge belongs to a cycle) are dual to directed acyclic graphs in which no edge belongs to a cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> (assignments of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to acyclic orientations (assignments of directions that produce a directed acyclic graph).|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a dual {{tessellation}} can also be applied to partitions of the plane into finitely many regions. It {{is closely related to}} but not quite the same as <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> duality in this case. For instance, the Voronoi diagram of a finite set of point sites is a partition of the plane into polygons within which one site is closer than any other. The sites on the convex hull of the input give rise to unbounded Voronoi polygons, two of whose sides are infinite rays rather than finite line segments. The dual of this diagram is the Delaunay triangulation of the input, a <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> that connects two sites by an edge whenever there exists a circle that contains those two sites and no other sites. The edges of the convex hull of the input are also edges of the Delaunay triangulation, but they correspond to rays rather than line segments of the Voronoi diagram. This duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations can be turned into a duality between finite graphs in either of two ways: by adding an artificial vertex at infinity to the Voronoi diagram, to serve as the other endpoint for all of its rays, or by treating the bounded part of the Voronoi diagram as the weak dual of the Delaunay triangulation. Although the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation are dual, their embedding in the plane may have additional crossings beyond the crossings of dual pairs of edges. Each vertex of the Delaunay triangle is positioned within its corresponding face of the Voronoi diagram. Each vertex of the Voronoi diagram is positioned at the circumcenter of the corresponding triangle of the Delaunay triangulation, but this point may lie outside its triangle.|$|E
5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph {{is defined as the}} family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> (the dimension of its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E

5|$|An arc diagram or linear {{embedding}} places vertices of a graph along a line, {{and draws}} {{the edges of}} the graph as semicircles either above or below this line, sometimes also allowing edges to be drawn on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds to a book embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also be drawn in a similar way, by allowing their edges to be represented by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book embedding by the usual definition, but has been called a topological book embedding. For every <b>planar</b> <b>graph,</b> it is always possible to find such an embedding in which each edge crosses the spine at most once.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a <b>planar</b> <b>graph,</b> in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane {{as it does to}} finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite <b>planar</b> <b>graph</b> embedding can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E
