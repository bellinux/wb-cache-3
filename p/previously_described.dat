5|$|The taxonomic {{history of}} Eucteniza spiders {{includes}} nearly 20 named species and four genera; the three additional generic names are now considered taxonomic synonyms of Eucteniza, and several named species have similarly {{been determined to}} be synonyms of <b>previously</b> <b>described</b> species.|$|E
5|$|In his {{landmark}} Flora Australiensis (1869), George Bentham {{argued that}} several <b>previously</b> <b>described</b> species {{were in fact}} a single species – E. impressa, uniting E. variabilis, a short red-flowered E. campanulata, E. ruscifolia, which had narrow leaves and long flowers, the white-flowered E. nivalis, and short white-flowered E. ceraeflora. He re-classified as a separate species – E. reclinata – several plants that Allan Cunningham had collected in the Blue Mountains and classified as E. impressa.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon {{published}} {{the first official}} description of Geastrum quadrifidum in 1794, and later sanctioned this name in his 1801 Synopsis Methodica Fungorum (as Geastrum quadrifidum var. minus, a variety now considered synonymous with G.quadrifidum). Although the species had been <b>previously</b> <b>described</b> as Lycoperdon coronatum by Jacob Christian Schaeffer (1763) and Giovanni Antonio Scopoli (1772), then afterward as Geaster coronatus by Joseph Schröter (1889), the epithet coronatus {{is not to be}} used because of the existence of the sanctioned name.|$|E

5|$|A {{second letter}} {{arrived from the}} west, this time {{addressed}} to Cope. The writer, O. W. Lucas, was a naturalist who had been collecting plants near Cañon City, Colorado when he came upon an assortment of fossil bones. After receiving more samples from Lucas, Cope concluded the dinosaurs were large herbivores, gleefully noting that the specimen was larger than any other <b>previously</b> <b>described,</b> including Lakes' discovery. Hearing of Lucas' finds, Marsh instructed Mudge and a former student, Samuel Wendell Williston, {{to set up a}} quarry on his behalf near Cañon. Unfortunately for Marsh, he learned from Williston that Lucas was finding the best bones and refused to quit Cope to come work for Marsh. Marsh ordered Williston back to Morrison, where Marsh's small quarry collapsed and nearly killed his assistants. This setback would have dried up Marsh's bone supply from the west, if not for receipt of a third letter.|$|E
5|$|In 1173 Henry {{faced the}} Great Revolt, an {{uprising}} by his eldest sons and rebellious barons, supported by France, Scotland and Flanders. A number of grievances underpinned the revolt. Young Henry was unhappy that, despite {{the title of}} king, in practice he made no real decisions and was kept chronically short of money by Henry. Young Henry had also been very attached to Thomas Becket, his former tutor, and may have held his father responsible for Becket's death. Geoffrey faced similar difficulties; Duke Conan of Brittany had died in 1171, but Geoffrey and Constance were still unmarried, leaving Geoffrey in limbo without his own lands. Richard was encouraged to join the revolt as well by Eleanor, whose relationship with Henry, as <b>previously</b> <b>described,</b> had disintegrated. Meanwhile, local barons unhappy with Henry's rule saw opportunities to recover traditional powers and influence by allying themselves with his sons.|$|E
5|$|Morchella snyderi was {{described}} as new to science in 2012, along with 13 other morels from the United States and Canada. The study, {{published in the journal}} Mycologia, resulted from the Morel Data Collection Project, which aimed to help clarify the taxonomy, biology, and distribution of morel species in North America. The specific epithet honors Leon C. Snyder, who described similar morels in Washington state in the 1930s. According to Michael Kuo, who coauthored the species description, the morel should have been named Morchella crassistipa, as it was <b>previously</b> <b>described</b> by Snyder in 1938, from collections made in Washington. However, molecular analysis determined that Snyder's type collection contained two distinct species, rendering the validity of the taxon dubious. M.snyderi was also previously identified as phylogenetic species Mel-12 (i.e., defined by DNA sequence) in a 2011 study.|$|E

5|$|The first living koala in Britain {{arrived in}} 1881, {{purchased}} by the Zoological Society of London. As related by prosecutor to the society, William Alexander Forbes, the animal suffered an accidental demise when the heavy lid of a washstand fell on {{it and it was}} unable to free itself. Forbes used the opportunity to dissect the fresh female specimen, thus was able to provide explicit anatomical details on the female reproductive system, the brain, and the liver—parts not <b>previously</b> <b>described</b> by Owen, who had access only to preserved specimens. Scottish embryologist William Caldwell—well known in scientific circles for determining the reproductive mechanism of the platypus—described the uterine development of the koala in 1884, and used the new information to convincingly place the koala and the monotremes into an evolutionary time frame.|$|E
5|$|The <b>previously</b> <b>described</b> {{study by}} Timby et al. (2015) also {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced {{a significant reduction in}} episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants’ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E
