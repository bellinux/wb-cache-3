5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a <b>powered</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E
2500|$|Although tiltrotors {{such as the}} Focke-Achgelis Fa 269 of the mid-1940s and the Centro Técnico Aeroespacial [...] "Convertiplano" [...] of the 1950s reached testing or mock-up stages, the V-22 Osprey is {{considered}} the world's first production tiltrotor aircraft. It has one three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. The Osprey is a multi-mission aircraft with both a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and short takeoff and landing capability (STOL). It is designed to perform missions like a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. The FAA classifies the Osprey {{as a model of}} <b>powered</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft.|$|E
50|$|With <b>powered</b> <b>lift,</b> the {{aircraft}} directs its engine thrust vertically downward. V/STOL aircraft, {{such as the}} Harrier Jump Jet and F-35B take off and land vertically using <b>powered</b> <b>lift</b> and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight.|$|E

50|$|<b>Powered</b> <b>lift</b> types rely on engine-derived lift for {{vertical}} takeoff {{and landing}} (VTOL). Most types transition to fixed-wing lift for horizontal flight. Classes of <b>powered</b> <b>lift</b> types include VTOL jet aircraft (such as the Harrier jump-jet) and tiltrotors (such as the V-22 Osprey), among others. A few experimental designs rely entirely on engine thrust to provide lift {{throughout the whole}} flight, including personal fan-lift hover platforms and jetpacks. VTOL research designs include the flying Bedstead.|$|E

5000|$|Variable incidence: {{the wing}} plane can tilt upwards or {{downwards}} {{relative to the}} fuselage. The wing on the Vought F-8 Crusader was rotated, lifting the leading edge on takeoff to improve performance. If powered prop-rotors are fitted to the wing to allow vertical takeoff or STOVL performance, merges into the <b>powered</b> <b>lift</b> category.|$|E
50|$|Heavier-than-air aircraft, such as airplanes, {{must find}} some way to push air or gas downwards, so that a {{reaction}} occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the aircraft upwards. This dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term aerodyne. There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust: aerodynamic lift, and <b>powered</b> <b>lift</b> in the form of engine thrust.|$|E
50|$|The PA-97 {{was built}} under a 1980 U.S. Navy {{contract}} for the Forest Service to demonstrate a heavy vertical airlifter for harvesting timber from inaccessible terrain.

50|$|Richard E. Hayden (b. March 23, 1946) is a {{specialist}} in acoustics. He earned a BS from Norwich University and an MS from Purdue University, after which he joined Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, where he embarked on a research program in the acoustics of flow/surface interactions. He won the Wright Brothers Medal in 1973 for a paper entitled Fundamental Aspects of Noise Reduction From <b>Powered</b> <b>Lift</b> Devices.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, a NASA C-8A Buffalo (nicknamed Bisontennial in 1976) was {{fitted with a}} short-span Boeing wing {{incorporating}} split-flow turbofan engines based on the Rolls-Royce Spey (providing both propulsion and augmentor airflow for the <b>powered</b> <b>lift</b> system). Beginning in 1972 with its first flight in this experimental configuration, this aircraft was used jointly by the NASA Ames Research Center and the Canadian Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce for STOL research.|$|E
50|$|The term {{may be used}} {{to refer}} {{specifically}} to those systems that use internal ductwork within the wing to direct the airflow, or more broadly to systems like upper surface blowing or nozzle systems on conventional underwing engine which that direct air through the flaps. Blown flaps are one solution among a broader category known as <b>powered</b> <b>lift,</b> which also includes various boundary layer control systems, systems using directed prop wash, and circulation control wings.|$|E

Material: the research covered 73 students of 18 - 22 yrs. Age, who have different training experience.

Psychological diagnostic {{was conducted by}} methodic of M. V. Makarenko. Results: different psycho-physiological characteristics, indicators of psychological state and personality’s features were found in students, depending on their <b>power</b> <b>lifting</b> training experience.
