25|$|With two-time championship-winning {{head coach}} Paul Henare departing the Sharks after three seasons {{at the helm}} {{to take up the}} role of head coach for the New Zealand Tall Blacks, the Sharks nabbed former New Zealand Breakers {{assistant}} and long-time Breakers Academy coordinator Judd Flavell to replace Henare in 2016. After valuable role player Duane Bailey re-signed with the team on a two-year deal shortly after the appointment of Flavell, Bailey's New Zealand Breakers teammate Alex <b>Pledger</b> was signed up by the Sharks for a return to the league in 2016. <b>Pledger</b> was named league MVP in 2011 while playing for the Waikato Pistons, and garnered Finals MVP honours in 2012 while playing for the Auckland Pirates. The Sharks began building their roster with the signings of Everard Bartlett and Derone Raukawa, and the re-signing of stalwart forward James Paringatai. The Sharks later signed Townsville Crocodiles pair Nick Kay and Jordair Jett as the two imports, following on the tradition of Crocodiles imports, having had Brian Conklin and Todd Blanchfield in previous years.|$|E
25|$|Much of the Sharks' squad was {{retained}} for the 2017 season, as they re-signed Illawarra Hawks import-duo Nick Kay and Mitch Norton, {{and brought}} back Alex <b>Pledger,</b> Hayden Allen, Duane Bailey and Derone Raukawa. To complement their roster, the Sharks picked up Luke Aston, James Hunter and Reuben Te Rangi. The Sharks had a difficult season {{with a host of}} players being in and out because of different injuries. Derone Raukawa, Hayden Allen, Alex <b>Pledger,</b> and Duane Bailey all spent time on the sideline nursing injury. As a result, the Sharks finished the season in second place behind the undefeated Wellington Saints (18–0) with a 12–6 record. They did however have another stellar home campaign. In their regular season finale, the Sharks defeated the Hawke's Bay Hawks 89–86 in Invercargill. The win took Southland's home record to eight wins and one loss. The only loss was against the high-flying Wellington Saints in a fixture which went down to the last possession. Their Final Four campaign saw them reach the grand final after defeating the Super City Rangers in their semi-final clash, but they were knocked over at the final hurdle as they were beaten 108–75 by the Saints in the championship decider.|$|E

50|$|A fifth peer-reviewed study, also by Janet Rosenbaum {{published}} in the journal Pediatrics in 2009, found no difference in sexual behavior of <b>pledgers</b> and similar non-pledgers five years after pledging, but found <b>pledgers</b> were 10 percentage points less likely to use condoms and 6 percentage points less likely to use birth control than similar non-pledgers. Rosenbaum's study was innovative for using Rubin causal model matching, instead of relying on regression analysis, which makes potentially untrue parametric assumptions. According to Rosenbaum, past research findings that virginity <b>pledgers</b> delayed sex may have been affected by their statistical method's inability to adjust fully for pre-existing differences between <b>pledgers</b> and non-pledgers: <b>pledgers</b> are much more negative towards premarital sex prior to even taking the pledge, so would be predicted to delay sex even if they hadn't taken the pledge. Comparing <b>pledgers</b> with similar non-pledgers {{is the only way to}} be certain that the effect comes from the pledge rather than the pre-existing greater beliefs of <b>pledgers</b> that sexuality should be restrained to the matrimonial context.|$|R
50|$|The {{efficacy}} of virginity pledges {{has been extensively}} studied. Some {{studies have found that}} virginity pledges may be effective at delaying vaginal intercourse, but that they are ineffective in reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) because <b>pledgers</b> may replace vaginal intercourse with other sexual activities, such as oral sex and anal sex; other research, however, has suggested no such substitution among <b>pledgers,</b> though <b>pledgers</b> may partake in vaginal or oral sex. Virginity pledges may also reduce the likelihood of contraceptive use once <b>pledgers</b> decide to engage in sex. Though studies have reported this and found that <b>pledgers</b> are more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who do not pledge and that those who do become sexually active report fewer sexual partners, at least one study found no difference in the sexual behavior of <b>pledgers</b> and non-pledgers after controlling for pre-existing differences between the groups.|$|R

2500|$|Film critic Scott Mendelson, {{writing in}} The Huffington Post, cited Scully {{as an example}} of strong female {{characters}} on television, calling her [...] "one of the most iconic characters in the science-fiction genre". Radio Times Laura <b>Pledger</b> also named her as a strong TV woman, placing her at #1. Rebecca Traister of Salon.com opined that Scully had a better character arc than Mulder. She wrote, [...] "The very fact that her character was such a hard sell made her repeated brushes with the supernatural all the more powerful. Mulder's desire to believe was so expansive, his credulity so flexible, that it's not as though he was ever going to have either shaken from him. But Scully's surety was solid, stable, rigid; every time she saw something she thought she'd never see, we saw it crack, sparks fly from it. She was forced to question herself, grow, change". She praised her for being more [...] "rational, resilient, [...] mature" [...] than her partner and for their mature relationship. In a review of [...] "Irresistible", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that it was a cliché to put Scully in danger, as [...] "Scully is [...] heart, and any time she's in danger, it feels like the show itself is about to be stabbed through the heart".|$|E
2500|$|Fr Hawkins was {{succeeded by}} Fr Maurice <b>Pledger,</b> under whose five-year {{ministry}} St Joseph's Church at Milford and the Church of Our Lady of Assumption in Elstead were opened. [...] The parish now had three churches. [...] Fr John McSheehy served {{for ten years}} from 1969 and established the first St Edmund's Catholic Primary School near Godalming town centre, and also opened dialogue with the Anglican Diocese of Guildford which culminated in Farncombe's Anglican church being used for weekly Catholic Masses, serving {{the population in the}} north of the parish. [...] During Fr Tony Clarke's incumbency (1980–1990), a new St Edmund's School was built and plans were made for a large new church to be built alongside it: the aim was to replace St Edmund's Church, the daughter churches at Milford and Elstead (the latter closed in 1985) and the Mass centre at Farncombe with a single central place of worship for the whole parish. [...] This never came to fruition, though, and land reserved for the proposed church next to the school was sold for residential development. [...] After Fr Clarke moved to St Mary of the Angels Church in Worthing, new priest Fr Bernard Rowley again took up the idea of centralising worship in a single church: he sought a site within Godalming town, and also considered the former Congregational chapel on Bridge Street which had been sold in 1977 and was in commercial use, but structural problems made it unsuitable for conversion back into a place of worship. [...] Fr Michael Perry, who joined the parish in 1994, instead arranged for St Edmund's and St Joseph's churches to be refurbished and improved. [...] The parish hall was sold in 1997 and was demolished in favour of a block of flats.|$|E
