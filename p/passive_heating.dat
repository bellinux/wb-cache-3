40|$|Rose, William C. It is {{well known}} that the {{prevalence}} of cardiovascular events is increased in extreme weather conditions. It has previously been shown that cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreases with heat stress, while the effect of heat stress on augmentation index and pulse wave velocity (PWV) has not been clearly investigated. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of passiveheat stress on CBF, PWV, and wave reflection. We measuredthe correlation between baseline measurements of Augmentation Index (AIx), PWV, wave reflection transit time (Tr) and changes in CBF. In addition, the correlation between changes in AIx, PWV, Tr and changes in CBF were also explored. We gathered data from sixteen apparently healthy young adults. Changes in variables from baseline to <b>passive</b> <b>heat</b> stress were evaluated with a paired t-test. While mean CBF did not significantly decline, it was found to trend downwards from baseline to <b>passive</b> <b>heat</b> stress (15 cm/s to 14. 9 cm/s, p= 0. 06). AIx was found to significantly decrease from a baseline of - 1 % to - 12 % during <b>passive</b> <b>heat</b> stress (p< 0. 05). PWV and Tr did not significantly change from baseline. There were no significant correlations found between variables. The present study is the first to demonstrate a decrease in AIx during <b>passive</b> <b>heat</b> stress. In conclusion, these data suggest that while CBF and AIx both decline under <b>passive</b> <b>heat</b> stress, it is not likely that a correlation between CBF and AIx leads to cardiovascular events in the heat.

50|$|In 1985 {{the city}} centre of Melbourne was {{in need of}} revitalization, with retail trading and {{cultural}} activities lagging behind its counterparts elsewhere in Australia and in Europe. Adams helped to write, and to put in place, the first comprehensive urban design strategy for the City, based on the idea of creating a vibrant and well populated street-scape profiting from the city's multi-mode transport system. He guided the strategy's implementation in several projects, which took place as the city recovered from economic recession in the late 1980s and was prepared to invest in the built environment. These included Postcode 3000 (bringing redundant buildings into use, particularly for apartments in the city centre), the redevelopment of Swanston Street as a pedestrian friendly street, the QV development, {{the creation of a new}} riverfront park called Birrarung Marr from under-used rail sidings, the Queensbridge Precinct, the Turning Basin, and the CH2 building which was the first purpose-built office building in Australia to achieve a maximum Six Green Star rating and which has <b>passive</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling, power generation and blackwater treatment.

50|$|The Chicago Center for Green Technology uses about 40% {{less energy}} than a {{building}} {{of the same size}} due to the multiple ways it gathers and conserves its energy. Solar panels on the roof, on awnings around the building, and an array of solar panels in a lot behind the building provide 20% of the building's energy. <b>Passive</b> <b>heating</b> is provided by large double-paned and insulated glass windows that also provide large amounts of light. Another source of heat or air-conditioning, depending on what season it is, comes from 28 vertical wells beneath the building that go to a depth of 200 feet, at which point the temperature is relatively constant. Water is pumped down the wells and then extracted, which helps cool the building in the summer and heat it in the winter. A smart lighting system throughout the building detects the amount of natural light and adjusts the amount of light provided by electricity. Scrap cork flooring and recycled glass bathroom tiles make up part of the building materials, which come from more than 40% recycled material. The Center for Green Technology has a green roof, which consists of 3 in of soil and plant matter. The green roof helps to absorb rainwater and insulate the building. Rainwater is released from downspouts into the soil, as opposed to the public sewer system, {{in order to reduce the}} amount of run-off contaminants in the sewers. The landscaping around the building is irrigated with rain water that is stored in cisterns, which helps reduce the amount of treated water from the city.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the merger}} of Northrup, Inc. into ARCO, Northrup became engaged in real estate development, {{including}} the assembly {{of one of the}} largest tracts of land in downtown Dallas, where he entered into a joint venture with James Rouse’s Enterprise Development Company to build a festival marketplace. This project was sold to a Belgian investment group who failed to pursue the project with Rouse. Northrup helped fund the establishment of Rouse's Enterprise Foundation affordable housing projects in Dallas. He also assembled tracts on 1½ miles of shoreline on Lewisville Lake, a part of which later became the city of The Colony. Northrup acquired 5,000 acres outside San Antonio, Texas, which was put into a trust for his family, and assembled land now occupied by the regional Rolex headquarters, among others. Northrup subsequently started American Limestone, an innovator in using surface quarried Texas limestone in building facades, using a patented method that employs thin panels of limestone as a veneer, attached to a metal grid without mortar. This popularized the use of rough cut limestone as a thin veneer in residential and commercial applications, including store fronts, such as Brooks Brothers, churches, bank buildings and municipal buildings. At the other extreme in size, Northrup has utilized massive blocks of limestone for their <b>passive</b> <b>heating</b> / cooling characteristics, and free-standing structural qualities, most notably donating the stone and devising the construction technique for the Cistercian Chapel in Irving, Texas, which reflects both a classic design aesthetic and construction technique of mortar-less masonry - a thoroughly modern building built in the rational style of Cistercian architecture.
