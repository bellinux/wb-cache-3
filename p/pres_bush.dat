50|$|On February 12, 1992, {{friction}} between the largely astronaut-based management at NASA and the National Space Council led to Richard Truly, then NASA Administrator and a former astronaut, being forced out. Truly was forced out after Vice President Quayle and the space council's executive director, Mark J. Albrecht, enlisted the aid of Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, in urging <b>Pres.</b> <b>Bush</b> to remove Truly. Quayle and the council staff made the move because they felt Truly would impede a new plan to restructure and streamline {{many aspects of the}} space program, including the space agency administration.|$|E

40|$|On Jan 7, 2005, <b>Pres</b> <b>Bush</b> {{established}} the President 2 ̆ 7 s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform. He asked the advisory panel to recommend reforms that would promote simplicity, fairness, and economic growth. Some tax reformers prefer a small fix to a drastic overhaul. Others believe that overhauling or replacing the current tax {{system is not}} politically possible, may cause economic disruption, would require new collection mechanisms, and could create new layers of bureaucracy. Some tax reformers want to replace the current income-based tax system with a consumption-based system. Edward J. McCaffery, Robert Packard Trustee of Law and Political Science at the University of Southern California, believes that individuals should pay tax when they spend, not when they work, save, give, or die.

Taxation of Business, 4. Taxation of International Transactions, and 5. Epilogue. The Panel 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations have received a mostly lukewarm reaction from {{the public and the}} media because, for many taxpayers, the recommendations are controversial. For some, the recommendations do not go far enough, because they would not tear out the old tax system by its roots and replace it with something new. The Panel 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations will likely shape the debate over tax reform in the years ahead, but its specific provisions are not likely to become law soon...|$|E

A polished, {{traditional}} documentary, Faust {{gives us}} unprecedented access and insider insight into Rice's role in Washington including {{the failure to}} pass along warning memos <b>pre</b> 9/11 to <b>Bush's</b> desk {{as well as her}} involvement in approving devastating torture interrogation techniques and shipping off suspects to other countries where more extreme measures were in dominant practice. Extremely timely and vital for American viewers to explore, Faust leaves us with both the question of how a person can change so much and additionally, wondering whether Rice or other staffers are guilty of war crimes. A triumph in independent documentary filmmaking precisely because it took the personal autobiographical feel of the first “festival circuit” feature as a jumping off point, American Faust is on par with hard-hitting documentaries including No End in Sight, Maxed Out, Rethink Afghanistan, and Fahrenheit 9/11, and ensures that Sebastian Doggart is a name you won't soon forget." ...|$|R
40|$|Christian and Muslim {{conflict}} in Southern Philippines intensified {{during the last}} few decades although a shared history dates back 435 years ago. The government has so far failed to deliver genuine peace and stability to 22 million people in Mindanao suffering from poverty, displacement, and bloodshed. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the international community became aware of Islamic fundamentalist movements in Southeast Asia. The US government linked a Filipino Muslim group, Abu Sayyaf, to Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, justifying the staging in Mindanao of what US <b>Pres.</b> George <b>Bush</b> said as the second largest 'war against terrorism' after Afghanistan. Whatever impact terrorist acts may have from Basilan to Manhattan, peace research is more urgent and significant than ever. This study looks at the causes of violence amongst Christian and Muslim Filipinos and consequently explores areas for peace by asking: "What are the reasons of conflict? Who are the actors and agenda-setters? How can a local conflict become linked to international terrorism? What are the ways and means of effective and immediate conflict resolution in Mindanao?" To acquire firsthand insight, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted in the Philippines in June-October 2002 using a 60 -day participant observation and the triangulation method for data gathering. Through snowball sampling, talks with different groups (government, military, rebels, academics, and NGOs) gave comprehensive and balanced analyses. Second, a quantitative survey of 400 youth respondents gave different views from Muslim and Christian perspectives, especially on concepts of alienation, animosity, and political participation. Finally, international newspaper reports, journals, and local publications were cautiously used as primary sources. Results showed contradictory views on the causes of conflict, whether economic, socio-political, or religious, depending on individuals and groups. Respondents said aggression was caused by economic neglect, frustration with the government, and lack of socio-political influence. Solutions offered are poverty alleviation, tolerance of socio-cultural diversity, strong leadership, and recognition of international peace agreements. Other means of conflict resolution involve empowering citizens, creating a balance of forces, channeling resources at the grassroots level, and cultivating a culture of peace. Endast sammandrag.

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} my brief remarks this {{afternoon}} {{is to use}} {{the life and times of}} Shirley Graham Du Bois as a vehicle for trying to understand how and why we need to think about revitalizing the radical tradition through the means of revisioning and rewriting our history, our past. I argue in these remarks that like other historians - for Shirley Graham Du Bois was among other things an historian - she tended to stress in her history writing, like most of the writers of her generation, the [...] "Crispus Attucks" [...] aspect of our history, I'm sure you're familiar with Crispus Attucks, he goes down in history as the first person to be slain in the uprising against British rule in then-British North America and a symbol of how black people have shed their blood to help to construct this country. Which of course is true and is accurate. But it only begins to tell part of the story, as I'll try to elaborate on in my remarks. I think today it's particularly important to talk about revitalizing our past so that we can reinvigorate the radical tradition in light of this precipitous downturn that we see in the capitalist economy. Newsweek has been amongst the many journals that have told us [...] "We're All Socialists Now", which some might be surprised to hear. In Latin America, certainly in the most recent election in El Salvador, and in Latin American generally, one can easily espy a shift to the left. The quipsters are suggesting that the recently departed <b>Pres.</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> entered office in 2001 as a social conservative but then after being compelled to nationalize various enterprises he leaves office as a conservative socialist. When you note that in South Africa you have a Communist Party minister sitting in office in Pretoria, and perhaps the same will take place in New Delhi, after the elections that take place in the late spring, it's time to revive that aspect it seems to me reality is shouting at us, time to revitalize that aspect of black history that stresses our ancestors who as early as the 18th century were actually trying to overthrow the government of the United States of America, as opposed to shedding their blood to help to create the government of the United States of America.|$|R
