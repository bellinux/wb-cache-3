5|$|The {{campaign}} was <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a decisive Israeli victory, causing reorganizations in the Syrian high command {{and the birth}} of heroic tales in Israel.

5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian {{adopted a}} policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian's Wall, which separated the Roman world from what was <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> an ever-present barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{dominant}} scholarly view during the late 19th {{and much of the}} 20th century, Roman religion was originally animistic, directed towards spirits associated with specific objects or activities which were only later <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> gods with independent personal existence. Terminus, with his lack of mythology and his close association with a physical object, seemed a clear example of a deity who had developed little from such a stage.|$|E

30|$|The {{premise of}} such studies {{is not based}} on an {{understanding}} of what users might <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> an unfit document [11], but rather on the assessment of the current ‘conservation state’ of the document and, in some cases, of the risk of damage by handling, <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> by conservation experts. Such perceived risk, however, still needs to be quantitatively justified by a study showing how wear and tear accumulates during use. Additionally, some of the above mentioned surveys are based on assessment elements, which users clearly do not <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> unacceptable change, e.g. yellowing or discolouration, tears or minor missing pieces [11].|$|R
5|$|After Singapore gained {{independence}} in 1965, the school {{came under the}} purview of the Ministry of Education and was accorded the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) status in 1979. Later, in 1988 the school achieved the status of an independent school, under a scheme that the ministry <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> proven successful and which was extended to other top schools in Singapore. On 19 March 1999, the school's clock tower was gazetted as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them to be <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded him as an unambiguously saintly figure, a status that he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing the}} {{preliminary}} pilot episode, however, Knauf and the producers {{realized there was}} no room for the character to grow in a television series. They demoted Brother Justin to an ordinary Christian minister in a little town, but when Brother Justin's affiliation needed to be decided, Knauf contested plans to make him a Catholic priest; he rather settled on the Methodist denomination, which he <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> significantly less suspicious and controversial. Although Brother Justin shares traits with Father Coughlin, an Irish Catholic priest who broadcast his sermons over the radio in the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.|$|E

5|$|All these controversies {{have led}} {{ethnic groups in}} Macedonia to use terms in {{conflicting}} ways. Despite {{the fact that these}} terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they may be <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> green.|$|E
