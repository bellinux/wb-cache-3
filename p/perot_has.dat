5000|$|In December 17, 1992, President George H.W. Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and Mexican President Carlos Salinas met in Texas to sign NAFTA, {{which would}} create a trilateral trade bloc and {{financial}} zone in North America. To take effect, NAFTA had to be ratified by the legislatures in the three countries. Long before the signing ceremony, Donahue was already leading a massive campaign by the AFL-CIO against US ratification. As early as February, 1991, “the AFL-CIO has made blocking a Mexican agreement its No. 1 legislative priority,” the New York Times reported. The main reasons for AFL-CIO opposition were that “it would {{pave the way for}} tens of thousands of… jobs to be exported to Mexico, and it would bump hundreds of thousands down the economic ladder to underemployment and low wages,” Donahue wrote. He condemned its “powerfully regressive effect” and noted, “The jobs that are most easily exported to Mexico are not those of probate attorneys, stockbrokers, economists, and editorial writers; they are the jobs of assembly-line workers and others who can least afford a massive disruption of their work lives.” [...] The AFL-CIO was certainly not the only opponent of NAFTA. Others included Ross Perot (among the most vocal critics of NAFTA), the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the National Farmers Union, the National Council of Senior Citizens, Ralph Nader’s Public Citizen, Jerry Brown’s We the People, and Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition. However, a pro-NAFTA editorial in the Washington Post complained that “it’s not Ross Perot but the labor movement that’s the central force in the campaign to kill NAFTA - the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. <b>Perot</b> <b>has</b> little following in Congress, but the unions have been working ferociously to line up their friends and campaign beneficiaries against the agreement.” [...] Donahue succeeded in mobilizing the entire trade union movement against NAFTA. The New York Times reported that “within the labor movement, the campaign against the accord extends far beyond the industrial unions…’Our self-interest is very similar,’ said Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. When factories close, he said, community tax revenues plunge, so teachers lose wages and jobs.” [...] Beyond the AFL-CIO, Donahue oversaw what the New York Times described as the federation’s “lobbying, petition drives and $3.2 million in billboard and radio advertising.” [...] He testified before Congress against NAFTA at least nine times. He appeared on such TV shows as NBC’s Meet the Press [...] and CNN’s Late Edition. He frequently wrote articles, letters to editors, and op-ed pieces for leading newspapers. And he built an unprecedented working coalition between the AFL-CIO and leading environmentalists, notably the Sierra Club and the National Toxics Campaign - the strongest relationship {{in the history of the}} two movements. All of it was not enough. By September, 1993, NAFTA’s supporters “seem to have the stronger hand: the prestige of the White House as well as five of its former occupants; a slew of eminent economists; the nation’s most powerful business lobbies, including the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers; and even the Christian Coalition. The Mexican government, as well, has poured millions of dollars into U.S. lobbying,” the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Two months later, NAFTA passed the House by a vote of 234-200 and the Senate by a vote of 61-38. It was signed by President Clinton on December 8, 1993, and went into effect on January 1, 1994. Nine years later, an Economic Policy Institute briefing paper on NAFTA’s effects pointed out that “the rise in the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico through 2002 has caused the displacement of production that supported 879,280 U.S. jobs. Most of those lost jobs were high-wage positions in manufacturing industries.” It continued, “The loss of these jobs is just the most visible tip of NAFTA's impact on the U.S. economy. In fact, NAFTA has also contributed to rising income inequality, suppressed real wages for production workers, weakened workers' collective bargaining powers and ability to organize unions, and reduced fringe benefits.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} Ross <b>Perot's</b> {{candidacy}} <b>has</b> been a contentious point of debate for many years.

While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but of the voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important," [...] two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, {{third-party}} Presidential candidate Ross Perot {{proposed that}} future Social Security benefits {{be subjected to}} a means test; though this was hailed {{by some as a}} potential solution to an impending crisis in funding the program, few other political candidates since <b>Perot</b> <b>have</b> publicly made the same suggestion, which would require costly investigations and might associate accepting those benefits with social stigma.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, Bush's {{approvals}} {{never went}} above 45% from February 1992 until {{weeks after the}} election, according to Gallup.

50|$|The American Reform Party {{is a minor}} {{political}} action committee in the United States that was formed in a factional split from the larger Reform Party of the United States in October 1997.

50|$|Some {{commentators}} identify Ross Perot's 1992 U.S. Presidential {{campaign as}} the first radical middle national campaign. However, many radical centrist authors were not enthusiastic about Ross Perot. Matthew Miller acknowledges that <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> enough principle to support a gasoline tax hike, Halstead and Lind note that he popularized the idea of balancing the budget, and John Avlon says he crystallized popular distrust of partisan extremes. But none of those authors examines Perot's ideas or campaigns in depth, and Mark Satin does not mention Perot at all.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1992 and 1996, the Commission on Presidential Debates {{changed its}} rules {{regarding}} how candidates could qualify {{to participate in}} the presidential debates. As <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> previously done very well in debates, it was a decisive blow to the campaign when the Commission ruled that he could not participate on the basis of somewhat vague criteria [...] - [...] such as that a candidate was required to have already been endorsed by [...] "a substantial number of major news organizations", with [...] "substantial" [...] being a number to be decided by the Commission on a case-by-case basis. <b>Perot</b> could not <b>have</b> qualified for the debates in 1992 under these rules, and was able to show that various famous US presidents would likewise have been excluded from modern debate by the Commission on Presidential Debates.|$|R
50|$|Maine {{confirmed}} {{its status}} as a blue state, with Democratic nominee President Bill Clinton carrying the state with 51.62% of the vote over Republican Bob Dole, who received 30.76%. Maine has voted Democratic since 1992, and is the only state other than Nebraska to split its electoral votes. The last time Maine went Republican was for George H. W. Bush and Dan Quayle in 1988. Third Party candidate Ross <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> a lesser impact this time, only drawing 14% of the vote, compared to 30% in 1992.

5|$|The Ross Perot presidential {{campaign}} of 1992 began when Texas industrialist Ross Perot opened {{the possibility of}} running for President of the United States in the election of 1992 as an independent candidate on the February 20, 1992 edition of Larry King Live. Though he had never served as a public official, <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> experience {{as the head of}} several successful corporations and had been involved in public affairs for the previous three decades. Spawned by the American dissatisfaction with the political system, grassroots organizations sprang up in every state to help Perot achieve ballot access following his announcement. James Stockdale, a retired United States Navy vice admiral, was Perot's vice presidential running mate.|$|R
500|$|Former Pat Buchanan pollster Frank Luntz {{was hired}} by the campaign, along with former Republican National Campaign Committee {{chairman}} Charles Leonard. The New York Times reported that Perot sought the help of operatives to search court and federal documents to find information that might reflect poorly on the potential candidate so that preparations could be made to respond. In the final round of Democratic and Republican primaries, most notably in California, exit polls revealed that 42% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats favored Perot. A Time Magazine poll found that <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> 37% support of all the electorate, ahead of both Bush and Clinton who tied for second at 24%. At this time, Vice President Dan Quayle became the most senior member of the Bush administration to criticize Perot, calling him a [...] "temperamental tycoon".|$|R

A mathematical look at the voting numbers reveals that Bush would have had to win 12.2% of Perot's 18.8% of the vote, 65% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot's best results were in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, or carried few electoral votes, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. NAFTA played a role in Perot's support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues.|$|R
50|$|Ventura's victory as a {{third party}} {{candidate}} was considered a historic major upset.

50|$|Simons {{divided the}} {{remaining}} EDS employees in Tehran into two groups. The less suspicious {{were to leave}} via airplane from Tehran. The more vulnerable, including the two fugitives, were to go to Turkey in two Range Rovers. Rashid accompanied the latter group on their 450 mi trip across northwest Iran. In two days of driving they repeatedly came close to capture. On almost every occasion, Rashid's quick wit saved them. When he and the six Americans crossed the Turkish border, they were met by an EDS employee waiting with a bus and a charter plane. One day later, February 17, they reached Istanbul, where an anxious <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> been pacing {{up and down his}} hotel room. That the fugitive pair lacked passports and had entered Turkey illegally rendered even the Turkish portion of the journey somewhat risky.|$|R

500|$|By {{the end of}} October, <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> reached 20% in opinion polls, and his favorability ratings {{slightly}} increased.

He was also interviewed on Talking with David Frost, where he affirmed a statement made by his running mate that the Vietnam War protests had prolonged the war effort. In the final days, it was estimated that Perot spent $5 million a day on advertisements. Overall, he had spent $40 million in October alone, and $60 million {{during the course of the}} campaign.|$|R

While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but roughly two-thirds of those voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important" [...] (25%) [...] voted for Bill Clinton. The voting numbers reveal that to win the electoral vote Bush would have had to win 10 of the 11 states Clinton won by less than five percentage points. For Bush to earn a majority of the popular vote, he would have needed 12.2% of Perot's 18.9% of the vote, 65% of Perot's support base. State exit polls suggested that Perot did not alter the electoral college count, except potentially in one state (Ohio), which nonetheless showed a result in the margin of error. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes.

2500|$|The {{applicability}} of the Wilko doctrine to 1934 Act claims, the judge wrote, [...] "merits some discussion". Allegaert v. <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> set precedent within the Second Circuit eight years earlier by making explicit what had long been taken as settled law in all federal courts. He further distinguished Allegaert from the instant case by noting that Allegaert had involved industrywide allegations of massive fraud, and thus there was a public policy reason to prefer litigation, whereas McMahon was between one brokerage firm and one client. Combined with the Court's declaration two years earlier in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp. that the FAA enacted [...] "a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary," [...] MacMahon followed the lead of district courts in other circuits and ordered the parties to arbitrate per their contract. He further held that the RICO claims were non-arbitrable, but stayed them pending the outcome of arbitration. Following Byrd, he also required arbitration of the McMahons' claims under state law.|$|R

500|$|Ross <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> {{never been}} elected to public office, but he ran several {{successful}} corporations and was involved in public affairs for decades. After serving in the United States Navy in the 1950s, Perot joined IBM as a salesman. He surpassed his one-year sales quota in just two weeks. After the company ignored his idea for electronic storage, he founded Electronic Data Systems in 1962, which was then contracted by the United States Government to store Medicare records. Perot earned a fortune with the company, and by 1968 was named by Fortune as the [...] "fastest, richest Texan." [...] Perot was known to run the company in a militaristic fashion, built on loyalty and duty. His best known venture with the company was in 1979, when he sent a private militia into Iran {{in the midst of}} the Iranian Revolution to rescue two of his employees who had been imprisoned. The episode inspired the 1983 novel, On Wings of Eagles. Perot eventually sold his company to General Motors in 1984 for $2.55 billion, and founded Perot Systems in 1988. By 1992, his fortune was judged to be $3 billion.|$|R
500|$|Perot was a hawk on the Vietnam War, an {{advocate}} for Americans held as prisoner of war and a supporter for their families. During the war, he aided soldiers by providing supplies and holding rallies for those returning home. In public affairs, he led the Texas War on Drugs Committee in 1979 {{at the behest of}} Republican Governor Bill Clements, and was put in charge of the Select Committee on Public Education in 1983 by Democratic Governor Mark White. Perot's most dear political effort involved the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. He worked extensively to free soldiers that he believed had been left behind, and even engaged in secret diplomatic talks with the Vietnamese government, to the chagrin of the Reagan White House. <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> been supportive of President Ronald Reagan and labeled him as a [...] "great president" [...] in 1986. He even pledged $2.5 million to support his presidential library, but the relationship soured after Perot was sent on a trip to Hanoi, and determined afterwards that the administration was not taking the POW/MIA issue seriously. He revoked his pledge to the library in 1987, based on the POW/MIA issue as well as his disillusionment from the administration's actions during the Iran–Contra affair. He became a critic of the George H. W. Bush administration, and opposed the 1991 Gulf War.|$|R

Supporters were angry and distraught at Perot's decision, and his popularity dropped among the American public. One woman called Perot and commented that [...] "the tears have not stopped." [...] A class action lawsuit was filed in Florida {{to force him to}} remain in the race, but it was dropped. Later in July, the economic plan that <b>Perot's</b> campaign <b>had</b> been working on was released. The fifty-page proposal included cuts in domestic spending, investment in education, communication and transportation programs, an increase in income taxes for the wealthy, and an increase in the gasoline tax. The plan was projected to eliminate the budget deficit in five years. [...] At the end of August, Perot promised to give his endorsement to any candidate that supported his economic plan, but hinted that he may reenter the race. These hints increased in September, as Perot looked to buy advertising time on the major networks to discuss his economic plan, which could only occur if he was a declared candidate. Meanwhile, petitions for ballot access were approved in all 50 states, and polls showed Perot still in double digits with 14% support, behind Clinton and Bush with 44% and 39%, respectively.|$|R
