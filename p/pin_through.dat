40|$|Anteriorly {{displaced}} fractures of {{the wrist}} can be treated by the Kapandji technique of percutaneous intrafocal pinning with <b>pins</b> inserted <b>through</b> an anterior approach to give good reduction and stabilisation of the fracture. We have modified this technique by placing the <b>pins</b> <b>through</b> a posterior approach which decreases the risks of neurovascular damage. We have used this method to treat six children with distal radial fractures showing anterior displacement or instability. Good anterior stabilisation was achieved. The pins were removed {{at an average of}} eight weeks and the patients were then able to return to full activity. This simple technique can be used for unstable fractures after the failure of conservative treatment or in bilateral fractures in adolescents. J Bone Joint Surg [Br] 1997; 79 -B: 734 - 7...|$|R
