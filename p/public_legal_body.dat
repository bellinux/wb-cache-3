In Land law, the Act of No. 5 of 1960 (hereinafter is called UUPA) is {{applicable}} governing the land matters and agrarian reform. According to article 33 (2) of the 1945 Constitution the State has power to determine the right to control property, including the land. Besides, Article 2 of the UUPA stipulates the basic rules as {{to the relationship between}} the State power and the right holder of the land. Accordingly, the State recognizes the ownership of the land by an individual or by private legal entity and by <b>public</b> <b>legal</b> <b>body</b> in terms of right to use for the government body. The implementation {{of the power of the}} State to confer the right on land as property is mentioned in Article 16 UUPA namely the right of the land permanently or temporarily, and other rights as determined by the law in future. The right to use of land is not covered by Article 16 UUPA, but shall be governed by law. As far as the special right to land use is concerned it is laid down under Articles 41 and Article 42 and also in general explanation II/ 2 UUPA. It is therefore suggested that the State Authority should enact the Act to determine such right on grounds : firstly it is possible for the government to do so on the basis article 16 UUPA strictly but then the implementation of Article 16 UUPA has become unlimited. Secondly, there exists the vast power of the state, and thirdly, the legislations in Indonesia confers vast and unlimited power to State to control the land which might lead to the abuse of power by the State. The special right to use of land should cover many factors, namely : the right, content of right, the burden of land towards the other right of land, subject of right, and land as the object of right. While factors embodied in right of control of land consist of : ownership, transfer or right to other(s), deletion of right, and the proof of right. Therefore it is suggested that the government should enact the law to lay down the special right to use of land in near futur...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} current state of <b>public</b> <b>legal</b> {{knowledge}} in China, which we regard as an essential aspect of and an empirical indicator for the development of modern legal culture. Using data from the 2004 survey on Institutionalization of Legal Reforms in China, we first demonstrate the relatively low level of <b>public</b> <b>legal</b> knowledge in China and the stark disparities between urban and rural populations. We further explore factors that can explain the variations through multivariate analyses. We find that the level of <b>public</b> <b>legal</b> knowledge is associated with individual characteristics such as gender, age, education, income, residency, and mode of production. Exposure to the outside world serves as a learning process about functions of the legal system, and the media {{play an important role in}} disseminating legal information. Educational activities focusing on the legal system or legal issues also provide an important channel for the public to acquire practical legal knowledge. We conclude by discussing potential approaches to increasing Chinese <b>public</b> <b>legal</b> knowledge and narrowing the disparities, including increasing the population's education and income levels and broadening access to special educational activities and coverage by the media.
