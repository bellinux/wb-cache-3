5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, organ {{builders}} began to incorporate digital components into their key, stop, and combination actions. Besides making these mechanisms simpler and more reliable, this {{also makes it}} possible to record and <b>play</b> <b>back</b> an organist's performance via the MIDI protocol. In addition, some organ builders have incorporated digital stops into their pipe organs.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile {{announced}} he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average {{at the end of}} the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians and the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Cobb. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits in a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns. Browns' manager Jack O'Connor supposedly told his third baseman Red Corriden to <b>play</b> <b>back</b> down the line all day, which allowed Lajoie easy bunt hits. Cobb complained about the move, though American League President Ban Johnson said that a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway and Chalmers ultimately awarded cars to both players.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, YouTube {{introduced}} videos {{playing at}} 60 frames per second, {{in order to}} reproduce video games with a frame rate comparable to high-end graphics cards. The videos <b>play</b> <b>back</b> at a resolution of 720p or higher. YouTube videos are available {{in a range of}} quality levels. The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ), and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the VP9 format with stereo Opus audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's user agent reports Windows XP, then H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video with stereo AAC audio is used instead.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the early}} to mid-1960s, some {{in-flight}} movies were <b>played</b> <b>back</b> from videotape, using early compact transistorized videotape recorders made by Sony (such as the SV-201 and PV-201) and Ampex (such as the VR-660 and VR-1500), and <b>played</b> <b>back</b> on CRT monitors mounted on the upper sides in the cabin above the passenger seats with several monitors placed a few seats apart from each other.

50|$|An {{alternative}} to converting sign language to audio in real-time {{is to do}} a Hand-Over by recording hand motions while simultaneously <b>playing</b> <b>back</b> pre-recorded arm motions. The data could then be <b>played</b> <b>back,</b> edited, or used to drive an audio program.|$|R
25|$|Cylinder {{machines}} of {{the late}} 1880s and the 1890s were usually sold with recording attachments. The ability to record as well as <b>play</b> <b>back</b> sound was an advantage of cylinder phonographs over the competition from cheaper disc record phonographs which began to be mass-marketed {{at the end of}} the 1890s, as the disc system machines can be used only to <b>play</b> <b>back</b> prerecorded sound.|$|E

He did, however, <b>play</b> <b>back</b> pocket when the reserves captured the premiership by defeating Melbourne in the Grand Final.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{commercial}} HDTV sets started {{to enter a}} larger market, {{but there was no}} inexpensive way to record or <b>play</b> <b>back</b> HD content. JVC's D-VHS and Sony's HDCAM formats could store that amount of data, but were neither popular nor well-known. It was well known that using lasers with shorter wavelengths would yield optical storage with higher density. Shuji Nakamura invented practical blue laser diodes, but a lengthy patent lawsuit delayed commercial introduction.|$|E
25|$|For the {{magnetic}} tape sound recording Kornél Tolnai used magnetic tape {{as a medium}} for magnetic recording, made of a thin magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic. Most audio, video and computer data storage is this type. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and <b>play</b> <b>back</b> audio and video using magnetic tape are tape recorders and later on video tape recorders. A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape is a tape drive (tape unit, streamer).|$|E

25|$|Timestamp: (32 bits) Used {{to enable}} the {{receiver}} to <b>play</b> <b>back</b> the received samples at appropriate intervals. When several media streams are present, the timestamps are independent in each stream, {{and may not be}} relied upon for media synchronization. The granularity of the timing is application specific. For example, an audio application that samples data once every 125µs (8kHz, a common sample rate in digital telephony) would use that value as its clock resolution. The clock granularity is one of the details that is specified in the RTP profile for an application.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the state}} of video {{playback}} on the PC {{at the time of}} its release, It's a Wonderful Life for Windows represented another first, as the longest running video on a computer. Prior to its release, Windows could only <b>play</b> <b>back</b> approx. 32,000 frames of video, or about 35 minutes at 15 frames per second. Working with Microsoft, Kinesoft was able to enhance the video features of Windows to allow for the complete playback of the entire film— all of this on a PC with a 486SX processor and only 8MB of RAM.|$|E
25|$|Lighting control tools {{might best}} be {{described}} as anything that changes the quality of the light. Historically this has been done by the use of intensity control. Technological advancements have made intensity control relatively simple - solid state dimmers are controlled by one or more lighting controllers. Controllers are commonly lighting consoles designed for sophisticated control over very large numbers of dimmers or luminaires, but may be simpler devices which <b>play</b> <b>back</b> stored sequences of lighting states with minimal user interfaces. Consoles are also referred to as lighting desks or light-boards.|$|E

25|$|Baird's {{numerous}} other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention. He was a visionary {{and began to}} dabble with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and <b>play</b> <b>back</b> a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, {{but some of the}} original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer.|$|E
25|$|Voicemail is the {{managing}} of telephone messages from a centralized data storing system. Voicemail is stored on hard disk drives, media generally used by computers {{in order to}} store other forms of data. Messages are recorded in digitized natural human voice similar to how music is stored on a compact disc. To retrieve and to <b>play</b> <b>back</b> messages, a user calls the system from any phone, {{and his or her}} messages can be retrieved immediately. The first voicemail system, known as the Speech Filing System (SFS), was invented by Stephen J. Boies in 1973. What started as a research project at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, the first working prototype became available to telephone users in 1975.|$|E
25|$|ELPJ, a Japanese-based company, sells a laser {{turntable}} {{that uses}} a laser to read vinyl discs optically, without physical contact. The laser turntable eliminates record wear {{and the possibility of}} accidental scratches, which degrade the sound, but its expense limits use primarily to digital archiving of analog records, and the laser does not <b>play</b> <b>back</b> colored vinyl or picture discs. Various other laser-based turntables were tried during the 1990s, but while a laser reads the groove very accurately, since it does not touch the record, the dust that vinyl attracts due to static electric charge is not mechanically pushed out of the groove, worsening sound quality in casual use compared to conventional stylus playback.|$|E
