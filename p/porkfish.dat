5000|$|... 196 reef {{fish species}} have been recorded, in 124 genera and 66 {{families}}.The families with the most species were Carangidae (16), Grouper (12), Wrasse (10), Pomacentridae (8) and Parrotfish (8).Abundant fish species include the tomtate grunt (Haemulon aurolineatum), sergeant major (Abudefduf saxatilis), brown chromis (Chromis multilineata), dusky damselfish (Stegastes fuscus), jubauna reeffish (Chromis jubauna), silver porgy (Diplodus argenteus), <b>porkfish</b> (Anisotremus virginicus) and ringneck blenny (Parablennius pilicornis).The park is on the migratory route of the giant manta rays of the Brazilian coast, which visit in the autumn and winter.|$|E
50|$|Anisotremus virginicus, the <b>porkfish,</b> is {{a species}} of grunt native to the western Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Brazil and the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. This nocturnal species inhabits areas of reef or with rocky {{substrates}} at depths of from 2 to 20 m. It can reach a length of 40.6 cm TL though most do not exceed 25 cm. It is of minor importance as a commercial food fish and is also popular as a game fish though it is reported to sometimes contain the ciguatera toxin. It is also a popular fish in public aquariums.|$|E
50|$|The Florida {{mangrove}} {{system is}} an important habitat for many species. It provides nursery grounds for young fish, crustaceans and mollusks, and for sport and commercial purposes. Many fish feed in the mangrove forests, including snook (Centropomus undecimalis), gray or mangrove snapper (Lutjanus griseus), schoolmaster snapper (Lutjanus apodus), tarpon, jack, sheepshead, red drum, hardhead silverside (Atherinomorus stipes), juvenile blue angelfish (Holocanthus bermudensis), juvenile <b>porkfish</b> (Anisotremus virginicus), lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus), great barracuda (Sphryaena barracuda), scrawled cowfish (Lactophrys quadricornis) and permit (Trachinotus falcatus), as well as shrimp and clams. An estimated 75% of the game fish and 90% of the commercial fish species in south Florida depend on the mangrove system.|$|E
5000|$|Days {{were spent}} diving to conduct {{experiments}} {{and gather data}} to {{study the effects of}} climate change and pollution on coral reefs, while the evenings were spent in Aquarius on lab work, relaxation and stress tests: Cousteau and his crew made themselves available for physiological and psychological tests {{to determine the effects of}} long-term living under the sea and without sunlight. [...] The crew also appeared on Weather Channel broadcasts periodically. They used a sonar device that records a wide range of frequencies and a slow-motion camera to capture more thorough data and installed tiny probes, less than the width of a human hair, into the coral reef. Among the animals seen during the expedition were eels, manta shrimp, octopus, plankton, <b>porkfish,</b> snook, sponges, spotted eagle rays, starfish, tarpon, and various reef sharks. The crew also observed an Atlantic goliath grouper attack a barracuda, a scene which Shantz described as [...] "something I never imagined happening".|$|E
50|$|Third is {{the bank}} reef community. Bank reefs {{are larger than}} patch reefs and are found on the outer reefs. Bank reefs consist of three zones. The reef flat is closest to the keys, and {{consists}} of coralline algae growing on fragments of coral skeletons. Further out to sea are the spur and groove formations, low ridges of coral (the spurs) separated by channels with sand bottoms (the grooves). The shallowest parts of the spurs support fire corals and zoanthids. Starting at five or six feet deep, Elkhorn, star, and brain corals {{are the most important}} members of the community. Various types of gorgonians are also common. Beyond the spur and groove zone is the forereef, which slopes down to the deeps. The upper forereef is dominated by star coral. At greater depths plate-like corals dominate, and then as the available light fades, sponges and non-reef building corals become common. Bank reefs provide habitat for various fishes, including French angelfish, Blue and Queen parrotfish, Queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula), Rock beauties (Holacanthus tricolor), Goatfish (Parupeneus cyclostomus), <b>Porkfish</b> (Anisotremus virginicus) and snappers. The sand found around and in the Florida Reef is composed of shell, coral skeleton and limestone fragments.|$|E
40|$|Eggs of <b>porkfish</b> (Anisotremus virginicus) were {{obtained}} from natural spawning eventsoccuring at Seaworld Orlando and transported to the Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory. Eggs were stockedinto 12 L experimental rearing tanks at 30 /L to determine growth and survival of larvae fed rotifers(Brachionus plicatilis – Cayman strain) and copepod nauplii (Acartia tonsa) during first exogenousfeeding through seven days post hatch (dph). Larvae fed rotifers during first feeding exhibited highersurvival than those fed copepod nauplii (35. 7 ± 4. 0 % and 23. 8 ± 4. 0 % respectively). Conversely, larvaefed copepod nauplii exhibited greater body length and body depth than those fed rotifers. Resultssuggest that <b>porkfish</b> is an ideal candidate species for existing aquaculture technologies.

40|$|Hybridization {{has been}} {{described}} in several families of coral reef fishes (Montanari et al. 2012), including grunts (genus Haemulon) (Rocha et al. 2008). Here, we report {{the presence of a}} hybrid between two species of Anisotremus grunts, the <b>porkfish,</b> A. virginicus, and the black margate, A. surinamensis, from Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro (23 °S, 42 °W). Interestingly, A. virginicus and A. surinamensis are not sister species (Bernardi et al. 2008), but both are common in that region. On 1 December 2012, while collecting fish tissues for molecular studies at a local spearfishing tournament, we observed one individual that showed typical morphological and coloration characteristics of both A. virginicus (gold lines along the body), and A. surinamensis (large bronze body). DNA sequencing of that individual following pub...|$|E
