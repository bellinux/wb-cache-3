50|$|Shin tape is a medical-type tape, used on shin pads or socks {{over the}} shin pads {{to help keep}} them in position. The {{pressure-sensitive}} tape is self-adhesive and water resistant, and is elastic {{so that there is}} no risk of cutting off circulation to the legs. Shin tape is available in a variety of colors, with clear tape being the most popular. Shin <b>pad</b> <b>tape</b> is discarded after use.|$|R
50|$|An overgrip is a soft, <b>padded,</b> clothlike <b>tape</b> {{wrapped around}} {{the grip of a}} racquet. There are a few {{purposes}} for an overgrip. The two main uses are to add tackiness (stickiness) and to increase sweat absorption. Other purposes are for the expansion of the circumference of the grip, and for adding more padding or cushioning.|$|R

50|$|For the {{cross-country}} phase, {{the rider}} usually uses similar tack {{as for the}} show jumping. However, cross country boots are used for extra protection, to help prevent injury {{if they were to}} hit the solid obstacles. Most horses that wear shoes are also fitted with horse shoe studs, to prevent slipping. At the upper levels, riders may also apply a grease or lard {{to the front of the}} horse's legs, to help the horse slide over fences if they hang a leg. Riders also tend to color-coordinate their cross-country tack to their colors. For example, using the same color saddle <b>pad</b> and <b>tape</b> for their boots, to match their shirt and protective vest.|$|R
5000|$|Colossus and {{the reasons}} for its {{construction}} were highly secret, and remained so for 30 years after the War. Consequently, it {{was not included in the}} history of computing hardware for many years, and Flowers and his associates were deprived of the recognition they were due. Colossi 1 to 10 were dismantled after the war and parts returned to the Post Office. Some parts, sanitised as to their original purpose, were taken to Max Newman's Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University. Tommy Flowers was ordered to destroy all documentation and burnt them in a furnace at Dollis Hill. He later said of that order: That was a terrible mistake. I was instructed to destroy all the records, which I did. I took all the drawings and the plans and all the information about Colossus on paper and put it in the boiler fire. And saw it burn. [...] Colossi 11 and 12, along with two replica Tunny machines, were retained, being moved to GCHQ's new headquarters at Eastcote in April 1946, and again with GCHQ to Cheltenham between 1952 and 1954. One of the Colossi, known as Colossus Blue, was dismantled in 1959; the other in 1960. There had been attempts to adapt them to other purposes, with varying success; in their later years they had been used for training. Jack Good related how he was the first to use Colossus after the war, persuading the US National Security Agency that it could be used to perform a function for which they were planning to build a special-purpose machine. Colossus was also used to perform character counts on one-time <b>pad</b> <b>tape</b> to test for non-randomness.|$|R
50|$|As {{reptiles}} {{are cold}} blooded they generally {{need to be}} kept in climate-controlled enclosures, especially when kept in regions further away from the equator. A standard enclosure usually incorporates a thermostat and a heat emitter; usually a heating <b>pad,</b> heat <b>tape</b> or an incandescent light bulb. Hot rocks can be used, but as a secondary heat source, as they often provide uneven heating. Some reptiles also require some form of Ultraviolet radiation which can be provided through a UV bulb. The lighting can be set to a timer to simulate a day/night cycle. Heat emitters are usually placed {{at one end of the}} enclosure to allow for a temperature gradient, so a reptile may move to the other end of the enclosure if it needs to cool itself.|$|R

40|$|A. Allemeier, A. Grefsrud, A. Hensley, L. Ferris, W. M. Silvers Whitworth University, Spokane, WA Aromatherapy, {{or the use}} of {{essential}} oils derived from plants, was widely used by the ancient Chinese and Romans for a variety of physiology altering purposes. Modern use of aromatherapy has grown, especially in alternative medicine. Lavender oil is a popular essential oil used to reduce anxiety, decrease stress, and calm mood. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of lavender oil inhalation on speed, accuracy, and heart rate (HR) when a timed Stroop test was performed. METHODS: Sixty-six healthy, college-aged (average age = 20. 08 ± 2. 00 years) males and females (nm = 17, nf = 49) performed incongruent Stroop tests under two scent conditions (lavender or control), in random order. Heart rate was monitored with a chest strap. Three drops of a 10 % lavender oil dilution in grapeseed oil were applied to a cotton <b>pad</b> <b>taped</b> under the participant’s nose. The scent condition was the independent variable and HR, speed, and accuracy were the dependent variables. Paired t-tests (significance level p ≤ 0. 05) were used to determine the existence of statistically significant differences between scent conditions for each dependent variable. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the lavender and control conditions for speed (control: 38. 74 ± 8. 55 s; lavender; 38. 76 ± 9. 63 s; p = 0. 99), accuracy (control: 0. 96 ± 0. 04 %; lavender: 0. 95 ± 0. 05; p = 0. 21), resting heart rate (control: 80. 14 ± 11. 71 bpm; lavender: 81. 55 ± 13. 95 bpm; p = 0. 32), and peak heart rate (control: 96. 54 ± 15. 57 bpm; lavender: 98. 82 ± 16. 98 bpm; p = 0. 18). CONCLUSION: Under the current research conditions, lavender inhalation did not impact cognitive performance or HR parameters. The primary explanation for the observed result was that inconsistencies in the testing environment, Stroop test administration, and mode of lavender delivery may have impacted speed and accuracy. Consequently, future research investigations should include more environmental controls. Also, a significant learning effect on speed and accuracy between testing sessions was observed (p = 0. 00), which indicates that a more rigorous familiarization process should be used in future research. Lastly, when participants who disliked the scent of lavender were excluded, PHR approached statistical significance (p = 0. 07). Future research investigations should include controls for perceived pleasantness of aroma. If the calming effects of lavender oil inhalation on cognitive performance are further confirmed, it is possible that lavender oil could be used to calm and focus athletes before stressful events...|$|R
50|$|After {{completing}} his master's degree from Villanova University, Hornblum went to Holmesburg prison to direct an adult literacy program in 1971. There he noticed, several inmates with arms striped with gauze <b>pads</b> and adhesive <b>tape.</b> He {{later learned that}} medical experiments had been conducted on the inmates for the last 20 years. Hornblum spent 10 years as a literacy instructor {{and sat on the}} board of the Pennsylvania Prison Society. He was appointed to the Philadelphia Board of Prison Trustees in 1986. While serving as a prison trustee, he actively participated in a proposal to allow prisoners the right to have condoms. However, the proposal was turned down. Hornblum also served as the executive director of the Americans for Democratic Action and worked at the Pennsylvania Crime Commission to investigate organized crime and public corruption.|$|R

50|$|The basic Chamberlin has a piano-style keyboard. Underneath each key is an {{individual}} tape-playing mechanism. Each tape is prerecorded with various musical instruments or special effects. When the player presses down a key, a pressure <b>pad</b> pushes the <b>tape</b> on to a tape head and a pinch roller beneath the key catches the tape and pulls it forward into storage box (or on to a roller mechanism). As this occurs {{the sound of the}} tape is heard through an amplified speaker. When the player releases the key, the sound stops, and the tape rewinds by either metal spring rods (as on the early Chamberlins) or by a return-roller mechanism (as on the later M1 models). Each tape is only a few seconds long (8 seconds on many units).|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} {{begins with}} orotracheal intubation using a laser-safe endotracheal tube. The {{eyes of the}} patient are <b>padded</b> and <b>taped</b> followed by draping {{of the head and}} application of upper tooth guard. When the patient is anesthetized sufficiently and full relaxation is seen. The largest feasible laryngoscope is introduced, to obtain {{a good view of the}} larynx. After positioning of the laryngoscope, it is fixed in place with the help of the chest holder. The light carrier is withdrawn after the adjustment of scope in desired position and then the operating microscope is introduced. The head and face of the patient is protected with moist towels. Then the operating microscope fitted with 400 mm lens and a microspot CO2 laser is brought in position. The endotracheal tube cuff is protected by a moist cottonoid sponge placed in subglottis. The site for the cordotomy is determined at the preoperative examination. If any one of the vocal fold seems to have a slightest degree of motion, then cordotomy is performed on the other one. Using CO2 laser with a spot size of 0.2 mm and power of 3-5 Watts, a cordotomy is performed 1-2mm anteriorly to the vocal process. This is then carried laterally to the thyroid lamina through the width of the vocal ligament and vocalis muscle. The cordotomy provides access to the arytenoid cartilage as well as opens the airway posteriorly.|$|R
