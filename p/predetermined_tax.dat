40|$|A kind of law {{enforcement}} in taxation is the appeal of tax payment to induce the submission of tax annual report (SPT). Letter of Appeal is a letter released by Tax Service Office based on internal investigation to ask for clarification from Taxpayers about the estimation of failure to obey tax affair pursuant to <b>predetermined</b> <b>tax</b> regulations”. The objective of research is to understand the influence of variables of Sanction, Taxpayers Awareness, Service, and Supervision on the Obedience to Submit Tax Annual Report. Research method is explanatory research which attempts to show a causal relationship between research variables through hypothesis testing. Based on the result of Multiple Linear Regression analysis, it is indicated that the variables of Taxpayers Awareness, Service and Supervision have positive and significant influence on the Obedience to Submit Tax Annual Report. It may be suggested that <b>predetermined</b> <b>tax</b> regulations must be obeyed and highly attended by taxpayers...|$|E
40|$|Following European Directive 2003 / 30 /EC, the Greek Government adapted {{legislation}} that introduces and regulates the bio diesel market. The implemented quota scheme allocates the country's annual, <b>predetermined,</b> <b>tax</b> exempt production of bio diesel to industries {{based on their}} ability to meet several criteria. A number of bio diesel supply chain stakeholders have criticized this policy for being efficiency-robbing and vague. This paper uses 2007 data from energy crop farms and three bio diesel-producing companies in order to assess these criticisms. We study the economic and environmental aspects of the currently adopted policy and compare them to three alternative scenarios. We conclude that such criticisms have a merit and that policy makers need to reconsider their alternative options regarding the promotion of bio diesel in transport. Permission of sales directly to local consumers and promotion of forward integration by farmers are efficiency enhancing and environment-friendly means of promoting the use of bio diesel in transport. Bio diesel Quota policy Greece...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} Blanchard (1985) finite horizon model {{to study how}} taxes and {{government}} spending can be managed to stabilize aggregate demand. It is shown that tax policy cannot stabilize demand {{in less time than}} it stabilizes the public debt, but that, if government spending is the instrument of policy, demand can be stabilized independently of the dynamics of the debt. These results imply that if the objective is to stabilize the debt while maintaining demand {{as close as possible to}} a pre-determined target path, and taxes are the instrument, taxes would have to be changed temporarily as much as feasible. On the other hand, if the instrument is government spending, it can be changed gradually to achieve the objectives. The dynamic effects of taxes are a straightforward implication of the intertemporal budget constraint, when it is assumed that agents cannot be surprised by government policies. More traditional dynamics can be obtained if it is assumed that the government succeeds in announcing a policy and implementing a different one. If however the announcement is no credible, discretion is inferior to a <b>predetermined</b> <b>tax</b> rule. ...|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the billions}} of dollars and {{enormous}} effort that might otherwise be wasted, the public interest will be best served if the Supreme Court of the United States decides the present challenges to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) during its October 2011 Term. Potentially standing in the way, however, is the federal Tax Anti-Injunction Act (TAIA), which bars any “suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax. ” The dispute to date has turned on the fraught and complex question of whether the ACA 2 ̆ 7 s exaction for being uninsured qualifies as a “tax” for purposes of the TAIA. Dorf and Siegel argue that the Supreme Court need not resolve this issue because the TAIA does not apply for a distinct reason: the present challenges to the ACA do not have “the purpose” of restraining tax assessment or collection. In order for the TAIA not to bar refund suits, the TAIA must be read to bar suits with the immediate purpose of restraining tax assessment or collection. The present challenges do not have such an immediate purpose because the very authority to assess or collect will not exist until long after the litigation is concluded. Among other virtues, this resolution of the TAIA question does not <b>predetermine</b> whether the <b>tax</b> power justifies the minimum coverage provision...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the distortive {{effect of the}} federal income tax on the efficiency of resource allocation within and between cities. This distortion shifts production tothe smaller and less productive cities from the larger and more productive cities. Toeliminate these distortive effects, a city-size deduction should be applied. The underlying assumption is that cities differ from one another in labor productivity Consequently, in equilibrium, the size, the nominal income, {{and the price of}} housing vary across cities. When a uniform income tax rate is used for financing federal expenditure, the shadow price of housing exceeds the market price in the larger cities, indicating that the stock of housing is too small and the per-capita housing consumption is too large. The opposite is true in small cities, where also, if housing and the LPG (local public good) are net substitutes, the provision of the LPG is excessive. The article also {{discusses the}} effects of federal corporate profit taxes, which are shown to discourage the supply of the LPG, and shows that a net land rent tax is not always a feasible tax instrument capable of raising the <b>predetermined</b> <b>tax</b> revenue...|$|E
