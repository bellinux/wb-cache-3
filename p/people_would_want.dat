5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} the idea of {{creating}} Theme Park because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that Theme Park is a game he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Another anthropologist, Kristen Hawkes, has criticised both {{of these}} theories. On the one hand, {{opposing}} Harris, she says both that {{the quickest way to}} get more male warriors would have been to have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory she points out that the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which it seems they did not.|$|E
500|$|Constructing the Munitions and Main Navy Buildings was an idea {{conceived}} by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, who put forth {{the idea to}} President Woodrow Wilson. [...] Roosevelt originally suggested a temporary building {{be placed on the}} Ellipse, but President Wilson disliked the idea of a building on the White House's front lawn. [...] Thus, Roosevelt suggested placing the buildings on the National Mall (Potomac Park) along B Street (renamed Constitution Avenue in 1931), near the Lincoln Memorial. [...] Roosevelt wanted them to be ugly wooden buildings, so that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to tear them down right away after World War I. [...] However, to make the buildings more fire resistant, concrete and steel materials were recommended. Roosevelt later expressed regret for allowing these building to be constructed, saying in 1941, [...] "I didn't think I would ever be let into the Gates of Heaven, because I had been responsible for desecrating the parks of Washington." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ... It's me, looking in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [...] I do the worst damage to myself — {{more than anybody else}} can to do me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally planned}} {{to add a}} feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, [...] "We thought about what <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> {{to do in order}} to survive. We explored different ideas, and one of them was fashioning weapons to defend yourself. That was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger." [...] Another cancelled feature was the alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was implemented at one point, it was eventually removed from the game because the developers felt it would change the course of the game in a [...] "weird" [...] direction. In addition, the developers considered the possibility for the game to be played from a third-person perspective, but then realised that it would significantly change the experience. Hope explained that it would become [...] "a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move." [...] The actual development of the game took overall four years to complete after the Creative Assembly first pitched the idea to Sega. The game went gold on 9 September 2014 and is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer of the game, who died during its development.|$|E

2500|$|A Spring 2013 Pew Research poll in the United States {{found that}} 38% of Americans would want life {{extension}} treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it {{also found that}} 68% believed most <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> it and that only 4% consider an [...] "ideal lifespan" [...] {{to be more than}} 120 years. The median [...] "ideal lifespan" [...] was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society. One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments {{may be due to the}} cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.|$|E
2500|$|On October 22, 2003, Moody {{left the}} band during the European tour for Fallen, {{reportedly}} because of creative differences. In an interview several months later, Amy Lee said: [...] "...we'd gotten {{to a point}} that if something didn't change, we wouldn't have been able to make a second record." [...] This became a point of confusion, as Moody and Lee stated on the Fallen album liner notes that they were best friends. Lee said it was almost a relief that Moody left because of tensions created within the band. During an interview, Lee has said, [...] "I don't know, I just think it's exactly what I would've expected. He's more about kind of the pop influence sort of thing and also, you know, about being commercial and I mean selling albums: That's the part of him we often disagreed on. I wanted to do the more artistic weird thing and he'd wanna do the thing that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to hear..." [...] She adds [...] "So that's a lot of the reason [...] it's been so fun writing now, is [...] we're not thinking about that.

She and Jessica [...] loved working together. So we came up with this character and I like that she's around in all the individual stories at that pivotal moment of are you going to fight {{or are you going to}} die." [...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy. You could see why <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> her to kiss them." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{few years}} later, Vanessa Williams (Miss New York 1983) won {{the title of}} Miss America 1984 on September 17, 1983, making her the first African American woman to wear the crown.

I wanted to dedicate this contagious act of liberation and freedom to them. I hoped it would become something contagious that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to do {{in some way or}} another". Badu has expressed that her video is a criticism of the psychological concept groupthink. On the video's location, Badu expressed that Matt & Kim's video and its [...] "monumental" [...] Times Square setting influenced her to film in Dealey Plaza, which is known as the site of President John F.
