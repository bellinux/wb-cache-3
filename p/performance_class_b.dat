40|$|The study {{analyzed}} students’ misconception {{based on}} {{rough set theory}} and combined with interpretive structural model (ISM) to compare students’ degree of two classes. The study then has provided an effective diagnostic assessment tool for teachers. The participants were 30 fourth grade students in Central Taiwan, and the exam tools were produced by teachers for math exams. The study has proposed three methods to get common misconception {{of the students in}} class. These methods are “Deleting conditional attributes”, “Using Boolean logic to calculate discernable matrix”, and “Calculating significance of conditional attributes. ” The results showed that students of Class A had common misconceptions but students of <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> had not common misconception.

40|$|The {{experimental}} program {{described in}} this paper sought to assess the suitability of the small scale DEF(AUST) 5706 standard for measuring the suppression and burnback <b>performance</b> of <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> foams on pool fires. DEF(AUST) 5706 is an Australian Defence standard mandatory {{for use by the}} Australian Navy, Army and Air Force. The test protocol required the measurement of the 3 / 4 control, extinguishment and 1 / 3 burnback times for a circular pan of aviation gasoline (AVGAS 100 / 130), 0. 28 m 2 in surface area. The test program involved compressed-air foams (CAF) and aspirated foams of two expansion ratios, and employed two AFFF formulations: a 6 % telomer concentrate and, to obtain base-line measurements, 3 % PFOS FC- 600 concentrate which was manufactured by the 3 M company prior to the PFOS phase out. At lower expansion (7 : 1), the aspirated and compressed-air foams demonstrated similar fire control performance, whilst more expanded (9 : 1) CAF was generally more efficient at extinguishing, but less efficient in controlling the fire. CAF formed a better seal over the fuel surface and at the hot pan walls, and these foams performed noticeably better than aspirated foam against fuel re-ignition. The paper links these observations with the underlying distributions of bubble sizes, which were measured and fitted to modified Rosin/Rammler cumulative volume distribution functions. We propose that a modified version of DEF(AUST) 5706 be adopted as a universal small-scale test protocol...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to enable easier data sharing and curb rising storage {{management}} costs, storage systems are becoming increasingly consolidated and thereby shared by a large number of users and applications. In such environments, service differentiation becomes increasingly important. Since caching is a fundamental and pervasive technique employed to improve the performance of storage systems, providing differentiated services from a storage cache is a crucial component of the entire end-to-end QoS solution. In this paper, we discuss a QoS architecture for a shared storage proxy cache which can provide long-term hit rate assurances to competing classes. The proposed architecture consists of three components: (a) per-class feedback controllers that track the <b>performance</b> of each <b>class,</b> (<b>b)</b> a fairness controller that allocates excess resources fairly in the case when all goals are met, and (c) a contention resolver that decides cache allocation in the case when at least one class does not meet its target hit rate. We compare the performance of various feedback per-class controllers, and provide guidelines for designing QoS mechanisms for such a dynamic environment. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Class</b> <b>B</b> floral {{homeotic}} genes {{are involved in}} specifying stamen and petal identity in angiosperms (flowering plants). Here we report that gymnosperms, the closest relatives of the angiosperms, contain at least two different clades representing putative orthologues of <b>class</b> <b>B</b> genes, termed GGM 2 -like and DAL 12 -like genes. To obtain information about the functional conservation of the <b>class</b> <b>B</b> genes in seed plants, the representative {{of one of these}} clades from Gnetum, termed GGM 2, was expressed {{under the control of the}} CaMV 35 S promoter in Arabidopsis wild-type plants and in different <b>class</b> <b>B</b> mutants. In wild-type plants and in a conditional mutant grown at a permissive temperature, gain-of-function phenotypes were obtained in whorls 1 and 4, where <b>class</b> <b>B</b> genes are usually not expressed. In contrast, loss-of-function phenotypes were observed in whorls 2 and 3, where <b>class</b> <b>B</b> genes are expressed. In different <b>class</b> <b>B</b> gene null mutants of Arabidopsis, and in the conditional B mutant grown at the non-permissive temperature, a partial complementation of the mutant phenotype was obtained. In situ hybridization studies and <b>class</b> <b>B</b> gene promoter test fusion experiments demonstrated that the gain-of- function phenotypes are not due to an upregulation of the endogenous B genes from Arabidopsis, and hence probably involve interactions between GGM 2 protein homodimers and <b>class</b> <b>B</b> protein target genes other than the Arabidopsis <b>class</b> <b>B</b> genes itself. To our knowledge, this is the first time that partial complementation of a homeotic mutant by an orthologous gene from a distantly related species has been reported. These data suggest that GGM 2 has a function in the gymnosperm Gnetum which is related to that of <b>class</b> <b>B</b> floral organ identity genes of angiosperms. That function may be in the specification of male reproductive organ identity, and in distinguishing male from female reproductive organs...|$|R
