The pilots also spotted and photographed areas the Germans were strengthening and reconnoitered marshalling yards to see if reinforcements were being sent in from other parts of Germany. During November and December, missions were flown over the Ruhr and Rhine valleys and over such cities as Frankfurt, Mannheim, Wiesbaden, Koblenz, and Ludwigshafen, many of which were heavily defended.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} human gait classification from a robust model (in) validation perspective. The main idea is to associate to each class of gaits a nominal model, subject to bounded uncertainty and measurement noise. In this context, the problem of recognizing an activity from a sequence of frames can be formulated as the problem of determining whether this sequence could have been generated by a given (model, uncertainty, and noise) triple. By exploiting interpolation theory, this problem can be recast into a nonconvex optimization. In order to efficiently solve it, we propose two convex relaxations, one deterministic and one stochastic. As we illustrate experimentally, these relaxations achieve over 83 percent and 86 <b>percent</b> <b>success</b> <b>rates,</b> respectively, {{even in the face}} of noisy data.

In April, Hoffman pitched nine innings and allowed 13earned runs and six home runs—surpassing his totals in both categories {{from all of}} the previous season—and he blew four of his seven save opportunities. Historically though, Hoffman had blown 20 of 84 save attempts in April for his career, a 76.1 <b>percent</b> <b>success</b> <b>rate,</b> while converting 90.6 percent the rest of the season. On May 1, Hoffman earned his first save at Petco Park as a visitor, as the Brewers beat the Padres 2–1. After saving just five of his first 10 chances with an ERA over 12.00 in mid-May, Hoffman's struggles prompted Brewers manager Ken Macha to remove him as closer and move him into middle relief to work on his mechanics. Hoffman insisted that there was nothing physically wrong with him, and he served as a mentor for his replacement, John Axford. Stuck at 596 career saves before his demotion, Hoffman eventually returned to a setup role, and occasionally pitched in save situations. On September 7, 2010, he recorded his 600th save, and he was carried off the field by his teammates. [...] "To {{be a part of it}} was great because of how much admiration we all have for Trevor", said teammate Craig Counsell. Hoffman finished the season win a 2–7 win–loss record, 10 saves in 15 chances, and a 5.89 ERA in 50 appearances, but he allowed just nine earned runs in his final 33 appearances dating back to June 3. He and the Brewers parted ways on November 2 when the club declined to exercise a $7 million mutual option on his contract.|$|E

2500|$|When {{performed}} with a YAG laser {{designed specifically for}} vitreolysis, reported side effects and complications associated with vitreolysis are rare. However, YAG lasers have traditionally been designed {{for use in the}} anterior portion of the eye, i.e. posterior capsulotomy and iridotomy treatments. As a result, they often provide a limited view of the vitreous, which can make it difficult to identify the targeted floaters and membranes. They also carry a high risk of damage to surrounding ocular tissue. Accordingly, vitreolysis is not widely practised, being performed by very few specialists. One of them, John Karickhoff, has performed the procedure more than 1,400 times and claims a 90 <b>percent</b> <b>success</b> <b>rate.</b> However, the MedicineNet web site states that [...] "there is no evidence that this [...] is effective. The use of a laser also poses significant risks to the vision in what is otherwise a healthy eye." [...] A YAG laser optimized for use in the posterior segment, in addition to use in the anterior segment, is recommended for vitreolysis. In order to visualize the floater and target accordingly, the laser's light source must be positioned in the same optical axis as the ophthalmologist's visual axis. Most conventional YAG lasers, in contrast, use a lower angle of illuminating light. Whilst these lasers are well-suited to use in the anterior part of the eye, they are ill-equipped for use in the vitreous chamber, and thereby make it difficult for the ophthalmologist to visualize (and treat) the floater(s).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{improvements}} in effectiveness {{and accuracy of}} the emerging field of automated deception detection and the associated potential of language technologies have triggered increased interest in mass media and general public. Computational tools capable of alerting users to potentially deceptive content in computer–mediated messages are invaluable for supporting undisrupted, computer–mediated communication and information practices, credibility assessment and decision–making. The goal of this ongoing research is to inform creation of such automated capabilities. In this study we elicit a sample of 90 computer–mediated personal stories with varying levels of deception. Each story has 10 associated human deception level judgments, confidence scores, and explanations. In total, 990 unique respondents participated in the study. Three approaches are taken to the data analysis of the sample: human judges, linguistic detection cues, and machine learning. Comparable to previous research results, human judgments achieve 50 – 63 <b>percent</b> <b>success</b> <b>rates,</b> depending on what is considered deceptive. Actual deception levels negatively correlate with their confident judgment as being deceptive (r = - 0. 35, df = 88, ρ = 0. 008).

Linguistic cues are extracted, calculated, and modeled with logistic regression, but are found not to be significant predictors of deception level, confidence score, or an authors’ ability to fool a reader. We address the associated challenges with error analysis. The respondents’ stories and explanations are manually content–analyzed and result in a faceted deception classification (theme, centrality, realism, essence, self–distancing) and a stated perceived cue typology.

40|$|Background: The use of endosseous dental {{implants}} {{has become}} common {{practice for the}} rehabilitation of edentulous patients, and a two-implant overdenture has been recommended as the standard of care. The use of small-diameter implants may extend treatment options and reduce the necessity for bone augmentation. However, the mechanical strength of titanium is limited, so titanium alloys with greater tensile and fatigue strength may be preferable. Purpose: This randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter study investigated in a split-mouth model whether small-diameter implants made from Titanium- 13 Zirconium alloy (TiZr, Roxolid (TM)) perform at least as well as Titanium Grade IV implants. Methods and Materials: Patients with an edentulous mandible received one TiZr and one Ti Grade IV small-diameter bone level implant (3. 3 mm, SLActive (R)) in the interforaminal region. The site distribution was randomized and double-blinded. Outcome measures included change in radiological peri-implant bone level from surgery to 12 months post-insertion (primary), implant survival, success, soft tissue conditions, and safety (secondary). Results: Of 91 treated patients, 87 were available for the 12 -month follow-up. Peri-implant bone level change (- 0. 3 +/- 0. 5 mm vs - 0. 3 +/- 0. 6 mm), plaque, and sulcus bleeding indices {{were not significantly different}} between TiZr and Ti Grade IV implants. Implant survival rates were 98. 9 percent and 97. 8 <b>percent,</b> <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> were 96. 6 percent and 94. 4 percent, respectively.

Conclusion: This study confirms that TiZr small-diameter bone level implants provide at least the same outcomes after 12 months as Ti Grade IV bone level implants. The improved mechanical properties of TiZr implants may extend implant therapy to more challenging clinical situations...|$|R

Forty-two patients who had undergone 46 endoscopic DCR at a tertiary medical center, from 2002 to 2004, for correction of lacrimal system obstruction were investigated. The surgical technique involves elevation of a nasal mucosal flap, full sac exposure using a power drill, and shaping of the mucosal flap to cover denuded bone and juxtapose exposed sac mucosa. Postoperative symptoms and endoscopic findings of the neo-ostium were evaluated. Mean duration of follow-up was 5. 9 months.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe how a WHP agency in Zurich, Switzerland, used bulk mailings, information events, telephone marketing and free initial consultations for the large-scale geographic marketing of WHP services, with a focus on tobacco prevention (TP). Design/methodology/approach – To analyze the number of companies responding positively to solicitation, examine the predictors of positive responses and explore the reasons for negative responses, the authors used both quantitative (e. g. a standardized questionnaire) and qualitative (telephone interviews) methods. Findings – The results show that except for telephone marketing (69 <b>percent),</b> the <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> of dissemination activities were very low (3 - 9 percent). Predictors for a positive response were institutionalization of WHP, the representative’s personal concern about TP, and problems with environmental tobacco smoke within the company. The most prominent reason for a negative Response was that the companies had already implemented TP measures by themselves and needed no further external support. Practical implications – It is suggested that TP was the wrong emphasis for a WHP program to be disseminated at that particular time, because a law on protection from passive smoking was introduced in Switzerland shortly afterwards. Originality/value – The study examines dissemination strategies under real-life Consulting conditions. It builds on on a large sample of companies and uses both quantitative and qualitative research methods.

Materials and Methods: Surface lesions were defined as tumours located or reaching within 1 cm of liver capsule including exophytic lesions. Seventy-four surface HCC including 21 exophytic in 58 patients (surface group) and 60 intraparenchymal HCC in 54 patients (intraparenchymal group) measuring up to 4 cm in maximum extent underwent percutaneous [ultrasound (US) or computed tomography-guided (CT-guided) ] RFA. The response to the treatment was assessed by contrast enhanced CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of RFA and thereafter every 4 – 6 months. In case of features suggesting residual disease, a repeat RFA was performed. The technical success after single-session RFA, complications and disease recurrence rates were calculated and compared between two groups. Results: Technical success achieved after first session of RFA in surface HCC was 95 % (70 / 74) and intraparenchymal HCC was 97 % (58 / 60). Hundred <b>percent</b> secondary <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> was achieved in both groups after second repeat RFA in residual lesion. No major difference in complication and local recurrence rate in both group on follow-up in surface HCC and intraparenchymal HCC. No case of needle track, peritoneal seeding, and treatment mortality was found. Conclusions: The complication rate and efficacy of RFA for surface and exophytic HCC's were {{comparable to that of}} intraparenchymal HCC. Hence surface and exophytic lesions should not be considered a contraindication for RFA in cirrhotic patients...|$|R
