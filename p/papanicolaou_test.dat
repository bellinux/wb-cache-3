25|$|HPV {{vaccines}} {{can prevent}} {{the most common}} types of infection.

Cervical cancer screening, such as with the <b>Papanicolaou</b> <b>test</b> (pap) or looking at the cervix after using acetic acid, can detect early cancer or abnormal cells that may develop into cancer. This allows for early treatment which results in better outcomes. Screening has reduced both the number and deaths from cervical cancer in the developed world.|$|E
25|$|Checking the cervix by the <b>Papanicolaou</b> <b>test,</b> or Pap smear, for {{cervical}} cancer has {{been credited with}} dramatically {{reducing the number of}} cases of and mortality from {{cervical cancer}} in developed countries. Pap smear screening every 3–5 years with appropriate follow-up can reduce cervical cancer incidence up to 80%. Abnormal results may suggest the presence of precancerous changes, allowing examination and possible preventive treatment. The treatment of low-grade lesions may adversely affect subsequent fertility and pregnancy. Personal invitations encouraging women to get screened are effective at increasing the likelihood they will do so.

While the cytopathologists need to be aware of specific infections and neoplasms likely to be encountered in this setting, they should be aware of the current shift in the pattern of human immunodeficiency virus-related diseases, as human immunodeficiency virus patients are living longer with highly active antiretroviral therapy and suffering fewer opportunistic infections with better antimicrobial prophylaxis. There is a rise in nonhuman immunodeficiency virus-defining cancers (e. g., anal cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma) and entities (e. g., gynecomastia) from drug-related side effects. Given that fine needle aspiration is a valuable, noninvasive, and cost-effective tool, it is frequently employed in the evaluation and diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus-related diseases.

Methods: Medical records of 46 women participating in a breast and cervical cancer prevention program and 42 medical reports of women that regularly visited the primary healthcare unit from August to December 2006 were examined.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To develop {{recommendations}} for practising physicians on the advisability of screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in asymptomatic women. OPTIONS: Visual inspection, <b>Papanicolaou</b> <b>testing,</b> colposcopy or cervicography, use of HPV group-specific antigen, DNA hybridization, dot blot technique, Southern blot technique or {{polymerase chain reaction}} followed by physical or chemical therapeutic intervention. OUTCOMES: Evidence for a link between HPV infection and cervical cancer, sensitivity and specificity of HPV screening techniques, effectiveness of treatments for HPV infection, and {{the social and economic}} costs incurred by screening. EVIDENCE: MEDLINE was searched for articles published between January 1966 to June 1993 {{with the use of the}} key words "papillomavirus," "cervix neoplasms," "mass screening," "prospective studies," "prevalence," "sensitivity," "specificity," "human" and "female. " VALUES: Proven cost-effective screening techniques that could lead to decreased morbidity or mortality were given a high value. The evidence-based methods and values of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination were used. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: Potential benefits are to prevent cervical cancer and eliminate HPV infection. Potential harmful effects include the creation of an unnecessary burden on the health care system and the labelling of otherwise healthy people as patients with a sexually transmitted disease for which therapy is generally ineffective. Potential costs would include expense of testing, increased use of colposcopy and treatment. RECOMMENDATIONS: There is fair evidence to exclude HPV screening (beyond <b>Papanicolaou</b> <b>testing</b> for cervical cancer) in asymptomatic women (grade D recommendation). VALIDATION: The report was reviewed by members of the task force and three external reviewers who were selected to represent different areas of expertise.

There is a statistically significant positive correlation (Spearman= 0. 829; p< 0, 001) between histological and cytological findings of the respondents. Most estimates of diagnostic performance of <b>Papanicolaou</b> <b>test</b> in discrimination of LSIL, HSIL and carcinoma planocellulare in accordance with cervicitis are for cytological findings of ASCH (PA IIIa) (Sp= 90. 6 % and Sn= 100 % for carcinoma planocellulare; Sn = 96 % for HSIL and Sn= 86 % for LSIL). In discrimination HSIL from LSIL the best discrimination is achieved by finding LSIL (PAIIIb) <b>Papanicolaou</b> <b>test</b> (Sn= 72. 0 %, Sp= 67. 4 %), and in discrimination carcinoma planocellulare from LSIL best discrimination is achieved by finding HSIL (PA IIIb/IV) <b>Papanicolaou</b> <b>test</b> (Sn= 77. 8 %, Sp= 97. 7 %). Based on our results we can conclude that there is a positive correlation between histological-cytological findings and that the <b>Papanicolaou</b> <b>test</b> more reliable in detecting severe premalignant lesions.
