40|$|Erecting shield wires {{is one of}} the {{effective}} measures to improve power frequency electric field environment around high voltage transmission line, which can reduce the impact of power frequency electric field to surroundings and human activity. There is an unknown multidimensional non-linear relationship among the quantity <b>of</b> <b>shield</b> wires, the suspended positions and shielding effectiveness. Therefore, finite element method combined with particle swarm optimization is proposed to solve this problem in the research. Shielding effectiveness is as optimization objective, the quantity, the diameter and the suspension <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>shield</b> wires are optimization variables. Moreover, an optimization example is demonstrated, and the optimization results are satisfied. The proposed method is not only applicable to optimize shield wires, but also suitable for employing in other aspects of electromagnetic field inverse problems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{effective}} neutron <b>shielding</b> characteristics <b>of</b> the new <b>shielding</b> material designed and manufactured to be used for the construction of the new SANRAD facility at Necsa, South Africa, through Au foil activation as well as MCNP simulations. The <b>shielding</b> capability <b>of</b> the high density shielding material was investigated in the worst case region (the neutron beam axis) of the experimental chamber for two operational modes. The everyday operational mode includes the 15 cm thick poly crystalline Bismuth filter at room temperature (assumed) to filter gamma-rays and some neutron spectrum energies. The second mode, dynamic imaging, will be conducted without the Bi-filter. The objective was achieved through a foil activation measurement at the current SANRAD facility and MCNP calculations. Several Au foilswere imbedded at different thicknesses(two at each <b>position)</b> <b>of</b> <b>shielding</b> material up to 80 cm thick to track the attenuation of the neutron beam over distance within the shielding material. The neutron flux and subsequently the associated dose rates were calculated from the activation levels of the Au foils. The concrete shielding material was found to provide adequate shielding for all energies of neutrons emerging from beam port no- 2 of the SAFARI- 1 research reactorwithin a thickness of 40 cm of concrete...|$|R

40|$|Background: Gonad {{shielding}} {{has been}} recommended during pelvic x-rays since the 1950 s. The popular method <b>of</b> gonad <b>shielding</b> is placement a lead shield in the midline of the pelvis. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the prevalence and utility <b>of</b> gonad <b>shielding</b> in pediatrics undergoing pelvic x-rays. Materials and MethodsFollowing study approval, we retrospectively retrieved data from the digital image library of ten radiology depertments of Khuzestan provience-Iran to identify pediatric patients who underwent pelvic x-ray (anteriorposterior [AP] view). All the images were reviewed for the probable evidence <b>of</b> gonad <b>shield.</b> If there was evidence <b>of</b> <b>shielding,</b> the accuracy <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shield</b> was also investigated by a single assistant radiologist. ResultsIn all 1745 pelvic x-rays (942 girls and 803 boys) were identified <b>of</b> which the <b>shield</b> was present in 51 (5. 41 %) radiographs of girls and 132 (16. 43 %) radiographs of boys. When a shield was present; the shields has adequate positioning only in 8 (15. 68 %) radiographs in girls and 59 radiographs in boys. Inaccurate placement and absence <b>of</b> gonad <b>shields</b> were more common in girls than the boys. Due to the shield has concealed the anatomical criteria of the pelvis, retakes of the examination was required in 11 (21. 56 %) radiographs of girls and 14 (10. 6 %) radiographs of boys. ConclusionThe current methods <b>of</b> gonad <b>shielding</b> in girls pelvic x-ray was not effective nor is justifiable. We  no longer advocate <b>of</b> gonad <b>shielding</b> during girls pelvic x-ray. However in boys it is controversial and depends on the skill and effort of radiographers...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether gonad shields are correctly positioned on the pelvic radiographs {{of children with}} slipped capital femoral epiphysis. DESIGN [...] Retrospective study of radiographs taken of children treated by in situ pinning of slipped capital femoral epiphysis between 1 January 1983 and 31 December 1988. SETTING [...] Three teaching hospitals in north west England. PATIENTS [...] 32 patients with complete set of radiographs. RESULTS [...] An average of 10. 8 anteroposterior pelvic radiographs plus 8. 9 lateral hip radiographs had been performed per patient. Gonad shields had been completely omitted in 137 (40 %) anteroposterior pelvic radiographs performed on the 32 patients {{at the time of}} completion of the study. In 100 (29 %) the gonad shields were adequately protecting the gonads, but in 109 (31 %) the gonad shields were not protecting the gonads due to incorrect <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shield.</b> The incorrect <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> the gonad <b>shields</b> was more commonly found in girls than boys (64 vs 45; p less than 0. 012), presumably because of the difficulty in determining gonadal position in relation to surface landmarks. Absence <b>of</b> gonad <b>shields</b> was also more commonly seen in girls (82 v 55; p less than 0. 005), but this is not easily explained. CONCLUSIONS [...] Gonad shields are not protecting the gonads in a large percentage of anteroposterior pelvic radiographs (71 %) because they have been omitted or inadequately placed. This avoidable excess radiation exposure to the gonads, combined with the inability to shield the gonads in lateral hip radiographs and the large number of radiographs performed, results in the gonads receiving a higher dose of radiation than may otherwise be the case, and may increase the potential for disease in the future offspring of these patients...|$|R

For this a special two variant of body frame – one for treatment planning and an another one for treatment delivery – was made. The total dose of 12 – 15 Gy (in lung not more than 9 Gy) was delivered in six fraction of 15 MV photons, produced in Primus linear accelerator, for 3 consecutive days. Patient was treated {{by a combination of}} fields: lateral – set at SSD of 330 cm and AP/PA – set at 135 cm. The dose-rate measured at 10 cm in a water phantom for lateral fields was 4, 3 cGy/min., and for AP/PA fields 23, 6 cGy/min. Lung shields were made from wood alloy and their shape was carried out from computerized tomograph scans (CT). For each patient a set of computerized tomograph scans was prepared. Patient during the CT was laying in supine position in the body frame made of 1 cm thick plexi plates. On the walls of that body frame a special marks of tin material were inserted. These marks allow to reproduce both – the same patient position during the irradiation and also in the treatment planning system HELAX. <b>Position</b> <b>of</b> <b>shields</b> before AP/PA fraction was determined by means of HELAX, and then shields were fastened to plexi trays inserted in the head of Primus.

The volume between the patient and walls of the body frame was fulfilled by bolus (bags with rice) to get a homogenous dose distribution. The electron boost to the thorax wall (shielded for 15 MV photons) was delivered with a 6 or 9 MeV electron beam. The percentage deviation of dose, for all 9 irradiated patients, calculated at ten anatomical points representative of the body anatomy, was in the limit − 0, 4 % to + 13 % (excluded in lung) from the dose delivered to PC (reference point: 1 / 2 AP and 1 / 2 lateral dimension at 1 / 2 of patient length in irradiation position).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} general {{applicable}} algorithm for the optimization {{of the current}} density distribution in the electrochemical cells using the insulating shields during the electroplating process.

The aim of this method is to develop a systematic modification <b>of</b> the insulating <b>shield</b> <b>position</b> in order to get a more uniform distribution of the current density, hence a more uniform deposited layer at the cathode. As the displacement <b>of</b> the insulating <b>shield</b> is performed with the Level Set Method, the re-meshing of the computational domain with finite elements is not required anymore.
