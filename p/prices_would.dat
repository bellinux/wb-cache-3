5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on a raft of {{promises}} that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E
5|$|Spain forbade its American colonies {{to trade}} with other nations or foreign colonies, and imposed itself as the only buyer and vendor for their {{international}} trade. This situation damaged the viceroyalty, as Spain's economy was not powerful enough to produce the huge supply of goods that the numerous colonies would need. This caused economic shortages and recession. The Spanish trade routes favored the ports of Mexico and Lima, {{to the detriment of}} Buenos Aires. As a result, Buenos Aires smuggled those products that could not be obtained legitimately. Most local authorities allowed this smuggling as a lesser evil, even though it was illegal, and it occasionally equalled in volume the legal commerce with Spain. Two antagonistic factions emerged: the landowners wanted free trade so they could sell their products abroad, while the merchants, who benefited from the high prices of smuggled imports, opposed free trade because <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> come down.|$|E
5|$|The {{deregulation}} process, {{which would}} {{eliminate the need for}} concessions for routes, was driven by Norway's application for membership of the EU. This was supported by the Labor Party and the right-winged Conservative Party and Progress Party. The plans from the EU indicated that international routes within EU should be deregulated from 1 January 1993, with Norway and Sweden joining from 1 July. Full, domestic liberalization should be performed by 1 April 1997. SAS and Braathens SAFE proposed a solution where only Norwegian airlines could compete until 1997, which was thought to efficiently hinder other airlines, rather than these two, until then. SAS announced its support for competition on 4 February 1993, while Braathens SAFE stated that it no longer was in favor of competition, despite having arguing for this for the whole of the company's history. The company stated that stability was needed and that competition would result in marginalized routes, that were being cross-subsidized, being closed. SAS stated that with competition, <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> fall 20–30%, and that SAS wanted to operate with a loss to force Braathens SAFE close services.|$|E

25|$|Imbalances in {{international}} trade were theoretically rectified automatically by the gold standard. A country with a deficit would have depleted gold reserves and would thus have to reduce its money supply. The resulting fall in demand would reduce imports and the lowering of <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> boost exports; thus the deficit would be rectified. Any country experiencing inflation would lose gold and therefore would have {{a decrease in the}} amount of money available to spend.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the price}} {{businesses}} charge to trade buyers. This is their cost price plus a mark up or profit margin. As a guideline: this is normally around 2 x the cost price. But if the cost price is relatively high then it’s less. So for example if your cost <b>price</b> <b>would</b> be £150, then your trade/whole sale <b>price</b> <b>would</b> be around £250.|$|R
25|$|The {{president}} {{opted to}} use price ceilings on tortillas that protected local consumers of corn. This price control {{came in the}} form of the Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact between the government and many of the main tortilla producing companies, including Grupo Maseca and Bimbo, to put a price ceiling at 8.50 pesos per kilogram of tortilla. The hope was that a ceiling on corn <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> provide incentive for the market to lower all prices nationally.|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} the birth of their second child, in 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act was enacted, which brought to Colorado, and Colorado mine-owners, the hope that wildly {{fluctuating}} silver <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> stabilize. Profits from silver mining had diminished as the supply had declined and the extraction process and labor costs had increased. When a few of Horace's investments began to fail, he was forced to mortgage the Tabor theater in Denver and other real estate he had bought during the past decades.|$|E
25|$|Controlling for inflation, {{prices of}} slaves rose {{dramatically}} in the six decades prior to Civil War, reflecting demand due to commodity cotton, as well as use of slaves in shipping and industry. Although the prices of slaves relative to indentured servants declined, both got more expensive. Cotton production was rising and relied {{on the use of}} slaves to yield high profits. Fogel and Engeman initially argued that if the Civil War had not happened, the slave <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> have increased even more, an average of more than 50 percent by 1890.|$|E

The contract for the bridge piers and land arches and for the Newcastle Viaduct were won by John Rush and Benjamin Lawton of York for £94,00 and £82,500 respectively.

25|$|In July 2011, Netflix {{announced}} that subscription prices were changing: that DVD rental <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> drop by 20%, {{but that the}} initially free streaming service would now be charged. For many customers this represented a savings, but for the group that both received discs and enjoyed streaming, it {{would result in a}} cost increase of up to 60%. The move led to reported customer backlash, cancellations, lower than projected subscriber growth, and a decline in stock price. In response, Netflix admitted to poor public relations decisions in announcing the change but kept its policy in place.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, believing rents would {{continue}} to rise, Li decided to purchase a site and develop his own factory building. An opportunity to acquire more land arrived after the 1967 riots when many people fled Hong Kong, and, as a result, property prices plummeted. Li believed the political crisis would be temporary and property <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> eventually rise, and bought land from the fleeing residents at low prices. In 1971, Li officially named his real estate development company Cheung Kong (長江實業), named after Cheung Kong, (Chang Jiang or the Yangtze River) the longest river in China.|$|E

25|$|There was an {{underlying}} misconception, {{that there is}} a belief by the Jews that whoever doesn't reveal a Corfu etrog for Sukkot will not survive the next year. However, this was not the case. The rabbi of Kovno, Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor, intended to stop this record-breaking monopoly, and banned the Corfu etrog until the <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> be lowered, and the status of kashrus clarified. Even the rabbi of Corfu certified in a letter that there were already many grafted trees in the region, and the certification process was very complex. The ban was further supported with signatures of many leading rabbis throughout Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|This mood is {{actively}} used in modern Lithuanian {{and one of}} its functions corresponds to the English conditional mood. The conditional mood is used to describe a hypothetical action that could take place if certain conditions were met (hence the name) or a desired action in present or in future: Panaikinus muitus, sumažėtų prekių kainos – Having eliminated customs duties, <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> go down. Conditional mood is used in conditional (if) sentences; this usage requires conditional mood in subordinate and main clauses if both actions are perceived as hypothetical: Visi laimėtų, jeigu priimtumėte šį pasiūlymą. – There would be a win-win situation for everyone if you accepted this offer.|$|E
25|$|The 1998 {{redevelopment}} caused controversy {{when the}} club informed 4,000 season-ticket-holding fans that their seat <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> be increased to corporate rates, with {{the option of}} paying these or being moved to seats in the proposed expanded sections. Half of these fans were 'bondholders', who had paid £500 in 1994 which they asserted guaranteed them an option on their specific seat for 10 years. Some fans resisted, and after two high-court cases and a Save Our Seats campaign, the club was allowed to move the fans, under an exceptional circumstances clause. As a gesture of goodwill, the club did not pursue the fans for legal costs awarded over their insured limit.|$|E

When it did so, Cramer's hedge fund profited. In 2003, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals was testing a weight‑loss drug, and Shkreli, then 19, predicted that the stock <b>price</b> <b>would</b> fall.

25|$|While {{the credit}} rating of India {{was hit by}} its nuclear weapons tests in 1998, it has since been raised to {{investment}} level in 2003 by Standard & Poor's (S) and Moody's. India experienced high growth rates, averaging 9% from 2003 to 2007. Growth then moderated in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. In 2003, Goldman Sachs predicted that India's GDP in current <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> overtake France and Italy by 2020, Germany, UK and Russia by 2025 and Japan by 2035, making it the third-largest economy of the world, behind the US and China. India is often seen by most economists as a rising economic superpower which will {{play a major role}} in the 21st-century global economy.|$|E
25|$|In {{mainstream}} economic theory, a {{free market}} rations an increasingly scarce commodity by increasing its price. A higher price should stimulate producers to produce more, and consumers to consume less, while possibly shifting to substitutes. The first three mitigation strategies in the above list are, therefore, in keeping with mainstream economic theory, as government policies can affect the supply and demand for petroleum {{as well as the}} availability of substitutes. In contrast, the last type of strategy in the list (attempting to shield consumers from rising <b>prices)</b> <b>would</b> seem to work against classical economic theory, by encouraging consumers to overconsume the scarce quantity, thus making it even scarcer. To avoid creating outright shortages, attempts at price control may require some sort of rationing scheme.|$|E
25|$|The ongoing {{demand for}} well-educated workers {{continued}}. Housing prices {{in urban areas}} continued to increase so that a modest home that in the 1960s cost $25,000, cost {{half a million dollars}} or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses they never intended to live in, expecting to make a huge profit in a matter of months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. Mortgage companies were compliant, as everyone assumed the <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> keep rising. The bubble burst in 2007-8 as housing prices began to crash and the boom years ended. Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared as many financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.|$|E
