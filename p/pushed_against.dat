5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic {{the western}} edge of the North American {{continent}} was <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a subduction zone. A subduction zone is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was pushed to the west. The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E
5|$|The ironclad age saw the {{development}} of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons, which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets. The first torpedoes were static mines, used extensively in the American Civil War. That conflict also saw {{the development}} of the spar torpedo, an explosive charge <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the hull of a warship by a small boat. For the first time, a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one—and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads, the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously. The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar-torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864–5, but these vessels never saw action. Another proposal, the towed or 'Harvey' torpedo, involved an explosive on a line or outrigger; either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal.|$|E
50|$|From a {{conceptual}} standpoint, Newton's third law is seen {{when a person}} walks: they <b>push</b> <b>against</b> the floor, and the floor <b>pushes</b> <b>against</b> the person. Similarly, the tires of a car <b>push</b> <b>against</b> the road while the road pushes back on the tires—the tires and road simultaneously <b>push</b> <b>against</b> each other. In swimming, a person interacts with the water, pushing the water backward, while the water simultaneously pushes the person forward—both the person and the water <b>push</b> <b>against</b> each other. The reaction forces account for the motion in these examples. These forces depend on friction; a person or car on ice, for example, {{may be unable to}} exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} main methods of using human power to propel a land vehicle: {{some kind of}} {{drivetrain}} that turns one or more drive wheels; <b>pushing</b> laterally <b>against</b> the ground, to the side relative to the forward motion of the vehicle, with a wheel, skate, or ski that simultaneously moves forward; by <b>pushing</b> <b>against</b> the ground directly with an appendage, such as a hand or a foot, opposite to the direction of travel, or by <b>pushing</b> <b>against</b> {{the air with a}} propeller.|$|R
5|$|Following {{an initial}} {{penetration}} to the north, the retreating 34th Infantry moved south to Nonsan. On July 15, the 19th Infantry moved its 2nd Battalion to fill {{some of the}} gaps left by the 34th. There, it was reinforced by troops from the Republic of Korea Army. The combined forces observed a large build-up of North Korean troops {{on the west side}} of the river. At 03:00 on July 16, the North Koreans launched a massive barrage of tank, artillery and mortar fire on the 19th Infantry positions and North Korean troops began to cross the river in boats. The North Korean forces gathered on the west bank and assaulted the positions of the 1st Battalion's C and E Companies, followed by a second landing against B Company. North Korean forces <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the entire battalion, threatening to overwhelm it. The regimental commander ordered all support troops and officers to the line and they were able to repulse the assault. However, in the melee, North Korean forces infiltrated their rear elements, attacking the reserve forces and blocking supply lines. Stretched thin, the 19th Infantry was unable to hold the line at the Kum River and simultaneously repel the North Korean forces.|$|E

25|$|This is a two {{movement}} structure, {{the first}} movement a vigorous Allegro, {{and the second}} combining the characters of a slow movement, scherzo and finale. Throughout there is a conflict between G major and G minor– particularly guided by the intervals of a major third and a minor third, which are often combined and <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> each other to create strange resonances– for example G to B flat in the low register of the piano, and B natural to D in the upper register.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, Kraus {{supported}} Frank Wedekind to {{make possible}} the staging in Vienna of his controversial play Pandora's Box; the play {{told the story of}} a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in German society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution. These plays' frank depiction of sexuality and violence, including lesbianism and an encounter with Jack the Ripper, <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time. Wedekind's works are considered among the precursors of expressionism, but in 1914, when expressionist poets like Richard Dehmel began producing war propaganda, Kraus became a fierce critic of them.|$|E
25|$|An {{internal}} collet {{can be used}} to lock two telescoping tubes together. In {{this case}} the collet {{is in the form of}} a truncated cone drilled and threaded down the centreline. The collet diameter matches the bore of the inner tube, having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A threaded stud, anchored at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull the collet into the tube. The increasing diameter of the collet forces the inner tube to expand and be <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the inner wall of the outer tube thus locking the two tubes together. The inner tube is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|E

25|$|On {{the same}} day, the Armenian vanguard <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> Sadakhlo, where general Tsulukdize's forces had {{fortified}} {{themselves at the}} station and nearby strategic heights. The initial Armenian attack was repulsed, {{and in order to}} outflank the defenders, the town of Shulaveri was captured the next day. Colonel Korolkov called for all Armenian men in the area, able to fight, to mobilize and support the army's offensive. On 20 December, the Armenians were blockading a vital train station that connected Sadakhlo with Tbilisi preventing further reinforcements. A day after, they massed all their artillery guns and launched an attack on the town, only to be repulsed with heavy casualties by the defenders who were equipped with an armoured train. Using the same train, the remaining Georgian troops broke out of the encirclement to join a defensive line further north. Following that defeat, Tsulukidze resigned and got replaced by general Sumbatashvili. The Georgian army was already mobilizing in the Lori district and started to prepare for major counterattacks.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} and most basic method of holding the work is a planing stop or dog ear, which is simply a peg or small piece of wood or metal that stands just above the surface {{at the end of the}} bench top. The work is placed on the bench with the end <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the stop. The force of the planing keeps the board in place, so long as the force is always toward the stop. Planing against a stop gives the woodworker good {{feedback}} - he can tell a lot about what is going on just by the pressure, force and balance required. A stop can take the form of a batten attached to the end of the bench, or it can be adjustable, able to be moved up and down according to the size of the work - or pushed down below the surface when not needed. A simple bench dog can serve as a planing stop.|$|E
25|$|The Zagros fold {{and thrust}} belt {{was formed by}} {{collision}} of two tectonic plates, the Eurasian Plate and the Arabian Plate. This collision primarily happened during the Miocene and folded the entire rocks that had been deposited from the Carboniferous to the Miocene in the geosyncline {{in front of the}} Iranian Plate. The process of collision continues to the present and as the Arabian Plate is being <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the Eurasian Plate, the Zagros Mountains and the Iranian Plateau are getting higher and higher. Recent GPS measurements in Iran have shown that this collision is still active and the resulting deformation is distributed non-uniformly in the country, mainly taken up in the major mountain belts like Alborz and Zagros. A relatively dense GPS network which covered the Iranian Zagros also proves a high rate of deformation within the Zagros. The GPS results show that the current rate of shortening in the southeast Zagros is ~10mm/yr, dropping to ~5mm/yr in the northwest Zagros. The north-south Kazerun strike-slip fault divides the Zagros into two distinct zones of deformation. The GPS results also show different shortening directions along the belt, normal shortening in the southeast and oblique shortening in the northwest Zagros.|$|E

25|$|On 22 May 1794 the Coalition {{defeated}} the French in the Battle of Tournay. After arriving a day {{too late for}} Tourcoing, Pichegru ordered {{an attack on the}} Allied position at Tournai. While Souham's division attacked the enemy right flank, Bonnaud <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> its center, while feinting against the left. After a struggle costly to both sides, the French were compelled to withdraw. On 17 June the French successfully concluded the Siege of Ypres which allowed that part of Flanders to be overrun. By 1 July, the Army of the North seized Bruges and on 10 July, Brussels. There was a lull during which the French reduced the Coalition-held fortresses in northern France. On 1 September Bonnaud's 5th Division counted 9,103 infantry, 1,558 cavalry and 658 gunners manning 34 cannons and five howitzers. On 27 December his division forced the lines of Breda and on 23 January 1795 was the first to enter The Hague. Bonnaud and Jacques MacDonald were credited with the capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder on the 23rd, but in fact the feat was accomplished by a relatively junior officer, Louis Joseph Lahure.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s it {{had become}} clear to the local {{authorities}} that Malmö's interest for football and other sports was becoming too big for Malmö IP to accommodate. Malmö FF in particular had high average attendances year on year, and matches were often sold out. Apart from the issue of growing popularity, the large crowds raised security issues that became apparent in the Scanian derby game between Malmö FF and Helsingborgs IF in 1951—amid considerable commotion in the stands some people were <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> poles and fences, but nobody was seriously injured. Plans for a new stadium were first drawn up in 1943, when local officials deemed Malmö IP to be too small for major events, but council members differed on where to build the new stadium. The matter was dropped until 1954, when Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup, with matches {{to take place in}} Malmö. The new ground's location was a central issue in the discussion: some suggested a suburban location in Jägersro, to the city's south-east, while others called for a stadium in central Malmö, near the city's main park, Pildammsparken. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954. Malmö Stadion was built on the southern side of Pildammsparken, opposite from the northern site occupied by Malmö IP. Malmö FF and IFK Malmö both moved to Malmö Stadion on its completion in 1958.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation is {{seasonal}} {{and most}} {{occurs in the}} higher elevations. In hot and arid or semi arid lands, evaporation vastly exceeds precipitation. Mexico’s most arid area, the Altar Desert is located in this state. The east {{of the state is}} dominated by the Sierra Madre Occidental, which has less extreme temperatures and relatively more rainfall due to altitude. Most moisture comes in from the Pacific Ocean and the tropics, which is <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the Sierra Madre. This cools the air masses, leading to rain and occasionally snow in the higher elevations. While most of the rain falls in the mountainous areas, much of this water finds its way back to the western coastal plains in the form of rivers and streams that empty into the Gulf of California and fill underground aquifers. Most of the year’s precipitation falls during the rainy season, which is locally called “las aguas” (the waters). These last from July to mid September, when monsoon winds bring moist air from southerly tropical waters. Most of this is from the Pacific Ocean west of Central America but can also come from Gulf of Mexico as well. This moister flow results in nearly daily afternoon thunderstorms. After the las aguas, there may be additional moisture brought in by hurricanes, which generally move west along the Pacific coast of Mexico and occasionally come inland, especially in southern Sonora. However, these storms tend to drop large quantities of rain in a short time, causing flooding and destruction.|$|E

500|$|The {{western edge}} of the North American {{continent}} was later <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the oceanic plate under the adjacent ocean. An area of great compression called a subduction zone was formed in the early-to-mid Mesozoic, which replaced the quiet, sea-covered continental margin with erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains. A chain of volcanoes pushed through the continental crust parallel to the deep trench, fed by magma rising from the subducting oceanic plate as it entered the Earth's hot interior. Thousands of feet (hundreds of meters) of lavas erupted, pushing the ocean over [...] to the west.|$|E
500|$|The {{shoulder}} blades were long flat blade-like bones, held roughly {{parallel to the}} vertebral column. The hips were composed of three elements each: an elongate ilium above the articulation with the leg, an ischium below and behind with a long thin rod, and a pubis in front that flared into a plate-like structure. The structure of the hip hindered the animal from standing with its back erect, because in such a position the thigh bone would have <b>pushed</b> <b>against</b> the joint of the ilium and pubis, instead of pushing only against the solid ilium. [...] The nine fused hip vertebrae provided support for the hip.|$|E
