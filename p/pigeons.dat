5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in <b>pigeons.</b> Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that <b>pigeons</b> build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, <b>pigeons</b> could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic <b>pigeons</b> (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal <b>pigeons,</b> so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E
5|$|Strickland and Melville {{established}} that the dodo was anatomically similar to <b>pigeons</b> in many features. They pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak, with its long, slender, naked basal part. Other <b>pigeons</b> also have bare skin around their eyes, almost reaching their beak, as in dodos. The forehead was high {{in relation to the}} beak, and the nostril was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with <b>pigeons.</b> The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial <b>pigeons</b> than of other birds, both in their scales and in their skeletal features. Depictions of the large crop hinted at a relationship with <b>pigeons,</b> in which this feature is more developed than in other birds. <b>Pigeons</b> generally have very small clutches, and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg. Like <b>pigeons,</b> the dodo lacked the vomer and septum of the nostrils, and it shared details in the mandible, the zygomatic bone, the palate, and the hallux. The dodo differed from other <b>pigeons</b> mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion {{to the rest of the}} cranium.|$|E
5|$|Homing <b>pigeons</b> have {{occasionally}} {{been used}} throughout history by different cultures. Pigeon post had Persian roots, {{and was later}} used by the Romans to aid their military. Frontinus said that Julius Caesar used <b>pigeons</b> as messengers in his conquest of Gaul.|$|E
2500|$|The {{confusion}} is not helped by English naming. [...] D. bicolor is variously {{described as the}} nutmeg <b>pigeon,</b> the Torres Strait <b>pigeon,</b> and the pied imperial <b>pigeon.</b> D. spilorrhoa is also described as the nutmeg <b>pigeon,</b> the white nutmeg <b>pigeon,</b> the Australian pied <b>pigeon,</b> the Australian pied imperial <b>pigeon,</b> the Torres Strait <b>pigeon</b> or the Torresian imperial <b>pigeon.</b>|$|R
50|$|Turturoena, {{commonly}} called bronze-naped <b>pigeon,</b> is a <b>pigeon</b> subgenus comprising three species: the eastern bronze-naped <b>pigeon,</b> the western bronze-naped <b>pigeon,</b> and the São Tomé bronze-naped <b>pigeon.</b>|$|R
500|$|Today, five {{skins and}} a partial {{skeleton}} {{are kept in}} the American Museum of Natural History, while a single skin and the egg are kept at the Natural History Museum at Tring. The Choiseul <b>pigeon</b> {{is also known as}} the Solomon crowned <b>pigeon,</b> Solomon Islands <b>pigeon,</b> Solomons crested <b>pigeon,</b> Solomon Islands crested <b>pigeon,</b> Choiseul crested <b>pigeon,</b> crested Choiseul <b>pigeon,</b> Meek's <b>pigeon,</b> Meek's ground <b>pigeon,</b> and dwarf goura. The indigenous peoples of Choiseul called the species either [...] "kumku-peka" [...] or [...] "kukuru-ni-lua", which translates literally as [...] "pigeon-belong-ground".|$|R
5|$|Homing <b>pigeons</b> use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing <b>pigeons</b> could not orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the sun, but switch to using a {{magnetic field}} cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the <b>pigeons</b> could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|E
5|$|In March, Ohioan {{returned}} 1,627 men to New York, {{mostly from}} the 348th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 87th Infantry Division, followed by another 1,596officers and men, and 1,000homing <b>pigeons</b> on 16 April. Among the <b>pigeons</b> was Cher Ami—the only bird sent out by the Lost Battalion that {{was able to get}} a message through—and 100 captured German <b>pigeons.</b> Cher Ami had received the French Croix de Guerre with Palm and had been recommended for the U.S. Army Distinguished Service Cross by General John J.

50|$|The crested <b>pigeon</b> (Ocyphaps lophotes) is a bird found widely {{throughout}} mainland Australia {{except for}} the far northern tropical areas. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Ocyphaps. There are only two Australian <b>pigeon</b> species that possess an erect crest, being the crested <b>pigeon</b> and the spinifex <b>pigeon.</b> The crested <b>pigeon</b> is the larger of the two species. The crested <b>pigeon</b> is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a topknot <b>pigeon,</b> however the topknot <b>pigeon,</b> or Lopholaimus antarcticus is a different species altogether, and has a red-brown crest that does not stand erect.|$|R
50|$|The band-tailed <b>pigeon</b> (Patagioenas fasciata) is a {{medium-sized}} bird of the Americas. Its closest relatives are the Chilean <b>pigeon,</b> passenger <b>pigeon</b> and the ring-tailed <b>pigeon,</b> which form a clade of Patagioenas with a terminal tail band and iridescent plumage on their necks. Some authorities split this species into the northern band-tailed <b>pigeon</b> (Patagioenas fasciata) {{and the southern}} band-tailed <b>pigeon</b> (Patagioenas albilinea).|$|R
5|$|The Prussian War Ministry was interested, {{but some}} initial {{skepticism}} {{could only be}} overcome {{through a series of}} successful demonstrations. The <b>pigeons</b> proved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a dovecote may need to be moved, and <b>pigeons</b> can take some time to orient to their new position. The problem of making carrier <b>pigeons</b> accept a displaced dovecote with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success by the Italian army around 1880; the French artillery captain Reynaud solved it by raising the <b>pigeons</b> in an itinerant dovecote. There is no indication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a solution as he had heard of an itinerant fairground worker who was also a pigeon fancier with a dovecote in his trailer. At the 1909 exhibitions in Dresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a darkroom with a mobile dovecote in flashy colors. In months of laborious work he trained young <b>pigeons</b> to return to the dovecote even after it was displaced.|$|E

40|$|Sera {{from all}} symptomatics with <b>pigeon</b> breeders' lung and many non-symptomatic <b>pigeon</b> breeders react {{specifically}} with the <b>pigeon</b> antigens {{and in particular}} <b>pigeon</b> intestinal secretions and isolated <b>pigeon</b> intestinal mucin and IgA. In sera from all 82 precipitin-positive <b>pigeon</b> breeders investigated, IgG 1 reacted with both IgA and mucin, while IgG 2 reacted predominantly with mucin only. Sera from all 32 symptomatic patients with <b>pigeon</b> breeders' lung demonstrated an IgG 3 reaction with mucin, but only three sera showed reactivity against IgA and this was very weak. In contrast, only three out of 27 <b>pigeon</b> breeders with pulmonary pathology other than <b>pigeon</b> breeders' lung and only three out of 23 sera from healthy <b>pigeon</b> breeders showed detectable IgG 3 reactivity with mucin. IgG 4 from eight sera only reacted with mucin (n = 7) or IgA (n = 1) and showed no consistent pattern between subject groups. Precipitin-negative sera from 30 volunteers with no previous <b>pigeon</b> exposure showed no IgG subclass reactivity with either the <b>pigeon</b> intestinal secretions or the isolated mucin and IgA antigens. These results show specific IgG 2 and IgG 3 subclass reactivity to <b>pigeon</b> intestinal mucin antigen in precipitin-positive sera from <b>pigeon</b> breeders. Further IgG 3 subclass reactivity specific to <b>pigeon</b> mucin is strongly associated with sera from patients with the active <b>pigeon</b> breeders' lung disease...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Pigeon</b> fanciers {{often have}} their <b>pigeon</b> lofts in {{suitably}} modified garden sheds. In Glasgow {{and other areas}} of Scotland {{there has been a}} tradition of <b>pigeon</b> keepers building their own freestanding urban <b>pigeon</b> lofts, or doocots, standing about 4m high in areas of waste ground close to housing estates. [...] In New York City, <b>pigeon</b> fanciers often build <b>pigeon</b> lofts {{on the roof of the}} building.|$|R
5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is variable. Granivorous species tend to have dull plumage, with a few exceptions, whereas the frugivorous species have brightly {{coloured}} plumage. The Ptilinopus (fruit doves) {{are some of the}} brightest-coloured <b>pigeons,</b> with the three endemic species of Fiji and the Indian Ocean Alectroenas being the brightest. <b>Pigeons</b> and doves may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic. In addition to bright colours, <b>pigeons</b> may sport crests or other ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{rock pigeon}} has been domesticated for {{hundreds}} of years. It has been bred into several varieties kept by hobbyists, of which the best known is the homing pigeon or racing homer. Other popular breeds are tumbling <b>pigeons</b> such as the Birmingham roller, and fancy varieties that are bred for certain physical characteristics such as large feathers on the feet or fan-shaped tails. Domesticated rock <b>pigeons</b> are also bred as carrier <b>pigeons,</b> used {{for thousands of years}} to carry brief written messages, and release doves used in ceremonies. White doves are also commonly used in magic acts.|$|E
5|$|Although war <b>pigeons</b> {{and mobile}} dovecotes were used {{extensively}} during the Second World War, {{it is unclear}} to what extent, if any, they were employed for aerial photography. According {{to a report in}} 1942, the Soviet army discovered abandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-minute intervals, as well as dogs trained to carry <b>pigeons</b> in baskets. On the allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported that the American Signal Corps was aware of the possibility of adopting the technique.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that many <b>pigeon</b> {{materials}} contain one or more of four <b>pigeon</b> proteins—pigeon γ-globulin (PGG), <b>pigeon</b> serum albumin (PSA), <b>pigeon</b> β-globulin (PBG) and a protein cross-reacting immunologically with PGG termed XPGG. It is thought that the ability of seemingly unrelated sources of <b>pigeon</b> material, e. g. <b>pigeon</b> droppings, serum, egg yolk and white to react with sera from cases of <b>pigeon</b> breeders' disease is due to the presence of PGG, PSA, PBG or XPGG in these materials...|$|R
50|$|The trocaz <b>pigeon,</b> Madeira laurel <b>pigeon</b> or long-toed <b>pigeon</b> (Columba trocaz) is a <b>pigeon</b> {{which is}} endemic {{to the island}} of Madeira. It is a mainly grey bird with a pinkish breast; its silvery neck patch and lack of white wing {{markings}} distinguish it from its close relative and probable ancestor, the common wood <b>pigeon.</b> Its call is a characteristic six-note cooing, weaker and lower-pitched {{than that of the}} wood <b>pigeon.</b> Despite its bulky, long-tailed appearance, this <b>pigeon</b> has a fast, direct flight.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountain}} imperial <b>pigeon</b> (Ducula badia), {{also known}} as the maroon-backed imperial <b>pigeon</b> or Hodgson's imperial <b>pigeon,</b> is a species of bird in the <b>pigeon</b> and dove family with a wide range in south-eastern Asia.|$|R
5|$|Despite the War Ministry's {{position}} {{immediately after}} the First World War, in 1932 {{it was reported that}} the German army was training <b>pigeons</b> for photography, and that the German pigeon cameras were capable of 200 exposures per flight. In the same year, the French claimed that they had developed film cameras for <b>pigeons</b> as well as a method for having the birds released behind enemy lines by trained dogs.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Army also trained {{animals for}} use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay {{telephone}} and telegraph cables. Carrier <b>pigeons,</b> who transported messages back from the front line, were also carried in tanks so that they could deliver messages during an attack. Over 20,000 <b>pigeons</b> and 370 handlers were used during the war, and at times, they were the sole means of communication.|$|E
5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual to the subway system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city <b>pigeons,</b> and these bird recordings play every few minutes or so. The system was installed because of issues with <b>pigeons</b> entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been ineffective in curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E
50|$|The Trocaz <b>pigeon</b> was {{formally}} described in 1829 by Karl Heineken.

5|$|Homing <b>pigeons</b> {{were used}} {{extensively}} in the 19th and early 20thcenturies, both for civil pigeon post and as war <b>pigeons.</b> In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the famous pigeon post of Paris carried up to 50,000microfilmed telegrams per pigeon flight from Tours into the besieged capital. Altogether 150,000 individual private telegrams and state dispatches were delivered. In an 1889 experiment of the Imperial Russian Technical Society at Saint Petersburg, {{the chief of the}} Russian balloon corps took aerial photographs from a balloon and sent the developed collodion film negatives to the ground by pigeon post.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war <b>pigeons</b> in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote {{found its way}} to the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were used on a larger scale in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of <b>pigeons</b> in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E
