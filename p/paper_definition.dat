In addition, the paper describes briefly the current results of sociolinguistic research, studying the relations between languages and language communities, as well as analysing {{similarities and differences between}} languages. Moreover, there are presented some results of a practical comparative analysis of a collection of French, German and Polish proverbs. It is shown that dog and cat are the most frequent animals in analysed examples, and that the “ statistical proverb animal” is a mammal. As far as their normative message is concerned, they concern generally the norms defending dignity and justice.

40|$|Background: Verrucae are benign proliferations seen in {{skin and}} mucosae due to {{infection}} with papillomaviruses. They may present differently according to clinical appearance and localization. In time, about 60 % of verrucae spontaneously resolve. Since {{there is no}} single effective treatment method, a few different methods may be combined or sequentially applied. Local treatment meth-ods of verrucae will be discussed in this <b>paper.</b> <b>Definition</b> Verrucae are benign proliferations seen in skin and mucosae due to infection with papillomaviruses. These viruses cause slow growing lesions that do not cause acute symptoms or signs [1, 2]. Historical Aspect Verrucae have been known since ancient Greece and Rome. Up until the 19 th cen-tury, verrucae were believed to be a form of syphilis or gonorrhea [2]. An infectious eti-ology was first questioned by Payne when he contracted verrucae after treating a pa-tient. Viral etiology was first proposed by Ciuffo in 1907 and Strauss et al. isolated the small DNA virus in 1949. Joseph Mel-nick used the term papovavirus in 1960. The virus was characterized by following re-search and it was named human papilloma virus (HPV) [3]. In 1974, Zur Hausen pro-posed that there may be different types of virus and 4 types were identified in 1976 [4]. Today, due to advanced recombinant DNA technology, over 100 different geno-types of HPV have been identified [2]...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{algebraic}} tool {{to solve}} the constraints of propositional calculus. Any constraint of propositional calculus {{can be described in}} terms of equations in a Boolean algebra, and also translated into equations of a Boolean ring where the constraint is represented {{in the form of a}} finite set of polynomials. We give an algorithm which produces a rewriting system for a given Boolean constraint, which reduces Boolean polynomials equivalent under the constraint to the same normal form. The algorithm is a central part of the constraint solver in CAL (Contrainte avec Logique), which is a constraint logic programming language being developed at ICOT. 1. Boolean ring We assume that the reader is familiar with elementary algebraic notions such as ring and ideal (see [Waerden 37, 40], for example), and the terminology of rewriting systems (see [Huet 80], for example). For a Boolean algebra , define x+y=def(x∧ y) ∨(xΛ y) and x y=defx∧ y for each x, y in B, then is known to be a commutative ring with a unit with the following properties.

In this report we consider a number of related measurement issues which are relevant for consideration of policy on equality of access to general practice. Our main conclusion is that whilst the set of worst provided PCTs varies, sometimes substantially, with the choice of GP supply measure, need adjustment, and population base, the set of 30 identified by the White Paper contains a core of around 10 PCTs which are amongst the worst provided on most possible alternative definitions. The White Paper set also contains a larger fringe group which are in the bottom 30 on some definitions, particularly when the White <b>Paper</b> <b>definition</b> of GPs is used, but which also often fall outside the worst provided bottom 30.

Frdchet numbers are defined on page 206 of [9] and later in this section. For Frdchet's conceptions see [1] and [8]. Theorem 27. 1 on page 208 of [9] embodies the first use of the Frdchet numbers as defined by Morse. M n is assumed compact, smooth, connected and without boundaries. A positive definite, nonsingular Weierstrass integral J of class Cøo is defined on M n. Extremals of J from A 1 to A 2 are sought which join a fixed point pair A 1 [...] /: A 2 of the type which is nondegenerate in that A 2 is never conjugate to A 1. Extremals are sought which are A 1 A 2 -homotopic to a homotopically minimizing fixed extremal gjoining A 1 to A 2, and which bear i conjugate points of A 1. Theorem 27. 1 is valid when the number m•g of extremals which are A 1 A 2 -homotopic to g and bear i conjugate points of A 1 is finite for each integer i. Theorem 27. 1 has the corollary, (0. 1) m • •> Ri(Mn) for g fixed and the numbers m g. finite. OBJECTIVE. That relations of the form (0. 1) are valid without restrictions as to finiteness of the type numbers m g. is not a consequence of Theorem 27. 1 of [9].
