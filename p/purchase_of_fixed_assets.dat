50|$|The US Small Business Administration 504 Loan or Certified Development Company {{program is}} {{designed}} to provide financing for the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> which usually means real estate, buildings and machinery, at below market rates. As part of its mission to promote the development of businesses, the SBA offers a number of different loan programs tailored to specific capital needs of growing businesses. The 504 program works by distributing the loan among three parties. The business owner puts a minimum of 10%, a conventional lender (typically a bank) puts up 50%, and a so-called Certified Development Company (CDC) puts up the remaining 40%. Certified Development Companies are established under the 504 code as non-profit corporations set up to support economic growth in their local areas. There are a few hundred such CDCs nationwide. The maximum amount of the loan is $5 million ($5 million for meeting SBA-defined policy goals, and $5.5 million for manufacturers and some energy-related policy goals), and if the borrower defaults, the private sector lender is paid off first, reducing the risk to the lender and encouraging loans.|$|E

Secondly, we develop the pragmatics of sinking funds, which focus on the choice problem attached to sinking funds and the fiduciary role expected from an appointed portfolio manager. Lastly, we move on to a protocol with suitable covenants to be embedded in a bond placement, so as to enhance the governance of those organizations that dare to avail themselves of sinking funds. sinking fund, corporate governance, bonds placement, financial hybrids, fixed assets, capital formation, portfolio management. ...|$|E

Results of investigations to determine the characteristics of the economic substance of depreciation established: depreciation is a compensation of working capital, which at one time was removed from circulation for the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> so you cannot treat depreciation as a source of investment in fixed assets.

The practical significance is to develop scientifically based recommendations on formation and sources of working capital enterprises and reproduction of fixed assets, which provide methodological support to forming the depreciation policy of enterprise...|$|E
