25|$|Consistent with {{principles}} of good laboratory practice, calibration is performed {{with at least}} two standard buffer solutions that span the range of pH values to be measured. For general purposes, buffers at pH 4.00 and pH 10.00 are suitable. The pH meter has one calibration control to set the meter reading equal to the value of the first standard buffer and a second control to adjust the meter reading to the value of the second buffer. A third control allows the temperature to be set. Standard buffer sachets, available from a variety of suppliers, usually document the temperature dependence of the buffer control. More precise measurements sometimes require calibration at three different pH values. Some pH meters provide built-in temperature-coefficient correction, with temperature thermocouples in the electrode probes. The calibration process correlates the voltage produced by the probe (approximately 0.06volts per <b>pH</b> <b>unit)</b> with the pH scale. Good laboratory practice dictates that, after each measurement, the probes are rinsed with distilled water or deionized water to remove any traces of the solution being measured, blotted with a scientific wipe to absorb any remaining water, which could dilute the sample and thus alter the reading, and then immersed in a storage solution suitable for the particular probe type.|$|E

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that depolarization-induced intracellular pH (pHi) shifts in restricted regions (dendrites) of mammalian neurones might be larger and faster than those previously reported from the cell soma. We used confocal imaging of the pH-sensitive dye, HPTS, to measure pH changes in both the soma and dendrites of whole-cell patch-clamped rat cerebellar Purkinje cells. In the absence of added CO 2 –HCO 3 −, depolarization to + 20 mV for 1 s caused large (≈ 0. 14 <b>pH</b> <b>units)</b> and fast dendritic acid shifts, whilst the somatic acidifications were significantly smaller (≈ 0. 06 <b>pH</b> <b>units)</b> and slower. The pHi shifts were smaller in the presence of 5 % CO 2 – 25 mm HCO 3 −-buffered saline (≈ 0. 08 <b>pH</b> <b>units</b> in the dendrites and ≈ 0. 03 <b>pH</b> <b>units</b> in the soma), although a clear spatiotemporal heterogeneity remained. Acetazolamide (50 μM) doubled the size of the dendritic acid shifts in the presence of CO 2 –HCO 3 −, indicating carbonic anhydrase activity. Removal of extracellular calcium or addition of the calcium channel blocker lanthanum (0. 5 mm) inhibited the depolarization-evoked acid shifts. We investigated more physiological pHi changes by evoking modest bursts of action potentials (≈ 10 s duration) in CO 2 –HCO 3 −-buffered saline.

50|$|Pure {{water is}} neutral. When an acid is {{dissolved}} in water, the pH {{will be less}} than 7. When a base, or alkali, is dissolved in water, the pH will be greater than 7. A solution of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, at concentration 1 mol dm−3 has a pH of 0. A solution of a strong alkali, such as sodium hydroxide, at concentration 1 mol dm−3, has a pH of 14. Thus, measured pH values will lie mostly in the range 0 to 14, though negative pH values and values above 14 are entirely possible. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, a difference of one <b>pH</b> <b>unit</b> is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration. The pH of neutrality is not exactly 7, although {{this is a good}} approximation in most cases. Neutrality is defined as the condition where H+ = OH− (or the activities are equal). Since self-ionization of water holds the product of these concentration H+&times;OH− = Kw, {{it can be seen that}} at neutrality H+ = OH− =&radic;(Kw), or pH = pKw/2. pKw is approximately 14 but depends on ionic strength and temperature, and so the pH of neutrality does also. Pure water and a solution of NaCl in pure water are both neutral, since dissociation of water produces equal numbers of both ions. However the pH of the neutral NaCl solution will be slightly different from that of neutral pure water because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions' activity is dependent on ionic strength, so Kw varies with ionic strength.|$|E

We demonstrate that ocean acidification significantly depresses fertilization, embryogenesis, larval development and survival during the pelagic phase. Fertilization and the formation of a D-shaped shell during embryogenesis were severely diminished: successful fertilization was reduced by 11 % at a 0. 6 <b>pH</b> <b>unit</b> decrease from present (pH 8. 1) conditions, while hatching success was depressed by 34 and 87 %, respectively at a 0. 3 and 0. 6 <b>pH</b> <b>unit</b> decrease. Under acidified conditions, larvae were still able to develop a shell during the post-embryonic phase, but higher larval mortality rates indicate that fewer larvae may metamorphose and settle in an acidified ocean. The cumulative impact of decreasing seawater pH on fertilization, embryogenesis and survival to the benthic stage is estimated {{to reduce the number of}} competent settlers by 38 % for a 0. 3 <b>pH</b> <b>unit</b> decrease, and by 89 % for a 0. 6 <b>pH</b> <b>unit</b> decrease from present conditions. Additionally, slower growth rates and a delayed metamorphosis at a smaller size were indicative for larvae developed under acidified conditions. This may further decline the recruit population size due to a longer subjection to perturbations, such as predation, during the pelagic phase. In general, early life history processes were most severely compromised at ~pH 7. 5, which corresponds to seawater undersaturated with respect to aragonite. Since recent models predict a comparable decrease in pH in coastal waters in the near future, this study indicates that future populations of Macoma balthica are likely to decline as a consequence of ongoing ocean acidification...|$|E

A new technique was developed that {{involves the use of}} perforated patch recordings in combination with fluorescence imaging microscopy to simultaneously measure pHi and membrane potential (Vm). Hypercapnic acidosis (15 % CO 2, pHo 6. 8) resulted in a maintained fall in pHi of 0. 31 <b>pH</b> <b>units</b> and a 93 % increase in the firing rate of LC neurones. On the other hand, isohydric hypercapnia (15 % CO 2, 77 mm HCO 3 −, pHo 7. 45) resulted in a smaller and transient fall in pHi of about 0. 17 <b>pH</b> <b>units</b> and an increase in firing rate of 76 %. Acidified Hepes (N- 2 -hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′- 2 - ethanesulfonic acid) -buffered medium (pHo 6. 8) resulted in a progressive fall in pHi of over 0. 43 <b>pH</b> <b>units</b> and an increase in firing rate of 126 %. Isosmotic addition of 50 mm propionate to the standard HCO 3 −-buffered medium (5 % CO 2, 26 mm HCO 3 −, pHo 7. 45) resulted in a transient fall in pHi of 0. 18 <b>pH</b> <b>units</b> but little increase in firing rate. Isocapnic acidosis (5 % CO 2, 7 mm HCO 3 −, pHo 6. 8) resulted in a slow intracellular acidification to a maximum fall of about 0. 26 <b>pH</b> <b>units</b> and a 72 % increase in firing rate. For all treatments, the changes in pHi preceded or occurred simultaneously with the changes in firing rate and were considerably slower than the changes in pHo. In conclusion, an increased firing rate of LC neurones in response to acid challenges was best correlated with the magnitude and the rate of fall in pHi, indicating that a decrease in pHi is {{a major part of the}} intracellular signalling pathway that transduces an acid challenge into an increased firing rate in LC neurones...|$|R
