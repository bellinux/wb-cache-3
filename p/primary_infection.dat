5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a <b>primary</b> <b>infection,</b> but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a <b>primary</b> <b>infection,</b> but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a <b>primary</b> <b>infection,</b> IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During <b>primary</b> <b>infection,</b> the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E

5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a <b>primary</b> <b>infection</b> with herpes simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} microbiological laboratory testing.

In this study, viremia and circulating NS 1 levels were determined in 225 serum samples collected from patients in Mexico infected with dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2 (DENV- 1 and DENV- 2). Patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) who were infected with DENV- 1 showed higher levels of circulating NS 1 than patients with dengue fever (DF) (P = 0. 0175). Moreover, NS 1 levels were higher in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>infections</b> with DENV- 1 than in patient infected with DENV- 2 (P < 0. 0001) and in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>infections</b> with DENV- 2 than in patients with secondary infections with DENV- 2 (P = 0. 0051). Unexpectedly, viremia levels were higher in patients with DF than in those with DHF infected with either DENV- 1 or DENV- 2 (P = 0. 0019 and P = 0. 001, respectively) and in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>infections</b> than those with secondary DENV- 2 infections (P < 0. 0001).

25|$|LGV {{may begin}} as a self-limited painless genital ulcer that {{occurs at the}} contact site 3–12 days after infection.

25|$|HIV (human {{immunodeficiency}} virus) {{damages the}} body's immune system, which interferes with {{its ability to}} fight off disease-causing agents. The virus kills CD4 cells, which are white blood cells that help fight off various infections. HIV is carried in body fluids, and is spread by sexual activity. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood, breast feeding, childbirth, and from mother to child during pregnancy. When HIV is at its most advanced stage, an individual {{is said to have}} AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). There are different stages of the progression of and HIV infection. The stages include <b>primary</b> <b>infection,</b> asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the <b>primary</b> <b>infection</b> stage, an individual will have flu like symptoms (headache, fatigue, fever, muscle aches) for about 2 weeks. In the asymptomatic stage, symptoms usually disappear, and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years. When HIV progresses to the symptomatic stage, the immune system is weakened, and has a low cell count of CD4+ T Cells. When the HIV infection becomes life-threatening, it is called AIDS. People with AIDS fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result. When the disease was first discovered in the 1980s, those who had AIDS were not likely to live longer than a few years. There are now antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) available to treat HIV infections. There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS but the drugs help suppress the virus. By suppressing the amount of virus in the body, people can lead longer and healthier lives. Even though their virus levels may be low they can still spread the virus to others.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to VZV in {{a healthy}} child initiates the {{production}} of host immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies; IgG antibodies persist for life and confer immunity. Cell-mediated immune responses are also important in limiting the scope and the duration of primary varicella infection. After <b>primary</b> <b>infection,</b> VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. VZV then remains latent in the dorsal ganglion cells of the sensory nerves. Reactivation of VZV results in the clinically distinct syndrome of herpes zoster (i.e., shingles), postherpetic neuralgia, and sometimes Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II. Varicella zoster can affect the arteries in the neck and head, producing stroke, either during childhood, or after a latency period of many years.|$|E
500|$|In all cases, HSV {{is never}} {{removed from the}} body by the immune system. [...] Following a <b>primary</b> <b>infection,</b> the virus enters the nerves {{at the site of}} <b>primary</b> <b>infection,</b> migrates to the cell body of the neuron, and becomes latent in the ganglion. As a result of <b>primary</b> <b>infection,</b> the body {{produces}} antibodies to the particular type of HSV involved, preventing a subsequent infection of that type at a different site. In HSV-1-infected individuals, seroconversion after an oral infection prevents additional HSV-1 infections such as whitlow, genital herpes, and herpes of the eye. Prior HSV-1 seroconversion seems to reduce the symptoms of a later HSV-2 infection, although HSV-2 can still be contracted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Symptomatic <b>primary</b> HIV <b>infection</b> is {{associated}} with an adverse prognosis, and immediate initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is recommended. However, {{little is known about}} immunological predictors of immune recovery. Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that promotes CD 4 + T cells homeostatic polyclonal proliferation and regulates Th 17 /regulatory T-cell balance, immunological functions known to be affected during <b>primary</b> HIV <b>infection.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} describe immune recovery in primary and chronic HIV infection and possible impact of TSLP. Methods Prospective study including 100 HIV-infected individuals (<b>primary</b> HIV <b>infection</b> (N[*]=[*] 14), early presenters (> 350 CD 4 + T cells/μL, N[*]=[*] 42), late presenters without advanced disease (200 – 350 CD 4 + T cells/μL, N[*]=[*] 24) and with advanced disease (< 200 CD 4 + T cells/μL, N[*]=[*] 20) and). Immune recovery was defined as increase in CD 4 + T cells count from baseline to a given time of follow-up. Plasma TSLP was determined using ELISA and CD 4 + T cell subpopulations (recent thymic emigrants, naïve and memory cells) were measured using flow cytometry at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24  months of cART. Results Immune recovery was comparable in all groups, and no differences in immune homeostasis were found between <b>primary</b> HIV <b>infection</b> and early presenters, whereas differences in absolute counts and proportions of CD 4 + T cell subpopulations were found between <b>primary</b> HIV <b>infection</b> and late presenters. TSLP was elevated in <b>primary</b> HIV <b>infection</b> at baseline and after 24  months of cART. Interestingly, TSLP was negatively associated with proportion of recent thymic emigrants (correlation coefficient − 0. 60, p[*]=[*] 0. 030). TSLP was not associated with immune recovery in <b>primary</b> HIV <b>infection.</b> Conclusions Immune recovery was comparable in primary and chronic HIV infection whereas differences in absolute counts and proportions of CD 4 + T cell subpopulations were found between <b>primary</b> HIV <b>infection</b> and late presenters supporting early initiation of cART. Higher plasma TSLP was found in <b>primary</b> HIV <b>infection,</b> and TSLP was associated with lower thymic output, but not with immune recovery. These findings indicate a possible role of TSLP in immune homeostasis in HIV infection but do not support TSLP to affect immune recovery in <b>primary</b> HIV <b>infection...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: Symptomatic <b>primary</b> HIV <b>infections</b> are {{over-represented}} in the mainly hospital-based {{studies on}} transmission of resistant HIV- 1. We examined {{a more general}} population for the prevalence of resistant HIV- 1 strains among <b>primary</b> <b>infections.</b> Design: From 1994 to 2002 <b>primary</b> <b>infections</b> were identified within the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS) among homosexual men and drug users, and at the Academic Medical Center (AMC). Whereas primary HIV- 1 -infected AMC patients, often presented with symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome, ACS participants largely seroconverted during follow-up and thus brought also asymptomatic <b>primary</b> <b>infections</b> to our study. Methods: Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease sequences were obtained by population-based nucleotide sequence analysis of the first HIV RNA-positive sample available. Subtypes were identified by phylogenetic analysis. Mutations were identified based on the IAS-USA resistance table. Results: A total of 100 <b>primary</b> HIV- 1 <b>infections</b> were identified (32 AMC and 68 ACS). Transmission of drug-resistant strains decreased over calendar time, with 20 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), 10 - 34 %] of infections bearing drug-resistant mutations before 1998 versus only 6 % (95 % Cl, 1 - 17 %) after 1998. No multi-drug resistance pattern was observed. The median plasma HIV- 1 RNA level of the first RNA positive sample was significantly lower for the individuals infected with a resistant strain versus those infected with wild-type, suggesting a fitness-cost to resistance. Four of seven non-B subtypes corresponded with the prevalent subtype in the presumed country of infection, and none showed resistance mutations. Conclusions: The transmission of drug-resistant HIV- 1 strains in Amsterdam has decreased over time. Monitoring should be continued as this trend might change.

This property may be explained by looking at the location and arrangement of the SGCs, as they are centered on the neurons, allowing them to protect the neurons. It has also been proposed that SGCs may have a job in ridding the ganglia of the virus and in protecting and repairing the nervous system after the virus has left the dormant stage.|$|E
