5000|$|Despite {{being asked}} on one {{occasion}} [...] "But tell me, Mr Edgar, {{what do you do}} in the daytime?", the early days of 5IT would often see Edgar working fifteen-hour days - planning the nightly <b>programme,</b> <b>booking</b> the performers and arranging their transport to the station's studio in Witton, reading the news, announcing the running order and working the gramophone. By late November, however, 5IT had been taken over by the newly established British Broadcasting Company and Edgar had recruited a staff of five, including an assistant manager, an announcer and two engineers.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the airline {{industry}} was undergoing explosive growth. A serious limiting factor was the time taken to make a single booking, which could take upwards of 90 minutes in total. TCA found their bookings typically involved between three and seven calls to the centralized <b>booking</b> <b>centre</b> in Toronto, where telephone operators would scan flight status displayed on a huge board showing all scheduled flights one month into the future. Bookings past that time could not be made, nor could an agent reliably know anything other than if the flight was full or not [...] - [...] to book two seats was much more complex, requiring the operator to find the [...] "flight card" [...] for that flight in a filing cabinet.|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{guidelines}} {{can be obtained}} from a DEA (data envelopment analysis) analysis. Firstly, the firm can reduce input or increase production according to the DEA results. Secondly, an inefficient firm might be able to identify reference units. This makes it possible for the inefficient firm to, on site, study production that is more efficient, and thereby get information on e. g. efficient organisational solutions. In this study, we focus on how to detect these firm-relevant reference units. While applying the existing methods for identification of reference units, i. e. the intensity variable method and the dominance method, on a data set concerning <b>booking</b> <b>centres</b> in the Swedish taxi market, shortcomings in these methods were identified. This motivates {{the development of a new}} method. This new method, the sphere measure, enables an inefficient unit to identify existing and efficient units that have the largest similarity with itself. The identified units will thus be firm-relevant reference units. reference units; firm-relevant; DEA...|$|R
5000|$|Initially, Shiv Sena {{rescinded}} its {{demand to}} block release of My Name Is Khan {{after it was}} announced that Khan would be allowed to release it [...] "in as many theatres" [...] as he would like. However, on 10 January 2010, when cinemas opened for advanced bookings, individuals disguised as [...] "cinegoers" [...] began to attack cinemas and <b>booking</b> <b>centres.</b> Director Karan Johar and distributors met with police to ask for additional security. In response, Chief Minister of Maharashtra Ashok Chavan threatened to withdraw security cover for party leader Uddhav Thackeray. Later, some security was withdrawn and the Maharashtra government has [...] "called in five battalions of the State Reserve Police Force to protect 63 cinemas in the city that will screen the film directed by Karan Johar from this Friday." [...] There were multiple arrests and leave of all police officials were cancelled. The distributor, Fox Star, stated that the film would still be released on its scheduled opening date, 12 February.

40|$|In Italy, {{waiting time}} is a {{critical}} issue for out-patient specialist care and diagnostic services, and it is being tackled by national plans issued in the last decade. Most regions improved patients’ access through better information on waiting times, process re-engineering {{and the creation of}} unified <b>booking</b> <b>centres.</b> In addition, important prioritisation criteria have been piloted to manage waiting time based on clinical criteria and professional judgment (for example, the Homogenous Waiting Groups pilots). However, actual policies, including the implementation of national legislation, vary across the regions, with some of them very active and others often lagging behind. Policies on co-payments, intramoenia dual practice and voluntary insurance also have substantial effects on waiting time. National and regional co- payments have likely reduced waiting time via the reduction of demand for national health services, but rather broad exemption criteria have limited their effect on the more affluent and healthier part of the population. The expansion of intramoenia dual practice and the promotion of additional private health insurance could undermine access to the NHS basic health care package: the former may encourage doctors to build up long lists in their public practices so as to maintain demand for their private practice, whereas the latter may worsen equity of access to the NHS services...|$|R
