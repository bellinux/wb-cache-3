5|$|Planning for {{the lake}} began in 1987. The main {{goal was to}} meet Southern California seasonal, drought and {{emergency}} needs. MWD chose the current site because of its geographic location, and began construction planning in 1993. Construction of the lake in 1995 with construction of the three dams. With over 40 million cubic yards of foundation excavation and 110 million cubic yards of embankment construction, {{the construction of the}} dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States. The shovels, loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established a new standard for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial <b>processing</b> <b>operation</b> in California. Construction of the lake was the largest construction project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct.|$|E

25|$|An exergoeconomic {{assessment}} {{accounting for}} the total and non-renewable unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions of Brazilian electricity is performed by Flórez-Orrego et al. (2014), comprising thermal, nuclear, hydro, wind farms and biomass-fired power plants. The analysis starts from the fuel obtainment and continues through the different stages of construction, fuel transportation and <b>processing,</b> <b>operation</b> and decommissioning of the plant, with electricity generation as the desired output. This approach allows the calculation of direct CO2 emissions {{as well as the}} upstream and downstream emissions, which {{play an important role in}} some technologies. In this way, a better comparison between the utilization of different fuels in the electricity generation can be achieved. An iterative calculation procedure is used to determine the unit exergy costs of electricity and processed fuels, since both electricity and processed fuel are used in their own production routes.|$|E
40|$|One {{method to}} detect faults in {{surfaces}} is {{the application of}} image <b>processing</b> <b>operations,</b> in order to emphasize areas with faults. Usually, a suitable chaining of image <b>processing</b> <b>operations</b> has to be found. During the search, suitable image <b>processing</b> <b>operations</b> are manually sequenced.

Even {{in the case of}} comparable few image <b>processing</b> <b>operations,</b> with each having one or more parameters, this is a tedious task. With increasing number of operations there is a high increase in the effort, which is known as 'combinatorial explosion' of choices. This pape...|$|R

40|$|The MPEG- 21 Multimedia Framework aims {{to provide}} an {{end-to-end}} framework for transparent and universal access to media content. It defines mechanisms to represent, process and exchange aggregate media objects, called Digital Items. One of the main requirements in MPEG- 21 is to devise a mechanism for making Digital Items dynamic, by allowing program code to be packaged along with them. This executable code consists of operations {{that are used to}} process the Digital Item. The design of this mechanism is categorized into three parts: a specification to express and package these <b>processing</b> <b>operations,</b> an engine on the platform to execute the <b>processing</b> <b>operations,</b> and base APIs on the platform that will assist in implementing these <b>processing</b> <b>operations.</b> This thesis proposes a solution that uses Java for expressing Digital Item <b>processing</b> <b>operations.</b> Also as a part of this solution, it proposes adapting the MPEG-J specification to define an engine for the execution of the the Java based <b>processing</b> <b>operations.</b> The MPEG-J specification is an application engine specification for the execution of mobile Java code...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{enhanced}} perceptual image authentication approach is proposed with extra ability of tamper localization and image self-restoration by combining perceptual hashing and digital watermarking technologies.

Another {{advantage of this}} approach is its robustness to various non-malicious image <b>processing</b> <b>operations.</b> This approach could provide better robustness to most content-based image <b>processing</b> <b>operations</b> such as JPEG compression and additive Gaussian noises than most existing semi-fragile watermarking methods.
