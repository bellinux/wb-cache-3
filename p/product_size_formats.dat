40|$|Botulinum neurotoxin type-A (BoNT/A) is very {{effective}} in the therapy {{of a wide range}} of human syndromes characterized by hyperactivity of peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals. Little diffusion of this toxin from the site of injection is commonly observed, but even minor changes in this property would greatly affect the validity of the treatment. Different pharmacological formulations of BoNT/A are available, and they may have different diffusion characteristics due to protein complex <b>size,</b> <b>product</b> <b>format,</b> and pharmacological properties. Here we assessed the extent of diffusion of three commercial preparations of BoNT/A: Botox (Allergan), Dysport (Ipsen), and Xeomin (Merz Pharmaceuticals) using a novel and highly sensitive test based on neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) expression in muscle. N-CAM is a membrane glycoprotein that accumulates on muscle fibers after denervation and is not expressed in untreated adult muscle. This allows fine monitoring of the functional diffusion of this toxin, and the sensitivity of this assay is emphasized by the use of the mouse model because of the small muscle dimensions. The results presented here indicate that there is no significant difference between Botox, Dysport, and Xeomin with respect to diffusion into adjacent muscles in the mouse leg...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the association of F 5 gene Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) with the incidence of thrombosis. Blood samples were collected from 40 patients {{during the period from}} November 2014 to January 2015, from Critical Care Unit (CCU) of (Yarmook Hospital, Kadhimiya Hospital), as well as from 10 unrelated healthy control group. This study found the age group between 50 to 60 are more susceptible to thrombosis 45 % and the thrombosis was more frequent in male 55 % from female 45 % the significant (p< 0. 01). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from whole blood samples, whereas, serum samples were analyzed using troponin test (TNT) for detection of thrombosis. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was achieved on extracted DNA using eleven specific primers for F 5 gene:the first primer (Fve 3) with <b>product</b> <b>size</b> (228 bp), second primer (Fve 4) with <b>product</b> <b>size</b> (310 bp), third primer (Fve 6) with product size(547 bp), fourth primer (Fve 7) with <b>product</b> <b>size</b> (241 bp), fifth primer (Fve 8) with <b>product</b> <b>size</b> (306 bp), sixth primer (Fve 12) with <b>product</b> <b>size</b> (286 bp), seventh primer (Fve 13 a) with product length (260 bp), eighth primer (Fve 13 c) with <b>product</b> <b>size</b> (317 bp), ninth primer (Fve 15) with <b>product</b> <b>size</b> (600 bp), tenth primer (Fve 16) with <b>product</b> <b>size</b> (333 bp) and eleventh primer (Fve 25) with <b>product</b> <b>size</b> (390 bp). PCR products of F 5 gene were sequenced. Result found to be change in DNA which was mostly SNP.

40|$|The {{software}} package JKSimMet {{was used to}} model processes at MountSorrel Granite quarry in Leicestershire. The project aimed to show whether there were functional relationships between the input data in the primary crushing phase (gap size (mm), feed size distribution, throughput (t/hr) and ore type) with the output data (<b>product</b> <b>size</b> distribution and power draw). The effect that changing the gap size has on the <b>product</b> <b>size</b> distribution was investigated for the gyratory crusher using the {{software package}} JKSimMet. Various simulations were run so that <b>product</b> <b>size</b> distributions were given for different values of CSS (close side setting). The percentage of granite passing various <b>sizes</b> in the <b>product</b> <b>size</b> distribution was plotted against the gap size using Matlab.

The effect of changing the feed size distribution, throughput of the gyratory crusher and the ore type were investigated.
