For example, Endor (spring of Dor), Engannin (spring of gardens), Engaddi (spring of the kid), Rogel or En-rogel (spring of the foot), Ensemes (spring of the sun), etc. But springs were comparatively rare; biblical language distinguishes the natural springs from the wells, which are water <b>pits</b> <b>bored</b> under the rocky surface and having no outlet. They belonged to and were named by the person who dug them. Many names of places, too, are {{compounded with}} B'er (the Hebrew word [...] "well"), such as Bersable, Beroth, Beer Elim, etc.|$|R

In order to expound the design of subway station structure with open cut method, a typical design of subway station in Chengdu subway line 7 is illustrated in the paper. The design of open cut subway station structure and its enclosure in Chengdu is still summarized and can be used to guide the structural design of subway stations under similar conditions with open cut method (OCM) ...|$|R
40|$|Swollen or {{otherwise}} malformed crinoid remains are relatively {{common in the}} Phanerozoic. However, published reports typically describe swellings associated with a discrete <b>pit,</b> <b>boring,</b> embedment structure or encruster, and, moreover, are overwhelmingly from Silurian or younger strata. Here, the rare occurrence of an amorphously swollen crinoid pluricolumnal is described from the Upper Ordovician (Katian) Grant Lake Formation of north-central Kentucky, USA. This {{represents one of the}} oldest examples of crinoid malformation potentially resulting from interaction with a parasite or epibiont, one of the oldest examples of swelling in a crinoid column, and likely represents the oldest record of amorphous swelling. The pluricolumnal is morphologically generalized, making definitive identification difficult. Potential candidates include the diplobathrid camerate Pycnocrinus and the large, morphologically aberrant disparid Anomalocrinus. Regardless, if generated by an antagonistic biotic interaction, this specimen seems to support the hypothesis that crinoids with large calyxes and relatively complex arm morphologies were preferentially utilized as hosts for parasites and commensals over crinoids with simpler morphologies in the Ordovician...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} resolve the controversy, the Editors of Field {{magazine}} decided to conduct a public trial in 1875. The London Trial of 1875 <b>pitted</b> choke <b>bores</b> and cylinder guns of various manufacturers in four categories—Class 1 (large bores, any boring), Class 2 (Choke bores, 12 gauge), Class 3 (Guns of English boring or Cylinders) and Class 4 (Small gauges, any boring). The choke bored guns performed better that the cylinder guns in all these tests, and W.W. Greener choke bore guns won the class 1, class 2 and class 4 categories. Greener Choke bores also won at the London Gun Trials of 1877 and 1879, and the Chicago Field Gun Trial of 1879. The results of these trials were responsible for making the W.W. Greener name famous.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the bore is to get from point A to point B under the obstruction. First the {{operator}} surveys the area and the obstacle(road, sidewalk, driveway). Utility locates must be present for any underground work, the path most clear of utilities is chosen to send the tool through. The first hole is now dug {{on one side of}} the obstacle. This hole must be large enough to fit the tool and the operator in it so they can aim the tool. The hole also must be deep enough that as the tool compacts the ground the surface remains undisturbed. The depth of the starting <b>bore</b> <b>pit</b> depends on the type on soil that is being worked in and how well it compacts. The operator aims the tool to the desired exit point and allows it to perform its function creating a bore hole under the ground without disturbing the surface. The tool is tracked by the operator who feels the tool pounding and can approximate the tools location under the ground. The operator also monitors the surface to make sure that it is undisturbed. As the tool nears the exit point it is slowed down and an exit pit is dug to locate both the tool and the bore. As the tool enters the exit pit the operator chooses to either dig up the tool to retrieve it or reverses the tool back into the first <b>bore</b> <b>pit</b> to retrieve it. Now between the two pits is a completed bore under the obstacle which can be used to run the product.|$|R
50|$|A single pit in a {{critical}} point can cause {{a great deal of}} damage. One example is the explosion in Guadalajara, Mexico on April 22, 1992, when gasoline fumes accumulated in sewers destroyed kilometres of streets. The vapours originated from a leak of gasoline through a single hole formed by corrosion between a steel gasoline pipe and a zinc-plated water pipe.Firearms can also suffer from pitting, most notably in the bore of the barrel when corrosive ammunition is used and the barrel is not cleaned soon afterwards. Deformities in the <b>bore</b> caused by <b>pitting</b> can greatly reduce the firearm's accuracy. To prevent <b>pitting</b> in firearm <b>bores,</b> most modern firearms have a bore lined with chromium.|$|R
40|$|IXC {{proposes to}} install and operate a {{telecommunications}} system from Denver, Colorado, to Salt Lake City, Utah, to provide service to these and other western cities. The approximately 611 -mile long cable would cross 116 miles of federal land administered by the BLM (all within Wyoming), 1 mile of National Forest lands administered by the Forest Service (all within Utah), and 494 miles of state, county, municipal, and private lands. Three 1. 9 -inch and three 2. 4 -inch high-density polyethylene conduits would be installed simultaneously and a fiber optic cable would be installed in one conduit; the other conduits {{would be used for}} future communication system upgrades. A ROW term of 30 years, with the right of renewal, would be granted. A temporary construction ROW of 40 feet and a permanent operations and maintenance ROW of 20 feet would be required. Direct surface disturbance width would average 15 feet and would occur on areas traversed by tracked machinery used to plow the duct into the ground. Additional disturbance would result from other traffic on the ROW, trenching, and excavation and installation of splice vaults and manholes. An area of up to 40 X 40 feet would be needed at each <b>pit</b> for <b>boring</b> under roads, driveways, railroads, pipelines, canal, streams, wetlands, and endangered species habitat. Nine optical amplifiers and two regeneration stations would be built along the route. All but one amplifier site and both regeneration stations would be built on private land. Approximately 1. 8 acres/mile would be disturbed. Approximately 212 acres of BLM lands would be disturbed (all in Wyoming), as would 2 acres of Forest Service lands (all in Utah), and 899 acres of state and private lands (in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah). Total disturbance would be approximately 1, 113 acres...|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic bore tools do have {{drawbacks}} {{which can}} cause difficulties completing the bore. First {{the distance of the}} bore the tool can create is limited by the length of the hose that supplies the tool with air. Also the tool is not steerable. Once it has exited the <b>bore</b> <b>pit,</b> the operator no longer has control over it. The tool can be deflected by rocks and soil density to a path the operator had not intended. If this deflection is {{in the direction of the}} surface, the tool can cause damage to the obstacle being bored under. If it is downward, the tool can dive to an unrecoverable depth. If it is deflected side to side the tool could also run into other utilities. These hazards make it important for the operator to maintain close observation of the tool.The type of ground the tool is working in can also lead to problems. If the soil is too loose, the tool cannot compact the soil, stalling it out or leaving no bore hole. If the soil is rocky the tool may be deflected or fail to pound forward due to its inability break the rock. These drawbacks can be overcome by directional boring.|$|R
50|$|At a {{town meeting}} at Moe's Tavern, people say that Moe's best friend is his old bar rag. Bart {{continues}} with the joke by comparing the rag with Milhouse. Insulted, Milhouse spurns Bart's friendship. The rag tells its life story, from being a medieval French tapestry, woven by Marge after Mr. Burns, Duke of Springfield, killed all their sheep which released demon spirits that forced Marge to weave the encounters the tapestry would have, the Duke was later accidentally hanged by the tapestry when he fell off a mountain; going to a cathedral before Vikings attacked it and Homer tore it; {{and then to the}} king of Persia (Nelson), who is then told 1001 stories by Scheherazade (Lisa), finally she releases his other wives who were thrown in a <b>pit</b> for being <b>boring</b> and decapitate him; being used as a blindfold for the executed and cloth on the chopping block in France; being used as a paint rag by Michelangelo in his creation of the Sistine Chapel; being used for a Confederate flag during the Civil War; made into soup during the Great Depression; and going close to the top of Mount Everest as a flag, though the explorer died from lack of oxygen; a yeti then found it and gave it to his son, an infant Moe.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the nocturnal and diurnal {{temperature}} relations inside and around the <b>pits</b> of Myrmeleon <b>bore</b> pit-building ant-lion larvae living in unsheltered microhabitat and Euroleon nostras living in sheltered microhabitat. The larvae's potential hunting activity and prey handling phase of predation {{in relation to the}} temperature conditions were observed. Due to the structure of pitfalls and the thermal layers above and under the sand surface, the larvae must suffer less temperature fluctuation during the day than their environment. The role of the pitfall seems to be just as important in prey capturing as in temperature tolerance. This function of pits especially prevails in unsheltered microhabitats. In unsheltered microhabitats temperature influences the potential predator activity as well as the distribution of prey handling phase of predation in time. The potential hunting activity of larvae is not influenced by temperature in sheltered microhabitats, where their prey handling phase of predation depends mainly on the activity of prey species. It takes one year for both species to develop, but underdeveloped individuals of two-year life cycle can also be found. During the observation period, the chances of development for normally developed larvae living in unsheltered microhabitats proved far better than the chances for underdeveloped larvae due to the temperature. During their evolution, pit-building ant-lion larvae have strongly adapted themselves to extreme environmental factors physiologically and behaviourally as well...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of {{various forms of}} corrosion that are present in both civilian and military aircraft is an increasing burden as they age. One particularly insidious form of corrosion is laminar Intergranular Corrosion (IGC) due to the small surface corrosion present, even though the long, sharp fissures can grow parallel to the surface up to and over 5 mm in highly extruded materials. This thesis investigates the fatigue effects of this peculiar form of IGC, particularly focussing on fatigue crack initiation. Its aim {{is to determine the}} mechanism behind the early fatigue failure due to IGC and to develop a model that can predict the knock-down factor for the number of cycles to a 1 mm fatigue crack, which is termed &ldquo;crack initiation&rdquo;. This thesis uses the example of IGC on the AP- 3 C Orion maritime surveillance aircraft, which is currently an issue for fleet operators world-wide as the unknown fatigue effects results in any IGC found being completely removed, leading to significant delays during maintenance. A secondary aim of this thesis is to use these results to develop a tool that can be used by fleet operators to assist in lifeing the AP- 3 C Orion in the presence of IGC. A series of constant-amplitude fatigue tests on specimens with a high stress concentration (of 3. 0 for a plate-with-hole) showed that IGC reduced the number of cycles to crack initiation and that this reduction was proportional to the depth at which the fatigue crack initiated. Fractography showed two types of initiating features on the corroded specimens. Fatigue cracks initiated at either a corrosion <b>pit</b> at the <b>bore</b> of the hole, or at corroded inclusions situated along the path of the IGC fissure. In contrast, fatigue cracks in the un-corroded specimens initiated at the hole corners A Monte Carlo model, combined with finite element analysis, was used to simulate the fatigue specimens. The Monte-Carlo model created representative IGC paths within simulated fatigue specimens. It then added simulated pits and corroded inclusions at locations along the surfaces of the predicted IGC paths. As a final step it created script files that were submitted to ABAQUS to complete the analysis. This Finite Element analysis showed that IGC only slightly changed the stress concentration at the specimen&rsquo;s hole. In contrast, pits and corroded inclusions significantly increased the stress concentration. This change explains the two different fatigue initiation locations observed in the fatigue tests, which were based on a competition between the stress concentraitons of these two mechanisms. The results of the FE analysis and the fatigue tests were combined to produce a model to predict the knock-down factor of the number of cycles to a 1 mm fatigue crack of a population of likely pit sizes and corroded inclusion locations. This model can then be used by fleet operators world-wide to assist in lifeing the AP- 3 C Orion to attempt to reduce the maintenance load currently experienced...|$|R
