50|$|Many {{different}} types of cutting tools {{are used in the}} milling process. Milling cutters such as endmills may have cutting surfaces across their entire end surface, {{so that they can be}} drilled into the workpiece (<b>plunging).</b> <b>Milling</b> cutters may also have extended cutting surfaces on their sides to allow for peripheral milling.

50|$|The slide {{serrations}} on the 1902 sporting model initially {{continued the}} sixteen <b>milled</b> <b>plunge</b> serrations {{on each side}} as featured in the model 1900. The 1902 Sporting Models looked {{very much like the}} Model 1900, however all vestiges of the 1900 sight safety had disappeared. At approximately serial 8000 around April 1905, these serrations were changed to a more modern look of twenty instantly discernible cut serrations as they did not plunge into the slide but cut down to the bottom. The position of the cuts was relatively short lived as the cut serrations were moved {{to the back of the}} frame. Certain deductions for the 1902 sporting model can be made: Front <b>milled</b> <b>plunge</b> serrations, number made about 3,725 (1,444 high spur hammer/2,281 stub hammer) (approx); front cut serrations, only about 500? made (all round hammer); rear cut serrations 3,002 made (2,811 stub hammer/191 low spur hammer).|$|R
50|$|CNC <b>plunge</b> <b>milling</b> {{is often}} called z-axis milling also. In this process, the feed is {{provided}} linearly along the tool axis while doing CNC processing. <b>Plunge</b> <b>milling</b> is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis <b>plunge</b> <b>milling,</b> the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In <b>plunge</b> <b>milling,</b> after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by <b>plunge</b> <b>milling</b> can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model.

40|$|ABSTRACT A New Approach to CNC Programming of <b>Plunge</b> <b>Milling</b> Sherif Abdelkhalek, PhD. Concordia University, 2013. In current {{industrial}} applications many engineering parts {{are made of}} hard materials including dies, mold cavities and aerospace parts. Manufacturing these types of parts is classified as pocket milling. By using the regular machining methods, pocket milling {{takes a long time}} accompanied by high cost. <b>Plunge</b> <b>milling,</b> is a new machining strategy that has proven to have an excellent performance in the rough machining of hard materials. In <b>plunge</b> <b>milling,</b> the cutter is fed {{in the direction of the}} spindle axis, with the highest structural rigidity which showed a very interesting performance in removing the excess material rapidly in the rough operations. Mainly, according to the previous researchers, two directions are adopted to improve the efficiency of the <b>plunge</b> <b>milling</b> process. First, to reduce the cutting forces and increase chatter stability which attracts the majority of the researchers. Second, to optimize the tool path planning which has less attention. Therefore, in the first part of the research, a new practical approach is established in optimized procedures to generate the tool paths for <b>plunge</b> <b>milling</b> of pockets, even for these with free-form boundaries and islands. This innovative approach is proposed as follows: (1) fill a pocket with minimum number of specified radii circles which are tangent to each other and/or the pocket boundary without overlapping by building an algorithm using the maximum hole degree (MHD) theory for solving the circle packing problem. (2) cover the areas left between the non-overlapped circles by the same used specified radii. Finally, solve the travelling sales man problem (TSP) for the circles with the same radii by using the simulated annealing algorithm. According to the results, this approach significantly advances the tool path planning technique for pockets <b>plunge</b> <b>milling.</b> In the second part of the research, a new algorithm is proposed to calculate the global solution for constraint polynomial functions by using subtractive clustering which makes the results more accurate and faster to be obtained. This part is extremely useful to calculate the depth of cut for each plunging place in case of having a polynomial surface as a bottom of the machined pocket with high accuracy, and less calculation time to avoid gauging between the tool and the bottom surface. The polynomial function can be classified according to the number of variables. In the proposed research, the functions with one and two variables have more importance because they graphically represent curves and surfaces which are the cases under study. Since the polynomial function under study can be represented graphically according to the number of the variables, the change in the function’s shape can be detected by the feature recognition. The feature recognition is done for the function’s shape by calculating the surface or curve curvature at the data points. The main procedure is; (1) identifying the entire features of the objective function which are classified according to the curvature as convex, concave, plane, and hyperbolic, (2) applying the sub-clustering technique for convex and concave regions to find the approximated centers of these regions, and eventually, (3) the clusters’ centers are calculated and used as initial points for local optimization technique which gives the local critical point for each region. The local minima are calculated, the global minimum is the minimum of the local minima...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhite {{layers and}} {{extensive}} material drag introduced during rough machining {{are regarded as}} detrimental to surface integrity. As such a sensible method for determining the amount of material to be removed in a roughing process would be to understand the relationship and interaction between roughing (i. e. drilling) and finishing (i. e. <b>plunge</b> <b>milling)</b> operations. Within this work non-standard cutting parameters were employed during the roughing process to generate a white layer and material drag up {{to a depth of}} 20 μm. Various <b>plunge</b> <b>milling</b> cutting strategies followed, with radius removal ranging from 25 μm to 250 μm in order to identify the amount of material removal necessary to eliminate the anomalies previously generated from mistreated surface history. The results show that finishing with a depth of cut between 50 μm and 125 μm removes all anomalies from the roughing process, leaving behind a negligible amount of material drag (3 – 4 μm). X-ray diffraction demonstrates significant tensile residual stresses (1000 – 2000 MPa) were generated in the axial and hoop direction by abusive hole drilling while subsequent <b>plunge</b> <b>milling</b> operation leaves compressive surface stresses in the region of − 500 MPa in both the axial and hoop directions; in both cases the depth of the surface stresses extended to around 125 μm from the drilled surface. It was also found that a depth of cut of 25 μm was not sufficient to recover the abused surface; this was due to intense material drag accompanied by surface cracking (i. e. 2 μm depth). The research shows that understanding the interaction between successive cutting operations can provide a suitable machining route to fulfil the industrial quality requirements in terms of the machined surface mechanical/metallurgical properties...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePlunge milling is an {{efficient}} machining process for roughing deep pockets. Its efficiency is mainly due to low radial {{forces on the}} cutter. This leads to reduced bendings and vibrations that allow one to improve cutting parameter values. The machining time can then be reduced with respect to machining processes with constant Z-level. Recently, another machining process has been introduced, called ”balancing of the transversal cutting force” (BotTCF), that is also characterized by a suitable distribution of forces on the cutter. It has been applied only to finishing operations on complex surfaces. In this paper, we present two main contributions. First, we extend the BotTCF concept to roughing open deep pockets and semi-open pockets opened from side to side. This is mainly based on successive parallel ramping trajectories, defined by an optimal angle which ensures a good balancing of the transversal cutting forces. This {{can be applied to}} 3 -axis and 5 -axis computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools. Second, we propose a new, hybrid methodology for roughing semi-open pockets (not opened from side to side) and closed pockets. It is based on the combination of ramping trajectories with BotTCF and <b>plunge</b> <b>milling.</b> The proposed methodology is developed for three-axis machining and can be extended to five-axis machining. Based on an identical criterion (identical maximum force acting on the cutters), we perform a fair machining-time comparison of <b>plunge</b> <b>milling</b> with the proposed hybrid method applied on a closed deep pocket: a simplified aeronautical housing made of magnesium-rare earth alloy. Results show a significant gain in machining time when the hybrid method is applied...|$|E
