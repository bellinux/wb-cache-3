5|$|In 1108, Ranulf {{was dragged}} {{into the middle of}} the ongoing dispute between Archbishop Anselm and the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of York, Thomas over whether or not Thomas should <b>profess</b> obedience to Anselm. Because Anselm refused to consecrate Thomas without a profession, and Thomas refused to <b>profess,</b> Thomas was unable to consecrate bishops himself. Ranulf wrote to Anselm, asking that he might act as Thomas' surrogate and consecrate Thurgot as Bishop of St Andrew's. In September 1108, Anselm wrote to Ranulf forbidding anyone but Thomas or Anselm himself to consecrate Thurgot or any other bishops. Later, Ranulf tried to bribe King Henry to take Thomas' side. Thurgot had been prior of the cathedral chapter at Durham, but had disagreed with Ranulf, who arranged for him to be elected to St Andrew's as a solution to the quarrel.|$|E

50|$|The United Methodist Church (UMC) {{practices}} {{infant and}} adult baptism. Baptized Members {{are those who}} have been baptized as an infant or child, but who have not subsequently <b>professed</b> their own faith. These Baptized Members become <b>Professing</b> Members through confirmation and sometimes the profession of faith. Individuals who were not previously baptized are baptized as part of their profession of faith and thus become <b>Professing</b> Members in this manner.

50|$|Methodists use the Apostles' Creed as part {{of their}} baptismal rites {{in the form of an}} interrogatory {{addressed}} to the candidate(s) for baptism and the whole congregation as a way of <b>professing</b> the faith within the context of the Church’s sacramental act. For infants, it is the <b>professing</b> of the faith by the parents, sponsors, and congregation on behalf of the candidate(s); for confirmands, it is the <b>professing</b> of the faith before and among the congregation. For the congregation, it is a reaffirmation of their <b>professed</b> faith.|$|R

5|$|The High Court {{rejected}} the plaintiffs' argument that, by compulsorily acquiring a temple, the Government was limiting a person's right under Article 15(1) of the Constitution to <b>profess,</b> practice and propagate {{his or her}} religion, and that this in turn gave him or her {{the legal right to}} commence an action on the ground that where an individual's constitutional rights are affected, he or she has a sufficient interest to ensure that his or her rights are protected. The court ruling held that this land acquisition matter was not in any way related to religious freedom. Because the acquisition was not related to religious freedom, the High Court found that only the trustees who were the legal owners of the temple property had the requisite locus standi to institute proceedings if they deemed their rights to have been infringed.|$|E
5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply <b>profess</b> their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E

5|$|Theobald {{also had}} a dispute with St Augustine's Abbey over {{the right of the}} {{archbishop}} to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually settled by a compromise in which St Augustine's continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to <b>profess</b> obedience.|$|E
5|$|Chad is a religiously diverse country. The 1993 census {{found that}} 54% of Chadians were Muslim (of these, {{according}} to a Pew report 48% professed to be Sunni, 21% Shia, 4% Ahmadi and 23% just Muslim). Roughly 20% of Chadians are Roman Catholic, 14% Protestant, 10% animist, while 3% did not <b>profess</b> any religion. None of these religious traditions are monolithic. Animism includes a variety of ancestor and place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam is expressed in diverse ways; for example, according to the Pew report mentioned earlier 55% of Muslim Chadians belong to Sufi orders. Christianity arrived in Chad with the French and American missionaries; as with Chadian Islam, it syncretises aspects of pre-Christian religious beliefs. Muslims are largely concentrated in northern and eastern Chad, and animists and Christians live primarily in southern Chad and Guéra. The constitution provides for a secular state and guarantees religious freedom; different religious communities generally co-exist without problems.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to <b>profess</b> her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Bloet's consecration, the Archbishop of York, Thomas of Bayeux, who had {{previously}} had a claim to supervise the see of Lincoln, tried to prevent the Archbishop Anselm's consecrating Bloet. Thomas argued that the area of Lindsey, which was within the diocese of Lincoln, really belonged to the archdiocese of York. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter alleged that Bloet gave Rufus £3,000 to intervene on Bloet's side when Thomas attempted to assert York's claim to Lindsey, but another medieval chronicler, Henry of Huntingdon, who knew Bloet well, said that the sum was £5,000. This payment secured Rufus' support in the dispute between York and Lincoln, which was settled in Lincoln's favour. The sum of £5,000 was extremely large, eight times what Domesday Book records as the bishop of Lincoln's annual income. The king gave York the abbeys of Selby and St Oswald, Gloucester {{in return for the}} settlement in favour of Lincoln. Bloet also refused to <b>profess</b> obedience to Anselm, but when King William intervened on Anselm's side, Bloet made the profession to Anselm.|$|E
5|$|The pope {{referred}} {{the dispute}} to a council of English prelates, which met at Windsor during Whitsuntide in 1072. The council {{decided that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had no rights south of the Humber River. This meant that the disputed bishoprics {{were taken from the}} province of York, an outcome that probably had the support of the King, who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England. By depriving the Archbishop of suffragans, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of England– such as the Danish king. However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland. Although Thomas was required to <b>profess</b> obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors.|$|E
