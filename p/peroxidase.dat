5|$|The {{glutathione}} system includes glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione S-transferases. This {{system is}} found in animals, plants and microorganisms. Glutathione <b>peroxidase</b> is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. There are at least four different glutathione <b>peroxidase</b> isozymes in animals. Glutathione <b>peroxidase</b> 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while glutathione <b>peroxidase</b> 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. Surprisingly, glutathione <b>peroxidase</b> 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative stress. In addition, the glutathione S-transferases show high activity with lipid peroxides. These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in detoxification metabolism.|$|E

30|$|White-rot fungus is {{the only}} {{organism}} that can effectively break down lignin, which is very resistant to general microbial attack. It {{is well known that}} extracellular <b>peroxidases,</b> such as LiP and MnP play major roles in the lignin biodegradation process of white-rot fungi [1 – 4]. The catalytic mechanisms and molecular genetics of these ligninolytic <b>peroxidases</b> have been studied and have revealed their structural and functional properties [5 – 10]. It has also been reported that plant and fungal <b>peroxidases</b> may be arranged in a superfamily of three distinct classes; namely class I of bacterial and intracellular <b>peroxidases,</b> class II of fungal secretory <b>peroxidases,</b> and class III of secretory plant <b>peroxidases,</b> respectively [11]. The lignin-degrading <b>peroxidases</b> in class II of fungal secretory <b>peroxidases</b> have been further subdivided into three groups, LiP, MnP, and VP, based on the genetic and protein structural evidence [12]. Recently, phylogenetic analysis of fungal ligninolytic <b>peroxidases</b> was reported, showing the ubiquity and diversity of these enzymes among a wide range of ectomycorrhizal fungi, basidiomycetes and agaricomycetes [13 – 15].|$|R

5|$|Lignin is {{a complex}} {{polymeric}} chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light. The species C.bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: lignin <b>peroxidase,</b> manganese <b>peroxidase,</b> and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications {{not only in the}} pulp and paper industry, but also to increase the digestibility and protein content of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C.bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C.pallidus can biodegrade the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions-contaminated soils.|$|E

40|$|<b>Peroxidases</b> are enzymes {{capable of}} {{reducing}} hydrogen peroxide and other hydroperoxides to water. Several substrates are oxidized during this process. <b>Peroxidases</b> are distinguished into heme and non-heme <b>peroxidases,</b> {{according to the}} chemistry of the active site interacting with peroxide. The former contain a heme catalytic center; the latter have a selenol or reactive thiol at their active site. Specific enzymatic features and biochemical attributes of <b>peroxidases</b> are described here.

40|$|<b>Peroxidases</b> are {{ubiquitous}} {{enzymes that}} catalyze {{a variety of}} oxygen-transfer reactions and are thus potentially useful for industrial and biomedical applications.

30|$|Ten DyP-type <b>peroxidases</b> from fungi {{have been}} thus far {{characterized}}, and only those from B. adusta und A. auricula-judae have been characterized from a structural and mechanical perspective (Linde and Coscolñas 2014; Linde et al. 2015 a; Strittmatter et al. 2013; Sugano 2009; Yoshida et al. 2011, 2012). DyP–type <b>peroxidases</b> possess a unique H 2 O 2 -binding site that differs {{from those of}} other <b>peroxidases</b> (Sugano et al. 1999). Whereas in the enzymes of the superfamily of plant <b>peroxidases</b> the rearrangement of the protons of H 2 O 2 is typically mediated by the distal histidine this is accomplished by an aspartate in DyP-type <b>peroxidases</b> (Sugano et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|DyP <b>peroxidases</b> {{comprise}} a novel superfamily of heme-containing <b>peroxidases,</b> which is {{unrelated to the}} superfamilies {{of plant and animal}} <b>peroxidases.</b> These enzymes have so far been identified in the genomes of fungi, bacteria, as well as archaea, although their physiological function is still unclear. DyPs are bifunctional enzymes displaying not only oxidative activity but also hydrolytic activity. Moreover, these enzymes are able to oxidize a variety of organic compounds of which some are poorly converted by established <b>peroxidases,</b> including dyes, β-carotene, and aromatic sulfides. Interestingly, accumulating evidence shows that microbial DyP <b>peroxidases</b> {{play a key role in}} the degradation of lignin.

5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid <b>peroxidase,</b> thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a <b>peroxidase</b> enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its {{neighbours}} in the halogen column (chlorine and iodine), bromine is {{not known}} to have a confirmed biological role in humans. A single 2014 study suggests {{that it may be}} a necessary catalyst to make collagen IV, making it essential to basement membrane architecture and tissue development, but these findings have not been confirmed and the precise role posited for bromine is not certain. Aside from this, only circumstantial evidence in the form of hypothesised deprivation symptoms exists for a trace role for bromine. Nevertheless, even if bromine is not an essential element, it can be pharmacologically beneficial. For example, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, formed by the eosinophil, and either chloride or bromide ions, eosinophil <b>peroxidase</b> provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular parasites (such as, for example, the nematode worms involved in filariasis) and some bacteria (such as tuberculosis bacteria). Eosinophil <b>peroxidase</b> is a haloperoxidase that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating hypobromite (hypobromous acid), although the use of chloride is possible.|$|E

In population-based studies, women were seven times {{more likely than men to}} have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid <b>peroxidase.</b> Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians.

5|$|A <b>peroxidase</b> enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula {{aromatic}} peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione <b>peroxidase</b> 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E

5|$|Subclinical {{hypothyroidism}} is a milder form of hypothyroidism {{characterized by}} an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This milder form of hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic {{signs and symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid <b>peroxidase</b> (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared with those who do not have antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Sundews are characterised by the glandular tentacles, {{topped with}} sticky secretions, that cover their laminae. The {{trapping}} and digestion mechanism usually employs {{two types of}} glands: stalked glands that secrete sweet mucilage to attract and ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them, and sessile glands that absorb the resulting nutrient soup (the latter glands are missing in some species, such as D.erythrorhiza). Small prey, mainly consisting of insects, are attracted by the sweet secretions of the peduncular glands. Upon touching these, the prey become entrapped by sticky mucilage which prevents their progress or escape. Eventually, the prey either succumb to death through exhaustion or through asphyxiation as the mucilage envelops them and clogs their spiracles. Death usually occurs within 15 minutes. The plant meanwhile secretes esterase, <b>peroxidase,</b> phosphatase and protease enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the insect and free the nutrients contained within it. This nutrient mixture is then absorbed through the leaf surfaces {{to be used by}} the rest of the plant.|$|E

There are several species of Marasmius with which M.rotula might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish them. Although M.rotula mushrooms are not generally considered edible, they produce a unique <b>peroxidase</b> enzyme that is attracting research interest for possible use in bioengineering applications.|$|E
