5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} a predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> a predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of a predator can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing an increase in the frequency of leaps.|$|E

40|$|Established {{entrepreneurial}} intentions models {{argue that}} entrepreneurial intentions are largely a function <b>of</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> desirability and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> feasibility. Recent research however, {{has suggested that}} the relationship between <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> desirability and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> feasibility may be more complex. In this paper we investigate how <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> desirability interact with <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> feasibility in the formation of entrepreneurial intentions. Using a relatively large multi-country sample we find that consistent with previous research, entrepreneurial intentions are positively related to both <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> desirability and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> feasibility. In addition, we find evidence of a significant interaction effect between <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> desirability and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> feasibility. While conventional wisdom might suggest a positive interaction, we find this interaction effect to be negative. Thus, the study not only supports the contention by McMullen & Shepherd (2006) that individuals who are not necessarily highly motivated might act entrepreneurially if they have high perceived self-efficacy, but also supports the converse argument that highly motivated individuals might act entrepreneurially even if they have low perceived self-efficacy. These findings have important implications for both theory and practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between dance-related perfectionism and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> motivational climate in dance over time. In doing so, three possibilities were tested: (a) perfectionism affects <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the motivational climate, (b) <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the motivational climate affect perfectionism, and (c) the relationship is reciprocal. Two hundred seventy-one young dancers (M = 14. 21 years old, SD = 1. 96) from UK Centres for Advanced Training completed questionnaires twice, approximately 6 months apart. Cross-lagged analysis indicated that perfectionistic concerns led to increased <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> an ego-involving climate and decreased <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> a task-involving climate over time. In addition, <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> a task-involving climate led to increased perfectionistic strivings over time. The findings suggest that perfectionistic concerns may color <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> training/performing environments so that mistakes are deemed unacceptable and only superior performance is valued. They also suggest that <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> a task-involving climate in training/performing environments may encourage striving for excellence and perfection without promoting excessive concerns regarding their attainment...|$|R

The purpose {{of this research is}} {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> collective efficacy, <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> incivilities, and fear of crime and determine whether these relationships are constant between neighborhoods. Methods: Surveys were conducted using a sample of residents from four neighborhoods within Miami-Dade County. Structural equation models were used to examine the relationships between <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> collective efficacy, <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> incivilities, and fear of crime for each neighborhood separately. Tests for invariance were conducted to determine whether the coefficients from these models differed across neighborhoods. Results: Results from these analyses suggest that the relationship between <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> collective efficacy and fear of crime exhibit significant heterogeneity between neighborhoods, as do a number of other relationships. The relationships between <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> collective efficacy and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> incivilities, and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> incivilities and fear of crime do not exhibit heterogeneity.

Additionally, organizational personality perceptions interacted with need motivation to affect <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> fit and organizational attraction.

40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was to {{determine}} what relationships exist between teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> principals' executive professional leadership and teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> principals' behavior in five aspects of administrative behavior. These administrative areas include Principals' support of teachers' authority (EPA), principals' egalitarian relationship with teachers (EPR), principals' involving teachers in decision-making processes for the school (EPI), principals' support of teachers in managerial matters (EPM), and principals' social support. Subjects for the study were grouped according to gender, length of service and level of education for descriptive purposes and to determine variations in their <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the principals' administrative behaviors. Significant relationships were found to exist between teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> principals' EPL and EPI leadership and teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> principals willingness to involve them in decision—making processes for the schools (EPI). A significant negative relationship was also found to exist between the teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> principals' leadership (EPL) and teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the managerial support (EPM) provided by principals. A slight negative relationship was found between teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> principals' leadership (EPL) and teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> social support (EPS) received from principals. There was a slight but insignificant positive relationship between teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> principals' executive professional leadership (EPL) and teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> egalitarian relationships (EPR) which existed between the teachers and principals. A positive but not significant relationship was also noted between teachers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> principals' leadership (EPL) and teachers* <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the manner in which principals granted them professional authority (EPA). When teachers were grouped by demographic variables, two important trends in^perceptions were noted regarding principals' executive professional leadership. (a) Female teachers had a tendency to perceive principals as having lower professional leadership than did male teachers. (b) Teachers with higher educational levels perceived principals as having less professional leadership ability than teachers with relatively low educational levels. Teachers' level of experience did not appear to have any systematic significant impact on their <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the principals' executive professional leadership.
