5|$|The King's sudden {{onset of}} {{insanity}} {{was seen by}} some as a sign of divine anger and <b>punishment,</b> <b>and</b> by others as the result of magic. Modern historians speculate that he may have suffered from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia.

Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.|$|E

Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison.

5|$|During 1166, Neville was {{in charge}} of Staffordshire for the general eyre {{undertaken}} in that year, and also tried the pleas of the forest for Devonshire and Worcestershire, and perhaps elsewhere. The abbot of Battle Abbey in 1167 sent a monk to plead with Waleran of Meulan to intervene and stop Neville's exactions on the abbot's manors. After the Revolt of 1173–74, Neville {{was in charge}} of a forest eyre held from 1176 to 1178 which resulted in fines totaling 12,000 pounds from breaches of the forest law during the revolt. It appears that the king intended this eyre to be a <b>punishment,</b> <b>and</b> used the forest law because it was solely dependent on the king's will rather than being based in customary law.|$|E

5|$|In his {{biennial}} {{message to}} the legislature in 1910, Willson called for a uniform system of accounting based on legislation recently passed in the neighboring state of Indiana. He also advocated a measure requiring full disclosure of campaign expenditures. Due to its hostility toward Willson, the Assembly scarcely considered the governor's agenda or other needed legislation such as tax reform and redistricting. The reforms Willson advocated would later pass under a Democratic administration. The few accomplishments of this legislature included making electrocution the legal form of capital <b>punishment</b> <b>and</b> establishing of an eight-hour work day for public workers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form of <b>punishment</b> <b>and</b> deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E
5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital <b>punishment,</b> <b>and</b> Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with aberrant sensitivity to rewards <b>and</b> <b>punishments.</b> Although some studies have focused on real-life decision making in children with ADHD using the Iowa gambling task, the number of good deck choices, a frequently used index of decision-making ability in the gambling task, is insufficient for investigating the complex decision-making strategies in subjects. In the present study, we investigated decision-making strategies in ADHD children, analyzing T-patterns with rewards, with <b>punishments,</b> <b>and</b> without rewards <b>and</b> <b>punishments</b> during the gambling task, and examined the relationship between decision-making strategies and skin conductance responses (SCRs) to rewards <b>and</b> <b>punishments.</b> We hypothesized that ADHD children and normal children would employ different decision-making strategies depending on their sensitivity to rewards <b>and</b> <b>punishments</b> in the gambling task. Our results revealed that ADHD children had fewer T-patterns with <b>punishments</b> <b>and</b> exhibited a significant tendency to have many T-patterns with rewards, thus supporting our hypothesis. Moreover, in contrast to normal children, ADHD children failed to demonstrate differences between reward <b>and</b> <b>punishment</b> SCRs, supporting the idea that they had an aberrant sensitivity to rewards <b>and</b> <b>punishments.</b> Therefore, we concluded that ADHD children would be impaired in decision-making strategies depending on their aberrant sensitivity to rewards <b>and</b> <b>punishments.</b> However, we were unable to specify whether large reward SCRs or small punishment SCRs is generated in ADHD children...|$|R

He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created anti-trust laws to attempt to break several large businesses.

40|$|In Western society, the {{prevalence}} of disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) is rapidly growing. Scientific research of related child factors contributes to optimization of prevention and treatment of DBDs and psychopathic traits. Previous research has revealed DBDs and psychopathic traits are related to aberrant reward <b>and</b> <b>punishment</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> aberrant response perseveration. Current research aims to investigate the exact reflection of reward <b>and</b> <b>punishment</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> response perseveration in boys with DBDs and psychopathic traits. In current correlational Dutch research, 84 boys between 8 and 12 years from clinical centers, regular and special education have been studied. Both surveys – Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Parent version, Youth Psychopathic traits Inventory-Child Version and Antisocial Processing Screening Device-Parent Form – and assessments for measuring cognitive abilities – Hungry Donkey Task and Door Opening Task – have been used. Results suggest a very large effect of DBDs on psychopathic traits measured by parent reports. No effects on reward <b>and</b> <b>punishment</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> response perseveration have been found between the DBD group and the control group. Psychopathic traits neither correlate with reward <b>and</b> <b>punishment</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> response perseveration, nor moderate reward <b>and</b> <b>punishment</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> response perseveration in the DBD group. In conclusion, boys with DBDs show – according to parents – more disturbances in interpersonal, affective and behavioral responses compared to the control group. No differences in reward <b>and</b> <b>punishment</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> response perseveration are found between these groups, neither when controlling for psychopathic traits. Finally, {{the extent to which}} boys with a DBD persevere in their responses (i. e. when no reward is given), cannot be predicted by their responses to reward <b>and</b> <b>punishment</b> (i. e. conduct continuation and adjustment). Compared to earlier research, contradicting findings have been found in current research and further research needs to be done...|$|R
