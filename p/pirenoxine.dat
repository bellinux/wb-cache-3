50|$|<b>Pirenoxine</b> (abbreviated PRX, {{trade name}} Catalin) is a {{medication}} {{used in the}} possible treatment and prevention of cataracts. A report {{in the journal of}} Inorganic Chemistry showed that in liquid solutions <b>pirenoxine</b> could cause decreased cloudiness of a crystallin solution produced to mimic the environment of the eye. <b>Pirenoxine</b> interacts with selenite or calcium ions that have been proven as factors leading to the formation of lens cataract.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pirenoxine</b> {{reduces the}} {{cloudiness}} {{of the lens}} solution containing calcium by 38% and reduced the cloudiness of the selenite solution by 11%.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} noninvasive method of {{detecting}} substance {{concentration in the}} aqueous humor based on dual-wavelength iris imaging technology. Two light sources, one centered within (392 nm) and the other centered outside (850 nm) of an absorption band of <b>Pirenoxine</b> Sodium, a common type of drugs in eye disease treatment, were used for dual-wavelength iris imaging measurement. After passing through the aqueous humor twice, the back-scattering light was detected by a charge-coupled device (CCD). The detected images were then {{used to calculate the}} concentration of <b>Pirenoxine</b> Sodium. In eye model experiment, a resolution of 0. 6525 ppm was achieved. Meanwhile, at least 4 ppm can be distinguished in in vivo experiment. These results demonstrated that our method can measure <b>Pirenoxine</b> Sodium concentration in the aqueous humor and its potential ability to monitor other materials’ concentration in the aqueous humor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The government-led "evidence-based {{guidelines}} for cataract treatment" labelled <b>pirenoxine</b> and glutathione eye drops, {{which have been}} regarded as the standard care for cataracts in Japan, as lacking evidence of effectiveness, causing great upset among ophthalmologists and professional ophthalmology societies. This study investigated the reasons why such "scientific evidence of treatment effectiveness" is not easily accepted by physicians, and thus, why they do not change their clinical practices to reflect such evidence. Methods We conducted a qualitative study based on grounded theory to explore physicians' awareness of "scientific evidence" and evidence-supported treatment in relation to <b>pirenoxine</b> and glutathione eye drops, and to identify current barriers {{to the implementation of}} evidence-based policies in clinical practice. Interviews were conducted with 35 ophthalmologists and 3 general practitioners on their prescribing behaviours, perceptions of eye drop effectiveness, attitudes toward the eye drop guideline recommendations, and their perceptions of "scientific evidence. " Results Although few physicians believed that eye drops are remarkably effective, the majority of participants reported that they prescribed eye drops to patients who asked for them, and that such patients accounted for a considerable proportion of those with cataracts. Physicians seldom attempted to explain to patients the limitations of effectiveness or to encourage them to stop taking the eye drops. Physicians also acknowledged the benefits of prescribing such drugs, which ultimately outweighed any uncertainty of their effectiveness. These benefits included economic incentives and a desire to be appreciated by patients. Changes in clinical practice were considered to bring little benefit to physicians or patients. Government approval, rarity of side effects, and low cost of the drops also encouraged prescription. Conclusion Physicians occasionally provide treatment without expecting remarkable therapeutic effectiveness, as exemplified by the use of eye drops. This finding highlights that scientific evidence alone cannot easily change physicians' clinical practices, unless evidence-based practices are accepted by the general public and supported by health policy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cataract {{is one of}} the  most  common  diseases, {{especially}} in the  elderly. Despite  the  fact that  the  share of elderly people  in economically developed countries is higher than  in developing countries, the incidence  of cataract in people over 50 years  in Western countries is 15 % and it is about  40 %  in developing countries. The reasons are  unbalanced nutrition,  lack of specialized ophthalmic  care  at {{the initial stages of}} the disease, the impact of adverse environmental conditions,  etc.   Surgical treatment is the only curative method. However, there are  not always enough indications for this treatment on the one hand, and it is not always possible due to patient’s unfavorable physical status, on the other  hand.   The supportive anti-cataract therapy  should be provided with the dynamic follow-up in such  cases. The pharmaceutical industry offers anti-cataract drugs  with a different composition  and properties, they are  based on the  mechanisms of the  onset  and development of the  disease. “Oxidative stress” is one  of the  main factors, which can  be the  cause of both  nuclear  and  cortical  cataracts. There  are scattering zones in the mature nucleus  of the lens, an increase in extracellular  spaces between corrugated membrane protein-like deposits in case of cataract. It is generally believed that  the  basis  of these deposits are  denatured, initially water-soluble  proteins, which turn  into opaque  substances due to the action of quinoids products formed through  the disturbed metabolism of aromatic aminoacids (tryptophan, tyrosine,  etc.).   Based  on this theory, an anti-cataract substance — <b>pirenoxine</b> was developed.   It inhibits the action of quinoids and prevents the formation of the len’s opacities  and the cataracts progression. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In this study, we {{investigated}} the biochemical pharmacology of <b>pirenoxine</b> (PRX) and catalin under in vitro selenite/calcium- and ultraviolet (UV) -induced lens protein turbidity challenges. The systemic effects of catalin were determined using a selenite-induced cataractogenesis rat model. Methods: In vitro cataractogenesis assay systems (including UVB/C photo-oxidation of lens crystallins, calpain-induced proteolysis, and selenite/calcium-induced turbidity of lens crystallin solutions) {{were used to}} screen the activity of PRX and catalin eye drop solutions. Turbidity was identified as the optical density measured using spectroscopy at 405 nm. We also determined the in vivo effects of catalin on cataract severity in a selenite-induced cataract rat model. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) was applied to analyze the integrity of crystallin samples. Results: PRX at 1, 000 μM significantly delayed UVC-induced turbidity formation compared to controls after 4 h of UVC exposure (p< 0. 05), but not in groups incubated with PRX concentrations of < 1, 000 μM. Results were further confirmed by SDS–PAGE. The absolute γ-crystallin turbidity induced by 4 h of UVC exposure was ameliorated {{in the presence of}} catalin equivalent to 1 ~ 100 μM PRX in a concentration-dependent manner. Samples with catalin-formulated vehicle only (CataV) and those containing PRX equivalent to 100 μM had a similar protective effect after 4 h of UVC exposure compared to the controls (p< 0. 05). PRX at 0. 03, 0. 1, and 0. 3 μM significantly delayed 10 mM selenite- and calcium-induced turbidity formation compared to controls on days 0 ~ 4 (p< 0. 05). Catalin (equivalent to 32, 80, and 100 μM PRX) had an initial protective effect against selenite-induced lens protein turbidity on day 1 (p< 0. 05). Subcutaneous pretreatment with catalin (5 mg/kg) also statistically decreased the mean cataract scores in selenite-induced cataract rats on post-induction day 3 compared to the controls (1. 3 ± 0. 2 versus 2. 4 ± 0. 4; p< 0. 05). However, catalin (equivalent to up to 100 μM PRX) did not inhibit calpain-induced proteolysis activated by calcium, and neither did 100 μM PRX. Conclusions: PRX at micromolar levels ameliorated selenite- and calcium-induced lens protein turbidity but required millimolar levels to protect against UVC irradiation. The observed inhibition of UVC-induced turbidity of lens crystallins by catalin at micromolar concentrations may have been a result of the catalin-formulated vehicle. Transient protection by catalin against selenite-induced turbidity of crystallin solutions in vitro was supported by the ameliorated cataract scores in the early stage of cataractogenesis in vivo by subcutaneously administered catalin. PRX could not inhibit calpain-induced proteolysis activated by calcium or catalin itself, and may be detrimental to crystallins under UVB exposure. Further studies on formulation modifications of catalin and recommended doses of PRX to optimize clinical efficacy by cataract type are warranted. Peer reviewe...|$|E
