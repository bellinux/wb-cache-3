40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} avoid wheel {{slippage}} or mechanical damage during the mobile robot naviga-tion, {{it is necessary to}} smoothly change driving velocity or direction of the mobile robot. This means that dynamic constraints of the mobile robot should be considered in the design of <b>path</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithm. In the study, a <b>path</b> <b>tracking</b> problem is formulated as following a virtual target vehicle which is assumed to move exactly along the path with specified velocity. The driving velocity control law is designed basing on bang-bang control considering the acceleration bounds of driving wheels. The steering control law is designed by combining the bang-bang control with an intermediate path called the landing curve which guides the robot to smoothly land on the virtual target’s tangential line. The curvature and convergence analyses provide sufficient stability conditions for the proposed <b>path</b> <b>tracking</b> controller. A series of <b>path</b> <b>tracking</b> simulations and experiments conducted for a two-wheel driven mobile robot show the validity of the proposed algorithm.

In the fusion, the backward <b>path</b> <b>tracks</b> {{assume the role of}} measurements of the forward <b>path</b> <b>tracks</b> for data association. The information fusion state prediction is updated through data association probabilities to obtain the smoothing innovation, which is used for calculating smoothing data association probabilities and the smoothed target trajectory state.

Then, FLIPDA-S uses the updated forward track state estimations to propagate the existing forward tracks to the next smoothing interval [k+ 1,N+ 1]. The smoothed probability of target existence is also calculated at each scan. At the end of each smoothing interval, the fixed-lag scan (first scan of each interval) is selected to calculate FLIPDA-S statistics (true track confirmation rates and estimation errors), and a new scan is appended for the next smoothing interval. The procedure continues for each subsequent smoothing interval.|$|R

The solution of the trajectory tracking problem {{is based on the}} requirement that the aircraft follows a given time parameterized trajectory in inertial frame.

The <b>path</b> <b>tracking</b> approach is based on designing a nonlinear state feedback controller that maintains a desired speed along a desired path with closed loop stability. This design approach is different from the trajectory tracking approach where aircraft speed and position are regulated along the desired path. The <b>path</b> <b>tracking</b> controller regulates the position errors transverse to the desired path but it does not regulate the position error along the desired path. First, a trajectory tracking controller, consisting of feedforward and static state feedback, is designed to guarantee uniform asymptotic trajectory tracking. The feedforward is determined by solving a stable noncausal inversion problem. Constant feedback gains are determined based on LQR with singular perturbation approach. A <b>path</b> <b>tracking</b> controller is then obtained from the trajectory tracking controller by introducing a suitable state projection...|$|E
