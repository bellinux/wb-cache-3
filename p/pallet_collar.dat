50|$|A single <b>pallet</b> <b>collar</b> {{consists}} of four or six wooden boards (plastic boards are also used) and four or six metallic hinges {{that are used to}} hold the boards together. These hinges allow to collapse every <b>pallet</b> <b>collar</b> in order to save space, {{which is one of the}} most important factors in successful logistics.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>pallet</b> <b>collar</b> is {{a modern}} and highly {{efficient}} wooden packaging solutions for compact, bulky or friable products of different types, that works together with the classic wooden pallet or various types of custom pallets. This solutions works as a substitution for the classic wooden boxes.|$|E
40|$|In general, the sawmill {{industry}} perceives {{softwood lumber}} to be a commodity product and its individual actors’ traditional {{focus is on}} cost reduction. However, {{instead of focusing on}} cost reduction, focus ought to be drawn towards sawmills’ total offers in which service is particularly stressed. Therefore, knowledge of the individual logistics service requirements and their internal grouping is of vital importance {{in order to be able}} to handle groups rather than individual requirements, thereby keeping costs low. About 20 % of the produced softwood lumber is used for pallets and pallet collars. Producers of pallets and pallet collars thereby constitute important customers to the sawmill industry. Despite this, studies regarding the producers of pallets andpallet collars’ logistics service requirements are lacking. Hence the purpose of this paper is to identify and categorize logistics service requirements in the pallet and <b>pallet</b> <b>collar</b> industry. This paper identifies and categorizes the logistics service requirements demanded by sawmills; bylearning which those individual requirements are, then knowing how they could be categorized is essential for the sawmills’ business development. This study commences with an interview study aimed at identifying individual logistics service requirements. Thereafter a survey study is conducted in order to be able to categorize the individual logistics service requirements. The study concludes that logistic service requirements,such as delivery precision and goods wrapped in plastic, are important logistic servicerequirements; there appears to be a standardized set of logistic service requirements required by this category of customer. As this research is constituted by an interview study as well as by aquestionnaire study, it is not possible to identify the actual actions with regards to real trade-offs,made by the actors, which are made in business. Therefore additional studies need to be conducted with an in-depth case study approach...|$|E
50|$|The simple, {{flexible}} {{construction is}} what allows <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> {{to stand out}} from other storage and transportation solutions. And it ensures the usage of <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> that differ in heights and sizes in order to adjust the needed capacity of every individual packaging.|$|R
50|$|Standard <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> are {{manufactured}} from wood plywood which provides the necessary quality. At {{the same time}} plywood, OSB or plastic <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> are also often used as an option. Each of the materials {{has advantages and disadvantages}} if compared to others.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} form the needed {{packaging}} from <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> only collars from one manufacturer should be stacked on one another. While the majority of manufacturers use standard sizes, minor differences can occur due to the technology used in manufacturing. Such minor differences can cause significant safety issues when <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> are used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pallet</b> <b>collars</b> work {{together}} with classic and different types of pallets.|$|R
50|$|Different {{types of}} {{products}} {{can be stored}} on pallets without the <b>pallet</b> <b>collars,</b> {{but they are still}} used in order to ensure safe multi-level both shelf and non-shelf storage which ensures warehouse optimisation.|$|R
50|$|Standard <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> are {{manufactured}} in four heights: 100, 200, 300 and 400 mm. By using the needed heights and combining them together {{it is possible}} to closely match every single package to particular products.|$|R
50|$|Using <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> {{ensure the}} {{possibility}} to store more types of products on pallet which would usually be stored in classic wooden boxes. For example, different friable products, can be stored when customised pallet is used.|$|R
50|$|When <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> are {{not used}} {{and there are no}} {{products}} in this packaging it is possible to collapse them and in comparison to wooden boxes it allows to save up to more that 80% of space.|$|R
50|$|Each of the <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> is {{stacked on}} one another in order to form a box type of packing, but be-cause of the {{convenient}} design they provide several important benefits that have high value in the storage and transportation industry.|$|R
50|$|To {{provide better}} {{transportation}} opportunities for more types of products, <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> {{were introduced to}} the market and followed the increased use of classic wooden pallets {{as a result of the}} growing popularity of containerised transportation on sea and land.|$|R
50|$|When quality <b>pallet</b> <b>collars</b> {{are used}} in the right way it is {{possible}} to optimise space in both ware-houses and when they are transported. They provide fast and easy handling and assembling. Also, the access to the goods that are stored is ensured to be faster and easier.|$|R
