During the 2012 snow year, these gap-filling methods reduced cloud pixels from 27. 7 % to 3. 1 %. A total of 12 metrics (e. g., date of first and last snow, date of persistent snow cover and periods of intermittence) for each pixel were calculated by snow year. A comparison of MODIS-derived snow onset and melt dates with in situ observations from 244 weather stations generally showed an early bias in MODIS-derived dates and an effect of increasing cloudiness exacerbating bias. Our results show that mean regional duration of seasonal snow cover is 179 – 311 days/year and that snow cover is often intermittent, with 41 % of the area experiencing ≥ 2 snow-covered periods during a snow season.

Since J_ is close to zero in the <b>polar</b> cap in <b>darkness,</b> the Pedersen current must also be small there. Since the electric field is typically north–south in the auroral oval, due to sunward ionospheric convection, the closure current there is probably dominated by Hall currents. Consequently, the quantity E·J_, which in the neutral wind frame of reference largely represents energy dissipation through frictional heating (Vasyliunas and Song 2005), must be much stronger on average in sunlight {{than it is in}} darkness. This is consistent with the result by Weimer (2005), who reports much larger dissipation globally in the Northern hemisphere for positive dipole tilt angles. The reduced importance of Pedersen currents in darkness implies that Birkeland current closure is partly dissipationless.|$|R

40|$|Polar regions {{have great}} {{sensitivity}} to climate forcing; however, {{understanding of the}} physical processes coupling the atmosphere and ocean in these regions is relatively poor. Improving our knowledge of high-latitude surface fluxes will require close collaboration among meteorologists, oceanographers, ice physicists, and climatologists, and between observationalists and modelers, {{as well as new}} combinations of in situ measurements and satellite remote sensing. This article describes the deficiencies in our current state of knowledge about air–sea surface fluxes in high latitudes, the sensitivity of various high-latitude processes to changes in surface fluxes, and the scientific requirements for surface fluxes at high latitudes. We inventory the reasons, both logistical and physical, why existing flux products do not meet these requirements. Capturing an annual cycle in fluxes requires that instruments function through long periods of cold <b>polar</b> <b>darkness,</b> often far from support services, in situations subject to icing and extreme wave conditions. Furthermore, frequent cloud cover at high latitudes restricts the availability of surface and atmospheric data from visible and infrared (IR) wavelength satellite sensors. Recommendations are made for improving high-latitude fluxes, including 1) acquiring more in situ observations, 2) developing improved satellite-flux-observing capabilities, 3) making observations and flux products more accessible, and 4) encouraging flux intercomparisons...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{the galactic}} cosmic ray (GCR) flux due to {{variations}} in solar activity may provide an indirect {{connection between the}} Sun's and the Earth's climates. Epoch superpositional (composite) analyses of high-magnitude GCR fluctuations, known as Forbush decrease (FD) events, {{have been widely used}} to test this hypothesis, with varied results. This work provides new information regarding the interpretation of this approach, suggesting that FD events do not isolate the impacts of GCR variations from those of solar irradiance changes. On average, irradiance changes of ∼ 0. 4 W m− 2 outside the atmosphere occur around 2 days in advance of FD-associated GCR decreases. Using this 2 day gap to separate the effects of irradiance variations from GCR variations on cloud cover, we demonstrate small, but statistically significant, anomalous cloud changes occurring only over areas of the Antarctic plateau in association with the irradiance changes, which previous workers had attributed to GCR variations. Further analysis of the sample shows that these cloud anomalies occurred primarily during <b>polar</b> <b>darkness,</b> precluding the possibility of a causal link to a direct total solar irradiance effect.

One of these young men said to his friend: [...] "I'll stay if you will." [...] And the other quickly agreed. After the ship sailed, and the land of the midnight sun had become icy and black, one of these comrades fell ill, and soon died. The living one placed the body in the room with the ship supplies, where it froze stiff; and during all the long polar night of solitude and ghastly gloom he lived next to this sepulchre that contained his dead friend. When the ship returned the crew found the living comrade an old man with hair as white as snow, and never in his life afterward was he seen to smile.|$|R

Polarimetric radar imaging has become a promising tool for lake ice mapping at high latitudes where cloud cover and <b>polar</b> <b>darkness</b> severely limit observations from optical sensors. In this study, we assessed and characterized the physical scattering mechanisms of lake ice from fully polarimetric RADARSAT- 2 datasets obtained over Great Bear Lake, Canada, with the intent of classifying open water and ice cover during the freeze-up and break-up periods. Model-based and eigen-based decompositions were employed to construct the coherency matrix into deterministic scattering mechanisms, and secondary physical parameters were generated following the polarimetric decompositions. This study presents an application of the Markov Random Field by introducing radar signals and polarimetric parameters as features. These features were labeled using the entropy-alpha Wishart classifier. We show that the selected polarimetric parameters can help with interpretation of radar-ice/water interactions and can be used successfully for water-ice segmentation. As more satellite SAR sensors are being launched or planned, such as the Sentinel- 1 a/b series and the upcoming RADARSAT Constellation Mission, the rapid volume growth of data and their analysis require the development of robust automated algorithms.

40|$|Global {{snow cover}} is an {{important}} environmental parameter, as is influences hydrology, vegetation, radiation balance, and the living space of humans and animals. Snow is an essential source for freshwater in many {{regions of the world}} and at the same time, snow cover depends on precipitation and temperature during the snow season. As climate and weather varies, also the amount as well as the onset, duration, and offset of snow cover changes throughout the years. It is important to analyze this variability in order to identify possible trends, but also to predict the impact of the snow cover situation on local freshwater availability, floods, or the influences on vegetation. Snow cover information derived from medium resolution remote sensing data such as AVHRR, MODIS, and now Sentinel 3 can help to understand and analyze both the current situation as well as possible long term tendencies of global snow cover. Such data is available on a daily basis which is essential as the snow cover extent can change rapidly during snow fall or snow melt events induced by sudden temperature increase. Data gaps caused by cloud cover or <b>polar</b> <b>darkness</b> can cause uncertainties, which make a processing of the time series necessary in order to estimate the snow cover status within these gaps. The Global SnowPack has been developed at DLR to overcome the problem of data gaps, provide information of global snow cover statistics through DLRs Geoservice, and to support analyzing the connections between snow cover and hydrological, climatological, and all the other aspects mentioned already above.

It is based on time series of global, daily snow cover information derived from medium resolution remote sensing data. The aim is to include every possible data source available to offer high quality products for the whole globe which range back until the early 80 s. Such a long time series is required in order to derive possible trends from the data. AVHRR, MODIS, MERIS, and the upcoming Sentinel- 3 data are only some examples for sensors that are/will be included in the Global SnowPack products. These products consist of the overall snow cover duration per hydrological year (different for Northern and Southern Hemisphere), early season snow cover duration and late season snow cover duration. The processing steps that are performed to derive these products include temporal and spatial interpolation to estimate the snow cover status below clouds, during <b>polar</b> <b>darkness,</b> and during data gaps, as well as a snowline detection which is depending on the topography of an area.

40|$|Avalanches form {{a threat}} to people {{travelling}} in mountainous regions {{as well as for}} infrastructure and buildings. They cause around 250 fatalities annually worldwide. To limit the number of future fatalities, forecasting services are interested in knowledge on avalanche activity to verify their warning system. They rely on information about the frequency, location and extent of debris fields, as provided by avalanche experts. As avalanche terrain is mostly remote and inaccessible, it can be dangerous or even impossible to obtain necessary field information. This information is especially crucial to gain during strong winds and blowing snow when an increased avalanche danger is present. By applying Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), large areas can be monitored at once with both high spatial resolution and high acquisition frequency. It also has the advantage of being daylight- and weather independent. The area of interest, Nordenskiold Land on Svalbard, experiences over four months of <b>polar</b> <b>darkness</b> per year. Consequently, the most applicable technique for avalanche monitoring is SAR. Avalanche debris has an increased surface roughness compared to the surrounding unperturbed snow causing a higher backscatter signal. Therefore, the debris fields appear bright in SAR images. The main goal of this research project is to optimise avalanche detection in SAR images by exploring the option of automatic detection of debris fields. Hence, we present a method to automatically detect avalanche debris fields in SAR images. It is designed and tested on both RADARSAT- 2 Ultra Fine (UF) mode and Sentinel- 1 A Extra Wide swath (EW) mode images. Sentinel- 1 A has the advantage of obtaining images twice per day over Svalbard and is made available for free. Due to the high costs to acquire RADARSAT- 2 data over Svalbard, these images have a low acquisition frequency. The UF mode images are geocoded to a pixel spacing of 3 m compared to 40 m for the EW mode images. Both modes detect the location of debris fields, but the extent is only clearly distinguishable in the UF mode images due to the fine resolution. In case of automatic detection, the backscatter coefficient of the debris fields is compared to the backscatter coefficient from a reference image. This reference image should be obtained during dry snow conditions or during a snow-free summer. The difference in backscatter coefficient between the two images is determined by subtracting the reference image from the avalanche image. By applying a threshold on the difference image debris fields are successfully located. However, to eliminate areas above the threshold value but not considered as avalanche, a filter is applied. Two filters are tested; a median filter and a Remove Small Objects (RSO) filter. For the RADARSAT- 2 UF mode images the best result is obtained by using a median filter and a threshold value of 1. 9 dB, while for the Sentinel- 1 A EW mode images a RSO filter in combination with a threshold value of 3. 4 dB resulted in the optimum detection. None of the designed automatic detection methods resulted in a 100 % probability of detection and zero false alarms, but they do confirm that automatic detection of avalanches in these SAR images is possible. They also show that the automatic detection method is depended on the characteristics of the input data. By combining a regular detection of the whole of Svalbard by the coarse Sentinel- 1 A EW mode images and a more specified forecasting using the fine RADARSAT- 2 UF mode images avalanche maps can be created indicating both location and extent of debris fields. These maps can be of great value for avalanche warning services, although further research is necessary before automatically generated avalanche maps can be included in daily operations.
