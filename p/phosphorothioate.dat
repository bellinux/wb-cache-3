5|$|Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are {{modified}} oligonucleotides {{where one}} of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate moiety is replaced by sulfur. Only the phosphorothioates having sulfur at a non-bridging position as shown in figure are widely used and are available commercially. The replacement of the non-bridging oxygen with sulfur creates a new center of chirality at phosphorus. In a simple case of a dinucleotide, this results in the formation of a diastereomeric pair of Sp- and Rp-dinucleoside monophosphorothioates whose structures are shown in Figure. In an n-mer oligonucleotide where all (n– 1) internucleosidic linkages are <b>phosphorothioate</b> linkages, the number of diastereomers m is calculated as m = 2(n– 1). Being non-natural analogs of nucleic acids, OPS are substantially more stable towards hydrolysis by nucleases, the class of enzymes that destroy nucleic acids by breaking the bridging P-O bond of the phosphodiester moiety. This property determines the use of OPS as antisense oligonucleotides in in vitro and in vivo applications where the extensive exposure to nucleases is inevitable. Similarly, to improve the stability of siRNA, at least one <b>phosphorothioate</b> linkage is often introduced at the 3'-terminus of both sense and antisense strands. In chirally pure OPS, all-Sp diastereomers are more stable to enzymatic degradation than their all-Rp analogs. However, the preparation of chirally pure OPS remains a synthetic challenge. In laboratory practice, mixtures of diastereomers of OPS are commonly used.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consideration}} is {{the inclusion of}} <b>phosphorothioate</b> bonds. In a <b>phosphorothioate</b> bond, one of the non-bridging oxygens between nucleotide bases is replaced with a sulfur atom, changing the chemical properties. This modification is necessary in oligo design because it results in decreased susceptibility to exonuclease degradation. At maximum, four of these bonds should be situated near the 5’ end of the oligo. Too many <b>phosphorothioate</b> bonds can be problematic; each modified site creates a chiral center, {{which can lead to}} a racemic mixture of isomers with varying characteristics and properties.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps most worrisome were {{experiments}} that suggested the A-9 and scissile phosphates must come within about 4 Å {{of one another}} in the transition-state, based upon double <b>phosphorothioate</b> substitution and soft metal ion rescue experiments; the distance between these phosphates in the minimal hammerhead crystal structure was about 18 Å, with no clear mechanism for close approach if the Stem II and Stem I A-form helices were treated as rigid bodies. Taken together, these results appeared to suggest that a fairly large-scale conformational change must have taken place in order to reach the transition-state within the minimal hammerhead ribozyme structure.|$|E

We report here the introduction of 3 '- and 5 '-terminal <b>phosphorothioates</b> into heptameric oligonucleotides and their post-synthetic modification with several reporter groups. The synthesis of terminal <b>phosphorothioates</b> {{is based on the}} coupling of a ribonucleoside phosphoramidite at the first or last nucleotide, respectively, which, after sulphurization, is removed by sequential oxidation of the vicinal hydroxyl groups and then beta-elimination. Product formation is of the order of 95 %. The ratio of phosphorothioate- versus phosphate-terminated oligodeoxynucleotides as analysed by electrophoresis on a Hg 2 +gel is in general 85 / 15.

500|$|Thirty years later, {{this work}} inspired, independently, two {{research}} groups {{to adopt the}} H-phosphonate chemistry to the solid-phase synthesis using nucleoside H-phosphonate monoesters 7 as building blocks and pivaloyl chloride, 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (TPS-Cl), and other compounds as activators. [...] The practical implementation of H-phosphonate method resulted {{in a very short}} and simple synthetic cycle consisting of only two steps, detritylation and coupling (Scheme 2). Oxidation of internucleosidic H-phosphonate diester linkages in 8 to phosphodiester linkages in 9 with a solution of iodine in aqueous pyridine is carried {{out at the end of}} the chain assembly rather than as a step in the synthetic cycle. If desired, the oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions. Alternatively, 8 can be converted to <b>phosphorothioate</b> 10 or phosphoroselenoate 11 (X = Se), or oxidized by CCl4 in the presence of primary or secondary amines to phosphoramidate analogs 12. The method is very convenient in that various types of phosphate modifications (phosphate/phosphorothioate/phosphoramidate) may be introduced to the same oligonucleotide for modulation of its properties.|$|E

These are segments of DNA or RNA that are designed as complementary molecule to critical sections of viral genomes, and the binding of these antisense segments to these target sections blocks the operation of those genomes. A <b>phosphorothioate</b> antisense drug named fomivirsen has been introduced, used to treat opportunistic eye infections in AIDS patients caused by cytomegalovirus, and other antisense antivirals are in development.

Three antisense oligonucleotides directed to the splice-acceptor site of the tat gene failed to suppress human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication at 1 microM concentration in long-term culture. In contrast, two oligodeoxynucleotide <b>phosphorothioates</b> (28 -mer) complementary to the gag and the rev mRNAs inhibited viral replication for > 80 days, and the antiviral activity was sequence- and length-dependent. In addition, after pretreatment of cells we could reduce the concentration of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides by > 10 -fold and still maintain the inhibition of viral replication.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a culture system, simulating in vivo conditions of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection, to evaluate the long-term efficacy of antisense oligonucleotide treatment. Five oligonucleotide <b>phosphorothioates</b> (28 -mers), complementary to different regions of HIV- 1 RNA, blocked replication of the virus in a sequence-specific manner at 1 microM concentration. Variations in antiviral activity were seen among the different oligonucleotides, revealing an effect of target selection. Mismatched or random oligonucleotide <b>phosphorothioates</b> delayed, but did not completely inhibit, HIV- 1 replication.

Sequential treatment of HIV- 1 -infected cells with a combination of different antisense oligonucleotides, each administered once, also prevented the development of escape mutants.

Effects of radioactive labeled oligos may be exerted both via direct antisense inhibition and radiation. This radionanotargeting approach may provide several benefits to conventional treatment modalities, and radiation is minimized in adjacent tissue. In addition, a combination of radiation and antisense activity of oligodeoxynucleotide may result in synergistic interaction, as there are two different treatment modalities hitting a single mechanism of action.
