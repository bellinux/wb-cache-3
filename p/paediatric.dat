5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is {{a medical}} nutrition therapy that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered <b>paediatric</b> dietitian who coordinates the diet programme; a <b>paediatric</b> neurologist who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a registered nurse who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a medical social worker who works with the family and a pharmacist who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in {{many aspects of the}} diet for it to be safely implemented.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{statement}} by the European Society for <b>Paediatric</b> Endocrinology and the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society (for children) uses slightly different cutoffs, where mild DKA is defined by pH7.20–7.30 (bicarbonate 10–15mmol/l), moderate DKA by pH7.1–7.2 (bicarbonate 5–10) and severe DKA by pH<7.1 (bicarbonate below 5).|$|E
5|$|By 1974 the Famous Five Club had a {{membership}} of 220,000, and was growing {{at the rate}} of 6,000 new members a year. The Beaconsfield home it was set up to support closed in 1967, but the club continued to raise funds for other <b>paediatric</b> charities, including an Enid Blyton bed at Great Ormond Street Hospital and a mini-bus for disabled children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Clinical {{trials and}} studies in animal models (including C. elegans) suggest that {{ketogenic}} diets provide neuroprotective and disease-modifying benefits {{for a number}} of adult neurodegenerative disorders. As of 2012, there is limited clinical trial data in these areas, and, outside of <b>paediatric</b> epilepsy, use of the ketogenic diet remains at the research stage.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 2005 of 88 <b>paediatric</b> neurologists in the US found that 36% {{regularly}} prescribed the diet after {{three or more}} drugs had failed; 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort; 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases; and 16% had never prescribed the diet. There are several possible explanations for this gap between evidence and clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.|$|E
5|$|Although {{her film}} career {{has yet to}} achieve {{large-scale}} success, Riya has generated considerable media attention. She was ranked ninth on Femina 50 Most Beautiful Women, published in the magazine's September 2007 issue. She was a jury member for the 2008 Final of the Mr. India contest. Riya appeared in Haath Se Haath Mila, an HIV/AIDS awareness music video. She made charity appearances at McDonald's India {{to raise money for}} <b>paediatric</b> eye-care during World Children's Week (14–20 November) in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Blyton {{felt she}} had a {{responsibility}} to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she encouraged them to support worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them {{to raise funds for}} animal and <b>paediatric</b> charities. The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled Enid, featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Four in 2009. There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage, screen and television.|$|E
5|$|Caldas da Rainha {{is home to}} the Hospital Distrital Caldas da Rainha (Caldas da Rainha District Hospital), {{which is}} managed by the multi-city Centro Hospitalar do Oeste (CHO, Hospital Centre of the West). The {{hospital}} serves all general emergency needs of residents in all civil parishes of Bombarral, Caldas da Rainha, and Óbidos, plus parts of Alcobaça; <b>paediatric</b> emergencies for the aforementioned municipalities, plus Peniche; and obstetric and gynecological emergency needs for the aforementioned municipalities, plus Cadaval, Lourinhã, Mafra, and Torres Vedras. In 2012, the municipality had 326 inhabitants per physician.|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} of the scientific consensus includes the rejection of a causal link between thiomersal and autism by multiple national and international scientific and medical bodies including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the Canadian <b>Paediatric</b> Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the European Medicines Agency.|$|E
5|$|She {{retired in}} 1938 {{and became an}} honorary {{consulting}} physician at the Children's Hospital, but when the Second World War broke out, {{she returned to the}} hospital as senior <b>paediatric</b> adviser, at the same time organising the Red Cross donor transfusion service. Dr Elma Linton Sandford-Morgan (22 February 1890 – 1983), author of ABC of Mothercraft, was appointed medical officer for MBHA in 1937. She was a daughter of industrialist and politician A. Wallace Sandford.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a casting}} {{department}} at Elstree Studios which casts actors for Holby City {{as well as}} Casualty, EastEnders and Doctors. The programme also has two dedicated casting directors who bring in a shortlist of actors for the producer and director to audition. Some cast members who play main characters have made previous appearances in Holby City in minor roles. Mealing appeared {{as the mother of}} a <b>paediatric</b> patient in the show's fourth series, Roberts appeared as the son of a medical professor in Holby City seventh series, and Dhillon appeared as anaesthetist Sunil Gupta in 2001. Roberts believes that his single scene in series seven was enough for him to be called in for the part of Joseph, while in contrast, Dhillon does not believe that his role contributed to his casting as Michael, but instead worried that it would work against him.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Australia, Downes was {{discharged}} from the AIF, but remained in the Army as a reservist. He became an honorary consulting surgeon at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne and Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, and honorary surgeon at Prince Henry's Hospital. He was a founding fellow of the College of Surgeons of Australasia in 1927, and {{became president of the}} Victorian branch of the British Medical Association in 1935. He established {{a reputation as one of}} Melbourne's leading <b>paediatric</b> surgeons, but found himself in disagreement with certain medical practices then in vogue. In a 1922 paper published in the Medical Journal of Australia, he examined 100 cases of tonsillectomy in children, and concluded that the majority of them were unnecessary. It would be another four decades before the medical profession in Australia accepted this. He lectured on medical ethics at the University of Melbourne from the late 1930s until his death in 1945, and wrote a course textbook on the subject, entitled Medical Ethics, which was published in 1942.|$|E
25|$|On September 13, 2011 Madras High Court revoked a {{suspension}} on manufacture {{and sale of}} <b>paediatric</b> drugs nimesulide and phenylpropanolamine (PPA).|$|E
25|$|<b>Paediatric</b> {{trials of}} {{docetaxel}} have been limited, and so safety of use in patients under 16 years {{has not been}} established.|$|E
25|$|Renal {{impairment}} {{is unlikely}} to affect metabolism or excretion of docetaxel as renal excretion contributes less than 5% of elimination. Limited data is available for docetaxel use in children with dosage between 55 and 75mg/m². Two <b>paediatric</b> studies have taken place that show a mean clearance of 33 L/h/m² and concentration-time profiles best fitted by a two-compartmental model of distribution and elimination. Mean distribution half-life was 0.09 hours and mean elimination half-life was 1.4 hours in <b>paediatric</b> studies.|$|E

25|$|Glucocorticoids are {{so named}} {{due to their}} effect on the {{carbohydrate}} mechanism. They promote glycogen storage in the liver. An enlarged liver is a rare side-effect of long-term steroid use in children. The classical effect of prolonged use both in adult and <b>paediatric</b> population is steatosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} medical {{services}} by {{the population of}} the municipality, is taken care of by publicly and privately owned institutions. The medical units in Xalapa provide external advisory services, general and specialized hospitalization that are equipped with laboratories for clinical medical analyses including X-rays, obstetrical, gynaecological and <b>paediatric</b> equipment.|$|E
25|$|Eder {{returned}} to London in 1900 {{and went into}} general practice. His interest in <b>paediatric</b> medicine led to his appointment as Medical Officer of the London School Clinic in 1908 and of the Nursery School at Deptford in 1910. He was also {{the editor of the}} medical journal School Hygiene.|$|E
25|$|The {{age range}} of {{patients}} seen by any given specialist {{can be quite}} variable. Paediatricians handle most complaints and diseases in children {{that do not require}} surgery, and there are several subspecialties (formally or informally) in paediatrics that mimic the organ-based specialties in adults. <b>Paediatric</b> surgery {{may or may not be}} a separate specialty that handles some kinds of surgical complaints in children.|$|E
25|$|An MD or a DNB (general {{medicine}} or paediatrics) {{is the basic}} requirement for specialisation in Cardiology, Nephrology, Neonatology, Gastro-enterology, Neurology except for Clinical Hematology (Pathology or general medicine), etc., while an MS or a DNB (general surgery, ENT or Orthopaedic surgery) is the basic requirement for Neurosurgery, Urology, Cardio-thoracic & Vascular Surgery, Gastrointestinal Surgery, <b>Paediatric</b> Surgery, Plastic Surgery, etc.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Norris {{supports}} the Vijay Amritraj Foundation, which aims at bringing hope, help and healing to the defenceless and innocent victims of disease, tragedy and circumstance in India.

25|$|Following {{completion}} of residency training, Radiologists may either begin practicing {{as a general}} Diagnostic Radiologist or enter into subspecialty training programs known as fellowships. Examples of subspeciality training in radiology include abdominal imaging, thoracic imaging, cross-sectional/ultrasound, MRI, musculoskeletal imaging, interventional radiology, neuroradiology, interventional neuroradiology, <b>paediatric</b> radiology, nuclear medicine, emergency radiology, breast imaging and women's imaging. Fellowship training programs in radiology are usually {{one or two years}} in length.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, neuropsychiatry, physiological, and imaging {{studies have}} shown PTSD and {{depression}} to be physical syndromes, in many respects, as they are psychiatric ones in demonstrating limbic system physiological and anatomy disturbances. Attendant PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, which additionally increase physiological stress, may {{play a part in}} leading to frequent MH-like hyperpyrexia and speculate on its influence on underlying myopathology of FSS in other ways. PTSD may also bring about developmental delays or developmental stagnation, especially in <b>paediatric</b> patients.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, anaesthetists are {{physicians}} who have specialized {{in the medical}} field of anaesthesia. Anaesthetists in the Netherlands must complete medical school training, which takes six years. After successfully completing medical school training, they start a five-year residency training in anaesthesia. In their fifth year they can choose to spend the year doing research, or to specialize in a certain area, including regular anaesthesia, critical care medicine, pain and palliative medicine, <b>paediatric</b> anaesthesia, cardiothoracic anaesthesia, neuro-anaesthesia or obstetric anaesthesia.|$|E
