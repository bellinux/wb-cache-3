40|$|Organic nitrates are a {{group of}} very {{effective}} anti-ischemic drugs. They are used {{for the treatment of}} patients with stable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and chronic congestive heart failure. A major therapeutic limitation inherent to organic nitrates is the development of tolerance, which occurs during chronic treatment with these agents, and this phenomenon is largely based on induction of oxidative stress with subsequent endothelial dysfunction. We therefore speculated that induction of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) could be an efficient strategy to overcome nitrate tolerance and the associated side effects.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{therapy with}} {{nitroglycerin}} (GTN) {{results in a}} rapid development of nitrate tolerance which is {{associated with an increased}} production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). According to recent studies, mitochondrial ROS formation and oxidative inactivation of the organic nitrate bioactivating enzyme mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH- 2) play an important role for the development of nitrate and cross-tolerance. Methods Tolerance was induced by infusion of wild type (WT) and heterozygous manganese superoxide dismutase mice (Mn-SOD +/-) with ethanolic solution of GTN (12. 5 μg/min/kg for 4 d). For comparison, the tolerance-free <b>pentaerithrityl</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (PETN, 17. 5 μg/min/kg for 4 d) was infused in DMSO. Vascular reactivity was measured by isometric tension studies of isolated aortic rings. ROS formation and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH- 2) activity was measured in isolated heart mitochondria. Results Chronic GTN infusion lead to impaired vascular responses to GTN and acetylcholine (ACh), increased the ROS formation in mitochondria and decreased ALDH- 2 activity in Mn-SOD +/- mice. In contrast, PETN infusion did not increase mitochondrial ROS formation, did not decrease ALDH- 2 activity and accordingly did not lead to tolerance and cross-tolerance in Mn-SOD +/- mice. PETN but not GTN increased heme oxygenase- 1 mRNA in EA. hy 926 cells and bilirubin efficiently scavenged GTN-derived ROS. Conclusion Chronic GTN infusion stimulates mitochondrial ROS production which is an important mechanism leading to tolerance and cross-tolerance. The tetranitrate PETN is devoid of mitochondrial oxidative stress induction and according to the present animal study as well as numerous previous clinical studies can be used without limitations due to tolerance and cross-tolerance. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Diabetes is {{associated}} with vascular oxidative stress, activation of NADPH oxidase, and uncoupling of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (endothelial NO synthase [eNOS]). <b>Pentaerithrityl</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (PETN) is an organic nitrate with potent antioxidant properties via induction of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1). We tested whether treatment with PETN improves vascular dysfunction {{in the setting of}} experimental diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—After induction of hyperglycemia by streptozotocin (STZ) injection (60 mg/kg i. v.), PETN (15 mg/kg/day p. o.) or isosorbide- 5 -mononitrate (ISMN; 75 mg/kg/day p. o.) was fed to Wistar rats for 7 weeks. Oxidative stress was assessed by optical methods and oxidative protein mod-ifications, vascular function was determined by isometric tension recordings, protein expression was measured by Western blotting, RNA expression was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, and HO- 1 promoter activity in stable transfected cells was determined by luciferase assays. RESULTS—PETN, but not ISMN, improved endothelial dysfunction. NADPH oxidase and serum xanthine oxidase activities were signif-icantly reduced by PETN but not by ISMN. Both organic nitrates had minor effects on the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits, eNOS and dihydrofolate reductase (Western blotting). PETN, but not ISMN, normalized the expression of GTP cyclohydrolase- 1, extracellular superoxide dismutase, and S-glutathionylation of eNOS, thereby preventing eNOS uncoupling. The expression of the antioxidant enzyme, HO- 1, was increased by STZ treatment and further upregulated by PETN, but not ISMN, via activation of the transcription factor NRF 2. CONCLUSIONS—In contrast to ISMN, the organic nitrate, PETN, improves endothelial dysfunction in diabetes by prevent-ing eNOS uncoupling and NADPH oxidase activation, thereby reducing oxidative stress. Thus, PETN therapy may be suited to treat patients with cardiovascular complications of diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Objective—Nitrate {{tolerance}} {{is likely}} attributable {{to an increased}} production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to an inhibition of the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH- 2), representing the nitroglycerin (GTN) and pentaerythrityl tetranitrate (PETN) bioactivating enzyme, and to impaired nitric oxide bioactivity and signaling. We tested whether differences in their capacity to induce heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) might explain why PETN and not GTN therapy is devoid of nitrate and cross-tolerance. Methods and Results—Wistar rats were treated with PETN or GTN (10. 5 or 6. 6 g/kg/min for 4 days). In contrast to GTN, PETN did not induce nitrate tolerance or cross-tolerance as assessed by isometric tension recordings in isolated aortic rings. Vascular protein and mRNA expression of HO- 1 and ferritin were increased in response to PETN but not GTN. In contrast to GTN therapy, NO signaling, ROS formation, and the activity of ALDH- 2 (as assessed by an high-performance liquid chromatography–based method) were not significantly influenced by PETN. Inhibition of HO- 1 expression by apigenin induced “tolerance ” to PETN whereas HO- 1 gene induction by hemin prevented tolerance in GTN treated rats. Conclusions—HO- 1 expression and activity appear to {{play a key role}} in the development of nitrate tolerance and might represent an intrinsic antioxidative mechanism of therapeutic interest.

Key Words: organic nitrates nitrate tolerance heme oxygenase- 1 reactive oxygen species When given acutely, organic nitrates such as nitroglyc-erin (glyceryl trinitrate, GTN) have potent antiische-mic effects. 1 Their clinical usefulness during long-term treat-ment, however, is limited because of the development of tolerance and cross-tolerance to endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilators. 2 The phenomenon of nitrate toler-ance was observed first in response to treatment with GTN, 3 but seems also to be shared by other organic nitrates such as isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) 4 and mononitrate (ISMN), but interestingly not by <b>pentaerithrityl</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (PETN). 5,...|$|E
