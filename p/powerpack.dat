5|$|After the Korean War, Boxer saw {{a variety}} of duties, {{including}} as an anti-submarine warfare carrier and an amphibious assault platform. She participated {{in a number of}} training exercises including Operation Hardtack and Operation Steel Pike, as well as several contingencies including Operation <b>Powerpack</b> and the Cuban Missile Crisis.

5|$|With two Landing Ship Docks, Boxer was {{dispatched}} to Hispaniola on 29 August 1964 on a humanitarian mission to aid Haiti and the Dominican Republic whose infrastructure had {{been damaged by}} Hurricane Cleo. The ships provided medical aid and helped to evacuate civilians displaced by the storm. On 27 April 1965 Boxer returned to the Dominican Republic with Helicopter Squadron 264 and a complement of Marines. They evacuated about 1,000 US nationals from {{the country in the}} wake of a revolution in the country. It was a part of Operation <b>Powerpack</b> which would eventually see the US occupation of that country. Later in 1965, she was used as a transport vessel for the Vietnam War. The carrier transported 200 helicopters of the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division to South Vietnam. She made a second trip to Vietnam in early 1966 when she transported Marine Corps aircraft to South Vietnam. However, she did not participate in combat operations during that war.|$|E

50|$|The {{modularity}} is {{what makes}} a <b>powerpack</b> powertrain different from other types; using the term <b>powerpack</b> implies that the whole unit can be easily removed or separated {{from the rest of}} the machine, allowing it to be rapidly replaced by another <b>powerpack</b> while the original is repaired or disposed of, and minimizing the amount of time that the entire machine is out of use. Even in cases where the <b>powerpack</b> is not being replaced, being able to remove it can make repairs easier and faster.|$|E

A bi-directional 250 kW inverter costs $52,500. By October 2016, a limited system of <b>Powerpack</b> 2 cost $398/kWh.|$|E
50|$|<b>Powerpacks</b> {{are used}} with {{certain types of}} {{industrial}} equipment designs, including vehicle designs such as forklifts and cherry picker lifts but also stationary equipment such as paint sprayers.

However, {{with the construction of}} a solar array, battery storage system and microgrid the island's power is provided virtually 100% from the sun. This solar array was constructed by SolarCity, and now includes sixty Tesla <b>Powerpacks.</b> The system should be a more reliable source of energy, and was designed to power the entire island for three days without sunlight and fully recharge in seven hours.|$|R

Energy manufactures {{a wide variety of}} hydraulic cylinders; welded, tie-rod, ram-type, rephasing, telescopic, and position-sensing. Energy has designed and manufactured hydraulic cylinders with bores from less than one inch (2.5 cm), up to 11 inches (28 cm). Cylinders have been manufactured with strokes up to 15 feet (4.5 cm). Energy has designed cylinders with working pressures as high as 10,000 psig (690 bar).|$|R

Gaetano was killed while on guard outside. Spock advises against pointless actions that could endanger them further. The creatures attack the shuttle and Scotty generates an electric field that briefly scares them off.|$|R
50|$|The {{model was}} based on the {{prototype}} bus designed and built by FFG known as B1 (later this bus became KD1 in the CIÉ fleet) for CIÉ. The bus was built on an all welded integral design frame. The model was offered with a choice of engine/gearbox combinations, including the Detroit Diesel 6V71/Allison V730, the Cummins LT10/Voith D851, the Rolls Royce Eagle/ZF 4HP500 Ecomat and the Gardner 6LXB/ZF 4HP500 Ecomat. The GM combination ran on Rockwell axles, the remaining <b>powerpacks</b> driving on Kirkstall axles. Steering was provided by ZF, suspension by Dunlop pneumatics, shocks by Koni and the air system by Wabco. Door systems on the early production models were made by Keiert of Germany with later buses having Deans Doors systems. SWF provided the wiper system and many electrical components.|$|R
50|$|Vector {{owns and}} {{operates}} the electricity sub-transmission and distribution networks across {{the majority of the}} Auckland Region, from Wellsford in the north to central Papakura in the south, and over the Tamaki Strait to Waiheke Island. The network consists of 18,116 km of lines, fifty-four percent of which is underground, at voltages of 110 kV, 33 kV, 22 kV,11 kV and 400 V. Electricity is taken from Transpower's national grid at fourteen grid exit points: Wellsford, Silverdale, Albany, Wairau Road, Henderson and Hepburn Road for the northern network, and Mount Roskill, Hobson Street, Penrose, Otahuhu, Pakuranga, Mangere, Wiri, and Takanini for the southern network. Due to differing vector groups, the only distribution level connection between the northern and southern networks is via a phase-shifting transformer between Avondale zone substation (Mount Roskill) and Brickworks zone substation (Hepburn Road). In October 2016, Vector installed a 1MW/2.3MWh lithium-ion battery for grid strengthening near Glen Innes in Auckland. It consists of 24 <b>Powerpacks.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The 1988-89 team {{may have}} been the most talented team ever {{assembled}} at the University of Illinois. The team was so athletic that they could [...] "run and alley-oop" [...] baskets using even the non-starting players, and a record number of 100+ game scores reflected this fact. The players known as the“Flying Illini,” included all the important pieces from the 1987-88 squad (Kenny Battle, Kendall Gill, Steve Bardo, Lowell Hamilton, Nick Anderson and Larry Smith) as well as junior college All-American P.J. Bowman and former high school All-American Marcus Liberty. The Fighting Illini won their first 16 games and were ranked No. 2 in the nation going into a nationally televised game against Georgia Tech, whom Illinois had already beaten, 80-75, at the Rainbow Classic in December. The Yellow Jackets led, 47-31, but Illinois managed to surge back to force overtime, eventually needing two extra periods to win the game. Along with the No. 1 ranking the next day came some bad news. Illinois’ catalyst, Gill, had broken a bone in his foot and would miss the next 12 games. Hurt by the loss of Gill, Illinois lost three of the next four games and its No. 1 ranking. The Illini rallied to finish second in the Big Ten with a 14-4 record and with Gill back in the lineup, the Illini were awarded a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. After rolling to victories over McNeese State and Ball State at the Hoosier Dome, a <b>powerpacked</b> regional in Minneapolis with Missouri, Louisville and Syracuse, stood in the way of Illinois’ trip to the Final Four.Louisville fell victim to Illinois, losing 83-69, which set up a regional final matchup with Syracuse. The Fighting Illini held off Syracuse to advance to the Final Four in Seattle where Illinois faced Michigan, a team ithad beaten twice already in conference play, in the national semifinals. Michigan was inspired by the firing of their coach prior to the tournament, and won a game that contained 33 lead changes.
