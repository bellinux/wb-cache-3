European container port system is not a homogenous set of ports. It is established with a several big ports (Rotterdam, Hamburg, Antwerpen…) and a large number of medium and small sized ports. In this <b>port</b> <b>category</b> are also the North Adriatic ports (NA) and in this paper we analysed the container flows and the throughput made in this ports. In paper we present {{the state of the art}} in the North Adriatic ports regarding the container throughput, market share and container market characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to (1) to {{investigate}} {{what are the}} main factors for evaluation of port competitiveness through an analysis of previous literature review; (2) to compare port competitiveness among a sample of ports in Korea and China using TOPSIS; (3) to determine ways to improve port competitiveness in Korea and particularly for Busan port. After selecting the related criteria on port competitiveness for the analysis, the main relevant criteria are divided into three major categories: port throughput, physical and financial criteria in Korean and Chinese ports. The empirical results indicate that Shanghai, Shenzhen and Busan port are the first three competitive ports. Shanghai port ranked near the top port in this analysis, it ranked fist port in port throughput and <b>port</b> financial <b>category</b> (ranked third <b>port</b> in <b>port</b> physical <b>category),</b> Shenzhen <b>port</b> ranked second port in port physical and <b>port</b> financial <b>category</b> (ranked third <b>port</b> in <b>port</b> throughput <b>category),</b> Busan <b>port</b> ranked first port in <b>port</b> physical <b>category,</b> and Ningbo <b>port</b> ranked third port in port throughput and <b>port</b> financial <b>category</b> in this analysis. The finding to the study suggests that the port competitiveness ranking {{is similar to the}} current throughput ranking to the main container ports taken into account in the sample...|$|R

It was also awarded a {{second place in the}} top 10 terminals in EMEA and third in the top 10 worldwide <b>ports</b> <b>category.</b> Gulftainer's KCT was the first port of call in the Middle East for CMA CGM's Marco Polo - at the time, the world's largest container ship - on its maiden voyage across the Persian Gulf.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} is to identify the factors affecting shipping companies' port choice based on a survey {{to a sample of}} shipping companies. Six factors were considered relatively important: local cargo volume; terminal handling charge; berth availability; port location; transshipment volume and feeder network. Exploratory factor and confirmatory factor analyses identified five <b>port</b> choice <b>categories,</b> i. e. advancement/convenience of port; physical/operational ability of port; operational condition of shipping lines; marketability; and port charge. A comparison between the main trunk and feeder service providers indicated that the former face more intense competition than the latter. Moreover, the main haul shipping lines are more sensitive to port cost factors. Shipping lines Trunk liners Feeder liners Port choice...|$|R
30|$|Singapore has {{significantly}} high performances for criteria in the <b>port</b> traffic <b>category,</b> specifically, “frequency of ship visits” and “number of services calling at port,” as reflected by its almost 18, 000 vessel arrivals in 2016 and its connections in maritime networks with 600 ports globally. Other hub ports have comparatively lower connectivity levels than Singapore has. Singapore performs {{significantly better than}} Colombo and Tanjung Pelepas, especially for operational criteria such as “port infrastructure,” “port superstructure,” “IT and advanced technology,” and “logistics facilities,” as Singapore has over 200 quay cranes, more than 60 container berths, and almost 20, 000  m of quay length, whereas Colombo and Tanjung Pelepas have fewer than 60 quay cranes, fewer than 15 container berths, and less than 6000  m of quay length. Moreover, Singapore has over 40 million TEU capacity, whereas Tanjung Pelepas has only 10.5 million TEU capacity.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{integrated}} structural and behavioral model of Reo connectors and Petri nets, allowing a direct {{comparison of the}} two concurrency models. For this purpose, we introduce a notion of connectors which consist {{of a number of}} interconnected, user-defined primitives with fixed behavior. While the structure of connectors resembles hypergraphs, their semantics is given in terms of so-called port automata. We define both models in a categorical setting where composition operations can be elegantly defined and integrated. Specifically, we formalize structural gluings of connectors as pushouts, and joins of port automata as pullbacks. We then define a semantical functor from the connector to the <b>port</b> automata <b>category</b> which preserves this composition. We further show how to encode Reo connectors and Petri nets into this model and indicate applications to dynamic reconfigurations modeled using double pushout graph transformation. ...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, a Strategic {{positioning}} analysis (SPA) {{is developed}} as a specific analytical approach consisting of a product portfolio analysis, a shift-share analysis and a diversification analysis. The SPA describes the performance of <b>ports</b> and traffic <b>categories</b> within <b>ports</b> in terms of market share, growth rate, diversification and value added. The SPA needs to be used {{taking into account the}} port's position with regard to value-added created by the different traffic categories. By using this integrative instrument, indications on the overall strategic position of ports are provided and will benefit strategy formulation and decision-making on port development. ...|$|R
30|$|In our {{research}} comparable time series data are used, regarding the supplied transportation {{work of the}} three <b>ports</b> per main <b>category</b> (containers, conventional cargo, bulk cargo, passenger traffic, cars), based on the official statistics provided by the respective Ports Organizations [11, 19, 20]. Because of the limited data and the ambiguous quality of {{them as well as}} the relative lack of complete homogeneity of the transport task categories, an attempt was made to group the ports under these common transport <b>categories,</b> permitting combined <b>port’s</b> analysis, {{in the second part of}} the following section. The time investigation considered covers the years 2002 – 2010. In particular, consider the following types of transport by main port: 1. Containers (Piraeus, Thessaloniki), 2. Cars (Piraeus, Patra), 3. Conventional load (Piraeus, Thessaloniki), 4. Bulk (Piraeus, Thessaloniki), 5. Passengers (Piraeus, Thessaloniki, Patra).|$|R
40|$|The {{duration}} of the aging process {{in the production of}} Port has a fundamental role in determining the quality of the finished product. During long-term barrel aging, a number of specific compounds accumulate progressively. One such compound is Sotolon, (3 -hydroxy- 4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 (5 H) -furanone) which imparts a typical aroma (1) which thus increases in intensity with age, usually described as “madeirised ” or “rancio”. It {{is important to note that}} the barrel aged <b>port</b> wine quality <b>category</b> is attributed by the “Instituto do Vinho do Porto ” (IVP) largely based on the sensorial properties. Hence the aim of this work was to: (i) evaluated the impact of Sotolon on the “perceived age ” of Port wine; (ii) determining among some technological parameters; temperature; dissolved oxygen; pH and free SO 2 content; which has the greatest effect on the rate of Sotolon formation (iii) determine the kinetic of Sotolon formation as a function of time and temperature, for different regimes of dissolved oxygen...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} 13 major ports of India in respect of key operational performance indicators. Following rapid economic growth India's share in international trade is escalating. This puts increased pressure on these ports, which handle {{a substantial portion of}} the trade to perform with optimal efficiency. The study presents a systematic analysis of different performance indicators for a ten-year time period (2003 to 2013) using a variety of statistical methods and evaluates status of each <b>port</b> in different <b>categories</b> of performance. This will enable the ports to gauge their own effectiveness and appraise reasons for their shortcomings. In this context, the work further develops an integrated composite performance index by relegating comparative weightages to different indicators, to assess the relative overall performance of different ports. The study underlines the need of such estimates to adjudge the consistency of performance, internal and across ports to enable planning and development of measures for enhanced performance. performance indicators; composite performance index; CPI; standardised composite performance index; SCPI; port grouping; statistical analysis; India...|$|R
