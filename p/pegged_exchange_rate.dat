50|$|A fixed {{exchange}} rate, sometimes called a <b>pegged</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> {{is a type}} of exchange rate regime where a currency's value is fixed against either the value of another single currency, to a basket of other currencies, or to another measure of value, such as gold.|$|E

For instance, by using reflationary tools to set the economy rolling (by decreasing taxes and injecting {{more money in the}} market), the government risks running into a trade deficit. This might occur as the purchasing power of a common household increases along with inflation, thus making imports relatively cheaper.|$|E

50|$|In 2003 Barry Eichengreen {{laid out}} a credit boom theory as a cycle in which loans {{increase}} as the economy expands, particularly where regulation is weak, and through these loans money supply increases. Inflation remains low, however, because of either a <b>pegged</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> or a supply shock, and thus the central bank does not tighten credit and money. Increasingly speculative loans are made as diminishing returns lead to reduced yields. Eventually inflation begins or the economy slows, and when asset prices decline, a bubble is pricked which encourages a macroeconomic bust.|$|E

When the bubble finally burst in late 1982, Chile slid into a severe recession that lasted more than two years.|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} {{the benefits and}} costs of floating a currency, {{we need to make}} a simple comparison between a floating exchange rate and a fixed (or <b>pegged)</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> A floating exchange rate refers to the situation when the currency's value is allowed to fluctuate according to the foreign exchange market. The value of this currency is determined by the supply and demand shocks in the market of the currency (foreign exchange market). Most of the countries adopting the free, floating exchange rate regimes (floaters) are developed small open economies, such as Canada, Australia, Sweden.|$|E

This paper examines the effects of money-supply changes on <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> interest rates, and production in an optimizing two-country model in which some {{sectors of the economy}} have predetermined nominal prices in the short run and other sectors have flexible prices. Money-supply shocks have liquidity effects both within and across countries and induce a cross-country real-interest differential.

40|$|Defending a government’s exchange-rate {{commitment}} with active interest rate {{policy is not}} an option in the Krugman-Flood-Garber (KFG) model of speculative attacks. In that model, the interest rate is the passive reflection of currency-depreciation expectations. In this paper we show how to adapt the KFG model to allow for an interest rate defense. It is shown that increasing the domestic-currency interest rate makes domestic assets more attractive according to an asset substitution effect, but weakens the domestic currency by increasing the government’s fiscal liabilities. As a result, raising the interest rate hastens the speculative attack when speculation is motivated by underlying fiscal fragility. <b>Exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes;exchange rate, bonds, domestic-currency, interest rate policy, international reserves, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> nominal interest rate, currency crises, shadow <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign bonds, currency crisis, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> government bonds, domestic bonds, foreign <b>exchange,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> currency risk, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>peg,</b> nominal bonds, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>peg,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> floats, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> currency <b>pegs,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciations, derivative, foreign exchange market, bond, <b>exchange</b> reserves, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, domestic bond, bond market, domestic government bonds, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, foreign <b>exchange</b> reserves...|$|R

50|$|Instead of blindly {{adhering}} to {{fixed exchange rate}} until running out of its foreign reserve, in the self-fulfilling model the government will abandon <b>pegged</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> when it is optimal. The possible benefits from maintaining fixed exchange rate include the following: facilitating international trade and international investment, using fixed exchange rate as nominal anchor to prevent inflation, gaining good reputation of policy consistency. Meanwhile, the government usually needs to raise domestic short-term interest rate to prevent speculative attack, and the associated cost from raising interest rate includes higher deficit pressure, harming financial stability and higher unemployment rate and economic recession consequently. Therefore, conflicts arise between the government’s incentives, or between internal balance and external balance. If people believe that the currency will depreciate in the future, by uncovered interest parity, the short-term interest rate will rise as a result, which makes defending fixed exchange rate more costly. When the cost is sufficiently high, fixed exchange rate is abandoned and currency crisis happens.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of financial fragility {{of the international system}} is the connection to exchange rate regimes. Barry Eichengreen and Ricardo Hausmann describe three views on the connection between exchange rate regimes and financial fragility. One view relates to the moral hazard created by the belief of market participants that governments will provide bailouts {{in the event of a}} crisis. A <b>pegged</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is a form of implicit guarantee, and leads market participants to expect such bailouts. A second view is that, due to lack of confidence in a country's currency, borrowers in that country seeking financing will not be able to borrow long-term, or borrow from international lenders at all, in that country's own currency. Yet often the returns of the borrower's project will be in the domestic currency. This is a source of financial fragility, because a drop in the exchange rate can cause a debt crisis, as debt denominated in foreign currency becomes much more expensive. A third view holds that the fundamental cause of international financial fragility is a lack of institutions to enforce contracts between parties. This lack of strong contracts makes lenders suspicious of borrowers, and can prompt a crisis should lenders begin to suspect that borrowers will not repay.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concentrated}} on the comparative macroeconomic analysis of the differences stemming from {{the extent to which}} the institutional framework of the currency board arrangement is implemented in the legal and regulatory systems in the different countries. The main objective of taking into consideration and examining the currency board institutional arrangements is to distinguish between the impact that currency board countries and countries with <b>pegged</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> have on different macroeconomic indicators. During the analysis of these two extreme representatives of the fixed exchange rate mechanism, a third group of countries naturally emerges, which consists of countries acting like currency boards but without official, legal implementation of this arrangement. Once the distinction among all 22 countries taken into consideration had been made, the main scope of the analysis concentrates on the econometric estimation of the currency boards' effects over inflation, nominal and real interest rates and economic growth in countries under currency board and all other <b>pegged</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> economies. The main hypothesis to be tested is whether the implementation of currency board arrangement results in lower inflation, lower nominal and real interest rates and better economic growth. In the course of carrying out a thorough empirical research, the hypothesis turns out to be true as the currency board countries exhibit almost 3 % lower annual inflation differential when putting them against the other <b>pegged</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, and 1 % point advantage over the countries similar to currency boards. On average, countries with currency boards showed higher economic growth, fact that can be even surprising taking into consideration the inabilities of the monetary authorities to intervene heavily on the market and neutralise the negative effects of various external shocks. comparative macroeconomic analyses, currency board, <b>pegged</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E
