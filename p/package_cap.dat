40|$|A generic wafer-level {{packaging}} technology for high-performance MEMS devices, operating under harsh external conditions is developed. This technology not only provides physical {{protection from the}} surroundings, but also provides thermal and mechanical isolation to enhance device performance. The wafer-level encapsulation and generic assembly approach accommodate {{a wide range of}} MEMS devices with minimal process lead-time and manufacturing cost. To realize this environment-resistant package, thermal isolation, mechanical isolation, generic device transfer/integration, wafer-level vacuum packaging, and feedthroughs have been developed. The environment-resistant package consists of two substrates: a platform substrate providing thermal and mechanical isolation, and a <b>package</b> <b>cap</b> wafer providing vacuum encapsulation. Thermal stabilization is provided by oven-controlling the device at a temperature higher than the maximum environment temperature utilizing a heater and a temperature sensor located on the platform or the MEMS device. The heated structure is thermally isolated from the environment by isolation suspensions, anti-radiation shield, and vacuum encapsulation to minimize heat loss. The isolation suspensions are designed with high thermal resistance for minimal heat loss, sufficient stiffness for mechanical support, and flexibility for rejecting environmental vibrations. The <b>package</b> <b>cap</b> seals the MEMS device in vacuum. Vertical feedthroughs for a signal delivery are formed on the platform substrate or the cap wafer. These vertical feedthroughs save area and allow direct attachment to circuit boards. Shock absorption layers, and a getter layer for achieving and maintaining high vacuum are deposited on the inside wall of the package. Performance is evaluated by packaging Pirani gauges and mode-matched tuning fork gyroscopes. The package size is 1. 2 × 1. 2 × 0. 17 mm 3, and the packaged device size is 4. 5 × 4. 5 × 0. 5 mm 3. The package has maintained vacuum pressure of ~ 6 mTorr for ~ 1 year. A packaged gyroscope shows a high-Q mode-matched operation (Q~ 65, 000) at a constant temperature of − 5 °C. Allan variance analysis displays an estimated angle random walk (ARW) of 0. 012 °/√hr and a bias instability value of 0. 55 °/hr at a constant − 5 °C. Drive frequency stability of 0. 22 ppm/°C is obtained using a compensated oven-control approach. Low power consumption of 33 mW for oven-control at 80 °C is demonstrated when the environment temperature is − 30 °C. The temperature control accuracy is ± 0. 2 °C...|$|E

The cost-effectiveness of each intervention was modelled for the 2010 Australia population using a multi-state life table Markov model with a lifetime time horizon. Long-term health outcomes were modelled from calculated changes in body mass index to their impact on Health-Adjusted Life Years (HALYs). Intervention costs were estimated from a limited societal perspective. Cost and health outcomes were discounted at 3 %. Total intervention costs estimated in AUD 2010 were AUD 210 million.

40|$|Legacy heavy-water {{moderator}} {{operations at}} the Savannah River Site (SRS) {{have resulted in the}} contamination of equipment pads, building slabs, and surrounding soil with tritium. At the time of discovery the tritium had impacted the shallow (< 3 -m) groundwater at the facility. While tritium was present in the groundwater, characterization efforts determined that a significant source remained in a concrete slab at the surface and within the associated vadose zone soils. To prevent continued long-term impacts to the shallow groundwater a CERCLA non-time critical removal action for these source materials was conducted to reduce the leaching of tritium from the vadose zone soils and concrete slabs. In order to minimize transportation and disposal costs, an on-site thermal treatment process was designed, tested, and implemented. The on-site treatment consisted of thermal detritiation of the concrete rubble and soil. During this process concrete rubble was heated to a temperature of 815 deg C (1, 500 deg F) resulting in the dehydration and removal of water bound tritium. During heating, tritium contaminated soil was used to provide thermal insulation during which it&#x 27;s temperature exceeded 100 deg C (212 deg F), causing drying and removal of tritium. The thermal treatment process volatiles the water bound tritium and releases it to the atmosphere. The released tritium was considered insignificant based upon Clean Air Act Compliance <b>Package</b> (<b>CAP</b> 88) analysis and did not exceed exposure thresholds. A treatability study evaluated the effectiveness of this thermal configuration and viability as a decontamination method for tritium in concrete and soil materials. Post treatment sampling confirmed the effectiveness at reducing tritium to acceptable waste site specific levels. With American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding three additional treatment cells were assembled utilizing commercial heating equipment and common construction materials. This provided a total of four units to batch treat concrete rubble and soil. Post treatment sampling verified that the activity in the treated soil and concrete met the treatment standards for each medium which allowed the treated concrete rubble and soil to be disposed of on site as backfill. During testing and operations a total of 1, 261 -m{sup 3 } (1, 650 -yd{sup 3 }) of contaminated concrete and soils were treated with an actual incurred cost of $ 3, 980, 000. This represents a unit treatment cost of $ 3, 156 /m{sup 3 } ($ 2, 412 /yd{sup 3 }).

40|$|MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) are micro machines, i. e. {{freestanding}} {{very small}} devices that can move. These devices are very fragile and {{very sensitive to}} the environment. Particles might damage them, oxidation of the MEMS changes their mass and affects their properties, changes in pressure of the environment will affect their functionality, etc. For this reason, MEMS have to be encapsulated on the wafer (before dicing into chips) in a hermetic cavity. This encapsulation or package should be such that the environment inside the cavity stays stable over the lifetime of the MEMS. However, hermetical MEMS encapsulation with long-term internal environment stability is often challenging, especially for thin film packages. Due to the very small volume (normally below 100 nL) inside the thin film packages, even very small amounts of a gas will significantly increase the pressure inside the package. Thin film packages hermeticity requirements demand for an ultra-fine leak rate below 1 × 10 - 15 mbar. l/sec. The standard He storage fine leak test used in industry, with its measurement sensitivity limited to 1 × 10 - 12 mbar. l/sec, is not sensitive enough to test such an ultra-fine leak, and a more sensitive method does not exist. For this reason, {{a lot of research}} is done on new methods that allow to measure the packaging hermeticity of MEMS thin film packages and the ultra-fine level leak rate testing. The object of this PhD is to develop a method that can measure the pressure and ultra-fine leak rate of wafer level thin film MEMS packages, and to understand the mechanisms that can contribute to any change of the atmosphere inside the SiGe MEMS thin film package through experiments with some supports by models. This includes studying of the outgassing from materials located inside the package, in-diffusion of gasses from the outside world and leakage of gasses from the interface between the package and substrate. In this thesis, we demonstrate a new systematical methodology to measure the package leakage rate and internal pressure by open/sealing the package with the focused-ion-beam (FIB). We demonstrate the methodology using the capacitance between cap and bottom of the package, using the curvature of the <b>package</b> <b>cap,</b> and using the resonance frequency of the cap. Especially the latter was shown to allow measuring the internal pressure with a very high sensitivity and to enable the measurement of an ultra-fine air leak rate below the order of 1 × 10 - 15 mbar. l/sec, highly outperforming the commonly used standard fine leak method. The methodology can be applied to various MEMS packages. As a case study, we applied the measurement method on two different real MEMS packages to test their hermeticity. It is also shown that the air leakage rate measurement can be accelerated by storing the packages in a higher pressure gas (3 bar N 2 for example). However, care has to be taken when testing the He leak rate, because He can leak in or out the package by both a leak path and by diffusion. We also report on a systematic study of the outgassing properties of typical materials used for imec’s polycrystalline silicon-germanium (poly-SiGe) -based MEMS platform with a thin film vacuum package. We studied the outgassing by the thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) method. Two different TDS techniques, atmospheric pressure ionization mass-spectrometry (APIMS) and ultra-high vacuum thermal desorption spectroscopy (UH-TDS), were used for this study. It is shown that the UH-TDS is more suitable for studying the outgassing properties of thin film materials. Table of Contents 1.

50|$|The {{perhaps best}} example is {{studies of the}} amount of oxygen in food packages. Oxygen is {{naturally}} present in most food and food packages as it is a major component in air. However, oxygen {{is also one of the}} great causes or needs for aging of biological substances, due to its source for increase of chemical and microbiological activity. Today, methods like atmosphere (MAP) and atmosphere <b>packaging</b> (<b>CAP)</b> are implemented to reduce and control the oxygen content in food packages to prolong life and ensure safe food. To assure the effectiveness of these methods it is important to regularly measure the concentration of oxygen (and other gases) inside these packages. GASMAS provides the possibility of doing this non-intrusively, without destroying any food or packages. The two main advantages of measuring the gas-composition in packages without perforation is that no food is wasted in the controlling process and that the same package can be controlled repeatedly during an extended time period to monitor any time-dependence of the gas composition. The studies can be used to guarantee the tightness of packages but also to study food deterioration processes.|$|R

The array, which is {{to be used as a}} spatial light modulator (SLM) for optical maskless lithography, consists of 8 mu m x 8 mu m pixels, which can be individually addressed by an analog voltage to enable accurate tilt angle modulation. Due to very stringent requirements on mounted-die flatness (< 0. 01 mrad), the first level packaging of SLM die is done using specially designed SiC holders. To avoid trapped particles between the die and holder, which would jeopardize the flatness spec, special backside cleaning of the dies (less than or equal to one 0. 8 -mu m particle/cm(2)) is needed before mounting the SLM die on the holder. To enable this backside cleaning and to avoid front-side particles during dicing, handling, and wire bonding, a temporary wafer-or zero-level <b>packaging</b> <b>cap,</b> which can be placed and removed at room temperature, was developed.

Currently, there is no two-step autoinjector of low-dose sumatriptan available {{on the market for}} acute migraine treatment. To fulfill this need, a fully assembled, single-dose, subcutaneous autoinjector (sumatriptan 3 mg; product-code DFN- 11) was developed. The device allows for injection with a simple two-step, push-to-inject process and provides feedback of the injection activation, progress, and completion. Objective: To determine if DFN- 11 autoinjector can be used correctly and safely by migraine patients. Methods and participants: A human factors validation study was conducted with 45 migraine patients (30 oral-only medications users; 15 injectable sumatriptan users) who performed one unaided simulated injection. Two days prior, half the oral participants were briefly trained. All others were only given the device to inspect and written instructions to review. No injections were performed during the initial session. All participants received written instructions at the injection session. Results: All participants (45 / 45; 100 %) performed the injection without any errors. Objective measures included device removal from <b>packaging,</b> <b>cap</b> removal, expiration date check, ­inspection of fluid in window, identification of allowable injection site, proper device positioning, dose confirmation, and device disposal. All participants (45 / 45; 100 %) reported no difficulty administering the injection and no concerns about using the autoinjector during a severe migraine onset. Conclusion: The results showed that the DFN- 11 autoinjector can be used with safe handling without patterns of confusion, failures, high-risk errors, wet injections, or patient safety risks.

The services provided by C4ISR aircraft include real-time data, voice, video, bulk data transfer, and interactive data.|$|R
40|$|Monitoring and surveillance, on {{and around}} the Nevada Test Site, (NTS) by US Department of Energy (DOE) {{contractors}} and NTS user organizations during 1997, indicated that operations on the NTS were conducted in compliance with applicable DOE, state, and federal regulations and guidelines. All discharges of radioactive liquids remained onsite in containment ponds, {{and there was no}} indication of potential migration of radioactivity to the offsite area through groundwater. Surveillance around the NTS indicated that airborne radioactivity from diffusion, evaporation of liquid effluents, or resuspension of soil was not detectable offsite, and exposure above existing background to members of the offsite population was not measured by the offsite monitoring program. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency`s (EPA`s) Clean Air <b>Package</b> 1988 (<b>CAP</b> 88) -PC model and NTS radionuclide emissions and environmental monitoring data, the calculated effective dose equivalent (EDE) to the maximally exposed individual offsite would have been 0. 089 mrem. Hazardous wastes were shipped offsite to approved disposal facilities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of wafer bow of Si carrier wafer to achieve high-yield BCB cap {{transfer}} in wafer-scale <b>packaging.</b> BCB <b>caps</b> are built-up on Si carrier wafer and then they are bonded and transferred to a target wafer. The height of BCB cap is 25 lm and the thickness of Si carrier wafer is 380 lm. Through several experiments, {{it is found that}} BCB cap transfer rate is mainly dependent on wafer bow of Si carrier wafer rather than that of the target wafer due to relatively large thickness of BCB caps. Therefore, Si carrier wafer bow with the BCB layers is investigated as a function of temperature. It is to figure out the effect of the wafer bow at certain temperature and applying pressure on BCB cap transfer rate. Through the study, it is found that zero wafer bow is very important for the cap transfer. Hence, aluminum metal layer is introduced to compensate the existing wafer bow of the Si carrier wafer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPackaging {{design is}} a key factor {{on the use of}} the products. For packagings that require the {{application}} of biomechanical forces, some features may favor or hinder the user's ability to open them. In soft drink PET <b>packaging,</b> the <b>cap</b> features play an important role in the application of forces and perception of the activity. The aim of this study is to evaluate two models of PET bottle caps widely used in Brazil. The study variables are the torque force exertion and thermal images of the hands of the subjects before and after the attempts of opening. This study has an exploratory and experimental character and included 16 subjects of both genders. The materials include one single PET packaging model properly adapted for the purpose of the study; two cap models with different characteristics; a torque transducer; and a digital thermograph. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and tests for mean comparisons. The results point out that the cap design may have influenced the opening forces applied, but not the temperatures measured at the evaluated points on the subject's hands...|$|R
40|$|Stratigraphic {{interpretations and}} {{infrared}} stimulated luminescence (IRSL) ages document the glacial {{history of the}} Middle Rakaia Gorge section of the Rakaia Valley, Canterbury, New Zealand, {{during the last two}} glacial cycles. Sheets of glaciolacustrine sediments several tens of metres in thickness can be traced at least 10 km upstream of the Rakaia Gorge. The stratigraphic <b>package</b> is <b>capped</b> by outwash gravels associated with the last glacial maximum (LGM) advances. The dominant inferred sedimentary environments in the sequence are 1) pro-glacial and paraglacial lake beds, 2) sub-aqueous ice-contact fans, 3) sub-aqueous mass flow deposits 4) supraglacial dump material and 5) outwash gravels. Syndepositional deformation, associated with glacitectonic deformation, is common. The stratigraphy records glacier margin oscillations, including six significant advances. These occurred in early MIS 6, mid-MIS 6, MIS 5 b (c 100 - 90 ka), MIS 5 a/ 4 (c 80 ka), mid-MIS 3 (c 48 ka), and late MIS 3 (c 40 ka). All the post-MIS 6 advances can be corroborated from other sites in New Zealand and the timings appear to coincide with both Southern Hemisphere insolation minima and maxima, suggesting variable combinations of climatic forcing in New Zealand glaciation.

50|$|The {{components}} {{discussed in}} this article are based on RF MEMS switches, switched capacitors and varactors. These components can be used instead of FET and HEMT switches (FET and HEMT transistors in common gate configuration), and PIN diodes. RF MEMS switches, switched capacitors and varactors are classified by actuation method (electrostatic, electrothermal, magnetostatic, piezoelectric), by axis of deflection (lateral, vertical), by circuit configuration (series, shunt), by clamp configuration (cantilever, fixed-fixed beam), or by contact interface (capacitive, ohmic). Electrostatically-actuated RF MEMS components offer low insertion loss and high isolation, linearity, power handling and Q factor, do not consume power, but require a high control voltage and hermetic single-chip <b>packaging</b> (thin film <b>capping,</b> LCP or LTCC packaging) or wafer-level packaging (anodic or glass frit wafer bonding).|$|R
