5|$|Gollob {{was born}} on 16 June 1912 in Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary. His father, Heinrich Gollob, worked as an {{academic}} painter. His mother, Johanna (née Reininghaus), {{was the daughter of}} Zoe von Karajan, a distant relative of Herbert von Karajan and wife of Carl Reininghaus. Gollob was the first of five children. Both his parents had studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where they mutually befriended Gordon Mallet McCouch, an American artist of Scottish descent. McCouch was his godfather and the namesake for his first and middle names, Gordon Mac. In his youth, Gollob already wanted to become an engineer and pilot. In 1930, as a student at an Oberrealschule, a secondary school, he built his first <b>primary</b> <b>glider</b> in Tirol, experimenting with it at the old airfield at Innsbruck. He also completed his A- and B-license to fly glider aircraft and became an instructor as well as a construction and airframe inspector.|$|E

50|$|Like other <b>primary</b> <b>gliders,</b> the Reynard R.4 Primary was a simple, wooden, robust design, not {{intended}} for high performance.|$|R
50|$|The Bonomi BS.11 Mikano and BS.12 Roma were <b>primary</b> <b>gliders</b> {{designed}} and built in Italy in the 1930s. Only about six were produced.|$|R
50|$|Constructed of wood, metal {{cables and}} cloth, <b>primary</b> <b>gliders</b> were very light {{and easy to}} fly. They {{generally}} had no cockpit and no instruments.|$|R
25|$|The Jongblood Primary is an American single-seat, high-wing, strut-braced <b>primary</b> <b>glider</b> {{designed}} by Mike Jongblood of southern California and first flown in 1967. The aircraft {{is unusual in}} that primary gliders went out of fashion in the 1930s and few have been built since.|$|E
25|$|After {{its first}} flight in 1928 Schleicher used the Poppenhausen to {{introduce}} passengers to soaring flight. It then {{appeared in the}} company catalogue, significantly modified for production; it could be fitted with dual controls and used as an advanced trainer. In the early 1930s {{the idea that a}} two-seater, though over twice the price of a single seat <b>primary</b> <b>glider</b> like the Zögling, could still train pilots from the beginning sufficiently faster to be economically competitive, and safer, lay in the future.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{versions}} of <b>primary</b> <b>gliders</b> are still built, but, {{while they are}} much like the originals in appearance, they are usually constructed with composites and safety enhancements.|$|R
50|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>gliders</b> are a {{category}} of aircraft that enjoyed worldwide popularity during the 1920s and 1930s as people strove for simple and inexpensive ways to learn to fly.|$|R
25|$|The Vándor (Wanderer) was a 1930s Hungarian {{single seat}} glider {{intended}} to ready {{students who had}} qualified on <b>primary</b> <b>gliders</b> for contemporary soaring and aerobatic aircraft. Only one was built.|$|R
2500|$|The Schneider DFS 108-14 SG-38 Schulgleiter (...) is a German high-wing, cable-braced, single-seat <b>primary</b> <b>glider</b> {{that was}} {{designed}} by Schneider, Rehberg and Hofmann at Edmund Schneider's factory at Grunau in 1938, hence the designation. It was produced by several builders, including Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (DFS).|$|E
2500|$|The BS.17 was {{intended}} to complement the earlier and successful BS.16 <b>primary</b> <b>glider</b> by providing the enhanced performance required to take new pilots to qualifications beyond the A certificate. [...] It used the wings and central support structure of the BS.16 and shared many smaller parts and fittings, but had a new, conventional fuselage {{in place of the}} primary's platform, together with different wing struts and empennage.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II {{civilian}} flying schools, under government contract, {{provided a}} considerable {{part of the}} flying training effort undertaken by the United States Army Air Forces. [...] In 1941 the Air Corps directed Flying Training Command to establish a glider training program. Contract schools opened soon after. [...] Students learned to perform maintenance and, in an emergency, to rebuild wrecked gliders. [...] This was a relatively simple operation, considering that the <b>primary</b> <b>glider</b> consisted of {{little more than a}} shell, equipped with radio, wheels, and brakes.|$|E
50|$|The ESG Grunau 9, later {{known as}} the ESG 29 and post-1933 as the DFS 108-10, {{was one of the}} first <b>primary</b> <b>gliders,</b> built in Germany from the late 1920s. It was widely sold.|$|R

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} from wood {{and covered in}} doped aircraft fabric covering. The glider has a detachable pod to cover the pilot or can be flown open cockpit. It has a constant chord wing with a [...] chord and a [...] span. The wing features dual parallel struts and jury struts, but has no spoilers or other glidepath control devices. The tailplane is also strut-braced. Unlike most earlier <b>primary</b> <b>glider</b> designs that land on a fixed skid, this aircraft has a fixed monowheel.|$|E
2500|$|The Harakka [...] ("European magpie") was a <b>primary</b> <b>glider</b> {{produced}} for pilot training in Finland in the 1940s. Its design {{was typical of}} this class of aircraft, a [...] "keel" [...] with a pilot's seat suspended beneath a high, strut-braced monoplane wing, and carrying a conventional empennage {{at the end of}} an open framework. First flown in February 1945, the type was built from plans by Finnish gliding clubs and soon replaced earlier primary gliders such as the Grunau 9, becoming a standard piece of equipment in the clubs.|$|E
2500|$|The Bug first flew in February 1999. The {{aircraft}} {{was designed to}} be an inexpensive and easy to fly three axis controlled aircraft similar to a <b>primary</b> <b>glider,</b> although the designer terms it an airchair. The Bug has an empty weight of under [...] and so qualifies to be operated under the United States FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles regulations. The aircraft is made available as technical drawings, not plans, to allow potential builders to study them. Sandlin makes his computer assisted design drawings available free of charge as downloads in [...]dxf, [...]dwf and [...]gif formats and has explicitly released them to the public domain. The Bug 4 drawings comprise 66 sheets. The designer considers his aviation activities a hobby only.|$|E
50|$|No. 614 VGS is {{the natural}} descendent of 3 Gliding Schools, No's: 142, 146, and 147. These schools where formed {{in the very early}} days of Air Training Corps gliding and have seen the {{transition}} from single-seater <b>Primary</b> <b>gliders</b> to two-seater soaring.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>primary</b> <b>gliders</b> of the 1930s, the Dickson Primary was aerodynamically unambitious, {{with its}} {{emphasis}} on low cost and simplicity. It was a wooden high wing aircraft, carrying the pilot on an open seat with a largely open, flat truss girder fuselage behind.|$|R
50|$|The IS-3 ABC {{series was}} in use at Polish state gliding clubs up to 1961, when the dual {{training}} syllabus was finally introduced. Many of the IS-3 <b>primary</b> <b>gliders</b> were dispersed {{to schools and}} clubs for use as training aids, some of which survive as exhibits in museums today.|$|R
2500|$|While {{members of}} the family varied in detail, they shared the same basic design, and parts were {{interchangeable}} between them. The design featured a typical <b>primary</b> <b>glider</b> layout with a conventional empennage carried {{at the end of a}} long boom in place of a conventional fuselage. The boom could be folded sideways for storage. The monoplane wing was carried high on a pylon above this [...] "keel" [...] and was further braced to it with two struts on either side. The pilot sat in front of the wing, and was enclosed in a simple U-shaped wooden fairing that was removed by sliding it forward to allow him or her to enter and leave the aircraft. The undercarriage consisted of a single skid underneath the [...] "keel", but this could also be fitted with small wooden wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The Goat first flew on 1 February 2003. The {{aircraft}} {{was designed as}} a monoplane development of the biplane Bug. Like the Bug it is intended to be an inexpensive and easy to fly three axis controlled aircraft similar to a <b>primary</b> <b>glider,</b> although the designer terms it an airchair. The Goat has an empty weight of under [...] and so qualifies to be flown under the United States FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles regulations and does not require registration or a pilot license. The aircraft is made available as technical drawings, not plans, to allow potential builders to study them. Sandlin makes his computer assisted design drawings available free of charge as downloads in [...]dxf, [...]dwf and [...]gif formats and has explicitly released them to the public domain. The Goat 1 drawings consist of 71 sheets. The designer considers his aviation activities a hobby only.|$|E

The plans are now sold by Sands' son, Ron Sands Jr.|$|E
50|$|Using {{the sole}} {{remaining}} W.W.S.1 Salamandra {{as a starting}} point, the IS-3 ABC emerged looking similar to most <b>primary</b> <b>gliders,</b> with a high set rectangular low aspect ratio wing, wire-braced to an open structure wire-braced fuselage, which did nothing more than connect the seat, skid and tail unit to the wings.|$|R
2500|$|The Grunau 9 was a German {{single seat}} trainer glider, {{one of the}} first of a group that later became known as <b>primary</b> <b>gliders.</b> [...] It was {{developed}} by Edmund Schneider from Alexander Lippisch's Djävlar Anamma ( [...] , [...] ) via the Espenlaub primary. The Grunau 9 was produced in numbers and was sold widely.|$|R
50|$|Erik Addyman {{designed}} and built the single-seat Zephyr, his first design, in 1933. It {{was intended as a}} light wind sailplane, combining a wing of modest aspect ratio with a nacelle cockpit and an open truss girder fuselage of the kind more common on <b>primary</b> <b>gliders.</b> It was a wooden-structured, largely fabric-covered aircraft.|$|R

50|$|An {{original}} WACO <b>primary</b> <b>glider</b> is in {{the collection}} of the National Air and Space Museum.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>gliders</b> were {{generally}} launched by bungee cord, whereby a rubber rope was {{arranged in a}} [...] "V" [...] with the glider at the apex. The ends of the rope were pulled by hand to launch the glider from a slope. Primaries were also launched by auto-tow and auto-bungee tow. Ramp launching from cliffs was also attempted successfully.|$|R
50|$|The glider {{was built}} {{with a wooden}} {{structure}} and steel fittings. The wings and tail surfaces were covered in fabric. Typical of the <b>primary</b> <b>gliders</b> of its day, the fuselage was open and featured an open seat with stick and rudder three-axis controls. The aircraft {{was designed to be}} bungee launched with an elastic shock cord and had a single skid for landing gear.|$|R
25|$|The PIK-5 was a {{training}} glider produced in Finland in the 1940s and 1950s, equipping the country's gliding clubs with an aircraft greater in performance than <b>primary</b> <b>gliders</b> {{but less than}} competition sailplanes. The aircraft had a pod-and-boom configuration, with a high, strut-braced monoplane wing and a cruciform tail carried {{at the end of}} a tailboom that extended from a position high on the aft end of the pod.|$|R
