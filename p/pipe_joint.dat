40|$|Abstract: <b>Pipe</b> <b>joints</b> {{have been}} widely {{utilized}} in industrial plants, where dynamic load of vibration is considerably harmful for sealing performance. However, there is a lock of design codes and experimental procedures developed for vibration testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper proposes an experimental setup for testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints,</b> which use metal gaskets, in vibratory conditions. Also, a flexible piezoelectric film sensor is introduced into this test rig for monitoring of stress in pipes. With the proposed test rig, vibration testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints</b> can be conducted, therefore further investigations such as fatigue analysis of the contact surfaces, and computational analysis of metal gaskets and seal devices are readily available.

50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of gases or liquids under pressure have a tapered thread that is slightly conical (in contrast to the parallel sided cylindrical section commonly found on bolts and leadscrews).

50|$|Steel pipe is {{sometimes}} joined using threaded connections, where tapered threads (see National Pipe Thread) are {{cut into the}} end of the tubing segment, sealant is applied in the form of thread sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape), and it is then threaded into a corresponding threaded fitting using two pipe wrenches. Beyond domestic or light commercial settings, steel pipe is often joined by welding, or by use of mechanical couplings made by companies such as Victaulic or Anvil International (formerly Grinnell) that hold the <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> together via a groove pressed or cut (a rarely used older practice), into the ends of the pipes.|$|E

Welding parameters including voltage, current and heat input are varied to find the optimized set to control stresses and deformations.

5000|$|Once {{the free}} {{point of a}} stuck pipe string is determined, the stringshot {{back-off}} service {{can be used to}} remove the free portion from the well.

The CCL is used to help position the string shot at the predetermined <b>pipe</b> <b>joint,</b> and then the string shot is detonated. [...] The explosion produces a similar effect as an intense hammer blow and allows the joint to be unscrewed at the proper connection. Several factors such as pipe size, weight and condition, back-off depth, mud or borehole fluid weight and well temperature are carefully considered when making up the proper string-shot assembly.|$|E
50|$|A grooved fitting, {{also known}} as a grooved {{coupling}}, has four elements: grooved pipe, gasket, coupling housing, and nuts and bolts. The groove is made by cold-forming (or machining) a groove {{at the end of a}} pipe. A gasket encompassed by coupling housing is wrapped around the two pipe ends, with the coupling engaging the groove; the bolts and nuts are tightened with a socket or impact wrench. The installed coupling housing encases the gasket and engages the grooves around the pipe to create a leakproof seal in a self-restrained <b>pipe</b> <b>joint.</b> There are two types of grooved coupling; a flexible coupling allows a limited amount of angular movement, and a rigid coupling does not allow movement and may be used where joint immobility is required (similar to a flange or welded joint).|$|E
50|$|Pipes are {{commonly}} joined by welding, using threaded pipe and fittings; sealing {{the connection with}} a pipe thread compound, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Thread seal tape, oakum, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common process <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> is the butt weld. The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common pipe thread in North America is the National Pipe Thread (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version. Other pipe threads include the British standard pipe thread (BSPT), the garden hose thread (GHT), and the fire hose coupling (NST).|$|E

50|$|Trace {{evidence}} is sometimes {{an important factor}} in reconstructing the sequence of events in an accident. For example, tire burn marks on a road surface can enable vehicle speeds to be estimated, when the brakes were applied and so on. Ladder feet often leave a trace of movement of the ladder during a slipaway, and may show how the accident occurred. When a product fails for no obvious reason, SEM and Energy-dispersive X&#8209;ray spectroscopy (EDX) performed in the microscope can reveal the presence of aggressive chemicals that have left traces on the fracture or adjacent surfaces. Thus an acetal resin water <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> suddenly failed and caused substantial damages to a building in which it was situated.

5000|$|After {{moving to}} Berlin, Stam devised a steel-tubing {{cantilever}} chair, using lengths of standard gas pipe and standard <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> fittings.

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became aware of Stam's work on the chair during planning for the Weissenhof Siedlung and mentioned it to Marcel Breuer at the Bauhaus. [...] This led almost immediately to variations on the cantilevered tubular-steel chair theme by both Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer, and began an entire genre of chair design. In the late 1920s, Breuer and Stam were involved in a patent lawsuit in German courts, both claiming to be the inventor of the basic cantilever chair design principle. Stam won the lawsuit, and, since that time, specific Breuer chair designs have often been erroneously attributed to Stam. In the United States, Breuer assigned the rights to his designs to Knoll, and for that reason it is possible to find the identical chair attributed to Stam in Europe and to Breuer in the U.S.|$|E
