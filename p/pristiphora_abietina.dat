During four years this specie was monitored in Lunca Bradului Forestry Department and it has been found that there is a trend of reduceing of the infested areas and of the degree of infestation. Infested area decreased from 2. 85 % (in 2010) to 0. 39 % (in 2013) of the total area of the Forestry Department. As a result of soil surveys it was found that larval hibernating density ranged from...|$|E
40|$|Little spruce sawfly (<b>Pristiphora</b> <b>abietina)</b> pose a {{significant}} threat for {{forests of the}} Czech Republic. A better knowledge of its population trends is therefore vital for mitigating future problems in forestry. During years 1998 - 2005 and then again in 2015, field observations {{of the population of}} P. abientina were conducted in few areas of young spruce biotope in the Czech Republic. The study areas were located in Vítkov Highlands, Javorníky (Maple Mountains) and in the surrounding of five other settlements - Albrechtice, Fryčovice, Skřipov, Spy and Stanovice. The catchment of P. abientina was performed from April till the of July by Malaise traps. Deployed Malaise traps were regularly checked, every 14 days in each study area. The field study has discovered high numbers of P. abientina in all study locations, as well as a high generic diversity. The flight activity of P. abientina was observed as well. This was demonstrated in the study area of Spy, where the individuals in the flight acitity were recorded from the beginning of May until the end of June. The study has further discovered a numerical superiority of females over males in the population of P. abientina. The population in 2015 exhibited a steep decline in comparison with previous years...|$|E
40|$|This {{work has}} been done for the purpose of {{creating}} a complete struggle strategy against <b>Pristiphora</b> <b>abietina</b> (Christ), which is the cause of the spoil in Artvin Savsat spruce forests in the recent years and Pyrethrum and Bacillus thuringiensis biopesticides effects has been investigated and put into practice on the P. abietina. Under laboratory conditions, Pyrethrum (Spruzit Neu) and B. thuringiensis (Dipel DF) biopesticides were administered at different doses to the larvae of P. abietina and the results were evaluated according to the One Way Analysis of Variance and Duncan Test. The most effective applications for larval applications have been determined that Dipel 100 gr / 100 lt, Dipel 300 gr / 100 lt and Dipel 500 gr / 100 lt. The Pyrethrum (Spruzit Neu) efficiency ratio was determined 71. 7 % dose of 150 ml / 100 lt, 81 % dose of 300 ml / 100 lt, 93. 2 % dose of 600 ml / 100 lt and Dipel DF was found to be 91. 5 % dose of 100 g / 100 lt, 93. 6 % dose of 300 gr / 100 lt and 98. 8 % dose of 500 gr / 100 lt, respectively. As a result, using of both biopesticides have been effective to against on larvae of P. abietina...|$|E
