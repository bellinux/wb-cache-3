25|$|Methotrexate is an {{antimetabolite}} of the antifolate type. It {{is thought}} to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the denovo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>base</b> biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.|$|E

Ordinarily, furan-side monoadducts form in a higher proportion. The furan monoadduct can absorb a second UVA photon leading to a second four-center photocycloaddition at the pyrone end of the molecule and hence the formation of a diadduct or cross-link. Pyrone monoadducts do not absorb in the UVA range and hence cannot form cross-links with further UVA irradiation.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{effort in}} photodynamical ab initio simulations of the ultrafast deactivation pathways for all five nucleobases adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil is reported. These simulations {{are based on}} a complete nonadiabatic surface-hopping approach using extended multiconfigurational wave functions. Even though all five nucleobases share the basic internal conversion mechanisms, the calculations show a distinct grouping into purine and <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>bases</b> as concerns the complexity of the photodynamics. The purine bases adenine and guanine represent the most simple photodeactivation mechanism with the dynamics leading along a diabatic pi pi* path directly and without barrier to the conical intersection seam with the ground state. In the case of the <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>bases,</b> the dynamics starts off in much flatter regions of the pi pi* energy surface due to coupling of several states. This fact prohibits a clear formation of a single reaction path. Thus, the photodynamics of the <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>bases</b> is much richer and includes also n pi* states with varying importance, depending on the actual nucleobase considered. Trapping in local minima may occur and, therefore, the deactivation time to the ground state is also much longer in these cases. Implications of these findings are discussed (i) for identifying structural possibilities where singlet/triplet transitions can occur because of sufficient retention time during the singlet dynamics and (ii) concerning the flexibility of finding other deactivation pathways in substituted pyrimidines serving as candidates for alternative nucleobases...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{backbone}} of PNA contains no charged phosphate groups, the binding between PNA/DNA strands is stronger than between DNA/DNA strands {{due to the lack}} of electrostatic repulsion. Unfortunately, this also causes it to be rather hydrophobic, which makes it difficult to deliver to body cells in solution without being flushed out of the body first. Early experiments with homopyrimidine strands (strands consisting of only one repeated <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>base)</b> have shown that the Tm ("melting" [...] temperature) of a 6-base thymine PNA/adenine DNA double helix was 31 °C in comparison to an equivalent 6-base DNA/DNA duplex that denatures at a temperature less than 10 °C. Mixed base PNA molecules are true mimics of DNA molecules in terms of base-pair recognition. PNA/PNA binding is stronger than PNA/DNA binding.|$|E
50|$|AP lyase enzymes {{catalyze}} reactions {{analogous to}} β-elimination reaction. Initially, AP hydrolyses, such as apurinic or apyrimidinic endonuclease I contain a Mg2+ active site that cleaves the DNA on the 5'-side, yielding a 5'-deoxyribosephosphate and 3'-OH. An AP site in DNA appears when the glycosylic bond {{that connects the}} purine or <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>base</b> to the deoxyribose sugar is cleaved. This reaction {{is referred to as}} depurination or depyrimidination. The sugar at the AP site is a highly unstable cyclic carboxonium ion that undergoes rapid hydrolysis to yield a diastereomeric mixture of 2-deoxy-α-D-ribose and 2-deoxy-β-D-ribose. AP lyase enzymes could be trapped on both pre-incised and unincised AP DNA by a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism of AP lyases, the β-elimination reaction, proceeds through an imine enzyme-DNA intermediate.|$|E
