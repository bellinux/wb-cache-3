5|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{many more}} Arabians came to Australia, though most {{were used to}} produce {{crossbred}} horses and left no recorded purebred descendants. The first significant imports to be <b>permanently</b> <b>recorded</b> with offspring still appearing in modern purebred Arabian pedigrees were those of James Boucaut, who in 1891 imported several Arabians from Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt's Crabbet Arabian Stud in England. Purebred Arabians were used to improve racehorses {{and some of them}} became quite famous as such; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book (for Thoroughbred racehorses). The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding calvalry horses, especially around World War I. They were part of the foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian, including the Australian Pony, the Waler and the Australian Stock Horse.|$|E

40|$|A kind {{of novel}} thermal history nanosensors were {{theoretically}} designed and experimentally demonstrated to <b>permanently</b> <b>record</b> thermal events.

50|$|Jackson's {{theory was}} that e-gold is a book entry system with account histories, making it simple to conduct an {{investigation}} to track down and identify users who had engaged in illicit activity after the fact. While the public perception was that e-gold accounts were anonymous, e-gold accounts were pseudonymous, allowing {{the creator of the}} account to use any name or label he wished to use. However, account and transaction records—even failed log-in attempts—were <b>permanently</b> <b>recorded,</b> enabling linkage of seemingly unrelated accounts secretly under unified control. The data mining this enabled, combined with inputs from independent exchange services, enabled law enforcement to identify numerous criminal users of the service.|$|E
50|$|Since stars {{apparently}} {{identical to}} the Sun can produce superflares it is natural to ask if the Sun itself can do so, {{and to try to}} find evidence that it has done in the past. Large flares are invariably accompanied by energetic particles, and these particles produce effects if they reach the earth. The Carrington event of 1859, the largest flare of which we have direct observation, produced global auroral displays extending close to the equator. Energetic particles can produce chemical changes in the atmosphere, which can be <b>permanently</b> <b>recorded</b> in the polar ice. Fast protons generate distinctive isotopes, particularly carbon-14, which can be taken up and preserved by living creatures.|$|E

5000|$|The Scientology and Dianetics {{auditing}} {{process has}} raised concerns {{from a number}} of quarters, as auditing sessions are <b>permanently</b> <b>recorded</b> in the form of handwritten notes in preclear folders, which are supposed to be kept private. Judge Paul Breckenridge, in Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong, noted that Mary Sue Hubbard (the plaintiff in that case) [...] "authored the infamous order 'GO 121669', which directed culling of supposedly confidential P.C. Preclear files/folders for the purposes of internal security". This directive was later canceled because it was not part of Scientology as written by L. Ron Hubbard. Bruce Hines has noted in an interview with Hoda Kotb that Scientology's collecting of personal and private information through auditing can possibly leave an adherent vulnerable to potential [...] "blackmail" [...] should they ever consider disaffecting from the church.
