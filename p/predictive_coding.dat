25|$|A deep <b>predictive</b> <b>coding</b> network (DPCN) is a <b>predictive</b> <b>coding</b> {{scheme that}} uses {{top-down}} information to empirically adjust the priors {{needed for a}} bottom-up inference procedure {{by means of a}} deep, locally connected, generative model. This works by extracting sparse features from time-varying observations using a linear dynamical model. Then, a pooling strategy is used to learn invariant feature representations. These units compose to form a deep architecture and are trained by greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning. The layers constitute a kind of Markov chain such that the states at any layer depend only on the preceding and succeeding layers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Packet losses over {{unreliable}} {{networks have}} a severe {{impact on the}} playback quality of many <b>predictive</b> <b>coded</b> sources such as compressed video. Prior efforts (e. g., [1]-[5] [7]-[9][11]-[13]) have developed a variety of coding methods that are resilient to packet losses. We propose a new packet-loss resilient coding approach, interleaved source coding (ISC), {{which is based on}} an optimum interleaving of <b>predictive</b> video <b>coded</b> frames transmitted over a single erasure channel. We develop a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and a corresponding dynamic programming algorithm for identifying the optimal interleaving pattern for a given channel model. This method improves the overall quality of <b>predictive</b> video <b>coded</b> stream over a lossy channel without complex modifications to standard video coders. ISC provides a viable alternative to (or it could be combined with) path-diversity based approaches, and hence, ISC eliminates (or reduces) the need for content distribution, path diversity routing, and related synchronization issues. Simulations {{of a wide range of}} video sequences over practical traces of Markov erasure channels showed significant improvements (up to 4 dB) when compared with traditional predictive video over the same channels...|$|R
