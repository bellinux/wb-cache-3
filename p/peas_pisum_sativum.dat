5000|$|A mosaic disease, {{believed}} to be BYMV, was first reported in the early 1900s infecting garden <b>peas</b> (<b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum)</b> in the Northeastern United States. [...] Today the virus is {{believed to}} be distributed worldwide.|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis has been to study of {{domestication}} traits. Identification of genes of domestication traits has a huge potencial for plant breeding. The experimental part {{has been devoted to}} the study of pod dehiscence as a domestication trait in <b>pea</b> (<b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> L.). The goal of this work has been to evaluate the expression of candidate genes of pod dehiscence in <b>pea</b> (<b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> L.). For this experiment was used JI 64 line <b>pea</b> (<b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> ssp. elatius L.) and JI 92 (Afghan cultural type of <b>pea</b> <b>Pisum</b> <b>sativum</b> ssp. sativum L.) and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) arising from reciprocal crossing.
