Map production {{in the area of the}} Alhambra is a challenge due to various factors such as the heritage value of the elements to be represented, the complex topography of the territory under study and the requirements of precision and detail exceeding the usual standards in cartography. The need for a multiscale cartography which must support both local-scale projects (up to 1 : 5000) and detailed <b>planimetric</b> <b>surveys</b> also constitutes a challenge. The methodology employed combines aerial (LiDAR, digital photogrammetry) and ground sensors (laser scanning) to ensure maximum precision while emphasizing the role of data model as a key element for ensuring the multi-scale information and its usability in projects of very different scales...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} focused on establishing a characterization of public used reinforced concrete constructions {{such as school}} units in the coastal zone of Chichiriviche and Tucacas in Venezuela’s Falcon State, exposed to highly corrosive environments and built with inadequate construction techniques. The ultimate aim was to make recommendations to regional bodies {{so that they could}} make structural interventions more precisely and assertively. The study was carried out in seven educational units, in which <b>planimetric</b> <b>surveys</b> were carried out, the collection of fault symptoms, tests in some structural members and finally a general evaluation of damages that allowed identifying their durability and particular recommendations for each school building. As a result, these units of different construction ages were in a better state of conservation, when compared directly to the sample evaluated in 2006 in private multifamily buildings, which were even younger than this sample. It was recommended for all cases that they apply a programmed and technical continuous maintenance system, which goes beyond the systems of paints whose substrate is not properly prepared, resulting in a process of superficial repair and aesthetic ineffective...|$|R

40|$|Salt marsh tidal {{channels}} are highly sinuous. For this project, field surveys and aerial photographs {{were used to}} characterize the planform of tidal channels at China Camp Marsh in the San Francisco Bay, California. To model the planform evolution, {{we assume that the}} topographic curvature of the channel centreline is a key element driving meander migration. Extraction of curvature data from a <b>planimetric</b> <b>survey,</b> however, presents certain problems because simple calculations based on equally distanced points on the channel axis produce numerical noise that pollutes the final curvature data. We found that a spline interpolation and a polynomial fit to the survey data provided us with a robust means of calculating channel curvature. The curvature calculations, combined with data from numerous cross-sections along the tidal channel, were used to parameterize a computer model. With this model, based on recent theoretical work, the relationship between planform shape and meander migration as well as the consequences of bidirectional flow on planform evolution have been investigated. Bank failure in vegetated salt marsh channels is characterized by slump blocks that persist in the channel for several years. It is therefore possibl...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDigital Elevation Model (DEM) {{is one of}} the {{important}} parameters for soil erosion assessment. Notable uncertainties are observed in this study while using three high resolution open source DEMs. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model has been applied to analysis the assessment of soil erosion uncertainty using open source DEMs (SRTM, ASTER and CARTOSAT) and their increasing grid space (pixel size) from the actual. The study area {{is a part of the}} Narmada river basin in Madhya Pradesh state, which is located in the central part of India and the area covered 20, 558  km 2. The actual resolution of DEMs is 30  m and their increasing grid spaces are taken as 90, 150, 210, 270 and 330  m for this study. Vertical accuracy of DEMs has been assessed using actual heights of the sample points that have been taken considering <b>planimetric</b> <b>survey</b> based map (toposheet). Elevations of DEMs are converted to the same vertical datum from WGS 84 to MSL (Mean Sea Level), before the accuracy assessment and modelling. Results indicate that the accuracy of the SRTM DEM with the RMSE of 13. 31, 14. 51, and 18. 19  m in 30, 150 and 330  m resolution respectively, is better than the ASTER and the CARTOSAT DEMs. When the grid space of the DEMs increases, the accuracy of the elevation and calculated soil erosion decreases. This study presents a potential uncertainty introduced by open source high resolution DEMs in the accuracy of the soil erosion assessment models. The research provides an analysis of errors in selecting DEMs using the original and increased grid space for soil erosion modelling...|$|E

40|$|Classic mapping {{technologies}} for {{acquisition of information}} on localisation of points of detailed <b>planimetric</b> <b>survey</b> during creation of survey sketches are influenced with new digital and communication possibilities. Weak points of this classic technology of survey sketches processing are detected and replaced by new communication technologies exploiting mobile telephone networks. There is a condition to develop new technologic process using electronic sketches, digital tacheometers and central databases for processing of survey sketches. Building of the complete system of supporting geodetic web services and exploitation of central databases with functional dispatching of services and controls during processing are important. The paper analyses classic mapping technologies {{from the point of}} view of their advantages and disadvantages and adverts to weak points of present technologies. The possibility to send data in digital mobile networks environment and possibilities of transfer of data designated as CSD (circuit switched data) is analysed. The possible risks of data transfer by GPRS are described. Creation of so-called electronic sketch is an integral part of use of new technologies. This concept is not only explained but also the exploitation of electronic sketches for specific task (i. e. creation of survey sketches) is described. The survey sketches serve for update of the cadastre. The stages of processing of survey sketch, numeration of detailed survey points and characteristics of elements in this technology for resulting geodata transfer to the central database are described. The process of creation of survey sketch by this new procedure in the specific condition of the Czech Republic, where the communication with the central database of the cadastre of real estates is realized through so-called "text exchange format", is explained.

40|$|Architectural {{surveying}} has {{for many}} years been approached in a manner which was so amateur that it left many people wondering whether {{it really was a}} separate discipline. Nowadays, the researcher's operational and algorithmic mentis form rejects this conception and suggests working on the methods, techniques and sequences of operations which are feasible and led to results; it also suggests recording every minute of this work, to describe it down to the minutest detail and be completely open about the errors committed and the choice criteria. The research presented here concerns a small piece of the mosaic which could be called «New Operative Methods for Architectural Surveying ». It is a programme involving. several Italian universities and concerns a method which simplifies and makes <b>planimetric</b> <b>surveys</b> quicker and more reliable. The method simplifies surveying, because the procedures 'can be carried out even by a single operator and makes it quicker because the field tests have shown a considerable reduction in the working times and finally it is more reliable because the procedure allows checking for any errors made during measurement. The method is based, in short, on the use of a theodolite equipped with an infra-red ray diastimeter which can operate even without a reflecting prism, i. e., by exploiting its own reflection on the surface under study. The diastimeter is accompanied by a laser which, thanks to a simple system of mirrors, produces a ray which is coaxial to the viewpoint of the diastimeter and allows sighting which does not require collimation via the spyglass. It is evident that while allowing a rather rapid surveying for polar coordinates, this method can free the surveyor from the tiring operations of trilateration and interacting with a computer and allows an almost immediate or even on-line results, i. e., at the very moment of measurement, attaining a sort of tracing of the building. To check both the quantity and quality errors made by the instrument, in our case, a WILD DIOR 3002 DISTOMAT, a simple and effective measuring instrument was prepared in the basement of Pescara University's Faculty of  Architecture. The instrument's performance was checked on various materials as were the different situations of the incidence of the ray of the surface being studied. The results obtained showed that the error is very constant and can therefore be checked by using a suitable procedure which consists in calibrating the instrument in the field. Three procedures were then experimented for collecting measurements and linking the models: the first, or «central» consisted in placing the instrument in a first position from which one could correspond all the other positions, measuring their three-dimensional coordinates vis-a-vis a reference system which originates from the first position. The second, or «tracking», is nothing more than the typical polygonal procedure. The third, or «support points» is that which furnished the best results, in terms of both precision and feasibility. In conclusion, research on surveying procedures is still an open field and there is much to discover as regards both the philological aspect and also the use of new technologies. When these studies are completed, architectural surveying, as regards both its practice and teaching, will be seen in a completely different light. The method will be appreciated to the same extent that the graphic quality of a plan is today, the traditional 'plan' will find itself in a context which no longer comprises tables, but various information and coordinates, which are however nonetheless aimed at satisfying the common objective of any scholar of architecture: knowledge...|$|R
