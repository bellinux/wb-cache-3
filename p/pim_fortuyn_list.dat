As a result, it did not participate in the 2002 general election, where the recently emerged <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> attracted votes based on an appeal {{similar to that of the}} Centre Democrats.|$|E
5|$|The Party for Freedom's {{political}} platform often overlaps {{those of the}} assassinated Rotterdam politician Pim Fortuyn and his <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List.</b> After his death, Fortuyn's impact remained, {{as more and more}} politicians sought to gain political mileage by directly confronting topics such as a ban on immigration that were, from a politically correct point of view, considered unmentionable in the Netherlands until Fortuyn came on the scene and upended the Dutch tradition of consensus politics with an anti-immigration stance. Wilders would position himself to inherit Fortuyn's constituency. The Party for Freedom called for a €16billion tax reduction, a far stricter policy toward recreational drug use, investing more in roads and other infrastructure, building nuclear power plants and including animal rights in the Dutch constitution. In the 2006 Dutch parliamentary election, their first parliamentary election, the Party for Freedom won 9 out of the 150 open seats.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 2002 Queen Beatrix asked Balkenende {{to form a}} new {{government}} after the general elections following the resignation of Prime Minister Wim Kok. This cabinet is known as Balkenende I. The coalition cabinet included the <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> (LPF) party, whose leader (Pim Fortuyn) was assassinated just days before the election. It collapsed after just 87 days in office because of internal conflicts within the LPF that destabilised the government.|$|E
5000|$|The Ratelband List (in Dutch, [...] Lijst Ratelband [...] ) was a {{political}} movement led by the self-help guru Emile Ratelband. Ratelband set up his own list after being rejected as lijsttrekker for Leefbaar Nederland; his daughter Minou had also had a prominent place in the list. The political programme of the Ratelband List was essentially {{in the spirit of}} <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn.</b> The Ratelband <b>List</b> took part in the elections for the Tweede Kamer on 22 January 2003. Before the elections Ratelband asserted that he would move to Australia or the Fiji Islands if the list failed to win a single seat.|$|R

25|$|On 9 February 2002, he {{was interviewed}} by the Volkskrant, a Dutch {{newspaper}} (see below). His statements were considered so controversial that the party dismissed him as lijsttrekker the next day. Fortuyn had said that he favoured {{putting an end to}} Muslim immigration, if possible. Having been rejected by Livable Netherlands, Fortuyn founded his own party <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> (LPF) on 11 February 2002. Many Livable Netherlands supporters transferred their support to the new party.|$|E
25|$|Fortuyn {{changed the}} Dutch {{political}} landscape and political culture. The 2002 elections, only weeks after Fortuyn's death, {{were marked by}} large losses for the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and especially the social democratic Labour Party (whose parliamentary group was halved in size); both parties replaced their leaders shortly after their losses. The election winners were the <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List,</b> and the Christian democratic Christian Democratic Appeal. Some commentators think that Fortuyn's perceived martyrdom created greater support for the LPF, which seems likely given its quick later decline.|$|E
25|$|The {{coalition}} {{cabinet of}} Christian Democratic Appeal, <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy fell within three months, due to infighting within the LPF. In the following elections, the LPF {{was left with}} only 8 seats in parliament (out of 150) and {{was not included in}} the new government. Political commentators speculated that discontented voters might vote for a non-traditional party, if a viable alternative was at hand. In recent times the right-wing Party for Freedom, which has a strong stance on immigration and integration, won 9 (out of 150) seats in the 2006 elections and 24 in 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} cabinet formation {{resulted in}} a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal, <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> (LPF) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) which formed the First Balkenende cabinet with Balkenende becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking office on 22 July 2002. The cabinet Balkenende I collapsed on 16 October after just 87 days in office after internal conflicts within the <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> that destabilized the government. For the Dutch general election of 2003, Balkenende again as lijsttrekker won one seat and the following cabinet formation {{resulted in a}} coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and the Democrats 66 (D66) which formed the Second Balkenende cabinet. On 29 June 2006 the Democrats 66 retracted {{their support for the}} cabinet Balkenende II after criticizing the way Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk (VVD) had handled the crisis around the naturalization of her party fellow elected to the House of Representatives Ayaan Hirsi Ali. On 7 July 2006 a rump cabinet Third Balkenende cabinet was formed and stayed in office until the Dutch general election of 2006. Balkenende again as lijsttrekker lost three seats but the Christian Democratic Appeal remained by far the largest party with 41 seats. The following 2006–2007 cabinet formation resulted in a coalition agreement with the Christian Democratic Appeal, the Labour Party (PvdA) and the ChristianUnion (CU) that formed the Fourth Balkenende cabinet. On 20 February 2010 the Labour Party retracted their support for the cabinet Balkenende IV after a disagreement over the extension of the ISAF mission in Afghanistan. For the Dutch general election of 2010, Balkenende was appointed again as lijsttrekker, but his party lost 20 seats; he resigned his position as Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal on 9 June, taking political responsibility for the disappointing results in the election. Balkenende remained Prime Minister of the Netherlands until the First Rutte cabinet was installed on 14 October 2010.|$|E
25|$|Balkenende, a jurist by occupation, {{worked for}} the Dutch Academic Senate and the Christian Democratic Appeal think tank from 1982 until 1998. Balkenende became a {{professor}} of Christian theology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 1993. He {{was elected to the}} House of Representatives after the Dutch general election of 1998, serving from 19 May 1998 until 22 July 2002. After the then Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal and Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stepped down after an internal power struggle between him and then party chair Marnix van Rij, Balkenende was selected to succeed him in both positions, and became the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) for the Dutch general election of 2002. The Christian Democratic Appeal became the surprising winner of the election, gaining 14 seats becoming the largest party in the House of Representatives. This success was in part owed to Balkenende's neutral attitude in the debates with Pim Fortuyn, the eponymous leader of the <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> party who was assassinated during the national election campaign on 6 May 2002.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> ( [...] , LPF) was {{a right-wing}} populist {{political}} {{party in the}} Netherlands. The eponymous founder of the party was Pim Fortuyn, a charismatic former university professor and political columnist who initially had planned to contest the 2002 general election {{as leader of the}} Livable Netherlands (LN) party. He was however dismissed as party leader in February 2002 due to controversial remarks he made in a newspaper interview on immigration-related issues, and instead founded LPF a few days later. After gaining support in opinion polls, Fortuyn was assassinated on 6 May 2002, nine days before the election. The party held onto its support, and {{went on to become the}} second-largest party in the election.|$|E

500|$|The Progress Party has by some been {{compared}} to parties such as the Dutch <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List,</b> French Front National and the Freedom Party of Austria. It has been approached for cooperation by some of these parties, including the Belgian Vlaams Belang, French Front National and the Freedom Party of Austria, only to be rejected by the Progress Party. In 2008, the Progress Party international secretary Kristian Norheim specifically distanced the Progress Party from such parties. He regarded many of these parties to be [...] "national social democratic", and stressed their lack of liberalism as inconsistent with the Progress Party's platform. The Progress Party has also {{been compared}} to the Alternative for Germany by Jan Simonsen, who he also cited as a blending of conservatives and economic liberals.|$|E
500|$|Until February, the LN had {{received}} disproportionate and generally sympathetic {{coverage in the}} media. The situation took a dramatic turn on 9February, when Fortuyn was interviewed in de Volkskrant, {{one of the leading}} national newspapers. Against the strong advice of his campaign team, he made several controversial statements; including one that said Islam was [...] "a backward culture", that no more asylum seekers would be allowed into the country, and, if necessary, the possible repeal of anti-racism clauses in the Dutch Constitution to protect freedom of speech. Fortuyn was dismissed as party leader the next day, and in a television interview said that the split was irreparable, although he would have preferred to remain in the party. He founded <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> (LPF) on 11February. Opinion polls soon showed that he took most of LN's supporters with him, leaving LN with its original 2%, while Fortuyn soared to 17%. The local LR—which held on to Fortuyn as its leader—was hugely successful in the March 2002 local elections, as it won more than one third of the vote and became Rotterdam's strongest party.|$|E

2500|$|Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, {{known as}} Pim Fortuyn ( [...] ; 19 February 1948– 6 May 2002), was a Dutch politician, civil servant, sociologist, author and {{professor}} who formed his own party, <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> (Lijst Pim Fortuyn or LPF) in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fall}} of the cabinet several new small right-wing parties {{announced}} that they would run. Most of these parties either came out of the remains of Pim Fortuyn's <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> (LPF) or the liberal VVD. In the period before the elections the small right was characterized by a chaos of secessions, new formations and party switches. Former Rotterdam alderman Marco Pastors and member of parliament for the LPF Joost Eerdmans formed Eén NL. Party for the Netherlands was led by former LPF minister Hilbrand Nawijn, while Wilders recruited people for his new Party for Freedom, which would take part in the 2006 elections. Nawijn and Wilders became independent in parliament at that time, while Eerdmans has formed the [...] "Group Eerdmans-Van Schijndel" [...] along with former VVD MP Anton van Schijndel. Two other LPF politicians have formed one man fractions but they have not formed their own party: Gerard van As, former leader of the LPF, and Gonny van Oudenallen, also former LPF. Margot Kraneveldt left the LPF, returned her seat to the party and joined the social-democratic PvdA. Meanwhile, the LPF announced that it would also run the next elections, under the name [...] "Fortuyn". The party is led by Olaf Stuger, who served as member of parliament in the period 2002–2003 and returned to parliament in 2006, to replace Gerard van As.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2002 general {{election}} the tide had {{turned against the}} Purple government, and the right-wing populist <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> (LPF) had won considerable ground. The three purple parties lost an unprecedented 43 seats. D66 was left with only seven seats. The first Balkenende cabinet, formed of CDA, LPF and VVD, lasted only three months. In the 2003 {{general election}} D66 lost another seat, leaving only six. De Graaf stood down, in favour of Boris Dittrich. After long formation talks between CDA and PvdA failed, a second Balkenende cabinet was formed, comprising CDA, VVD and D66 parties. In return for investments in environment and education, and a special minister of democratisation, a post taken by De Graaf, who also became [...] Deputy Prime Minister, D66 supported the centre-right reform cabinet {{and some of its}} more controversial legislation. In May 2005 the Senate rejected a constitutional reform that would allow a directly elected mayor. The legislation was introduced in the second Wim Kok-led Purple government, but it was unable to get a two-thirds majority because the Labour Party, whose minister De Vries had initiated the reform, rejected the legislation, because they were opposed the model of election proposed by De Graaf. De Graaf stepped down, {{but the rest of the}} ministers stayed on after D66 was promised more investment in public education and the environment, and a plan for electoral reform. A special party congress was called to ratify this so-called Easter Accord. 2,600 members (20 percent of total membership) were present and the congress was broadcast live on by the Netherlands Public Broadcasting (NPO). The congress agreed to remain in cabinet by a large majority. Alexander Pechtold replaced De Graaf as minister of government reform. Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, the Minister of the Economy, became Deputy Prime Minister.|$|E
