25|$|Kees’s worldview {{and writing}} were shaped by his Jazz Age childhood, and his early {{adulthood}} during the Great Depression. By {{the time he}} {{graduated from high school}} in 1931, he rejected entering the family business and, while at Doane College, decided to become a novelist. It was for this reason that he transferred to the University of Missouri, which had a writing program, and then to the University of Nebraska, where he was mentored by the founding editor of graduating <b>Prairie</b> <b>Schooner,</b> Lowery C. Wimberley. By the time Kees graduated in 1935, he had already written and published short stories in that journal as well as other literary magazine such as Horizon and Rocky Mountain Review. While working for the Federal Writers' Project in Lincoln, Nebraska, and after having suffered the rejection of several novels, Kees turned to writing poetry—and, for a time, engaged in union organizing and considered himself a communist. In 1937, Kees moved to Denver to earn a degree in library science at the University of Denver, which included working as a librarian at the Denver Public Library. He then became director of the Bibliographical Center of Research for the Rocky Mountain Region, which was used as a model for a national union catalog. That same year he married Ann Swan.|$|E

500|$|To {{finance the}} venture, Rose sold the {{majority}} of his assets, and after paying off his debts was left with $30,000, then a considerable amount of money. These funds enabled him to finance an especially well-equipped wagon train that included twenty horses, including two Morgan fillies and a Morgan stallion named Black Morrill; their combined value exceeded $3,000. He also purchased two hundred head of red Durham cattle, which he planned to resell in California for profit. To complete the train, Rose acquired four large ox-drawn <b>prairie</b> <b>schooner</b> style covered wagons, each required three yokes (i.e. six oxen) to pull each wagon. [...] Three wagons were loaded with supplies, and the fourth was used by Alpha Brown and his family.

2500|$|Eiseley {{enrolled}} in the University of Nebraska, where he wrote for the newly formed journal, <b>Prairie</b> <b>Schooner,</b> and went on archaeology digs for the school's natural history museum, Morrill Hall. [...] In 1927, however, {{he was diagnosed with}} tuberculosis and left the university to move to the western desert, believing the drier air would improve his condition. While there, he soon became restless and unhappy, which led him to hoboing around the country by hopping on freight trains (as many did during the Great Depression). [...] Professor of religion, Richard Wentz, writes about this period: [...] "Loren Eiseley had been a drifter in his youth. From the plains of Nebraska he had wandered across the American West. Sometimes sickly, at other times testing his strength with that curious band of roving exiles who searched the land above the rippling railroad ties, he explored his soul as he sought to touch the distant past. He became a naturalist and a bone hunter because something about the landscape had linked his mind to the birth and death of life itself.|$|E
2500|$|The first land route across {{what is now}} the United States was mapped by the Lewis and Clark Expedition between 1804 and 1806. Lewis and Clark {{initially}} {{believed they}} had found a practical overland route to the west coast; however, the two passes they found going through the Rocky Mountains, Lemhi Pass and Lolo Pass, turned out to be much too difficult for <b>prairie</b> <b>schooner</b> wagons to pass through without considerable road work. On the return trip in 1806, they traveled from the Columbia River to the Snake River and the Clearwater River over Lolo pass again. They then traveled overland up the Blackfoot River and crossed the Continental Divide at Lewis and Clark Pass and on {{to the head of the}} Missouri River. This was ultimately a shorter and faster route than the one they followed west. This route had the disadvantages of being much too rough for wagons and controlled by the Blackfoot Indians. Even though Lewis and Clark had only traveled a narrow portion of the upper Missouri River drainage and part of the Columbia River drainage, these were considered the two major rivers draining most of the Rocky Mountains, and the expedition confirmed that there was no [...] "easy" [...] route through the northern Rocky Mountains as Jefferson had hoped. Nonetheless, this famous expedition had mapped both the eastern and western river valleys (Platte and Snake Rivers) that bookend the route of the Oregon Trail (and other emigrant trails) across the continental dividethey just had not located the South Pass or some of the interconnecting valleys later used in the high country. They did show the way for the mountain men, who within a decade would find a better way across, even if it was not to be an easy way.|$|E

5000|$|True to the then-ideal of Manifest Destiny, over 500,000 people set {{out from}} the river town of Independence, Missouri to their various {{destinations}} in the American West from the 1830s to the 1860s. These people had many reasons to embark on this strenuous year-long journey - economic crisis, and later gold strikes including the California Gold Rush, for example. For most, the route took them up the Missouri to Omaha, Nebraska, where they would set out along the Platte River, which flows from the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming and Colorado eastwards through the Great Plains. An early expedition led by Robert Stuart from 1812 to 1813 proved the Platte impossible to navigate by the dugout canoes they used, let alone the large sidewheelers and sternwheelers that would later ply the Missouri in increasing numbers. One explorer remarked that the Platte was [...] "too thick to drink, too thin to plow". Nevertheless, the Platte provided an abundant and reliable source of water for the pioneers as they headed west. Covered wagons, popularly referred to as <b>prairie</b> <b>schooners,</b> provided the primary means of transport {{until the beginning of}} regular boat service on the river in the 1850s.|$|R

At a large trading post owned by a man named Wellmore, Coleman sees Flack and suspects him right away as being one of the killers. Flack likewise suspects Coleman as being somebody who knows too much about the killing. Coleman is asked by a large group of settlers to scout their caravan west, and declines, until he learns that Flack and Lopez were just hired by Wellmore to boss a bull train along the as-yet-unblazed Oregon Trail to a trading post north of Oregon, owned by another Missouri fur trader. Coleman agrees to scout for the train, so he can {{keep an eye on the}} villains and kill them as soon as they reach their destination. The caravan of settlers in their <b>Prairie</b> <b>schooners</b> would follow Wellmore's ox-drawn train of Conestoga Wagons, as the first major group of settlers to move west on the Oregon Trail. The film is set somewhere between 1837 and 1845.

Todd, a Southern gentleman whose fortune was depleted during the Civil War, is attempting to rebuild it by gambling on the river boats that frequent the great river. He wins four race horses at poker with Colonel Brereton (Fenton), but refuses to collect the stakes. Brereton insists, and then takes his own life. Brereton's suicide causes Todd to question his new profession. Todd and Castiga again meet at the plantation home of the Colonel's daughter Barbara (Burnham), both having gone there {{to break the news}} of her father's death. Castiga's wiliness makes Barbara believe that Todd is an intruder and the cause of her father's ruin. The trouble between the men results in a duel in which Castiga cheats and is driven out of town. Barbara's faith in Todd is established and together they join the great army of homesteaders and go West for the great land lottery that followed the Civil War. They win a race for a homestead involving <b>prairie</b> <b>schooners,</b> buckboards, horse teams, and race horses, but fall victims to a plot hatched by Castiga. In a struggle between the two, Todd is victorious while his enemy meets his death. Love beckens for Todd and Barbara.|$|R
