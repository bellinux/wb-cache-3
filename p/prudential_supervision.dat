40|$|Includes bibliographyAbstract This paper {{explores the}} {{complementary}} use of two instruments to manage capital-account volatility in developing countries: capital account regulations and counter-cyclical prudential regulation of domestic financial intermediaries. Capital-account regulations can provide useful instruments {{in terms of}} both improving debt profiles and facilitating the adoption of (possibly temporary); counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies. <b>Prudential</b> regulation and <b>supervision</b> should take into account not only the microeconomic risks, but also the macroeconomic risks associated with boom-bust cycles. It should thus introduce counter-cyclical elements into <b>prudential</b> regulation and <b>supervision,</b> together with strict rules to prevent currency mismatches and reduce maturity mismatches. These instruments should be seen as a complement to counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies and, certainly, neither of them can nullify the risks that pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies may generate...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{the evolution of}} the financial industry across industrialised countries since liberalisation gathered momentum in the 1980 s and assesses its implications for <b>prudential</b> regulation and <b>supervision,</b> paying particular attention to changes in the degree of compartmentalisation between (commercial and investment) banking, insurance and non-financial business activities. Two key conclusions are highlighted. First, as segmentation has weakened, the compartmentalisation of <b>prudential</b> regulation and <b>supervision</b> has come under pressure. At the same time, how far harmonisation in prudential arrangements can, or indeed, should, be extended remains a moot question. Second, the changes have also put a premium on the need to find an appropriate balance between official and market discipline. The scope for improvement in this area should not be underestimated. It is argued that information disclosure should be strengthened and capital standards upgraded. ...|$|R

In all three countries, the timing of deregulation coincided with a strongly expansionary macroeconomic momentum.

In the absence of strengthened <b>prudential</b> banking <b>supervision,</b> these incentives coupled with expectations of government intervention {{in the event of a}} crisis prompted many Nordic banks to increase their lending excessively. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how depositors choose among different banks {{and over time}} in Colombia, focusing on whether they discipline bank behavior. By controlling for a more comprehensive set of risk/return factors, the study improves upon conventional market discipline tests. Panel data estimations for 1985 - 99 show that depositors prefer banks with stronger fundamentals, and that banks tend to improve their fundamentals after being “punished” by depositors. Banks with stronger fundamentals benefit from lower interest costs and higher lending rates. Market (or “regulatory”) discipline therefore appears to exist in Colombia, perhaps thanks to certain key design features of the deposit insurance scheme.

40|$|The most {{important}} challenge of Estonia's strategy for integrating its financial sector {{with that of}} the European Union (EU) is to upgrade its capacity for <b>prudential</b> regulation and <b>supervision</b> enough to gain recognition from its EU counterparts. Doing so is also a crucial complement to Estonia's strategy for strengthening macroeconomic policy and stabilization [...] especially because, under a currencyboard, its banks are a central part of the transmission mechanism for capital flows. Under the currency board, banks have been able to arbitrage between domestic and foreign financial markets [...] increasingly funding themselves from abroad. Such arbitrage has become the key funding source for rapidly expanding credit, contributing to the country's large current account deficit. Estonian authorities are justified in tightening <b>prudential</b> regulation and <b>supervision</b> because of the risks associated with an overheating economy, general market volatility, and the possible deterioration in the quality of credit. Improvements in prudential regulation should be followed by improvements in the country's capacity to supervise banks and an upgrading of the banks'risk management systems, to manage the increasingly complex operations and diverse markets in which they engage. These steps should be a priority. The institutional development of banks and supervision have lagged behind market developments. In improving the regulatory framework for banks, Estonia should avoid establishing incentives for tax arbitrage that lead to the creation of artificial and socially costly financial intermediaries.

40|$|In 2011, China revised its {{prudential}} regulation on the derivatives activities {{of financial institutions}} {{as a result of}} the global financial crisis. This paper considers how <b>prudential</b> regulation, <b>supervision</b> of conduct and requirements that limit risk-taking are used to achieve policy objectives in the context of regulating derivatives in China. This is particularly pertinent in the case of China, where financial institutions were formerly state-owned enterprises. These objectives are closely related to defining the legitimate purpose of contracts which are used to hedge default risk of credit assets owned by financial institutions. The paper also considers the legal aspects of the executory contract arising from the legal transplant of the ISDA Master Agreement 2002 into China in the form of NAFMII Documents, and the way in which the Contract Law 1999 (CL) and the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law 2006 (EBL) interact to offer a solution to the issue.
