5|$|Beginning with Michel Zink, whose {{influential}} 1979 monograph Roman rose et rose rouge: Le Roman de la rose ou de Guillaume de Dole {{ushered in}} a new era of criticism, critics have recognized Guillaume de Dole as a work of literature about literature, a self-referential <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> comments on the improbability of some of its own plot elements and on its own fictional status, encouraging a trend in studies of Renart and his work.|$|E
5|$|His 1815 Polish {{translation}} of Homer's Iliad {{met with a}} negative reception. In 1816–20 he published many of his writings in a 9-volume Works (Dzieła). Volumes 7–9 comprised his Humankind: A Didactic Poem (Ród Ludzki. Poema Dydaktyczne), a gigantic philosophical essay and <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> is regarded as {{an important contribution to}} the history of Polish philosophy. However, the work ran afoul of the new censorship law and was not distributed, much of the edition eventually being destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Auden {{controversially}} rewrote or discarded some of {{his most}} famous poems when he prepared his later collected editions. He wrote <b>that</b> he rejected <b>poems</b> <b>that</b> he found [...] "boring" [...] or [...] "dishonest" [...] {{in the sense that they}} expressed views he had never held but had used only because he felt they would be rhetorically effective. His rejected poems include [...] "Spain" [...] and [...] "September 1, 1939". His literary executor, Edward Mendelson, argues in his introduction to Selected <b>Poems</b> <b>that</b> Auden's practice reflected his sense of the persuasive power of poetry and his reluctance to misuse it. (Selected Poems includes some <b>poems</b> <b>that</b> Auden rejected and early texts of <b>poems</b> <b>that</b> he revised.) ...|$|R

5|$|Dvořák often adapted Bohemian {{folklore}} for his compositions, and {{his previous}} four symphonic poems {{were based on}} actual poems by the Czech poet Karel Jaromír Erben, especially Erben's collection of ballads Kytice. A Hero's Song broke away from this pattern of programmatic symphonic works, as Dvořák did not specify a specific accompanying text, and he only roughly outlined its plot in a later letter. The lack of a fixed programme has been hypothesized {{as a reason for}} its relative neglect when compared to Dvořák's other symphonic works. It has also been suggested that the work was intended to be autobiographical, an unusual approach for Dvořák. This was Dvořák's only symphonic <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> pursued Franz Liszt's idealized view of the genre, as Dvořák's other four works were based on eerie subjects not appropriate to Liszt's conception.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{began working}} on The Dry Salvages during World War II {{at a time when}} London was {{experiencing}} air-raids near the end of 1940. During the time, he moved around often and spent his time writing mostly lectures or tiny poems. However, he was able to find time to work on the third <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> would become part of the Four Quartets: Eliot envisioned that Burnt Norton, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and a fourth, yet uncreated poem would be united in a set. Eliot wrote the poem quickly and sent the first draft off on 1 January 1941 to John Hayward. After Hayward received the draft, the two began corresponding about corrections and alterations to the poem. Geoffrey Faber joined in and then the poem was soon finished. It was published in the February 1941 issue of the New English Weekly.|$|E
5|$|In July 1793, Southey {{discussed}} {{the story of}} Joan of Arc with Grosvenor Bedford, his friend. The conversation led to him believe that Joan of Arc {{would serve as a}} good basis for an epic so he began to work a plan for the poem and started composing lines. The subject of the poem appealed to Southey because it reflected incidents surrounding the French Revolution that started in early 1793. By 8 August, he had around 300lines of the poem written. On 13 August, he devoted his time to writing a 12-book <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> he hoped to complete by the end of September. After admitting this desire for haste in the preface to the poem's first edition, critics accused Southey of not spending enough time on composing the poem. During Summer 1794, Southey attempted to find a publisher for John of Arc while taking up The Fall of Robespierre, a poetic drama about the French Revolution, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.|$|E

25|$|Critic Lynn Keller lends {{some insight}} to the lyric {{sequence}} by {{placing it in}} opposition to the epic: “At {{the opposite end of the}} critical spectrum are the treatments of the long <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> do not consider issues of quest, hero, community, nation, history and the like, and instead regard the form as essentially lyric.|$|E
