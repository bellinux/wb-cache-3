40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} current myocardial protection {{strategies for}} {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) across the UK and Ireland. METHODS: A questionnaire survey of 15 questions was sent to practising cardiac surgeons between June and October 2002. The list of surgeons {{was obtained from the}} Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland database and they were contacted by <b>postal</b> and <b>electronic</b> <b>mail.</b> RESULTS: 118 (73. 7 %) out of 160 surgeons responded to the survey. 61 (51. 7 %) perform CABG on-pump (ONCAB) while 10 (8. 5 %) practice off-pump CABG (OPCAB). 47 (39. 8 %) perform either depending on individual cases. Of the 108 surgeons performing ONCAB, 91 (84. 3 %) use cardioplegia while 17 (15. 7 %) use cross-clamp and fibrillation techniques. Of those using cardioplegia, 76 (83. 5 %) use blood cardioplegia, 15 (19. 7 %) use warm-blood and 60 (78. 9 %) use cold-blood cardioplegia. 15 (16. 5 %) use crystalloid cardioplegia. Retrograde cardioplegia is used by 23 (25. 2 %). We find an interesting variation of practice in relation to specifics like warm induction, graft cardioplegia, hot-shot, single cross-clamp, hypothermia and venting procedures. An overwhelming majority of surgeons performing OPCAB use the Octopus stabiliser (n= 44, 77. 2 %) with some others preferring the Genzyme system. Supplementary stabilisation is not commonly used. While most OPCAB surgeons use intracoronary shunts (n= 51), some prefer blockers (n= 9) and others use coronary sloops (n= 36). Ischaemic preconditioning is not commonly practised. Several surgeons have changed their practice of myocardial protection in the last 5 years (n= 45). CONCLUSIONS: This survey gives us an interesting insight into current myocardial protection practices in the UK and Ireland and may be useful for future reference...|$|R

This research investigated {{the process by which}} individuals make decisions about opening and reading versus deleting <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> and also assessed attitudes towards <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> surveys. The sample received an <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> message followed by a telephone interview. Results indicated that individuals delete mail when the subject line does not interest them or when they do not recognize the name of the individual sending the email.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} about <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse analysis. <b>Electronic</b> <b>mail</b> {{or e-mail}} {{is a form}} of information interchange, in which messages are sent from one personal computer to another via modems and telecommunication system. <b>Electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse is a relatively new form of discourse with its own peculiarities. Thus, it rises the writer's curiosity on the characteristics of the <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse in the e-mail of Petra Christian University's Webmaster, the characteristic of the <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse that mostly occurs in the e-mail of Petra Christian University's Webmaster, and the type of discourse that is mostly performed in the <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse characteristics. In order to come to the findings, the writer uses the theory of Brown and Yule (1983), McMurdo (1995), Krol (1994), Sims (1996), Goodman and Graddol (1996), Hightower and Sayeed (1996), Jacobson (1996), Cicourel (1973), and Ong (1982), that are about <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse. The writer's research uses both descriptive and qualitative method in analyzing the data. The writer uses both methods, since she wants to find out and describe the characteristics of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse. The data she used are English e-mails that are sent to Petra Christian University's Webmaster. Then, the data are categorized based on the characteristics of written and spoken discourse. The writer analyzes the postings and finds that there are eleven characteristics that are complete sentences (47), syntactic devices (26), incomplete sentences (24), lower-case letters (24), incomplete words (18), misspelling words (15), upper-case letters (5), emoticons (4), repeated letters (3), explicit statements (2), and filler (1) appearing at <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse. The total number above is not a definite measurement in indicating the position of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse characteristics. The position of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse characteristics above may happen only in the analysis of postings that are sent to Petra Christian University's Webmaster. This may change in different analysis. The message of e-mail, that carries the characteristics of spoken discourse and written discourse, represents the <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> discourse.

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>mail</b> is a {{new medium}} of communications. It changes the way things happen in communication. While man has 50, 000 years of {{experience}} with spoken communications, 5, 000 years with written communications, and 100 years with the telephone, <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> is relatively new. Research to date has focused on strategies for implementing, how it is used, patterns of use, resulting social changes, and effect on decision making. Other researchers conclude that <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> {{is a new}} and different way of communicating that often leads to results different from other mediums of communication. This study focused on the effects that <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> might have on organizational effectiveness. Since organizational effectiveness can represent a range of things, the study uses leadership as a surrogate for organizational effectiveness. The study attempted {{to determine if there}} is a relationship between <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> and other communication in leadership situations and if <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> contributes to the effectiveness of communication between leader and subordinate. A Delphi survey of 26 experienced <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> users in the Washington federal community was conducted. Respondents were selected by the information management staffs of the 21 largest federal agencies. The respondents were anonymous. They were contacted via a person in their organization. Questions concerned the relation between <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> and the process of communication, leadership behavior and communication performance. Other questions covered the possibility that a new type of leader, one more proficient in writing, might emerge.

40|$|<b>ELECTRONIC</b> <b>MAIL</b> HAS been {{available}} {{for over a decade}} in various forms. How is it used in libraries? To what extent is it used? Is it still viable for library applications? Are there other competing technologies which have surpassed the promise of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail?</b> These are some of the issues which this article will address. The concept of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> is fairly straightforward. <b>Electronic</b> <b>mail</b> systems allow creation and transmission of messages which can be addressed to an individual or select groups of individuals. The recipient can then read the message, answer it, store itelectronically, forward it to another individual, print a paper copy, or delete it. However, the technology and variety of types and levels of electronic messaging is much more complex. For background information, consider Trudell et al. (1984) who present historical and technical aspects of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail.</b> Trudell et al. also identify speed of delivery, reliability of delivery, and security and privacy of messages as three beneficial characteristics of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail.</b> Universal delivery and flexibility continue to present problems in the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> (Trudell et al. 1984, pp. 21 - 23). Additional benefits of electronic communication include the extension of the potential work day since <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> can virtually be sent and received any hour of the day; the use of more succinct, written communications which take advantage of the fact that people read about six times faster than they can talk; and the decrease in interruptions by incoming telephone calls (Howitt & Weinberger 1984, pp. 89 - 90). The classic benefit of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail,</b> however, is the elimination of “telephone tag ” and the frustration {{of not being able to}} reach the person you need to talk to...|$|R
