25|$|At SIGGRAPH 2009, Nvidia {{announced}} OptiX, a free API for real-time {{ray tracing}} on Nvidia GPUs.

Nvidia has shipped over 350,000,000 OptiX capable GPUs as of April 2013. OptiX-based renderers are used in Adobe AfterEffects, Bunkspeed Shot, Autodesk Maya, 3ds max, and many other renderers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — IP alias {{resolution}} {{is an important}} step in generating sample Internet topologies from collected <b>path</b> <b>traces.</b> Inaccuracies in IP alias resolution may significantly affect the characteristics of the resulting sample topologies. This in turn affects the accuracy of measurement results obtained using such topologies. Existing tools for alias resolution use an active probing approach. They induce significant traffic overhead into the network and critically depend on the participation of the routers. Recent studies have reported on the limited effectiveness of these approaches [1], [2]. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called Analytical Alias Resolver (AAR), for IP alias resolution. Given a set of <b>path</b> <b>traces,</b> AAR utilizes the common IP address assignment scheme to infer IP aliases from the collected <b>path</b> <b>traces.</b> AAR does not incur traffic overhead due to active probing for alias resolution. Our experimental evaluations on a set of collected Internet <b>path</b> <b>traces</b> show that, compared to existing approaches, AAR can detect significantly more number of IP aliases. I...|$|R
25|$|Photon mapping {{is another}} method that uses both light-based and eye-based ray tracing; in an initial pass, {{energetic}} photons are traced along rays {{from the light}} source so as to compute an estimate of radiant flux {{as a function of}} 3-dimensional space (the eponymous photon map itself). In a subsequent pass, rays are traced from the eye into the scene to determine the visible surfaces, and the photon map is used to estimate the illumination at the visible surface points. The advantage of photon mapping versus bidirectional <b>path</b> <b>tracing</b> is the ability to achieve significant reuse of photons, reducing computation, at the cost of statistical bias.|$|E
500|$|Monsters University is {{the first}} Pixar film that used global illumination, a new {{lighting}} system introduced {{as part of the}} overhaul of the rendering system used since the first Toy Story film. In the planning stage of the film, director of photography, Jean-Claude Kalache, asked [...] "What if we made these lights just work?" [...] Before the new system, artists had to build reflections and shadows manually, which became increasingly complex as the models and the setups became more technologically advanced. The new lighting system uses <b>path</b> <b>tracing,</b> a technique that imitates the behaviour of the light in the real world; this automatized the process, delivered more realism, produced soft shadows, and let the artist spend more time on models and complex scenes – some of which contained thousands of light sources.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the direct}} {{illumination}} is generally best sampled using eye-based ray tracing, certain indirect effects {{can benefit from}} rays generated from the lights. Caustics are bright patterns caused by the focusing of light off a wide reflective region onto a narrow area of (near-)diffuse surface. [...] An algorithm that casts rays directly from lights onto reflective objects, tracing their paths to the eye, will better sample this phenomenon. This integration of eye-based and light-based rays is often expressed as bidirectional <b>path</b> <b>tracing,</b> in which paths are traced from both the eye and lights, and the paths subsequently joined by a connecting ray after some length.|$|E
