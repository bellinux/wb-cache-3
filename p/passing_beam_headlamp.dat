50|$|Sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> were {{introduced}} in the United States in 1939, and became mandatory from the following year until the 1984 model year. Cars prior and subsequent to that date could {{have a variety of}} shapes of headlamps, using any {{of a wide variety of}} replaceable bulbs. Halogen sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> appeared on U.S. cars in 1978 to enable halogen technology under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which at the time required all headlamps to be of sealed beam construction; eventually halogen sealed beams came to dominate the sealed beam lamp market.|$|R
50|$|The {{limited range}} of {{standardized}} sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> sizes and shapes restricted styling options for automobiles. Replaceable-bulb headlamps provide the regulated light distributions while allowing greater design and engineering freedom.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, the law changed slightly, {{permitting}} Americans {{to possess}} vehicles with four 5.75 in round sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> and in 1974, these lights {{were permitted to}} be rectangular as well.|$|R
25|$|They are {{sometimes}} used {{in place of}} dipped-beam headlamps, reducing the glare-back from fog or falling snow, although the legality varies by jurisdiction of using front fog lamps without low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Forward {{illumination}} {{is provided}} by high- ("main", [...] "full", [...] "driving") and low- ("dip", [...] "dipped", [...] "passing") <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> which may be augmented by auxiliary fog lamps, driving lamps, or cornering lamps.|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} daylight with 32 participants to determine whether left turning drivers’ gap acceptance in front of approaching motorcycles depends on the motorcycle’s forward lighting treatment. Five experimental lighting treatments including a modulated high <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp,</b> or the low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> plus pairs of low-mounted auxiliary lamps, high-mounted auxiliary lamps, both high- and low-mounted auxiliary lamps, or low-mounted LED lamps were compared to a baseline treatment with only the low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> illuminated. Participants viewed the approaching traffic stream (including the motorcycle) on an active roadway and indicated {{when it would be}} safe (and not safe) to initiate a left turn across the opposing lanes. Participants also shared their attention with a secondary visual distraction task that took their eyes off the forward roadway. Participants did not know {{that the purpose of the}} study was to measure their responses to approaching motorcycles. Based on participants’ indications of the last safe moment to turn, the mean temporal safety margin provided to the approaching motorcycle did not differ significantly between any of the experimental lighting treatments and the baseline treatment. However, having either low-mounted auxiliary lamps or modulated high beam lamps on the motorcycle significantly reduced the probability of obtaining a potentially unsafe short safety margin as compared to the baseline lighting treatment. Overall, the results suggest that enhancing the frontal conspicuity of motorcycles with lighting treatments beyond an illuminated low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> may be an effective countermeasure for daytime crashes involving right-of-way violations...|$|R
50|$|Historically, one of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} differences between UN and US regulations was the design and performance of headlamps. The Citroën DS shown here illustrates the large differences in headlamps during the 1940-1983 era when US regulations required sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R
25|$|US laws {{required}} sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> on all vehicles between 1940 and 1983, {{and other}} countries such as Japan, United Kingdom and Australia also made extensive use of sealed beams. In most other countries, and in the US since 1984, replaceable-bulb headlamps predominate.|$|R
25|$|High beam (main beam, driving <b>beam,</b> full <b>beam)</b> <b>headlamps</b> {{provide a}} bright, center-weighted {{distribution}} of light with no particular control of light directed towards other road users' eyes. As such, {{they are only}} suitable for use when alone on the road, as the glare they produce will dazzle other drivers.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the American sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> {{requirement}} {{in place at}} the time, the USA models had a special front fascia with four round headlights instead of the two rectangular units it had in other markets. The [...] "US front" [...] then became an item for car customisers in Europe, and vice versa.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the DRL mandate, {{countries}} requiring daytime lights permitted low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> {{to provide}} that function. National regulations in Canada, Sweden, Norway, Slovenia, Finland, Iceland, and Denmark require hardwired automatic DRL systems of varying specification. DRLs are permitted in many countries where they are required, but prohibited in other countries not requiring them.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s most serving SAR {{steam and}} {{electric}} locomotives had their original large round headlamps replaced by less attractive but more efficient double sealed-beam automobile headlamps.

50|$|Lamps and reflectors: Front, side, {{and rear}} turn signals; brake lights, {{front and rear}} {{position}} lights, hazard warning lights, rear reflectors, low and high <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> are all required.

25|$|Some {{countries}} permit {{or require}} vehicles to {{be equipped with}} daytime running lamps (DRL).

5000|$|From April 1966, {{the trains}} were {{reclassified}} [...] "600 series", and {{roughly half of}} the former driving cars were rebuilt as intermediate cars with the cabs removed. At the same time, the headlamps were changed from the original incandescent light bulbs to sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> and the original steel doors were replaced with new stainless steel doors.|$|R

5000|$|Sealed beams are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} nominal voltage ratings, most commonly 6, 12, 24, 28, 120, and 230 V. The actual operating voltage may differ from the nominal rated voltage; for example, [...] "12 volt" [...] sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> are meant for use in automobiles with typical line voltage of 13.5 to 14.2 with the engine running.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standardized}} [...] round sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp,</b> one per side, {{was required}} for all vehicles sold in the United States from 1940, virtually freezing usable lighting technology in place until the 1970s, for Americans.

40|$|Incorporating {{safety in}} the design of a highway is one of the {{foremost}} duties of a design engineer. Design guidelines provide standards that help engineers include {{safety in the}} design of various geometric features. However, design guidelines are not frequently revised and do not accommodate for the frequent changes in vehicle design. One such example is the change in vehicle headlamps. These changes significantly impact the illuminance provided on the road and in turn the design formula. Roadway visibility is critical for nighttime driving. In the absence of roadway lighting, vehicle headlamps illuminate the road ahead of a vehicle. Sag vertical curve design depends on the available headlight sight distance provided by the 1 degree upward diverging <b>headlamp</b> <b>beam.</b> The sag curve design formulas were developed in the early 1940 s when sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> were predominant. However, headlamps have changed significantly and modern headlamps project less light above the horizontal axis. In this research, the difference in illuminance provided by sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> and modern headlamps was examined. For the theoretical analysis, three different sag curves were analyzed. On these curves, about 26 percent reduction in illuminance was observed at a distance equal to the stopping sight distance when comparing sealed <b>beam</b> to modern <b>headlamps.</b> A change in the headlamp divergence angle from 1. 0 degree to 0. 85 degree will provide the required illuminance on the road when using modern headlamps. A field study was performed to validate the theoretical calculations. It was observed that for modern headlamps, a divergence angle less than 1 degree and greater than 0. 5 degrees will provide illuminance values comparable to sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b> As a part of this research, a preliminary study, examining the impact of degraded headlamp lenses on the illuminance provided on sag vertical curves was conducted. A significant reduction in illuminance reaching the roadway on sag curves was observed, due to headlamp lens degradation...|$|R
25|$|Technology {{moved forward}} {{in the rest of}} the world. The first halogen lamp for vehicle {{headlamp}} use, the H1, was introduced in 1962 by a European consortium of bulb and headlamp makers. Shortly thereafter, headlamps using the new light source were introduced in Europe. These were effectively prohibited in the US, where standard-size sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> were mandatory and intensity regulations were low. US lawmakers faced pressure to act, both due to lighting effectiveness and vehicle aerodynamics/fuel savings. High beam peak intensity, capped at 140,000 candela per side of the car in Europe, was limited in the United States to 37,500 candela on each side of the car until 1978, when the limit was raised to 75,000. An increase in high beam intensity to take advantage of the higher allowance could not be achieved without a move to halogen technology, and so sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> with internal halogen burners became available for use on 1979 models in the United States. Halogen sealed beams now dominate the sealed beam market, which has declined steeply since replaceable-bulb headlamps were permitted in 1983.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standardised}} 7 {{in round}} sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> {{was introduced in}} 1940, and was soon required (exactly two per car, though Crosley somehow continued with prefocused headlamps into 1947) for all vehicles sold in the United States, freezing usable lighting technology in place until the 1970s, for Americans. [...] Because the law was written to prevent 'bad headlights,' it by design looks backwards and has historically {{not been able to}} deal with improved, innovative designs.|$|R
50|$|The {{last time}} pop-up {{headlamps}} {{appeared on a}} volume-production car was in 2004 when both the Lotus Esprit and C5 Corvette ended production. Development of both projector <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> — like those on the 1990 Nissan Z — and more efficient, bright LED headlamps of small size will most likely {{eliminate the need for}} concealed headlamps altogether, though composite headlamps containing small halogen bulbs offered enough freedom of styling have already replaced them to a mainstream scale.|$|R

25|$|Auxiliary {{high beam}} lamps may be fitted to provide high {{intensity}} light {{to enable the}} driver to see at longer range than the vehicle's high <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> may be fitted. Such lamps are most notably fitted on rallying cars, and are occasionally fitted to production vehicles derived from or imitating such cars. They are common in countries with large stretches of unlit roads, or in regions such as the Nordic countries where the period of daylight is short during winter.|$|R
25|$|Headlamp systems require {{periodic}} maintenance. Sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> are modular; {{when the}} filament burns out, the entire sealed beam is replaced. Most vehicles in North America made {{since the late}} 1980s use headlamp lens-reflector assemblies that are considered {{a part of the}} car, and just the bulb is replaced when it fails. Manufacturers vary the means by which the bulb is accessed and replaced. Headlamp aim must be properly checked and adjusted frequently, for misaimed lamps are dangerous and ineffective.|$|R
