40|$|Octopamine-like immunoreactivity was {{localized}} to {{a limited}} number (< 40) of neurons in the Aplysia central nervous system, including three neurons in the paired buccal ganglia (BG) that control feeding movements. Application of octopamine (OA) to the BG circuit produced concentration-dependent (10 − 8 – 10 − 4 mol l− 1) modulatory actions on the spontaneous burst activity of the bilaterally <b>paired</b> <b>B</b> 67 pharyngeal motor neurons (MNs). OA increased B 67 's burst duration {{and the number of}} impulses per burst. These effects reflected actions of OA on the intrinsic tetrodotoxin-resistant driver potential (DP) that underlies B 67 bursting. In addition to its effects on B 67 's burst parameters, OA also increased the rate and regularity of burst timing. Although the bilaterally <b>paired</b> <b>B</b> 67 MNs both exhibited rhythmic bursting in the presence of OA, they did not become synchronized. In this respect, the response to OA differed from that of dopamine, another modulator of the feeding motor network, which produces both rhythmicity and synchrony of bursting in the <b>paired</b> <b>B</b> 67 neurons. It is proposed that modulators can regulate burst synchrony of MNs by exerting a dual control over their intrinsic rhythmicity and their reciprocal capacity to generate membrane potential perturbations. In this simple system, dopaminergic and octopaminergic modulation could influence whether pharyngeal contractions occur in a bilaterally synchronous or asynchronous fashion...|$|R
50|$|A lattice {{with the}} {{property}} that if (a, b) is a modular pair, then (b, a) {{is also a}} modular pair is called an M-symmetric lattice. Since a lattice is modular {{if and only if}} all pairs of elements are modular, clearly every modular lattice is M-symmetric. In the lattice N5 described above, the <b>pair</b> (<b>b,</b> a) is modular, but the pair (a, b) is not. Therefore, N5 is not M-symmetric. The centred hexagon lattice S7 is M-symmetric but not modular. Since N5 is a sublattice of S7, it follows that the M-symmetric lattices do not form a subvariety of the variety of lattices.|$|E

50|$|If the Euclidean {{algorithm}} requires N {{steps for}} a pair of natural numbers a > b > 0, the smallest values of a and b for which this is true are the Fibonacci numbers FN+2 and FN+1, respectively. More precisely, if the Euclidean algorithm requires N steps for the pair a > b, then one has a ≥ FN+2 and b ≥ FN+1. This can be shown by induction. If N = 1, b divides a with no remainder; the smallest natural numbers for which this is true is b = 1 and a = 2, which are F2 and F3, respectively. Now assume that the result holds for all values of N up to M − 1. The first step of the M-step algorithm is a = q0b + r0, and the Euclidean algorithm requires M − 1 steps for the <b>pair</b> <b>b</b> > r0. By induction hypothesis, one has b ≥ FM+1 and r0 ≥ FM. Therefore, a = q0b + r0 ≥ b + r0 ≥ FM+1 + FM = FM+2,which is the desired inequality.This proof, published by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, represents the beginning of computational complexity theory, and also the first practical application of the Fibonacci numbers.|$|E
5000|$|Let X be {{a variety}} of nonnegative Kodaira {{dimension}} over a field of characteristic zero, and let B be the canonical model of X, B = Proj R(X, KX); the dimension of B {{is equal to the}} Kodaira dimension of X. There is a natural rational map X - → B; any morphism obtained from it by blowing up X and B is called the Iitaka fibration. The minimal model and abundance conjectures would imply that the general fiber of the Iitaka fibration can be arranged to be a Calabi-Yau variety, which in particular has Kodaira dimension zero. Moreover, there is an effective Q-divisor Δ on B (not unique) such that the <b>pair</b> (<b>B,</b> Δ) is klt, KB + Δ is ample, and the canonical ring of X {{is the same as the}} canonical ring of (B, Δ) in degrees a multiple of some d > 0. In this sense, X is decomposed into a family of varieties of Kodaira dimension zero over a base (B, Δ) of general type. (Note that the variety B by itself need not be of general type. For example, there are surfaces of Kodaira dimension 1 for which the Iitaka fibration is an elliptic fibration over P1.) ...|$|E

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{refractory}} period that follows exercise and isocapnic hyperventilation, 10 asthmatic children performed {{two pairs of}} challenge tests in random order at least six hours apart.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a four-ball-best-ball (4 BBB) model for pairs of golf players is set up. The 4 BBB match-play scoring system {{is seen to}} satisfy a basic {{requirement}} of fairness. It is shown {{that it is not}} strictly possible to rate individual players as 4 BBB players. However, a (reasonably broad) class of individual players is identified such {{that it is possible to}} rate them individually as 4 BBB players. The capacity of an individual to play birdies is seen to be a very important determinant in being a successful member of a 4 BBB pair, but there are other minor factors as well. Consideration is given to equal and unequal 4 BBB pairs. The transitive law is seen to apply for 4 BBB pairs. Thus, if pair A is better than <b>pair</b> <b>B,</b> and <b>pair</b> <b>B</b> is better than pair C, then pair A must be better than pair C. Correspondingly, if pair A is equal to <b>pair</b> <b>B,</b> and <b>pair</b> <b>B</b> is equal to pair C, then pair A is equal to pair C. Consideration is given to some strategic issues in 4 BBB match-play golf. For example, the conditions under which a player should take a greater risk and have a higher probability of obtaining a bogie in order to achieve a higher probability of scoring a birdie, are determined. Also, the conditions under which a player, noting that his partner is about to have a ‘bad’ hole and score only a par or a bogie, should ‘play safe’, are determined. Thirdly, players who can interact in certain ways are seen to have an advantage over those pairs that cannot do this. Finally, one pair’s optimal strategy when they see that their opponents are about to score a par or a bogie, but not a birdie, is analyze...|$|E
