5|$|Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} inner planet Gliese 876 c {{and the outer}} planet Gliese 876 e: {{in the time it}} takes planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of the planets change fairly rapidly as they dynamically interact with one another. The planet's orbit has a low eccentricity, similar to the planets in the Solar System. The semimajor axis of the orbit is only 0.208 AU, less than that of Mercury in the Solar System. However Gliese 876 is such a faint star that this <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer part of the habitable zone.|$|E

25|$|Docetaxel is a {{cytotoxic}} chemotherapeutic agent. As {{with all}} chemotherapy, adverse effects are common, and many side effects have been documented. Because docetaxel is a cell-cycle-specific agent, it is cytotoxic to all dividing {{cells in the}} body. This includes tumour cells as well as hair follicles, bone marrow and other germ cells. For this reason, common chemotherapy side effects such as hair loss occur; sometimes this can be permanent. North west France are conducting a survey to establish exactly {{how many people are}} affected in this way. Independent studies show it could be as high as 6.3%, which <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 'common and frequent' classification.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of season one of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Mary McNamara at the Los Angeles Times praised the connections between that series and the films, stating that [...] "never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise ... is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination." [...] Terri Schwartz of Zap2it agreed with this sentiment, stating that [...] "the fact that [...] so influenced the show is game-changing {{in terms of how}} the mediums of film and television can be interwoven", though [...] "the fault there seems to be that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. had to bide time until The Winter Soldiers release", which led to much criticism.|$|E
500|$|Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the series [...] "created a whole new sort of {{television}} show: One that must support, and change with, the plot twists of its film family ... never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise." [...] She stated that the Captain America: The Winter Soldier crossover [...] "infused S.H.I.E.L.D. with a new energy, and helped explain, perhaps, why the show {{took so long to}} find its footing—in the writers' room at least ... That Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to succeed as a story both independent and ancillary is all but miraculous."

The rest of the office are unhappy with Dwight's system, and call it a doomsday device. Despite their best efforts, the group manages to make five mistakes barely halfway through the first day with the system, and Dwight reveals that the emails will be automatically sent to California at 5:00 pm. Andy pleads with Dwight to deactivate the system, but Dwight refuses, belittles the rest of the office staff for being so careless, and retreats to Schrute Farms.|$|E

500|$|Cameron {{said that}} Americans have a [...] "moral responsibility" [...] to {{understand}} {{the impact of their}} country's recent military campaigns.

[...] We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] Christian Hamaker of Crosswalk.com noted that, [...] "in describing the military assault on Pandora, Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war on terrorism and <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouths of the film's villains... as they 'fight terror with terror'. Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men." [...] A columnist in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti traced Avatars popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve [...] "us the scoundrels" [...] of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal." [...] Other reviews saw Avatar as [...] "the bubbling up of our military subconscious... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army—much more fun to fly, unarmored, on a winged beast." ...|$|E

A contrary opinion is expressed by Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict, who says the series is [...] "occasionally clever and funny," [...] but that [...] "much of it is gratingly obnoxious". Many reviewers express displeasure with middle and later episodes, saying they were [...] "more of the same," [...] that they had stale humor, that they were tiresome, or even painfully unfunny.

2500|$|Theologically, Henry James Sr. was out {{of sympathy}} with the naturalism {{of much of the}} {{religious}} thought of the nineteenth century. [...] He regarded creation itself as [...] "a purely spiritual process, falling wholly within the realm of affection and thought." [...] The fundamental theological problem, in his view, is theodicy, or the problem of evil. [...] His Swedenborgian {{solution to the problem of}} evil relied on breaking the bond between God and nature, or, put alternatively, between nature and reality. [...] True reality (or God) is, in James's view, thoroughly spiritual, in a way that denizens of the natural world can scarcely comprehend. [...] But through intuition of this true reality, James thought, liberation from the illusions of natural appearances—which include time, space, and selfhood—is possible. [...] In such liberation lies salvation, in James's view, whereas evil—more specifically, spiritual evil, since James distinguishes this from [...] "physical" [...] and [...] "moral" [...] evil—arises from action based on the delusion of selfhood. [...] In James's thought, [...] "the principle of hell is selfhood and the principle of heaven is brotherly love," [...] as C. Hartley Grattan <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Three James: A Family of Minds: Henry James Sr., William James, Henry James (N.Y. Univ. Press, 1962 , p.75). [...] But James was not a slavish follower of Swedenborg. [...] Rather, it was in Swedenborg that he found the most fecund exploration of his central insight that the source of all evil was in attachment to the self.|$|E
