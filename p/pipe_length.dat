25|$|Unlike many flutes, ocarinas do {{not rely}} on <b>pipe</b> <b>length</b> to produce a {{particular}} tone. Instead the tone {{is dependent on the}} ratio of the total surface area of opened holes to the total cubic volume enclosed by the instrument. This means that, unlike a flute or recorder, sound is created by resonance of the entire cavity and the placement of the holes on an ocarina is largely irrelevant – their size is the most important factor. Instruments that have toneholes close to the voicing/embouchure should be avoided, however; as an ocarina is a Helmholtz resonator, this weakens tonal production.|$|E

The primary boundary conditions are flow with friction and flow with heat transfer and friction. Two PASCAL programs were developed to calculate the efflux parameters: EFFLUZD and EFFLUXM. EFFLUXD calculates the minimum mass flow for the given shield temperatures and shield heat inputs. It then calculates the <b>pipe</b> <b>lengths,</b> diameter, and fluid parameters which satisfy all boundary conditions. Since the diameter returned by EFFLUXD is only rarely of nominal size, EFFLUXM calculates the mass flow and shield heat exchange for given <b>pipe</b> <b>lengths,</b> diameter, and shield temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Fluids {{are very}} common and {{widely used in}} various {{industry}} processes. The only way to transfer fluids is to use pipe. During the transfer, the turbulent flow in pipe always causes a phenomenon called drag. However, this effect could be reduced by addition of Drag Reduction Agents (DRA’s). This study is aimed to provide {{a clear understanding of}} the effects of various <b>pipe</b> <b>lengths</b> and <b>pipe</b> diameter on the percentage of drag reduction based on experimental work. In this work, an anionic surfactant, Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) will be used as a DRA’S to investigate the purpose as stated above. An experimental apparatus consisting of two tanks, pump, pressure drop indicator, flow meter, test specimen pipe and piping network are set up. The parameters of investigation include concentration of the additive (100, 300 and 500 ppm), different <b>pipe</b> <b>lengths</b> (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 m) as well as different pipe diameters (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 in) at different water flow rates.

40|$|Water hammer {{concerns}} the generation, propagation, reflection and damping of pressure waves in liquid-filled pipe systems. The numerical simulation of water-hammer events is usually based on one-dimensional mathematical models. Two equations representing {{the conservation of}} mass and momentum govern the unsteady flow in the pipes. Boundary and/or intermediate conditions model the behaviour of hydraulic machinery and the additional complication of column separation. The method of characteristics is the preferred method of solution and the conventional approach is to define a fixed grid in the distance-time plane. On this grid, the unknown pressures and velocities (or heads and discharges) are numerically computed in a time-marching procedure that starts from a given initial condition. Rectangular or diamond grids are used that in general do not exactly match the given <b>pipe</b> <b>lengths</b> or the chosen time step. Therefore numerical interpolations and/or adjustments of wave speeds or <b>pipe</b> <b>lengths</b> are necessary, and these necessities introduce error. This paper presents {{a different way of}} water-hammer computation. The procedure is based on the method of characteristics, but a numerical grid is not required. Any point in the distance-time plane can be selected to compute the local solution without explicitly using stored previous solutions. The computation is based o...|$|R

3000|$|Flexible {{construction}} Unlike {{steel and}} concrete pipelines, wood stave pipelines are not delivered in large segments, but in small discrete parts. Thus, an on-site assembly is possible {{without the need}} of complex equipment. Therefore, wood stave pipelines can easily be applied in remote or difficult-to-access environments (e.g., mountainous region, karst caves). In general, this kind of pipeline can be produced with diameters from 0.5 to 4  m and for pressures up to six bars. Due to timber’s low sensitivity to temperature variations, <b>pipe</b> <b>lengths</b> of several kilometers are feasible without any flexible joints to compensate temperature-induced expansions.|$|R

50|$|A {{flue pipe}} (also {{referred}} to as a labial pipe) is an organ pipe that produces sound through the vibration of air molecules, {{in the same manner as}} a recorder or a whistle. Air under pressure (called wind) is driven down a flue and against a sharp lip called a Labium, causing the column of air in the pipe to resonate at a frequency determined by the <b>pipe</b> <b>length</b> (see wind instrument). Thus, there are no moving parts in a flue pipe. This is in contrast to reed pipes, whose sound is driven by beating reeds, as in a clarinet. Flue pipes are common components of pipe organs.|$|E
