25|$|In {{contrast}} to his glamorous image, Boyer began losing his hair early, had a pronounced <b>paunch,</b> and was noticeably shorter than leading ladies like Ingrid Bergman. When Bette Davis first saw him {{on the set of}} All This, and Heaven Too, she did not recognize him and tried to have him removed.|$|E
500|$|While {{briefing}} Saswata Chatterjee {{about his}} character, the cold-blooded killer Bob Biswas, Ghosh {{used the phrase}} [...] "Binito Bob" [...] (meaning polite Bob), which crystallised the notion of Bob's manners. Further discussions led to the inclusion of <b>paunch</b> and a bald patch. Chatterjee devised the mannerism of rubbing his nails together as some Indians believe doing that helps prevent hair loss. The mannerism was well-noted and praised by the viewers. Ghosh {{was surprised at how}} Bob Biswas was greeted by fans as a cult figure. He emphasised that the deliberate ordinariness of Bob Biswas was portrayed so convincingly by Chatterjee that the viewers can expect Bob to be around them at any time and any place.|$|E

50|$|The unflattering figured-character of the stonemason is: bald, <b>paunched,</b> with facial stubble, in a leaning-over, {{and awkward}} pose. It is a {{caricature}} scene, as in a cartoon. The Stonemason is holding his chisel {{in his left}} hand, and his wooden Egyptian mallet in his right hand.|$|R
60|$|There must be {{something}} curious about the proximity of a volcano. Naples and Catania alike, the men are hugely fat, with great macaroni <b>paunches,</b> they are expansive and in a perfect drip of casual affection and love. But the Sicilians are even more wildly exuberant and fat and all over one another than the Neapolitans. They never leave off being amorously friendly with almost everybody, emitting a relentless physical familiarity that is quite bewildering to one not brought up near a volcano.|$|R
500|$|Cagney's {{portrayal}} of Cody Jarrett in the 1949 film White Heat {{is one of}} his most memorable. Cinema had changed in the 10 years since Walsh last directed Cagney (in The Strawberry Blonde), and the actor's {{portrayal of}} gangsters had also changed. Unlike Tom Powers in The Public Enemy, Jarrett was portrayed as a raging lunatic with few if any sympathetic qualities. In the 18 intervening years, Cagney's hair had begun to gray, and he developed a <b>paunch</b> for the first time. He was no longer a romantic commodity, and this was reflected in his performance. Cagney himself had the idea of playing Jarrett as psychotic; he later stated, [...] "it was essentially a cheapie one-two-three-four kind of thing, so I suggested we make him nuts. It was agreed so we put in all those fits and headaches." ...|$|E
500|$|Polynesian peoples {{often did}} not {{recognize}} Canis Minor as a constellation, but they saw Procyon as significant and often named it; in the Tuamotu Archipelago it was known as Hiro, meaning [...] "twist as a thread of coconut fiber", and Kopu-nui-o-Hiro ("great <b>paunch</b> of Hiro"), which was either {{a name for the}} modern figure of Canis Minor or an alternative name for Procyon. Other names included Vena (after a goddess), on Mangaia and Puanga-hori (false Puanga, the name for Rigel), in New Zealand. In the Society Islands, Procyon was called Ana-tahua-vahine-o-toa-te-manava, literally [...] "Aster the priestess of brave heart", figuratively the [...] "pillar for elocution". The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia gave Procyon and Gomeisa the names Magum and Gurumana, describing them as humans who were transformed into gum trees in the dreamtime. Although their skin had turned to bark, they were able to speak with a human voice by rustling their leaves.|$|E
2500|$|Travolta's {{entire career}} becomes [...] "backstory", {{the myth of}} a movie star who has fallen out of favor, but still resides in our memory as the king of disco. We keep {{waiting for him to}} shed his <b>paunch,</b> put on a white {{polyester}} suit, and enter the 2001 Odyssey club in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he will dance for us and never, never stop. Daniel Day-Lewis couldn't have woken such a powerful longing in us. He isn't part of America's own mad cosmology...

Related {{to the theory of}} Green's equivalences, the isomorphism classes of sub-rooted cluster algebras of a rooted cluster algebra are corresponded one-by-one to the regular D-classes of the semigroup consisting of partial seed endomorphisms of the initial seed.

6000|$|Sixty men {{had come}} to the dinner. They made islands and eddies in the hall; they packed the {{elevator}} and the corners of the private dining-room. They tried to be intimate and enthusiastic. They appeared to one another exactly as they had in college--as raw youngsters whose present mustaches, baldnesses, <b>paunches,</b> and wrinkles were but jovial disguises put on for the evening. [...] "You haven't changed a particle!" [...] they marveled. The men whom they could not recall they addressed, [...] "Well, well, great to see you again, old man. What are you--Still doing the same thing?" ...|$|R
60|$|All {{fell away}} from us, however, when the Emperor, with a {{following}} of intimates, advanced to look us over. He was a merry monarch, especially so for an Asiatic. Not more than forty, with a clear, pallid skin {{that had never}} known the sun, he was <b>paunched</b> and weak-legged. Yet {{he had once been}} a fine man. The noble forehead attested that. But the eyes were bleared and weak-lidded, the lips twitching and trembling from the various excesses in which he indulged, which excesses, as I was to learn, were largely devised and pandered by Yunsan, the Buddhist priest, of whom more anon.|$|R
2500|$|Reid's {{career was}} aided by his quick wit and {{entertaining}} oratory; he {{was described as}} being [...] "perhaps the best platform speaker in the Empire", both amusing and informing his audiences [...] "who flocked to his election meetings as to popular entertainment". In one particular incident his quick wit and affinity for humour were demonstrated when a heckler pointed to his ample <b>paunch</b> and exclaimed [...] "What {{are you going to}} call it, George?" [...] to which Reid replied: [...] "If it's a boy, I'll call it after myself. If it's a girl I'll call it Victoria. But if, as I strongly suspect, it's nothing but piss and wind, I'll name it after you." [...] His humour, however, was not universally appreciated. Alfred Deakin detested Reid, describing him as [...] "inordinately vain and resolutely selfish" [...] and their cold relationship would affect both their later careers.|$|E

40|$|Postweaning {{development}} was monitored in domesticated rabbits reared in single- or mixed-sex groups at a commercial farm. The {{results suggest that}} sex composition of cage groups had no significant effect on weight gain, feed intake or mortality rates from weaning (35 days) to marketing (93 days). On sacrifice at 93 days, females from single- and mixed-sex groups showed {{no significant differences in}} plasma gonadotropin levels (LH and FSH) or weights of <b>paunched</b> carcase, ovaries, uterus, adrenals, kidneys or kidney fat. Evidence for within-cage dominance hierarchies was found at 63 days of age when 46 % of the rabbits inspected showed signs of aggressive attack...|$|R

The first displayed the portrait of a young man with a pure brow, an iron jaw, silk socks, and hair like patent leather. Standing with one hand in his trousers-pocket and the other extended with chiding forefinger, he was bewitching an audience of men with gray beards, <b>paunches,</b> bald heads, and every other sign of wisdom and prosperity.

60|$|The {{advanced}} {{lines of}} the two contending armies were now in presence--the National Guard of Orleans and the Irish Brigade. The white belts and fat <b>paunches</b> of the Guard presented a terrific appearance; but {{it might have been}} remarked by the close observer, that their faces were as white as their belts, and the long line of their bayonets might be seen to quiver. General Odillon Barrot, with a cockade as large as a pancake, endeavored to make a speech: the words honneur, patrie, Francais, champ de bataille might be distinguished; but the General was dreadfully flustered, and was evidently more at home in the Chamber of Deputies than in the field of war.|$|R

60|$|Late in {{the evening}} I heard the distant {{rumbling}} of wagons over bridges--a sound heard farther {{than almost any other}} at night--the baying of dogs, and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow in a distant barn-yard. In the mean-while all the shore rang with the trump of bullfrogs, the sturdy spirits of ancient wine-bibbers and wassailers, still unrepentant, trying to sing a catch in their Stygian lake--if the Walden nymphs will pardon the comparison, for though there are almost no weeds, there are frogs there--who would fain keep up the hilarious rules of their old festal tables, though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave, mocking at mirth, and the wine has lost its flavor, and become only liquor to distend their <b>paunches,</b> and sweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory of the past, but mere saturation and waterloggedness and distention. The most aldermanic, with his chin upon a heart-leaf, which serves for a napkin to his drooling chaps, under this northern shore quaffs a deep draught of the once scorned water, and passes round the cup with the ejaculation tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r--oonk, tr-r-r-oonk! and straightway comes over the water from some distant cove the same password repeated, where the next in seniority and girth has gulped down to his mark; and when this observance has made the circuit of the shores, then ejaculates the master of ceremonies, with satisfaction, tr-r-r-oonk! and each in his turn repeats the same down to the least distended, leakiest, and flabbiest <b>paunched,</b> that there be no mistake; and then the howl goes round again and again, until the sun disperses the morning mist, and only the patriarch is not under the pond, but vainly bellowing troonk from time to time, and pausing for a reply.|$|R

50|$|Nicandra physalodes is {{suspected}} of having poisonous properties similar to those possessed by certain Physalis species implicated in the poisoning of sheep. Some conflicting evidence in respect of these suspicions has emerged from Australia (where the plant is sometimes known as wild gooseberry), in which the plant has been suspected, on rather vague evidence, of poisoning stock at various times, although a feeding test carried out in New South Wales using a sheep and a goat gave negative results. A case was reported from New South Wales in 1970 in which two crossbred ewes died, apparently {{as a result of}} consuming this plant. The animals had been left to graze in a paddock of Wimmera ryegrass heavily infested with Nicandra physalodes plants of around 60 cm in height, such that the Nicandra overtopped the grass. Both ewes died, with symptoms of bloat within 12 hours. At necropsy there were extensive hemorrhages in heart and lungs, but no other apparent abnormalities. The <b>paunches</b> of the ewes were observed to contain large amounts of Nicandra.|$|R

60|$|Near by, were arched ways, {{leading to}} {{subterranean}} places, whence issued a savory steam, and an extraordinary clattering of calabashes, and smacking of lips, {{as if something}} were being eaten down there by the fattest of fat fellows, with the heartiest of appetites, and the most irresistible of relishes. It was a quaffing, guzzling, gobbling noise. Peeping down, we beheld a company, breasted up against a board, groaning under numerous viands. In the middle of all, was a mighty great gourd, yellow as gold, and jolly round like a pumpkin in October, and so big it must have grown in the sun. Thence flowed a tide of red wine. And before it, stood plenty of <b>paunches</b> being filled therewith like portly stone jars at a fountain.

60|$|Now {{when the}} tyrant {{had arrived at}} Hell-Gate Hill, with his old friend Incredulity, they {{immediately}} descended the den, and having there with their fellows for a while condoled their misfortune and great loss that they sustained against the town of Mansoul, they fell at length into a passion, and revenged they {{would be for the}} loss that they sustained before the town of Mansoul. Wherefore they presently call a council to contrive yet further what was to be done against the famous town of Mansoul; for their yawning <b>paunches</b> could not wait to see the result of their Lord Lucifer's and their Lord Apollyon's counsel that they had given before; for their raging gorge thought every day, even as long as a short for ever, until they were filled with the body and soul, with the flesh and bones, and with all the delicates of Mansoul. They therefore resolve to make another attempt upon the town of Mansoul, and that by an army mixed and made up partly of doubters, and partly of blood-men. A more particular account now take of both.|$|R

5000|$|The Wicked Witch of the West is the malevolent {{ruler of}} the Winkie Country. Her castle is {{described}} as beautiful instead of being the sinister fortress shown in the movie. In all versions, she is seriously aquaphobic. The Wicked Witch of the West {{was not related to}} the Wicked Witch of the East, but leagued together with her, the Wicked Witch of the South and Mombi to conquer the Land of Oz and divide it among themselves, as recounted in L. Frank Baum's Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz. She shows no interest in the death of the Eastern Witch, and all she cares about is obtaining the Silver Shoes which will increase her power. W. W. Denslow's illustrations for The Wonderful Wizard of Oz depict her as a <b>paunched</b> old hag with three pigtails and an eye-patch. L. Frank Baum himself specified that she only had one eye, but that it [...] "was as powerful as a telescope", enabling the witch {{to see what was happening}} in her kingdom from her castle windows. Other illustrators, such as Paul Granger, placed her eye in the center of her forehead, as a cyclops. Usually, she is shown wearing an eye patch, however some illustrations show her with two eyes. Possibly to suggest that the witch actually has two eyes, but has no vision in one of them.|$|R
2500|$|The Bradshaw {{paintings}} predominantly depict human silhouette {{figures that}} appear to be suspended in the air or in a dynamic style that suggests running, hunting or dancing. While gender is rarely portrayed in the paintings, limb, arm and shoulder muscles are often well defined in addition to stomach <b>paunches.</b> The question of gender representation in Bradshaw art was illuminated recently by the discovery that figures are depicted as if they are facing into the rock face. This perspective has been overlooked until now because of the Western bias toward images that “face out”, but also because the “facing in” perspective is more evident in depictions with excellent delineation of body contours, such as the rare, Classic Realistic style, which is also earliest in superposition studies;|). If one appreciates the “facing in” perspective, it becomes evident that the many attributions of “paunches’ by [...] are incorrect, both because they can now be seen to be located at the rear of these figures, but also because it is anatomically incorrect to attribute the belly to gluteal structures located more inferiorly. Furthermore, the figures are ornamented with a diversity of objects such as belts, headdresses, bags and tassels, while other material culture is sometimes depicted, such as boomerangs and wands. While Bradshaw initially described the colour of the art as having shades of pale blue and yellow, most figures have a deep purple-red hue, mulberry colour or a red to yellow-brown colour. However, Donaldson notes that there are rare examples of multi-coloured figures that retain some yellow and white pigment. The height of the art is variable; most are between 40 and 50cm in length with some examples up to 2 metres in height.|$|R
