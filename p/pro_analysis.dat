This analysis establishes a framework for evaluating rapidly shifting clinical practices (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, microincisional vitrectomy surgery) and incorporating changing reimbursements for care delivery (intravitreal injections, optical coherence tomography [OCT]) to determine the impact on practice profitability. Pro forma modeling targeted the impact of declining reimbursement for OCT imaging and intravitreal injection using a strategy that incorporates activity-based cost analysis into a direct evaluation schema for clinical operations management. Methods: Activity-based costing analyses were performed at two different types of retinal practices in the US, ie, a small single-specialty group practice and an academic hospital-based practice (Bascom Palmer Eye Institute). Retrospective claims data were utilized to identify all procedures performed and billed, submitted charges, allowed charges, and net collections from each of these two practices for the calendar years 2005 &ndash; 2006 and 2007 &ndash; 2008. A <b>pro</b> forma <b>analysis</b> utilizing current reimbursement profiles was performed to determine the impact of altered reimbursement on practice profitability. All analyses were performed by a third party consulting firm. Results: The small single-specialty group practice outperformed the academic hospital-based practice on almost all markers of efficiency. In the academic hospital-based practice, only four service lines were profitable, ie, nonlaser surgery, laser surgery, non-OCT diagnostics, and injections. Profit margin varied from 62 % for nonlaser surgery to 1 % for intravitreal injections. Largest negative profit contributions were associated with office visits and OCT imaging. Conclusion: Activity-based cost analysis is a powerful tool to evaluate retinal practice efficiencies. These two distinct practices were able to provide significant increases in clinical care (office visits, ophthalmic imaging, and patient procedures) through maintaining efficiencies of care. <b>Pro</b> forma <b>analysis</b> of 2011 data noted that OCT payments to facilities and physicians continue to decrease dramatically and that this payment decrease further reduced the profitability for the two largest aspects of these retinal practices, ie, intravitreal injections and OCT retinal imaging. Ultimately, all retinal practices are at risk for significant shifts in financial health related to rapidly evolving changes in patterns of care and reimbursement associated with providing outstanding clinical care.

To test the hypothesis that ovarian cancer patients with worse PROs would drop out earlier, we examined how patients differed by time of dropout on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), anxiety, depression, optimism and insomnia. MethodsThis analysis included 619 participants, stratified by time of dropout, from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study - Quality of Life substudy, in which participants completed PRO questionnaires at three-monthly intervals for 21 months. Trends in PROs over time were examined. Pearson correlations examined the relationship between time of dropout and baseline PROs. Multiple linear regression models including age, disease stage and time since diagnosis examined relationships between baseline and final PRO scores, and final PRO scores and dropout group. ResultsParticipants who dropped out earlier had significantly worse baseline HRQOL (p< 0. 0001) and higher depression (p< 0. 0001). For all five PROs, final scores were significantly associated with baseline scores (p< 0. 0001). Time of dropout was significantly associated with final HRQOL (p= 0. 003), anxiety (p= 0. 05), depression (p= 0. 02) and optimism (p= 0. 02) scores. Depression, HRQOL and anxiety worsened at a faster rate overtime in dropouts than study completers. ConclusionsPoorer HRQOL and higher depression at baseline, and final HRQOL, anxiety, depression and optimism scores were predictive of time of dropout.

40|$|This thesis explores finite {{control in}} Korean. An {{overview}} of the previous studies of control shows that the mainstream literature on control has consistently argued that referential dependence between an overt matrix argument and an embedded null subject is characteristic of non-finite clauses which contain a PRO subject. Moreover, although some evidence for finite control involving pro in several languages has been presented, a <b>PRO</b> <b>analysis</b> of finite control has been firmly established in the literature. This thesis, however, argues that the currently established approach to Obligatory Control (OC), which is confined to PRO, cannot account for OC in Korean, and provides an empirical and theoretical analysis of finite control containing a pro subject in Korean. Although finite OC in Korean differs from non-finite OC in other languages in that the former can allow an overt NP coreferential with a matrix argument in the null subject position, finite OC in Korean displays the same properties of OC which are widely employed as the criteria for defining OC in non-finite clauses. This thesis adopts the formal approach to finiteness in which finiteness is defined as an ability of licensing nominative subjects. However, reviewing the cross-linguistic data in the literature reveals that the feature determining finiteness should not be restricted to just Tense and Agreement, as the formal approaches have argued, and that languages may vary in determining finiteness. It also explores the relevance of Mood and Modality as the manifestation of finiteness in Korean. Based on this, this thesis argues for the CP status of finite OC in Korean and a <b>pro</b> <b>analysis</b> of the null subject in the constructions. Through an investigation of six complementation types that have or have not been grouped under the types of control in the literature along with ninety matrix predicates which are classified into nine different categories based on their semantic class, this thesis further argues that OC in Korean cannot be explained by a solely syntax-based or semantically-based theory. OC in Korean is mainly the result of multiple semantic factors, but syntactic and pragmatic factors can {{also play a role}} in determining control...|$|E
