Objective: Our main objective {{was to determine whether}} the relation between <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> intake and nutrient adequacy could be explained, at least in part, by an association with overall dietary diversity. Methods: We used data from 1330 adults participating in the French Nutrition and Health Survey [Etude Nationale Nutrition Sante (ENNS); 2006 - 2007]. With the use of global, integrative approaches, we assessed nutrient adequacy (by using the probabilistic PANDiet (Probability of Adequate Nutrient Intake) scoring system] and overall dietary diversity (by using a 100 -point score that accounts for the relative number of subgroups consumed in 7 food groups). Linear multivariate modeling was used for the analysis. Results: We found a positive association between <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> (but not total or animal protein) intake and dietary diversity (beta = 0. 08) and a strong positive association between dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy (beta = 0. 33). However, the association between <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> intake and nutrient adequacy was not explained by dietary diversity (r= 0. 38 and partial r= 0. 36, P < 0. 0001).

The descriptive statistics of the socio-economic characteristics of proteinous food consumers show that majority (56. 7 %) of the household heads are about 40 years old, most (73 %) of the households’ heads are males, of which about 68 % are married. A high percentage of the households heads are well educated with mean household size of 4 and mean monthly income of N 15, 000. 00. The per capita expenditures on the two classes of proteinous source of foods indicate that the mean per capita expenditure (N 1266. 11) on animal protein source food (APSF) is greater than the per capita expenditures (N 239. 12) on <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> source food (PPSF).

Three groups of isonitrogenous (74. 1 +/- 0. 9 g N/kg dry matter) and isoenergetic (24. 7 +/- 0. 2 MJ gross energy) diets were formulated using L-Lys center dot HCL, crystalline amino acids and one of three <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> sources: wheat gluten (WG), maize gluten (MG) or a mixture of sesame oil cake (39 %) and wheat gluten (61 %) (SW). Each diet was offered to one group of 70 rainbow trout fry with an initial mean body weight of 0. 92 +/- 0. 01 g {{over a period of}} 30 days at 15 +/- 0. 6 degrees C. Lys utilization efficiency in fish was assessed by comparative regression analysis. The results showed that Lys gain, protein deposition, liveweight gain and voluntary feed intake increased linearly with increasing dietary Lys content or Lys intake (P< 0. 01). Voluntary feed intake was lower for fry fed the MG diets compared to fry fed the SW and WG diets at all levels of supplemental L-Lys center dot HCl.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research presented in this thesis was to evaluate multiple amino acidsupplemented <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates as the main protein source in diets for carnivorous fish. This objective was approached experimentally by: 1) Determining the effects of using <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates to provide 30 %, 50 %, and 95 % of total protein in extruded diets for rainbow trout and black sea bream on growth performance, feed utilization, and nutrient digestibility and retention; 2) Examining if combinations of different <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates diminishes {{the negative effects of}} anti-nutritional factors associated with single <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> sources when fed to carnivorous fish, thereby facilitating higher dietary <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> inclusions; 3) Evaluating the effects of dietary inclusion of <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates on fish physiology and health; 4) Assessing the efficiency of pre-treatment of <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates with phytase to improve utilization of minerals and macronutrients in rainbow trout; 5) Quantifying the changes in loss of nutrients to the environment by replacing high-quality fish meal with untreated or dephytinized <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates. The dietary <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates used in this thesis were all supplemented with multiple limiting amino acids and taurine. Four experiments were conducted, and the results are reported in four papers. Paper I (Optimal inclusion of lupin and pea protein concentrates in extruded diets for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)) focuses on the response of rainbow trout to nine extruded diets. These diets included eight <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> based diets formulated using four mixtures of lupin (LPC) and pea protein concentrates (PPC) (L/P ratio, 3 : 0, 2 : 1, 1 : 2 and 0 : 3) with two dietary inclusion levels (300 or 500 g <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> kg - 1 dietary protein) and one diet using LT-fish meal as the sole protein source (FM diet). The same nine diets, but with a lower level of oil coating, were also studied in black sea bream in Paper II (Mixtures of lupin and pea protein concentrates can efficiently replace high-quality fish meal in extruded diet for juvenile black sea bream (Acanthopagrus schlegeli)) In Paper III (Optimizing <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> combinations in fish meal-free diets for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by a mixture model) three <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> premixtures (P-MIX, C-MIX, and S-MIX) were prepared by mixing four protein concentrates. These were pea protein concentrates (PPC), canola protein concentrate (CPC), potato protein concentrate, and soy protein concentrate (SPC). Seven <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> based diets were formulated based on a mixture design using P-MIX, C-MIX, and S-MIX alone or in combinations to provide > 95 % of the dietary protein. These diets were supplemented with 5 % krill products as feeding attractant. One diet using LT-fish meal as the sole protein source (FM diet) was also produced. All diets were designed to contain equal amounts of digestible protein and digestible energy, and fed to rainbow trout. In Paper IV (Incubation of soy protein concentrate with phytase improves the nutritional value of a fish meal-free diet for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)), two of the diets from Paper III (the FM and SPC diets), and one additional experimental diet based on dephytinized SPC (DSPC diet) were fed to rainbow trout. In Papers I and II, the trout grew from 58 to 180 g during the 62 days of feeding, and the black sea bream grew from 13 to 46 g during 60 days. No significant differences in growth rate among dietary treatments were seen for either species. The only body composition parameter significantly affected by the diets in both experiments was ash, which could be ascribed to the presence of phytic acid in the <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates. The highest inclusion of 500 g <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates kg- 1, and the diets with the highest L/P ratio resulted in higher feed intake (FI) in black sea bream. No significant effects of diet on feed intake were observed in rainbow trout. The average feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 0. 72 g dry matter intake (g gain) - 1 in rainbow trout, and 1. 13 g g- 1 in black sea bream. The diets with the highest L/P ratio resulted in higher FCR in both species, due to the higher content of non-starch polysaccharides in LPC than in PPC. In rainbow trout, the apparent digestibility of starch was reduced as a consequence of increasing dietary LPC at both inclusion levels, while the digestibility of lipid was increased with increasing dietary LPC only at high inclusion level. The diet with the highest inclusion of PPC resulted in reduced maltase activity in the intestines of both trout and sea bream. Trout fed the diet with the highest inclusion of PPC tended to have a slight decrease in mucosal fold height and a slight increase in fold fusion. The energy retentions did not significantly differ between the FM and <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> diets in either species. Several of the plant protein-concentrate based diets resulted in similar or significantly higher nitrogen retentions in both species. The conclusion of the two papers was that any combination of essential amino acid (EAA) -fortified LPC and PPC can be efficiently used when total dietary <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> inclusion is limited to 300 g kg- 1. At higher inclusion, PPC seemed preferable. The reduced mineralization and tendencies of change in the intestinal physiology caused by the LPC and PPC require further attention. In Papers III and IV the trout grew from 61 to 214 g during 72 days of feeding, without significant differences in weight gain among dietary treatments. In both experiments, fish fed the <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> based diets had significantly higher feed intake, FCR, and metabolic nitrogen (N) loss than those fed the FM diet. Digestibility of most nutrients other than mineral elements, and body composition did not significantly differ from the fish fed the FM diet. The digestibility of energy and retentions of both N and energy were significantly lower in trout fed the plant concentrate diets. Fish fed diets with P-MIX, containing protein from pea and potato, exhibited inflammatory changes of mild or moderate severity in the distal intestine. The mixture model predicted different optimal diet formulations based on different response criteria. A combination of P-MIX and C-MIX gave most efficient feed conversion. The digestibility of N and amino acids were maximized when S-MIX was used alone. The digestibility of lipid and energy were maximized by a combination of P-MIX and S-MIX. Retention of ingested N was most efficient when combining P-MIX and S-MIX, while the highest retention of digested N was obtained by a combination of P-MIX and C-MIX. Using CMIX alone supported the highest digestibility and retention of P, and whole-body concentrations of ash, P, Ca and Mg. The reason was that the CPC in C-MIX had been incubated with phytase by the producer. Dephytinization of the SPC also resulted in significant improvements in the utilization of dietary P, as well as Ca and Mg. In addition, dephytinization of the SPC resulted in lower FCR, and increased digestible energy concentration in the diet. Both metabolic losses of N and faecal loss of energy were higher for the <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> diets than for the FM diet, while the faecal loss of P was higher for the FM diet. Dephytinization of SPC led to a reduction in faecal and metabolic loss of N and P, and faecal loss of energy. Considerable benefits both to secure the welfare of the fish and to minimize losses of P and N into water can thus be achieved by the use of dephytinized <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> concentrates in fish feeds...|$|R
