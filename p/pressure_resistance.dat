50|$|To {{achieve a}} better <b>pressure</b> <b>resistance,</b> hoses can be {{reinforced}} with fibers or a steel cord. Commonly used reinforcement methods are braiding, spiraling, knitting and wrapping of fabric plies. The reinforcement increases the <b>pressure</b> <b>resistance</b> {{but also the}} stiffness. To obtain flexibility, corrugations or bellows are used. Usually, circumferential or helical reinforcement rings are applied to maintain these corrugated or bellowed structures under internal pressure.|$|E

40|$|A {{non-linear}} behaviour in {{the resistance}} of tellurium {{as a function of}} pressure has been observed. At each <b>pressure</b> the <b>resistance</b> shows a time variation. At lower <b>pressures,</b> the normalized <b>resistance</b> increases with time, and at higher <b>pressures,</b> the normalized <b>resistance</b> decreases exponentially as a function of time. This change in behaviour with respect to time occurs in the region of the steepest descent in the <b>resistance</b> versus <b>pressure</b> plot. However, the magnitude of the change in the resistance with time is small compared to a change in the <b>resistance</b> with <b>pressure.</b> The origin of this behaviour is suggested to be linked with the generation and annealing of localized charged defects...|$|R

Second, intravascular access simplifies experimental protocols, keeps the animals’ temperature stable and allows repeated measurements over time. Third, in this experimental model, the animal is its own control, with absolute measurements of flow, <b>pressure,</b> <b>resistances</b> and heart rate, which helps our understanding and interpretation of results.|$|R

50|$|Corrugated hoses {{are used}} as economical, {{flexible}} connecting elements that permit movement, thermal expansion and vibrations, {{and that can be}} used as filling hoses. The starting material is a seamless or longitudinally welded, thin-walled tube into which corrugations are introduced by mechanical or hydraulic means using special tools. Corrugated hoses are absolutely leak-tight and are used to convey liquids or gases under pressure or as vacuum lines. They are also referred to as pressure hoses. Their special design achieves both flexibility and <b>pressure</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{braiding}} also greatly {{increases the}} resistance of the hose to internal pressure. The braid flexibly moulds itself to the movement of the hose. This applies even if a second braiding is used, which further increases <b>pressure</b> <b>resistance.</b> The method by which the braiding is attached to the connection fittings depends on the type of fitting and the demands on the hose. Under rough operating conditions, an additional round wire coil can be wound over the braid or the braid can be sheathed in a protective hose.|$|E
50|$|The {{universal}} {{expansion joint}} can absorb not only axial movements but angular and lateral movements as well. It {{consists of two}} metal bellows with an intermediate pipe and connectors on both sides. As a special form of the axial expansion joint, the universal expansion joint has only a limited <b>pressure</b> <b>resistance</b> for stability reasons and, moreover, loads the adjacent pipe supports with the axial compressive force resulting from the internal pressure. It is usually used to compensate large axial and lateral movements at low pressure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flexibility}} of the hose is achieved {{by means of the}} elastic behaviour of the corrugation profile. When the hose is bent, the outer corrugations separate while the inner corrugations are squeezed together. The flexibility, bending behaviour and pressure stability of corrugated hoses depend on the selected profile shape. While flexibility increases with an increase in profile height and a decrease in corrugation spacing, <b>pressure</b> <b>resistance</b> decreases. The frequently required semi-flexible bending behaviour is achieved by flat profiles. Depending {{on the use of the}} hose, special application-specific profile shapes can be implemented ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} {{incidence}} of raised pulmonary artery <b>pressure</b> and <b>resistance</b> in adults with isolated atrial septal defect within the oval fossa (so called secundum defect) or sinus venosus defect.  DESIGN—A historical, retrospective, unrandomised study.  SETTING—A tertiary referral centre.  METHODS—Cardiac catheterisation was performed in all patients, with measurement of pulmonary artery <b>pressure</b> and <b>resistance.</b> Pulmonary to systemic flow ratio was calculated using the Fick principle. Pulmonary {{hypertension was defined as}} mean pulmonary artery pressure >  30 mm Hg, and increased resistance as an Rp/Rs ratio >  0. 3.  PATIENTS—All patients with a secundum atrial septal or sinus venosus defect who presented between July 1988  and December 1997  were enrolled in the study.  RESULTS—Pulmonary artery <b>pressure</b> and <b>resistance</b> in the patients with sinus venosus defect (n =  31) was higher than in patients with atrial septal defect (n =  138). Pulmonary hypertension was present in 26 % of patients with sinus venosus and in 9 % of patients with atrial septal defect. The incidence of raised pulmonary vascular resistance was 16 % in patients with sinus venosus and 4 % in patients with atrial septal defect. The increase in resistance occurred at a younger age in sinus venosus defect than in atrial septal defect.  CONCLUSIONS—Patients with sinus venosus defect have higher pulmonary <b>pressures</b> and <b>resistances</b> and develop these complications at younger age than patients with atrial septal defects. Thus they should be managed differently than patients with "simple" atrial septal defects.    Keywords: sinus venosus defect; atrial septal defect; pulmonary hypertension; congenital heart defect...|$|R
