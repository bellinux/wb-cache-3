5|$|In 1882 Stowe {{purchased}} {{a plot of}} land in Mandarin on the St. Johns to build the Mandarin Church of Our Saviour, the dedication of which she attended. The windows of the church were installed by its benefactors. Calvin's health began to fade and in 1884 the Stowe family left Mandarin forever {{to spend the rest}} of their years in Hartford. He died two years later and Stowe asked to add a window in the Mandarin church in his memory, but it remained <b>plain</b> <b>glass</b> for 30 years. The church's parishioners remained so loyal to Stowe that they neglected to suggest an alternate plan for the window. Stowe declined into a childlike state after 1894, losing much of her memory but keeping her fascination with plants and flowers as she would wander Hartford exclaiming over those she came across. She died in 1896.|$|E

25|$|The oldest records found {{indicate}} that this structure was built in 1885 consisting of a one-story building organized around two identical anterior courtyards. This original spatial distribution is still preserved. The southern half was altered in 1928 after the 1918 earthquake damaged part of this side. During this remodeling a second story was added to this half. This southern facade is set back from the street by a fence and front yard. Its main element is the entrance portico articulated by flat tuscan pilasters and three arches, the central one slightly protruding to the front (This portico {{is part of the}} original 1885 construction). Over the portico, separated by cornice and parapet with the building's name in sans serif letters. Other decorative elements at this level include overhangs, a segmental round cornice over the recessed center window, louvered casement windows with segmental round openings and <b>plain</b> <b>glass</b> transoms and a rosette on top of the center recess between the two volumes. In contrast, the first floor of this south facade presents large rectangular windows with wide planar moldings and a simple cornice with a segmental pyramidal profile on the top molding, a cornice and rectangular windows with false segmental arch crowned by an equally false keystone all part of the original 1885 construction.|$|E

40|$|Prismatic {{adaptation}} {{has been}} shown to induce a realignment of visuoproprioceptive representations and to involve parietocerebellar networks. We have investigated in humans how far other types of functions known to involve the parietal cortex are influenced by a brief exposure to prismatic adaptation. Normal subjects underwent an fMRI evaluation before and after a brief session of prismatic adaptation using rightward deviating prisms for one group or after an equivalent session using <b>plain</b> <b>glasses</b> for the other group. Activation patterns to three tasks were analyzed: (1) visual detection; (2) visuospatial short-term memory; and (3) verbal short-term memory. The prismatic adaptation-related changes were found bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobule when prisms, but not <b>plain</b> <b>glasses,</b> were used. This effect was driven by selective changes during the visual detection task: an increase in neural activity was induced on the left and a decrease on the right parietal side after prismatic adaptation. Comparison of activation patterns after prismatic adaptation on the visual detection task demonstrated a significant increase of the ipsilateral field representation in the left inferior parietal lobule and a significant decrease in the right inferior parietal lobule. In conclusion, a brief exposure to prismatic adaptation modulates differently left and right parietal activation during visual detection but not during short-term memory. Furthermore, the visuospatial representation within the inferior parietal lobule changes, with a decrease of the ipsilateral hemifield representation on the right and increase on the left side, suggesting thus a left hemispheric dominance...|$|R

500|$|The {{church had}} much stained glass in 1622 that {{disappeared}} during the Reformation. The current eleven coloured glass {{windows on the}} north, west and south sides of the church were erected in 1879 by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake, each being named for its donor; the scenes depicted tell the Life of Christ from the Annunciation to the Last Supper. The stained glass in the chancel and the Hasting Chapel was erected in 1924, and most was once in the castle; the earliest glass is a German, Swiss and Flemish work possibly originally from Farleigh Hungerford. The chancel's east window contains arms of RichardI and EdwardI and the south window includes [...] "The Magi bearing gifts" [...] and the arms of Catherine Parr. The Hastings Chapel south window has several panels from the 15th and 16th centuries, and one which could possibly be {{as old as the}} 13th century.

500|$|Fender {{completed}} the double in 1922 with 1,169 runs and 157 wickets, Surrey {{finished third in}} the Championship, and once again the lack of effective bowling hindered the team. Wisden described the team's success as [...] "nothing less than a triumph for Mr Fender". Despite damp weather which did not suit his style, he bowled more than his share of overs, often because there were few alternative bowlers. Wisden said: [...] "Essentially a change bowler —the best in England, as he has been aptly described—he became by force of circumstances the chief attacking force". He bowled mainly leg spin, but often bowled successfully at medium pace. Wisden praised his inspirational captaincy, and concluded: [...] "Over and above all this he was, by general consent, by far the best of the county captains, never losing his grip of the game and managing his side with a judgement that was seldom at fault." [...] During the season, Fender began to wear glasses in an attempt to cure headaches; the remedy worked, although he later discovered {{there was nothing wrong with}} his eyesight, and the lenses he wore were little more than <b>plain</b> <b>glass.</b> The first time he wore glasses, Fender scored 185 in 130 minutes against Hampshire. Other rapid scoring feats included 91 in 50 minutes against Leicestershire and 137 in 90 minutes against Kent. There were no Tests in 1922, but Sydney Pardon wrote that Fender was the only amateur who could be guaranteed a place on ability alone in an England team. Late in the season, Fender was involved in a public dispute with Lord Harris over the qualification of Alfred Jeacocke to play for Surrey. Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent, had noticed that Jeacocke's qualification had lapsed when he moved across the border from Surrey to Kent, albeit living on the same road. Fender, privately furious with Harris, publicly defended Jeacocke, and the press supported him; the rules were altered the following season to allow Jeacocke to continue to play for Surrey.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Strength and {{stress-strain}} {{properties are}} investigated for <b>plain</b> woven <b>glass</b> fiber laminates using thin tubular specimens under biaxial static and cyclic loadings. Some composites show large distortion and fiber reorientation close to failure under biaxial load-ing. For such composites {{the usage of}} the 2 nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress instead of the nominal stress is proposed for strength evaluation. The experimental result reveals that the Tsai-Wu criterion fits the biaxial strength expressed by the 2 nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress {{much better than the}} strength expressed by the nominal stress. Strong interaction between axial and shear deformations is found beyond the knee/yield points while, within the elastic range no interaction is found between the axial and shear stiffness. Fiber misalignment with the loading axis affects the observed stress-strain behavior under cyclic loading. More than two S-S curves are distinguishable when the fiber misalignment is higher than 2 &deg;. Such stress-strain relations are successfully simulated using an incremental method in conjunc-tion with updating fiber orientation. Good agreement between the calculated result and ex-perimental one confirms that the proposed model which considers fiber misalignment can explain the observed stress-strain response under biaxial fatigue loading.
