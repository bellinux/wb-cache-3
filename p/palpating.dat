25|$|Psoas can be palpated {{with active}} flexion of the hip. A {{positive}} psoas contracture test and pain with palpation {{reported by the}} patient indicate clinical significance. Care should be taken around the abdominal organs, especially the colon when <b>palpating</b> deeply.|$|E
25|$|The common {{carotid artery}} {{is often used}} in {{measuring}} the pulse, especially in patients who are in shock and who lack a detectable pulse in the more peripheral arteries of the body. The pulse is taken by <b>palpating</b> the artery just deep to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle {{at the level of}} the superior border of the thyroid cartilage.|$|E
25|$|A mid-diastolic {{rumbling}} murmur with presystolic accentuation will {{be heard}} after the opening snap. The murmur is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope. Its duration increases with worsening disease. Rolling the patient toward left as well as isometric exercise will accentuate the murmur. A thrill might be present when <b>palpating</b> at the apical region of the precordium.|$|E
50|$|The {{scaphoid}} can be <b>palpated</b> at {{the base}} of the anatomical snuff box. It can also be <b>palpated</b> in the volar (palmar) hand/wrist. Its position is the intersections of the long axes of the four fingers while in a fist, or the base of the thenar eminence. When <b>palpated</b> in this position, the bone will be felt to slide forward during radial deviation (wrist abduction) and flexion.|$|R
50|$|After {{a visual}} exam, the {{practitioner}} <b>palpates</b> the horse, feeling for heat, swelling, {{and sensitivity to}} pressure indicating pain. Palpation is usually most thoroughly performed in the lower limb, but a comprehensive exam will include palpation of the back, pelvis, and neck. Joints should be <b>palpated</b> for pain, effusion of joint pouches, thickening of the joint capsule, and checked for range of motion. Major ligaments and tendons, such as the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, inferior check ligament, suspensory ligament, and distal sesamoidean ligaments, should also be <b>palpated</b> along their entire length. Individual bones may be <b>palpated</b> if injury is suspected, such as a fracture, bucked shins in racehorses (cannon bones), or splints (splint bones).|$|R

25|$|The {{volume of}} the {{testicle}} can be estimated by <b>palpating</b> it and comparing it to ellipsoids of known sizes. Another method is to use calipers (an orchidometer) or a ruler either on the person or on an ultrasound image to obtain the three measurements of the x, y, and z axes (length, depth and width). These measurements can then be {{used to calculate the}} volume, using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid: 4/3 π × (length/2) × (width/2) × (depth/2).|$|E
25|$|One form of {{instruction}} {{is where a}} medical professional, a preceptor, teaches the medical student how to perform the examination using a simulated patient as the model. However the preferred mode {{of instruction}} {{is to use a}} teaching associate. The teaching associate will guide the medical student or nurse practitioner trainee through the examination process using their own body as the teaching tool. They will advise the student on such things as how minimize embarrassment for the patient, how to position the patient, what to explain to the patient, where to probe, and how much pressure to apply when <b>palpating.</b>|$|E
25|$|Larger tonsilloliths {{may cause}} {{multiple}} symptoms, including recurrent halitosis, which frequently accompanies a tonsil infection, sore throat, white debris, a bad taste {{in the back}} of the throat, difficulty swallowing, ear ache, and tonsil swelling. A medical study conducted in 2007 found an association between tonsilloliths and bad breath in patients with a certain type of recurrent tonsillitis. Among those with bad breath, 75% of the subjects had tonsilloliths, while only 6% of subjects with normal halitometry values (normal breath) had tonsilloliths. A foreign body sensation may also exist {{in the back of}} the throat. The condition may also be an asymptomatic condition, with detection upon <b>palpating</b> a hard intratonsillar or submucosal mass.|$|E
30|$|The femoral {{epicondyle}} is <b>palpated</b> and identified, preferentially before ACL femoral socket drilling. A 15  mm incision is {{made just}} proximal to the epicondyle and the ITB is divided. The lateral epicondyle is then <b>palpated</b> and a position taken 8  mm proximal and 4  mm posterior to the lateral epicondyle. A 2.4  mm drill pin is then inserted.|$|R

500|$|A 1981 {{case study}} {{reported}} that stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall made the area grow by fifty percent and that self-reported levels of arousal/orgasm were [...] "deeper" [...] when the G-spot was stimulated. Another study, in 1983, examined eleven women by <b>palpating</b> the entire vagina in a clockwise fashion, and reported a specific response to stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall {{in four of the}} women, concluding that the area is the G-spot. In a 1990 study, an anonymous questionnaire was distributed to 2,350 professional women in the United States and Canada with a subsequent 55% return rate. Of these respondents, 40% reported having a fluid release (ejaculation) at the moment of orgasm, and 82% of the women who reported the sensitive area (Gräfenberg spot) also reported ejaculation with their orgasms. Several variables were associated with this perceived existence of female ejaculation.|$|E
500|$|Soring can be also {{detected}} by observing the horse for lameness, assessing its stance and <b>palpating</b> the lower legs. Some trainers evaded detection from inspectors by training horses not {{to react to}} the pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching after the sored area is touched. The practice is called [...] "stewarding", in reference to the horse show steward. Others use topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine and benzocaine, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Use of chemicals can be completely avoided if pressure shoeing is also used. This process involves placing some type of hard foreign object (such as a small piece of wood, stone, hard acrylic, or sharp object such as a tack or nail) against the sole of the horse's foot before applying the horseshoe and pads. [...] It can also be done by trimming down the horse's hoof to its sensitive structures, then shoeing. Either method causes pain when the horse places its foot on the ground.|$|E
500|$|Soring can be {{detected}} by observing the horse for lameness, assessing its stance and <b>palpating</b> the lower legs. Some trainers trick inspectors by training horses not {{to react to the}} pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching when the sored area is touched. The practice is sometimes called [...] "stewarding", in reference to the horse show steward. Some trainers use topical anesthetics, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Pressure shoeing is also used, eliminating use of chemicals altogether. Trainers who sore their horses have been observed leaving the show grounds when they find that the more stringent federal inspection teams are present. Although illegal under federal law for over 40 years, soring is still practiced and criminal charges have been filed against people who violate the Act. Enforcement of the HPA is difficult, due to limited inspection budgets and problems with lax enforcement by inspectors who are hired by the shows they were to police. As a result, while in 1999 there were eight certified HIOs, by 2010, only three organizations remained certified as HIOs, all known to be actively working to end soring.|$|E

2500|$|When {{breeding}} live cover, {{the mare}} is usually boarded at the stud. She may be [...] "teased" [...] several {{times with a}} stallion that will not breed to her, usually with the stallion being presented to the mare over a barrier. Her reaction to the teaser, whether hostile or passive, is noted. A mare that is in heat will generally tolerate a teaser (although {{this is not always}} the case), and may present herself to him, holding her tail to the side. A veterinarian may also determine if the mare is ready to be bred, by ultrasound or <b>palpating</b> daily to determine if ovulation has occurred. Live cover can also be done in liberty on a paddock or on pasture, although due to safety and efficacy concerns, it is not common at professional breeding farms.|$|E
2500|$|Patients with {{symptoms}} of CAP require evaluation. Diagnosis of pneumonia is made clinically, {{rather than on}} the basis of a particular test. Evaluation begins with a physical examination by a health provider, which may reveal fever, an increased respiratory rate (tachypnea), low blood pressure (hypotension), a fast heart rate (tachycardia) and changes in the amount of oxygen in the blood. <b>Palpating</b> the chest as it expands and tapping the chest wall (percussion) to identify dull, non-resonant areas can identify stiffness and fluid, signs of CAP. Listening to the lungs with a stethoscope (auscultation) can also reveal signs associated with CAP. A lack of normal breath sounds or the presence of crackles can indicate fluid consolidation. Increased vibration of the chest when speaking, known as tactile fremitus, and increased volume of whispered speech during auscultation can also indicate fluid.|$|E

50|$|On {{clinical}} examination, it {{is important}} to evaluate the exact location of the pain, the range of motion and the condition of the nerves and vessels. It is important to <b>palpate</b> the calf bone (fibula) because there may be an associated fracture proximally (Maisonneuve fracture), and to <b>palpate</b> the sole of the foot to look for a Jones fracture at the base of fifth metatarsal (avulsion fracture).|$|R
