25|$|<b>Proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> (a {{variant of}} levator ani syndrome) is a severe, episodic {{pain in the}} regions of the rectum and anus. It {{can be caused by}} cramp of the levator ani muscle, {{particularly}} in the pubococcygeal part.|$|E
25|$|During an episode, {{the patient}} feels spasm-like, {{sometimes}} excruciating, {{pain in the}} anus, often misinterpreted as a need to defecate. The pain must arise de novo, that is in absence of clear cause. As such, pain associated with penetrative anal intercourse, trauma or rectal foreign body insertion preclude a diagnosis of <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax.</b> Simultaneous stimulation of the local autonomic system can cause erection in males. In some people, twinges sometimes occur shortly after orgasm. Because of {{the high incidence of}} internal anal sphincter thickening with the disorder, it is thought to be a disorder of the internal anal sphincter or that it is a neuralgia of pudendal nerves. It is recurrent and there is also no known cure. However, some studies show effective use of botulinum toxin, pudendal nerve block, and calcium channel blockers. It is not known to be linked to any disease process and data on the number of people afflicted vary, but prevalence may be as high as 8–18%. It is thought that only 17–20% of sufferers consult a physician, so obtaining accurate data on occurrence presents a challenge.|$|E
50|$|Perineodynia means perineal {{pain and}} {{includes}} vulvodynia and <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax.</b> Pudendal neuralgia {{is one of}} the main causes of perineodynia.|$|E
40|$|Pudendal nerve entrapment. We {{prefer the}} term {{neuralgia}} rather than pudendal nerve entrapment {{because so many}} of our patients have relief following self-care or pudendal nerve blocks (see treatment below). Entrapment can only be observed at surgery. Definition: Pudendal neuralgia • perineal and other pelvic pain that is aggravated by sitting and reduced or relieved by sitting on a toilet seat. • The “pudendal territory ” is extensive and may include suprapubic, inguinal, genital and perineal pain, vulvodynia, coccydynia, and <b>proctalgia</b> (proctitis <b>fugax).</b> • Bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction are common Pathophysiology and variations in symptoms. Pudendal neuropathy is a functional entrapment where pain occurs during a compression or stretch maneuver. Causes include: cycling, fitness exercises; stretch due to constipation and childbirth; youthful sports, falls onto the buttocks; iatrogenic neuropathy (vaginal surgery, suture entrapment) and pelvic radiation. Central sensitization {{plays an important role in}} aggravation and maintenance of symptoms in many patients. Evidence of central sensitization (spinal cord wind-up) includes aggravation of pelvic pains follows sexual arousal (e. g. reading a sexually explicit novel); foreign body sensation in the rectum, vagina, urethra, or perineum is frequent. Sensations include a golf ball, a red-hot bowling ball, a pine cone, a fist, or even a stovepipe. The size of the object varies with intensity of the pain and disappears following successful treatment of neuropathy. Sacral cord neuroplasticity cause pains in the calf, and the dorsum, arch, and toes of the feet that are aggravated during pain flares and eliminated after treatment...|$|R
5000|$|Variants of levator ani {{syndrome}} include <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> (fleeting {{pain in the}} rectum) and coccydynia (pain in the coccygeal region). <b>Proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> and levator ani syndrome {{have not}} {{been found to be}} of psychosomatic origin, although stressful events may trigger attacks. Patients with levator ani syndrome also have [...] "significant elevations on the hypochondriasis, depression, and hysteria scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory," [...] which is also the case in general among chronic pain sufferers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> (a {{variant of}} levator ani syndrome) is a severe, episodic {{pain in the}} regions of the rectum and anus. It {{can be caused by}} cramp of the levator ani muscle, {{particularly}} in the pubococcygeal part.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{more highly}} common causes of {{functional}} anorectal pain are levator ani syndrome (LAS) and <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax.</b> Both {{of these conditions}} {{are thought to be}} caused by muscle spasms of the either the levator ani muscle or the anal sphincter muscle respectively, and may overlap symptomatically with a third less-common condition called coccygodynia which is the result of previous trauma to the coccyx bone. Stress, prolonged sitting, and constipation all seem to be associated with LAS. The majority (90%) of those reporting chronic episodes of such pain are women. Some researchers group these conditions under the medical category of [...] "tension myalgia of the pelvic floor". Less than a third of those experiencing these conditions seek medical treatment for them. Treatment can involve the use of antispasmotic medications as well as the down-training (conscious involvement and relaxation of previously unconscious muscle movements) so that spasms occur less frequently or not at all.|$|E
40|$|A {{report is}} made of the {{successful}} use of oral clonidine for <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> by the author on himself. The author, a 30 year old otherwise healthy man, has been having attacks of <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> for several years. He had hitherto left the condition untreated. Last year, in a severe attack, he tried oral clonidine 150 micrograms twice a day and {{found it to be}} dramatically effective. He was completely relieved in three days and tapered off the drug thereafter. A further attack of <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> after a month was again treated successfully with oral clonidine. The presumed aetiology of <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> is discussed and the possible mechanism of action of clonidine in this condition is outlined. Further trials of clonidine appear to be worthwhile for this condition which has been described as incurable...|$|E
40|$|The {{syndrome}} called <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> may be {{a repository}} of various conditions, {{because there are no}} distinctive signs or supporting tests. Usually, the pain of this condition is described as cramping, gnawing or tight, and lasts about ten to 15 minutes. It occurs most frequently at night and is localized to the rectal region above the anus. One subgroup may be diagnosed by the existence of a `shelf sign' in the rectum. This shelf is probably caused by pubococcygeus spasm. Patients suffering from <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> tend to be perfectionists and above average in intelligence. A literature review and the case history of one patient illustrate the difficulties, frustrations and pitfalls associated with this incurable condition...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> (PF) is a benign, {{self-limiting}} disease characterized by episodes of intense anorectal pain at fre-quent intervals {{in the absence}} of organic proctological disease. Even though PF was described more than a century ago, its etiolo-gy remains unclear. Currently there is no information available...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <b>Proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> is {{a common}} problem, yet its {{pathophysiology}} is poorly understood. The objective was to characterise colorectal disturbances in a paraplegic patient with a 10 year history of <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> that began two years after an attack of transverse myelitis. METHODS: Standard anorectal manometry and prolonged 33 hour ambulatory colonic manometry at six sites in the colon were performed together with myoelectrical recording of the anus. Provocative tests designed to simulate psychological and physical stress and two types of meals were included. RESULTS: Anorectal manometry showed normal internal sphincter tone and normal rectoanal inhibitory reflex but an inability to squeeze or to bear down or to expel a simulated stool. Rectal sensation (up to 360 ml inflation) was absent. Pudendal nerve latency was prolonged (4. 5 ms (normal 3. 2 mv), high frequency (5 - 50 /min) anal myoelectrical activity, particularly after stress tests, meals, and at night. The myoelectrical disturbance only occurred with proctalgia. Intermittently, 16 bursts of 3 cycles/ min phasic rectal contractions were seen, but only six were associated with proctalgia. Colonic motility was reduced compared with normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The temporal association between a high amplitude, high frequency myoelectrical activity of the anal sphincter, and the occurrence of proctalgia suggests that paroxysmal hyperkinesis of the anus may cause <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} the {{functional}} anorectal disorders, {{the etiology of}} which is currently unknown or related to the abnormal functioning of normally innervated and structurally intact muscles, are discussed. These disorders include functional fecal incontinence, functional anorectal pain, including levator ani syndrome and <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax,</b> and pelvic floor dyssynergia. The epidemiology of each disorder is defined and discussed, their pathophysiology is summarized and diagnostic approaches and treatment are suggested. Some suggestions for the direction of future research on these disorders are also given.    Keywords: fecal incontinence; pelvic floor dyssynergia; anismus; proctalgia fugax; levator ani syndrome; constipation; Rome I...|$|E
40|$|A second {{family with}} {{hereditary}} <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> and internal anal sphincter hypertrophy associated with constipation is described. Anorectal ultrasonography, manometry, and sensory {{tests were conducted}} in two symptomatic and one asymptomatic subjects within the same family and further clinical information was obtained from other family members. The inheritance would correspond to an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetration, presenting after the second decade of life. Physiological studies showed deep, ultraslow waves and an absence of internal anal sphincter relaxation on rectal distension in the two most severely affected family members, suggesting {{the possibility of a}} neuropathic origin. Both of these patients had an abnormally high blood pressure. After treatment with a sustained release formulation of the calcium antagonist, nifedipine, their blood pressure returned to normal, anal tone was reduced, and the frequency and intensity of anal pain was suppressed. These together improved the quality of the patients' sleep, which had previously been very troubled because of night time attacks of anal pain...|$|E
40|$|Pain is {{a common}} feature in {{functional}} gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). An abnormally low visceral sensory threshold, {{as well as a}} number of central, spinal and peripheral pain-modulating abnormalities, have been proposed for this syndrome. Clinical aspects of pain associated with irritable esophagus, functional dyspepsia, biliary dysmotility, inflammatory bowel syndrome and <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> are reviewed. Because of its unclear pathophysiology, pain expression is the main target for the successful assessment and management of symptomatic FGID. The sensory, cognitive and affective components of pain intensity expression need to be addressed in the context of a good physician-patient rapport. A multidisciplinary team approach is ideal for the smaller subset of patients with severe and disabling symptoms. Although pharmacotherapy may target specific functional disorders, the role of behavioural techniques and psychotherapy appears much more important for pain management in FGID. Functional performance and quality of life improvement, rather than pain intensity, are the main therapeutic goals in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} clinical {{manifestation of}} unspecified functional bowel disorder (UFBD), {{the features of}} coexistence with functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) and its relationship with psychological factors and sleep disturbance in the Chinese Army servicemen. Methods　cFGIDs were diagnosed based on the Rome Ⅲ Modular Questionnaire. The subjects were 189 servicemen with UFBD (UFBD group) and 372 without FGID (control group). All subjects completed symptom checklist 90 (SCL- 90) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Results　'Have to rush to the toilet when having a desire to defecate' was the most frequent symptom of UFBD (93. 7 %). More than one half of UFBD patients had the symptom 'a feeling of incomplete emptying as bowel movements' or 'straining during bowel movements'. Twenty-eight percent of UFBD subjects had combined FGID (namely cFGID). Among them, the most frequent was <b>proctalgia</b> <b>fugax</b> (7. 9 %), followed by cyclic vomiting syndrome (6. 3 %), functional fecal incontinence (6. 3 %), functional dyspepsia (4. 8 %) and belching (4. 8 %). The UFBD group {{scored significantly higher than}} the control group in the global severity index (GSI) and in all SCL- 90 subscales (P 0. 05). Conclusion　Pathogenesis of UFBD may be closely correlated with psychiatric and psychological factors and sleep disturbance. cFGID are associated with an increased severity of psychopathological features.
