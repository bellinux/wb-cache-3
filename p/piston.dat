5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot <b>piston</b> design. The {{idea was to}} use a second <b>piston</b> (located within the primary <b>piston)</b> to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter of}} the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
5|$|Flamethrower, double <b>piston</b> and gunpowder-activated: Although {{the single}} <b>piston</b> {{flamethrower}} was first {{developed in the}} Byzantine Empire during the 7th century, the 10th-century Chinese flamethrower, or Pen Huo Qi, boasted a continuous stream of flame by employing double <b>piston</b> syringes (which had been known since the Han Dynasty) spouting Greek fire which had been imported from China's maritime trade contacts in the Middle East. It was first used in battle 932 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), and the earliest illustration {{is found in the}} early Song Dynasty military manuscript Wujing Zongyao of 1044, which also described the device in full. Unlike the Greek model which employed a furnace, the Pen Huo Qi was ignited by an incendiary gunpowder fuse.|$|E
5000|$|In the straight-4 configuration, the two end <b>pistons</b> (<b>pistons</b> 1 and 4) reach TDC simultaneously, {{as do the}} two centre <b>pistons</b> (<b>pistons</b> 2 and 3), {{but these}} two pairs reach TDC with an angular {{displacement}} of 180°. Similar patterns are found in almost all straight engines with even numbers of cylinders, with the two end <b>pistons</b> and two middle <b>pistons</b> moving together (not necessarily 180° out of phase however) and the intermediate <b>pistons</b> moving in pairs in mirror-image around {{the centre of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pistons</b> {{are cast}} from {{aluminium}} alloys. For better strength and fatigue life, some racing <b>pistons</b> may be forged instead. Early <b>pistons</b> were of cast iron, {{but there were}} obvious benefits for engine balancing if a lighter alloy could be used. To produce <b>pistons</b> that could survive engine combustion temperatures, {{it was necessary to}} develop new alloys such as Y alloy and Hiduminium, specifically for use as <b>pistons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Matti Holtzberg first {{attempted}} to make polymer <b>pistons</b> for an Austin Mini engine in 1969. The <b>pistons</b> ran for only 20 minutes until failure. Holtzberg remedied this by fitting the <b>pistons</b> with aluminium crowns and he sold these <b>pistons</b> to racing builders during the early 1970s.|$|R

5|$|The Rolls-Royce Merlin is a British liquid-cooled V-12 <b>piston</b> {{aero engine}} of 27-litres (1,650cu in) capacity. Rolls-Royce {{designed}} {{the engine and}} first ran it in 1933 as a private venture. Initially known as the PV-12, it was later called Merlin following the company convention of naming its <b>piston</b> aero engines after birds of prey.|$|E
5|$|Like modern crocodilians, pterosaurs {{appeared}} {{to have had a}} hepatic <b>piston,</b> seeing as their shoulder-pectoral girdles were too inflexible to move the sternum as in birds, and they possessed strong gastralia. Thus, their respiratory system had characteristics comparable to both modern archosaur clades.|$|E

5|$|A flying ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat (The Germans traditionally set the threshold at 10 victories.). During World War II, hundreds of German Luftwaffe fighter pilots achieved this feat flying contemporary <b>piston</b> engine fighter aircraft. However, only 28 pilots are credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft while flying a jet-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Despite having {{settled on}} a new {{standard}} type, Gresley continued to experiment on individual locomotives, in one of which experiments ACFI feedwater heaters were installed in A1 2576 The White Knight and A3 2580 Shotover. However, on the Pacifics the increase in efficiency was deemed insufficient and the apparatus was eventually removed. In 1935, number 2544 Lemberg received Trofimoff <b>piston</b> valves of an ingenious design with automatically varying steam passages.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July, while {{conducting}} patrols off the Albanian coast, a <b>piston</b> in U-21s {{diesel engine}} broke and Dürrial put in at Djenovic. On 25 July, U-21 was towed to Pola, where she remained {{until the end}} of the war. She was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920. Like all of her sister boats, U-21 had no wartime successes.|$|E

5|$|Overseen by Cyril Lovesey, {{flight testing}} {{commenced}} on 4 August 1929 {{in the new}} Supermarine S.6 at RAF Calshot, a seaplane and flying boat station on Southampton Water in Hampshire. During pre-race scrutineering tests, metal particles were found {{on two of the}} engine's 24 spark plugs indicating a <b>piston</b> failure which would require an engine re-build or replacement. The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to the foresight of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged <b>piston</b> replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition.|$|E
5|$|However, Chase had {{designed}} the aircraft {{to allow for}} the easy installation of engines; the first XG-20 had already been modified with two radial <b>piston</b> engines, becoming the XC-123, the prototype of the long-serving C-123 Provider family of transports. Meanwhile, the second prototype XG-20 was returned to Chase Aircraft, to be fitted with two twin pods for General Electric J47 turbojets, becoming the XC-123A, the first jet-powered transport aircraft built in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A <b>piston</b> extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E

5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic <b>piston</b> method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Sprint was {{the primary}} weapon of Nike-X as {{originally}} conceived; {{it would have been}} placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered <b>piston.</b> The missile was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR as soon as it became visible. A transponder in the missile could respond to signals from either the MAR or MSR for accurate tracking.|$|E
5|$|The Blackburn Firebrand was a British {{single-engine}} strike fighter for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy designed during World War II by Blackburn Aircraft. Originally {{intended to}} serve as a pure fighter, its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre <b>piston</b> engine by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its load-carrying capability. Development was slow and the first production aircraft was not delivered until {{after the end of the}} war. Only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953.|$|E

5|$|The Hsinchu Station is an oval-shaped {{space with}} a curved {{parallelogram}} roof. It is designed {{to respond to the}} sunlight and winds in Hsinchu. The cladding of the roof is durable stainless steel. It keeps the maintenance easier and enhances the high-tech image. The roof opens up over the platform and rail to avoid a <b>piston</b> effect and the style responds to the local environment. The station has become the new landmark of Hsinchu.|$|E
5|$|The Ryan FR Fireball was a mixed-power (<b>piston</b> and jet-powered) fighter {{aircraft}} {{designed by}} Ryan Aeronautical for the United States Navy during World War II. It was the Navy's first aircraft with a jet engine. Only 66 aircraft were built before Japan surrendered in August 1945. The FR-1 Fireball equipped a single squadron {{before the end}} of the war, but did not see combat. The aircraft ultimately proved to lack the structural strength required for operations aboard aircraft carriers and was withdrawn in mid-1947.|$|E
5|$|The U-boat {{conducted}} patrols off the Albanian {{coast in}} October 1917, but experienced {{the failure of}} the seal on her main hatch. The repairs kept the boat out of action until June 1918. But in July a <b>piston</b> in her diesel engine broke, knocking the submarine out {{of the rest of the}} war. At the end of World War I, U-21 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920. U-21 had no wartime successes.|$|E
