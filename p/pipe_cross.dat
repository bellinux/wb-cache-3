The report {{concluded that the}} primary cause of failure was that the blind shear rams failed to fully close and seal due to a portion of drill pipe trapped between the shearing blocks. This happened because the drill pipe elastically buckled within the wellbore due to forces induced on the drill pipe during loss of well control, consequently, drill pipe in process of shearing was deformed outside the shearing blade surfaces, and, consequently, the blind shearing rams were not able to move the entire <b>pipe</b> <b>cross</b> section into the shearing surfaces of the blades. Therefore, oil continued to flow through the drill pipe trapped between the ram block faces and subsequently through the gaps between the ram blocks. Since the pipe buckled when well control was lost, the blind shear rams would have failed to function as planned no matter when they were made active.|$|E

The shape of the flow velocity profile is given by the following equation, [...] ---- (1) The value of n determines {{the shape of the}} flow velocity profile. The eq.(1) can be used to determine the flow profile's shape within the pipe by fitting a curve to experimentally measured velocity data.

A fully developed flow profile was used as the reference state for meter calibration and determination of Coefficient of Discharge (Cd). For Reynolds Number [...] to [...] n is approximately 7.5; for Re of , n is approximately 10.0 where a fully developed profile in a smooth pipe was assumed.

[...] ---- (3) In eq.(3) the pipe lengths required is significant, hence we need some devices that can able to condition the flow over a shorter pipe length allowing metering packages to be cost competitive and accurate.

Measurements were carried out in a coiled copper pipe with 103. 2 m length and 20 mm diameter. Velocity profiles for steady flows are asymmetrical in the <b>pipe</b> <b>cross</b> section, with higher velocities in the outer region due to the centrifugal force created by the flow in the coil. Velocity profiles during transient flows have shown regions of flow recirculation and a large flow reversal near the wall, occurring first in the inner side of the pipe.

The objective of my study was to determine if a decommissioned rubber dam, a check dam, and a temporary sewage <b>pipe</b> <b>crossing</b> impeded movement and/or created conditions that were unfavorable for outmigrating steelhead smolt during low flow periods. For the study I gathered data on temperature, depth, and channel form.

Although the check dam and the sewage <b>pipe</b> <b>crossing</b> were less restrictive for smolt passage, all of the structures created environments that increased the risk of smolt predation. These inhospitable conditions were likely exacerbated by low flows. Gauge data from the past 33 years showed that low flows are common throughout the smolt migration period of April in the lower reach of Alameda Creek; therefore indicating the conditions observed in this study were not uncommon.
