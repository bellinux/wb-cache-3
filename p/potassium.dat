5|$|Major <b>potassium</b> {{chemicals}} are <b>potassium</b> hydroxide, <b>potassium</b> carbonate, <b>potassium</b> sulfate, and <b>potassium</b> chloride. Megatons of these compounds are produced annually.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of <b>potassium</b> exploit the high {{solubility in water}} of <b>potassium</b> compounds, such as <b>potassium</b> soaps. Heavy crop production rapidly depletes the soil of <b>potassium,</b> and this can be remedied with agricultural fertilizers containing <b>potassium,</b> accounting for 95% of global <b>potassium</b> chemical production.|$|E
5|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{concluded that}} a 1640mg increase in the daily intake of <b>potassium</b> {{was associated with a}} 21% lower risk of stroke. <b>Potassium</b> chloride and <b>potassium</b> bicarbonate may be useful to control mild hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Adequate <b>potassium</b> intake is {{achieved}} by eating a variety of foods. <b>Potassium</b> is present in all fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. Foods with high <b>potassium</b> concentrations include yam, parsley, dried apricots, milk, chocolate, all nuts (especially almonds and pistachios), potatoes, bamboo shoots, bananas, avocados, coconut water, soybeans, and bran. Dried apricots have the highest concentration of <b>potassium</b> by weight of any food. Many processed foods contain no <b>potassium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although sodium is less {{reactive}} than <b>potassium,</b> {{this process}} works because at such high temperatures <b>potassium</b> is more volatile than sodium and {{can easily be}} distilled off, so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more <b>potassium</b> gas and proceeds almost to completion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the acute}} phase of an attack, {{administration}} of <b>potassium</b> will quickly restore muscle strength and prevent complications. However, caution is advised {{as the total}} amount of <b>potassium</b> in the body is not decreased, and it is possible for <b>potassium</b> levels to overshoot ("rebound hyperkalemia"); slow infusions of <b>potassium</b> chloride are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced.|$|E
5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of <b>potassium</b> salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and <b>potassium</b> salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of <b>potassium</b> and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of <b>potassium</b> and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as <b>potassium</b> nitrate. <b>Potassium</b> soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that <b>potassium</b> is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack <b>potassium</b> caused a steep rise in demand for <b>potassium</b> salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a <b>potassium</b> salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing <b>potassium</b> chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> {{compounds}} {{are often}} used as fertilisers as <b>potassium</b> is an important element for plant nutrition. <b>Potassium</b> hydroxide {{is a very strong}} base, and is used to control the pH of various substances. <b>Potassium</b> nitrate and <b>potassium</b> permanganate {{are often used}} as powerful oxidising agents. <b>Potassium</b> superoxide is used in breathing masks, as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give <b>potassium</b> carbonate and oxygen gas. Pure <b>potassium</b> metal is not often used, but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> {{homeostasis}} {{denotes the}} maintenance of the total body <b>potassium</b> content, plasma <b>potassium</b> level, and the ratio of the intracellular to extracellular <b>potassium</b> concentrations within narrow limits, in the face of pulsatile intake (meals), obligatory renal excretion, and shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> ions are {{necessary}} for the function of all living cells. The transfer of <b>potassium</b> ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; <b>potassium</b> deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of <b>potassium.</b> The body responds to the influx of dietary <b>potassium,</b> which raises serum <b>potassium</b> levels, with a shift of <b>potassium</b> from outside to inside cells {{and an increase in}} <b>potassium</b> excretion by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> is an {{extremely}} active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms <b>potassium</b> peroxide, and with water <b>potassium</b> forms <b>potassium</b> hydroxide. The reaction of <b>potassium</b> with water is dangerous because of its violent exothermic character {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining <b>potassium.</b> This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, <b>potassium</b> and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used to}} dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> is {{the eighth}} or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) {{in the human}} body, so that a 60kg adult {{contains}} {{a total of about}} 120g of <b>potassium.</b> The body has about as much <b>potassium</b> as sulfur and chlorine, and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant (with the exception of the ubiquitous CHON elements). <b>Potassium</b> ions are present {{in a wide variety of}} proteins and enzymes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> {{levels can}} {{fluctuate}} severely during {{the treatment of}} DKA, because insulin decreases <b>potassium</b> levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular <b>potassium</b> would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood <b>potassium</b> concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the <b>potassium</b> levels and addition of <b>potassium</b> to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3mmol/l. If <b>potassium</b> levels fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> metal reacts violently {{with water}} {{producing}} <b>potassium</b> hydroxide (KOH) and hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> reacts violently with halogens and detonates in the {{presence}} of bromine. It also reacts explosively with sulfuric acid. During combustion, <b>potassium</b> forms peroxides and superoxides. These peroxides may react violently with organic compounds such as oils. Both peroxides and superoxides may react explosively with metallic <b>potassium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sodium is reabsorbed to {{maintain}} extracellular volume, osmotic pressure, and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits; <b>potassium</b> is reabsorbed {{to maintain}} serum <b>potassium</b> concentration within narrow limits. Sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium. <b>Potassium</b> must be conserved also, but, because {{the amount of}} <b>potassium</b> in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of <b>potassium</b> in the cells is about thirty times as large, the situation is not so critical for <b>potassium.</b> Since <b>potassium</b> is moved passively in counter flow to sodium {{in response to an}} apparent (but not actual) Donnan equilibrium, the urine can never sink below the concentration of <b>potassium</b> in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water {{at the end of the}} processing. <b>Potassium</b> is excreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules. At that point, urine usually has about the same <b>potassium</b> concentration as plasma. At the end of the processing, <b>potassium</b> is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high.|$|E
5|$|Sodium occurs {{mostly in}} {{seawater}} and dried seabed, {{but is now}} produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700°C {{through the use of}} a Downs cell. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide. <b>Potassium</b> occurs in many minerals, such as sylvite (<b>potassium</b> chloride). Previously, <b>potassium</b> was generally made from the electrolysis of <b>potassium</b> chloride or <b>potassium</b> hydroxide, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from seawater. However, these methods are problematic because the <b>potassium</b> metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures, potentially forming the explosive superoxide. As a result, pure <b>potassium</b> metal is now produced by reducing molten <b>potassium</b> chloride with sodium metal at 850°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of sodium <b>potassium</b> alloys {{is accomplished by}} changing the reaction time {{and the amount of}} sodium used in the reaction. The Griesheimer process employing the reaction of <b>potassium</b> fluoride with calcium carbide was also used to produce <b>potassium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{reactive}} feed-forward system {{refers to}} an incompletely understood system that induces renal <b>potassium</b> secretion in response to <b>potassium</b> ingestion prior to any rise in the plasma <b>potassium.</b> This is probably initiated by gut cell <b>potassium</b> receptors that detect ingested <b>potassium</b> and trigger vagal afferent signals to the pituitary gland.|$|E
5|$|An average meal of 40-50mmol {{presents}} {{the body with}} more <b>potassium</b> than is present in all plasma (20-25mmol). However, this surge causes the plasma <b>potassium</b> to rise only 10% at most {{as a result of}} prompt and efficient clearance by both renal and extra-renal mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|As such, {{they have}} to be made by {{reacting}} alkylmercury compounds with sodium or <b>potassium</b> metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents. While methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium, methylpotassium is more ionic and has the nickel arsenide structure with discrete methyl anions and <b>potassium</b> cations.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} {{reactive}} nature of <b>potassium</b> metal, it must be handled with great care, with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal. Ingestion of large amounts of <b>potassium</b> compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system. <b>Potassium</b> chloride {{is used in the}} United States for lethal injection executions.|$|E
5|$|Diets low in <b>potassium</b> {{can lead}} to {{hypertension}} and hypokalemia.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, {{rubidium}} and caesium {{in the body}} mimic <b>potassium</b> and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace <b>potassium</b> in the body causing <b>potassium</b> deficiency. Partial substitution is quite possible and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of <b>potassium</b> by rubidium. Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute <b>potassium</b> in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.|$|E
5|$|For decades, the {{commercial}} technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of <b>potassium</b> heptafluorotantalate away from <b>potassium</b> oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, {{a process that}} was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866. This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a {{by-product}} of <b>potassium</b> production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium, with the rest being <b>potassium</b> and {{a small amount of}} caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, such as the Tanco Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as a by-product from pollucite.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} stages, {{electrolyte}} levels are often abnormal and require correction. High <b>potassium</b> levels can be life-threatening, {{and respond to}} increased urine production and renal replacement therapy (see below). Temporary measures include the administration of calcium to protect against cardiac complications, insulin or salbutamol to redistribute <b>potassium</b> into cells, and infusions of bicarbonate solution.|$|E
5|$|Membrane cell {{electrolysis}} employs permeable membrane as an ion exchanger. Saturated sodium (or <b>potassium)</b> chloride {{solution is}} {{passed through the}} anode compartment, leaving at a lower concentration. This method also produces very pure sodium (or <b>potassium)</b> hydroxide but has the disadvantage of requiring very pure brine at high concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Metallic <b>potassium</b> is used {{in several}} types of magnetometers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> can be {{detected}} by taste because it triggers {{three of the five}} types of taste sensations, according to concentration. Dilute solutions of <b>potassium</b> ions taste sweet, allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices, while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter/alkaline, and finally also salty to the taste. The combined bitterness and saltiness of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose <b>potassium</b> supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> is {{the second}} least dense metal after lithium. It is a soft solid with a low melting point, and can be easily cut with a knife. Freshly cut <b>potassium</b> is silvery in appearance, but it begins to tarnish toward gray {{immediately}} on exposure to air. In a flame test, <b>potassium</b> and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of 766.5 nanometers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Potassium</b> metal {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, <b>potassium</b> hydroxide) by electrolysis of molten KOH with the newly discovered voltaic pile. <b>Potassium</b> {{was the first}} metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (caustic soda, NaOH, or lye) rather than a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating that the elements, and thus the salts, are different. Although the production of <b>potassium</b> and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements, {{it took some time}} before this view was universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium, like {{sodium and}} <b>potassium,</b> almost always has +1 {{oxidation}} state when dissolved in water, even in biological contexts. The human body tends to treat Rb+ ions {{as if they}} were <b>potassium</b> ions, and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body's intracellular fluid (i.e., inside cells). The ions are not particularly toxic; a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. The biological half-life of rubidium in humans measures 31–46days. Although a partial substitution of <b>potassium</b> by rubidium is possible, when more than 50% of the <b>potassium</b> in the muscle tissue of rats was replaced with rubidium, the rats died.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} <b>potassium</b> salts from sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined <b>potassium</b> mineral ends up as <b>potassium</b> chloride after processing. The mineral industry refers to <b>potassium</b> chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the kidneys}} are {{the site of}} <b>potassium</b> excretion, {{individuals}} with impaired kidney function {{are at risk for}} hyperkalemia if dietary <b>potassium</b> and supplements are not restricted. The more severe the impairment, the more severe is the restriction necessary to avoid hyperkalemia.|$|E
5|$|Sodium and <b>potassium</b> {{are very}} {{abundant}} in earth, both {{being among the}} ten most common elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal. <b>Potassium</b> makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and zeolite. Many of these solid deposits occur {{as a result of}} ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as Utah's Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than <b>potassium</b> in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because <b>potassium</b> is bound by silicates in soil and what <b>potassium</b> leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.|$|E
