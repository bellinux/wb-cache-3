40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe transition from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans represents {{the most significant}} change in both {{the private sector and}} civil service employee retirement systems in the last twenty years. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), a tax-deferred, defined contribution plan for federal civilian employees, was established in 1986 as part of the Federal Employee Retirement System. This thesis discusses {{the costs and benefits of}} a TSP plan for the uniformed services. The objective of the research addresses the costs of a military TSP. Government studies, periodicals, and the Internet were examined to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the federal TSP. Next, a probabilistic spreadsheet model using Monte Carlo simulation was developed to forecast deferred tax revenue, which represents the most significant cost associated with a military TSP. An analysis of the results indicates that the simulations come within 2. 6 percent of the initial Department of Defense's forecast. On October 30, 2000, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2001 was enacted. This act included a military TSP called the Uniformed Services <b>Payroll</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Plan.</b> It is recommended that future cost estimates use probabilistic spreadsheet modeling to provide more relevant information to the decision making process[URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} data from INSEE’s  2004  household assets survey (Enquête Patrimoine) to {{highlight}} the determinants of holding a contractual financial <b>saving</b> <b>plan</b> to provide supplementary income, distinguishing between working and retired households. Our {{results suggest that the}} profiles of individuals holding certain types of contractual <b>saving</b> <b>plans</b> (retirement <b>saving</b> and life insurance) are determined by factors common to workers and retirees, and tend to confirm behaviour of saving for retirement. Factoring in occupational status reveals specific profiles that suggest that private-sector workers are disadvantaged, particularly with regard to retirement saving. The discrepancy between the public and the private sector in terms of the supplementary retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plans</b> available is a potential source of inequality in terms of household participation in these schemes. The overlap between holding retirement savings and holding alternative savings (life insurance, employee <b>saving</b> <b>plans)</b> in preparation for old age indicates that altruism and a wish to make inter-generational transfers are among the motivations of holders of annuity products, since a significant proportion hold supplementary death insurance. The need to save for retirement via a non-occupational plan is lessened by the availability of a company retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plan,</b> which households with high incomes and financial assets are the most likely to hold. Employee <b>saving</b> <b>plans,</b> which are the only type of <b>saving</b> <b>plan</b> open to younger cohorts of households, are complementary to company retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R

The share of employed tax filers participating in either type of plan declined from 54 % in 1997 to 50 % in 2008 and this is mainly driven by a decreasing share of employed tax filers contributing to a RRSP. The share of employed tax filers participating in an EPP remained fairly stable over the period. ...|$|R
