5|$|While {{large enough}} to <b>perhaps</b> <b>be</b> dangerous, the bignose shark seldom comes into contact with humans due to its {{preference}} for deep water. This species is a bycatch of gillnet, bottom trawl, and deep-set pelagic longline fisheries (particularly those targeting tuna) {{in many parts of}} its range. It is regularly taken in Cuban waters and used to produce liver oil, shagreen, and fishmeal. Elsewhere, such as in Southeast Asia, the meat is consumed and the fins shipped to East Asia for shark fin soup. The bignose shark is not used commercially in United States, where it is listed as Prohibited Species under the 2007 Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic tunas, swordfish and sharks, or in Australia.|$|E
5|$|In {{her account}} of the affair, Margaret Macaulay explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a {{significant}} factor and notes that although numerous documents {{from the hands of}} Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children. Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour. Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may <b>perhaps</b> <b>be</b> gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun. Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale {{from the perspective of the}} descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.|$|E

25|$|Thaw will <b>perhaps</b> <b>be</b> {{best remembered}} for two roles: the hard-bitten, tough talking Flying Squad detective Jack Regan in the Thames Television/ITV series (and two films) The Sweeney (1975–1978), which {{established}} {{him as a}} major star in the United Kingdom. Thaw was only 32 when he was cast in The Sweeney, although many viewers thought he was older.|$|E
25|$|If the {{resources}} available are not fixed or not perishable, the problem is limited to logistics, i.e. inventory or production management.

25|$|The Second Dáil was not {{formally}} dissolved, but following the precedent of 1921, it should <b>perhaps</b> <b>be</b> regarded (from {{the viewpoint of}} the Irish Free State) as dissolved upon the assembling of the Third Dáil. The Third Dáil was first summoned to meet on 1 July 1922. It was prorogued on five occasions and eventually met on 9 September 1922.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{simplicity}} of the above proof, it is rather difficult for an automated theorem prover to produce it. The main difficulty lies in an automated discovery of the Cantor diagonal set. Lawrence Paulson noted in 1992 that Otter could not do it, whereas Isabelle could, albeit {{with a certain amount of}} direction in terms of tactics that might <b>perhaps</b> <b>be</b> considered cheating.|$|E
25|$|His sympathies, however, {{were all}} on their side, and he would do nothing to {{diminish}} their chances of success. He would not even oppose the doctrine of innate ideas, because it looked with a friendly eye upon piety and morality.

25|$|It should <b>perhaps</b> <b>be</b> {{noted that}} CBS {{did not include}} any further {{coverage}} from Dallas or Washington as the other networks had until after the announcement of Kennedy's death.

25|$|The biblical text {{does not}} {{explicitly}} depict {{the nature of}} the relationship between David and Jonathan. The traditional and mainstream religious interpretation of the relationship has been one of platonic love and an example of homosociality. Some later Medieval and Renaissance literature drew upon the story to underline strong personal friendships between men, some of which involved romantic love and could <b>perhaps</b> <b>be</b> described as romantic friendships.|$|E

25|$|The {{names of}} the next two exilarchs - Hezekiah and Akkub - are also found {{at the end of the}} Davidic list in Chronicles. Then follows Nahum, with whom the {{authentic}} portion of the list probably begins, and who may, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>be</b> assigned to the time of the Hadrianic persecution (135). This is the period in which are found the first allusions in traditional literature to the exilarch.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it is also}} {{believed}} that this contamination is only by dormant micro-organisms {{that have not yet}} encountered conditions permitting them to metabolize and reproduce. If so, then a future human colonization may <b>perhaps</b> <b>be</b> biologically reversible.

25|$|Huainanzi translators {{proposed}} two hypotheses for {{the origins}} of ganying philosophy. Charles Le Blanc (1985: 143) asserts that the idea originated from musical resonance. John S. Major believes the ideas of Zou Yan (305-240 BCE), founder of the School of Yin-Yang, had a pervading influence on the Huainanzi, and suggests that the doctrine of qi and ganying resonance could <b>perhaps</b> <b>be</b> regarded as a genuine creation of the Zuo Yan school.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most of Australia, where {{exploration}} typically went inland {{from the}} sea, the Gippsland region was first explored and settled by Europeans who came overland from the Monaro region of New South Wales {{and headed down}} to the coastal regions. This could <b>perhaps</b> <b>be</b> seen as a natural expansion of the first settlements of Australia radiating out from Sydney, {{but to do so}} the settlers had to cross the not insignificant barrier of the Australian Alps.|$|E
