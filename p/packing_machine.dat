In 1949, being a {{co-owner}} of Teepack he invented a modern form of tea bag - bag with 2 chambers which remains the most popular type of the tea bag till now. In the same year he proposed a new tea bag <b>packing</b> <b>machine</b> Constanta which produced 160 bags per minute.|$|E

5000|$|Once a {{sufficient}} volume of fleeces {{of a particular}} grade has filled a grading bin, the wool is compressed into a bale by a <b>packing</b> <b>machine,</b> producing a single bale equivalent to the capacity of some 5 1/2 wool sheets, a weight of 330 kg. Such bales are most economical for shipping purposes, but clearly require mechanised lifting equipment.|$|E

50|$|Wright's Automatic Machinery Company, {{also known}} as Wright Machinery Company and Wright’s Automatic Tobacco <b>Packing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company, is a {{historic}} machine factory located at Durham, Durham County, North Carolina. It was built in 1942, and is a two-story, square Modern Movement style stuccoed brick factory building. It features a wide ribbon of glass block underscored by a continuous concrete sill stretches across the facade at each story and recessed double-leaf entrances set into cast-concrete peaked surrounds. The building was constructed by the Defense Plant Corporation during World War II to support the manufacturing of gunfire control equipment for the United States Navy.

5000|$|As a Longchuan County specialty, cowhells cakes {{are often}} bought {{to give to}} friends or {{relatives}} at a visit, especially during festivals. The recipe for cowhells cake {{is owned by the}} Laolong Niujingao Company, which originally hand-made the cakes. A batch of cake could take ten workers more than ten hours: three hours to make the cake and seven hours to steam it. The company often ran out of stock during periods of high demand, such as the Spring Festival. In 1990, it introduced machinery to increase production capacity. [...] Cowhells cakes would originally remain fresh for only a few days after production, limiting their distribution range. Company researchers extended the cake's shelf life to three months during the 1990s, allowing it to be sold more widely. The manufacturer now has a 2680 m2 factory, a fryer, five grinding machines, three blenders, four food steamers, a boiler, cooling equipment and a <b>packing</b> <b>machine.</b> After an investment of over ¥100,000, it produces more than 35 tons of Cowhells cakes each year.|$|E

This research focus on rate capacity, productive capacity, idle capacity, and nonproductive capacity to measure capacity cost. Result of this research shows most of the capacity owned by either by production machine or human resources are not utilized to its maximum potential. There are need to reduce capacity cost owned by production machine and human resoures to increase the product sales but if its unachieveable there will be need to increase efficiency from production machine and human resources by reducing their quantity DOI: 10. 15408 /ess. v 4 i 1. 1961 </p...|$|E

50|$|As it now exists, the Adams Building is {{the product}} of several {{distinct}} phases of construction from 1854 to around 1874. The earliest phase is the building facing Stoney Street, with its elaborate symmetrical frontage behind a railed courtyard. It was designed as a lace showroom and warehouse, in which lace products brought in from outlying factories were finished off and then sold. The main display area {{seems to have been a}} two-storey lightwell in the centre of the building (now closed up), originally lit by decorative gas lamps; approached by a grand staircase. Secondary areas were used for mending and packing. The main power-source was a steam engine to the rear, with hydraulic engines for the hoists and <b>packing</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

40|$|The rubber glove <b>packing</b> <b>machine</b> {{had been}} {{designed}} an important function which worked with folding carton. Each folded paper carton would be pulled to be erected by vacuum cups. Some carton could not completely form because of an unsuitable design of the erector.

This research aimed to use simulation method to erect the folded carton. Finite element (FE) model of the rubber glove carton was created with shell elements. The orthotropic material properties were employed to specify FE model for analysis erection behavior of the folding carton.
