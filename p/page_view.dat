This {{can be done by}} viewing the traffic statistics found in the web server log file, an automatically generated list of all the pages served. A hit is generated when any file is served. The page itself is considered a file, but images are also files, thus a page with 5 images could generate 6 hits (the 5 images and the page itself). A <b>page</b> <b>view</b> is generated when a visitor requests any page within the web site– a visitor will always generate at least one <b>page</b> <b>view</b> (the main page) but could generate many more.|$|E

[...] Varma added that, [...] "While Wikipedia's managers think {{that this could be}} due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users." [...] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Security indicated that he suspected much of the <b>page</b> <b>view</b> decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, [...] "If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [...]" ...|$|E
