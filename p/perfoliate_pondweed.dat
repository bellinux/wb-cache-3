40|$|Perspective {{direction}} of the Volga-Caspian basin fisheries is increasing the productivity of aquaculture production which requires the availability of sufficient quantities of feed. The cutting waste of carp and crucian carp, crayfish processing (cephalothorax), wheat bran, soy isolate, freshwater plants – <b>pondweed</b> <b>perfoliate,</b> fish-vegetable ration, produced feeding staffs have been investigated. In researching samples of manufactured pelleted feeds the standard methods adopted in the animal feed industry have been used. The number of nitrogen-free extractives and energy value has been determined by calculation. The composition of fish-vegetable ration has been worked out. Some manufacturing inspection of fish-vegetable feed technology using proofing process has been carried out. The possibility of manufacturing {{on the basis of}} crushed fish waste of the company LLC "VES" and dry ingredients of fish-vegetable feed has been determined; the output of feed at water content of not more than 10 % is 43 % of feed mix based on the mass of directed waste equal to 84 %. The pilot batch of dry fish-vegetable feed has been investigated to establish quality indicators. It has been determined that fish-vegetable feed meets the requirements of GOST 10385 – 2014 "Combined feeding staffs for fishes. General specifications" as for main quality indicators and refers to economic grower for catfish and carp fish weighing more than 50 g. This reveals good palatability of the experimental batch of floating feed by carp fish species and African catfish. Thus, fish-vegetable feed manufacturing technology can be implemented in the production for processing secondary raw materials: waste from butchering fish by grinding, cooking, mixing with selected vegetable fillings which is waste of flour or grain processing industries and freshwater plants mowed annually during the reclamation works on the Volga delta...|$|R

The research project provides detailed {{data on the}} architectural growth rules of Potamogeton perfoliatus L. (<b>perfoliate</b> <b>pondweed)</b> such as rhizome spacer lengths, biomass allocation, branching frequencies, branching angles, as well as maps of rhizome networks and their seasonal development in Lake Constance. Besides architectural reasons, the causes for different sizes and shapes of P. perfoliatus patches are dependent on nutrients, light conditions, and clonal integration. Branching {{was positively related to}} both irradiation and nutrient supply. Rhizome spacer lengths were negatively related to nutrient supply and positively related to irradiation. Rhizome allocation tended to increase with irradiation and shoot allocation tended to decrease with irradiation. Root allocation was higher at low nutrient supply. Clonal growth was further complicated because the species showed complex sharing of of resources between older and younger ramets, aiming at optimal resource partitioning. We present an individual-based clonal model which is able to simulate seasonal growth of Potamogeton patches. Furthermore, it shows that architectural growth affects patch characteristics: both rhizome spacer lengths and growth of rhizome axes relative to those in the previous year considerably determine patch density and patch expansion rates. All results on clonal architecture are discussed in the light of foraging theory and allometric rules...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} {{variation in}} nature is called biodiversity. Anthropogenic pressures {{have led to}} a loss of biodiversity, alarming scientists as to what consequences declining diversity has for ecosystem functioning. The general consensus is that diversity (e. g. species richness or identity) affects functioning and provides services from which humans benefit. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how aquatic plant species richness and identity affect ecosystem functioning in terms of processes such as primary production, nutrient availability, epifaunal colonization and properties e. g. stability of Zostera marina subjected to shading. The main work was carried out in the field and ranged temporally from weeklong to 3. 5 months-long experiments. The experimental plants used frequently co-occur in submerged meadows in the northern Baltic Sea and consist of eelgrass (Z. marina), <b>perfoliate</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton perfoliatus), sago pondweed (P. pectinatus), slender-leaved pondweed (P. filiformis) and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris). The results showed that plant richness affected epifaunal community variables weakly, but had a strong positive effect on infaunal species number and functional diversity, while plant identity had strong effects on amphipods (Gammarus spp.), of which abundances were higher in plant assemblages consisting of P. perfoliatus. Depending on the starting standardizing unit, plant richness showed varying effects on primary production. In shoot density-standardized plots, plant richness increased the shoot densities of three out of four species and enhanced the plant biomass production. Both positive complementarity and selection effects were found to underpin the positive biodiversity effects. In shoot biomass-standardized plots, richness effects only affected biomass production of one species. Negative selection was prevalent, counteracting positive complementarity, which resulted in no significant biodiversity effect. The stability of Z. marina was affected by plant richness in such that Z. marina growing in polycultures lost proportionally less biomass than Z. marina in monocultures and thus had a higher resistance to shading. Monoculture plants in turn gained biomass faster, and thereby had a faster recovery than Z. marina growing in polycultures. These results indicate that positive interspecific interactions occurred during shading, while the faster recovery of monocultures suggests that the change from shading stress to recovery resulted in a shift from positive interactions to resource competition between species. The results derived from this thesis show that plant diversity affects ecosystem functioning and contribute to the growing knowledge of plant diversity being an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Diverse plant communities sustain higher primary productivity than comparable monocultures, affect faunal communities positively and enhance stability. Richness and identity effects vary, and identity has generally stronger effects on more variables than richness. However, species-rich communities are likely to contain several species with differing effects on functions, which renders species richness important for functioning. Mixed meadows add to coastal ecosystem functioning in the northern Baltic Sea and may provide with services essential for human well-being...|$|E
