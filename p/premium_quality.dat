25|$|California {{sparkling}} wine traces its roots to Sonoma in the 1880s with {{the founding of}} Korbel Champagne Cellars. The Korbel brothers made {{sparkling wine}} according to the méthode champenoise from Riesling, Chasselas, Muscatel and Traminer. Today most California sparkling wine is largely made from the same grapes used in Champagne, Chardonnay, Pinot noir and some Pinot Meunier. Some wineries will also use Pinot blanc, Chenin blanc and French Colombard. The <b>premium</b> <b>quality</b> producers still use the méthode champenoise (or traditional method) while some low cost producers, like Gallo's Andre brand or Constellation Brands' Cook's, will use the Charmat method.|$|E

25|$|Wine expert Jancis Robinson {{has noted}} that Chenin blanc is {{probably}} the world's most versatile grape, being able to produce quality wines of various sweetness, including dessert wines noted for their aging ability, as well as sparkling made according to the méthode champenoise and fortified wines. The grape can distinguish itself as a single varietal wine, or it can add acidity as a blending component. Its ability to be crafted into <b>premium</b> <b>quality</b> wines across {{a wide spectrum of}} dry and sweetness levels invites the comparison to German Rieslings, with Robinson noting that in many ways Chenin blanc is France's answer to the German Riesling.|$|E
25|$|Located {{near the}} 47th {{parallel}} north, the Cote de Nuits {{is one of}} the northernmost regions to produce <b>premium</b> <b>quality</b> red wines. However, this northerly location brings with it a lot of vintage variation from year to year. From winter time hail, spring time frost and cool autumns that may bring devastating rains that impede ripening and harvest, the quality of each vintage can be highly variable. The vineyards of the Cote de Nuits are planted on east and southeast facing slopes that receive the most opportune sun exposures with vineyards designated as premier and grand cru almost always planted on this ideal aspect at elevations between 800–1000ft (250–300 m).|$|E
25|$|Political {{instability}} in the 20th century, coupled with bureaucratic regulations and high taxes tempered {{the growth of the}} Chilean wine industry. Prior to the 1980s, the vast majority of Chilean wine was considered low quality and mostly consumed domestically. As awareness of Chile's favorable growing conditions for viticulture increased so did foreign investment in Chilean wineries. This period saw many technical advances in winemaking as Chile earned a reputation for reasonably priced <b>premium</b> <b>quality</b> wines. Chile began to export extensively, becoming the third leading exporter, after France and Italy, into the United States {{by the turn of the}} 21st century. It has since dropped to fourth in the US, being surpassed by Australia, but focus has switched to developing exports in the world's other major wine markets like the United Kingdom and Japan.|$|E
40|$|Prices {{received}} by Australian wheat farmers have increasingly depended on grain quality, especially protein concentration. This concentration depends on various agronomic and physical factors including weed competition. In this paper {{a model of}} weed management {{in the presence of}} grain <b>quality</b> <b>premiums</b> is presented. Two types of <b>quality</b> <b>premium</b> are examined: a continuout linear payment schedule and a discontinuous "stepped" schedule with substantial <b>premiums</b> for <b>quality</b> levels above a critical level. The model is applied to an analysis of the impact of protein premiums on optimal management strategies for a particular weed in Western Australia. It is found that the impact of protein premiums on optimal weed management is likely to be very small indeed, even if premiums were substantially increased above current levels.

2500|$|The California wine {{regions that}} seem to favor {{producing}} <b>premium</b> <b>quality</b> Chardonnay {{are the ones that}} are most influenced, climatically, by coastal fogs that can slow the ripening of the grape and give it more time to develop its flavors. The regions of Alexander Valley, Los Carneros, Santa Maria Valley, Russian River Valley, and other parts of Sonoma County have shown success in producing wines that reflect more Burgundian styles. Other regions often associated with Chardonnay include Napa Valley, Monterey County, and Santa Barbara County. The California Central Valley is home to many mass-produced Chardonnay brands, as well as box and jug wine production. While the exact style of the wine varies by producer, some of the terroir characteristics associated with California Chardonnay include [...] "flinty" [...] notes with the Russian River Valley and mango and guava from Monterey. A large portion of the Californian sparkling wine industry uses Chardonnay grapes from Carneros, Alexander, and Russian River valleys, with these areas attracting the attention of Champagne producers such as Bollinger, Louis Roederer, Moët et Chandon, and the Taittinger family, which have opened up wineries in last few decades.|$|E
