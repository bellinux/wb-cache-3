25|$|A channel {{agreement}} for Virgin Media to keep non-premium Sky channels ended on 1 March 2007. Virgin Media and Sky {{failed to reach}} agreement on the issue, and Sky reacted by posting {{a letter to the}} public in major UK newspapers on 28 February 2007. Despite Sky's letter, Virgin Media blamed Sky for tyrannising them and inciting consumers to switch. The companies failed to resolve their differences, and subsequently after midnight on 1 March 2007, Virgin Media replaced the Sky 1, Sky 2, Sky Travel, Sky Travel Extra, Sky Sports News and Sky News channel content with a standard message. Sky attributed part of the rate rise {{to the fact that the}} new deal would also include Sky 3, Sky Arts and undisclosed high definition and video on demand content. Sky said the deal would cost only 3p per customer per day (roughly £35,000,000 per year), but Virgin said that a minimum <b>payment</b> <b>guarantee</b> included in the contract meant that the actual amount due would exceed twice the current payment.|$|E
500|$|In an {{additional}} legal issue, on February 8, 2005, Trump had closed on a construction loan of $640million from Deutsche Bank for the project. He also obtained a $130–135million junior mezzanine loan from another syndicate headed by Fortress Investment Group. As {{part of these}} contracts, Trump had included a $40million personal guarantee. The contracts also mandated partial repayments for each closed unit sale, and minimum sale prices. In September 2008, due to slow unit sales, Trump sought to extend both loans until mid-2009 because he {{felt that it was}} necessary in the business environment and expected from the outset of the contract. On November 10, Deutsche Bank demanded the outstanding loan payment and the $40million guarantee. Trump filed suit later that month against Deutsche Bank in New York State Supreme Court in an effort to excuse a repayment of more than $330million that had been due November 7, and to extend the construction loan for an unspecified period of time because of extenuating circumstances arising from the financial crisis of 2007–2010. Trump cited a [...] "force majeure" [...] clause that allowed the borrower to delay completion of the project under a catch-all section covering [...] "any other event or circumstance not within the reasonable control of the borrower". Trump not only sought an extension, but sought damages of $3billion from the bank for its use of predatory lending practices to undermine the project and damage his reputation, which he claimed [...] "is associated worldwide with on-time, under-budget, first-class construction projects and first-class luxury hotel operations." [...] At the end of November, Deutsche Bank countersued Trump to force him to uphold his personal <b>payment</b> <b>guarantee</b> from February 2005, after he failed to repay the amount due November 7—a date that already had been extended. The suits did not interfere with Trump's ability to continue drawing on the credit line provided by Deutsche Bank, because without the project's continued financing, Deutsche Bank may have had to assume the role of developer. In March 2009, both parties agreed to suspend litigation and resolve the disagreement amicably in an effort to help the project to succeed. In September 2010, an amended loan agreement stopped the litigation and extended the term on an approximately $600million construction loan for five years.|$|E

As a result, Wingspan's online-only operation effectively competed with Bank One's own online presence, particularly as the online bank's lack of physical presence allowed it to provide better fees and rates for customers. The bank provided most traditional financial services from interest-bearing checking accounts to credit cards, Individual Retirement Accounts and HELOCs.

50|$|To {{avoid the}} {{processing}} fees, many businesses resorted to using direct debit, {{which is then}} called electronic direct debit (Elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren, abbr. ELV). The point-of-sale terminal reads the bank sort code and account number from the card but instead of handling the transaction through the Girocard network it simply prints a form, which the customer signs to authorise the debit note. However, this method also avoids any verification or <b>payment</b> <b>guarantee</b> provided by the network. Further, customers can return debit notes by notifying their bank without giving a reason. This means that the beneficiary bears the risk of fraud and illiquidity. Some business mitigate the risk by consulting a proprietary blacklist or by switching to Girocard for higher transaction amounts.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} considerations for exporters in international trade transactions is the aspect of payment. In the context of financial risk management, Letters of Credit enable the exporter to substitute the credit risk of the buyer with that of his bank. The Letter of Credit is a conditional <b>payment</b> <b>guarantee,</b> relying on one hundred per cent documentary accuracy to trigger the payment. Less than one hundred per cent compliance means {{the loss of the}} <b>payment</b> <b>guarantee.</b> Non-compliance is a significant problem as, according to the International Chamber of Commerce, worldwide documentary discrepancy rates against Letter of Credit transactions have been estimated to be between sixty to seventy per cent. The mechanics of Letter of Credit transactions comprise a complex web of interactions between banks, traders and their service providers, providing a fertile ground for discrepancies and existing literature acknowledges this world-wide problem. In the UK, in 2000, losses were estimated to be AUD 305 million (£ 113) through non-compliant documents being presented under Letters of Credit – this amount did not include lost opportunities and cash flow problems. In the same year, a separate USA study of Letter of Credit transactions confirmed the high discrepancy rate, but also claimed that as long as buyers want the goods discrepancies did not translate into financial losses. The findings were refuted by others. It is the potential loss of revenue caused by the mismanagement of risk that is foremost in this research. It is estimated that the annual value of Letter of Credit business for manufacturing exports to ASEAN is approximately AUD 3. 5 billion, with losses estimated to be upwards of AUD 920 million. This research aims to assist in greater understanding of the usage of Letters of Credit and the dynamics that underpin these transactions leading to a greater understanding of the interactions between Australian exporters and ASEAN importers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{accommodate}} {{the rapid growth}} of e-commerce transactions, non-face-to-face transactions, businesses use a wide variety of payment methods. However, many of these payment mediums are not secure as shown by increases in fraudulent transactions. In this paper, we analyze a particular e-commerce transaction medium, the Safety Transaction Service (STS). This system protects consumers through a wide variety of safeguards: safety settlement systems (escrow), consumer damage compensation insurance, <b>payment</b> <b>guarantee,</b> and secure bank settlement. In contrast to the safeguards, we identify the limitations and concerns with the STS and potential legal and political improvements. The plethora of payment methods limits the consumers ability to distinguish between the secured and unsecured transaction services. Regulation and consumer based verification of transaction services are essential to root out dangerously fraudulent systems. We propose the development of specific standards to these systems, in particular the need for consumer confirmation and clear settlement documentation. Only through the active promotion of scrutiny and improvement to STS will consumers be protected in e-commerce...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{decisions}} by the Spanish national competition authority (TDC) mandate payment systems to include only two costs when setting their domestic multilateral interchange fees (MIF) : a fixed processing cost and a variable {{cost for the}} risk of fraud. This artificial lowering of MIFs will not lower consumer prices, because of uncompetitive retailing; but it will however lead to higher cardholders fees and, likely, new prices for point of sale terminals, delaying {{the development of the}} immature Spanish card market. Also, to the extent that increased cardholders fees do not offset the fall in MIFs revenue, the task of issuing new cards will be underpaid relatively to the task of acquiring new merchants, causing an imbalance between {{the two sides of the}} networks. Moreover, the pricing scheme arising from the decisions will cause unbundling and underprovision of those services whose costs are excluded. Indeed, the <b>payment</b> <b>guarantee</b> and the free funding period will tend to be removed from the package of services currently provided, to be either provided by third parties, by issuers for a separate fee, or not provided at all, especially to smaller and medium-sized merchants.

40|$|In {{the modern}} {{commercial}} world guarantees {{have become an}} important instrument. Guarantees {{are not limited to}} those given by a bank in the commercial world. Guarantees may also be issued by a parent company on behalf of a subsidiary, or by an individual(s) in personal transactions. The question then is what is a contract of guarantee? A guarantee is an assurance or security issued by one party (the guarantor) {{at the request of the}} party with the liability (the principal) to the party the liability is owed to (the beneficiary). Guarantees are discussed in this paper in the context of bank issued guarantees in shipbuilding contract. In shipbuilding contracts there are two types of guarantees issued – (i) refund guarantees, and (ii) payment guarantees. When payment is due under a guarantee, irrespective of if it is a refund guarantee or a <b>payment</b> <b>guarantee,</b> is dependent upon if it is a traditional guarantee type, or an on-demand bond type. The aim of this thesis is to examine the distinction between the true guarantee type and the on-demand bond type under English law. At the same time the objective of this thesis is to analyse the legal literature and the English common law cases to understand how a refund guarantee issued in shipbuilding contracts is conceived by the English courts to be either an on-demand bond or true guarantee. What are true guarantees and on-demand bonds? What are the distinguishing characteristics of each type of guarantee...|$|E

In addition, some distributions {{made by a}} partnership in liquidation of a partner 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the partnership are treated as <b>guaranteed</b> <b>payments.</b> A <b>guaranteed</b> <b>payment</b> constitutes ordinary income to the partner, and the partnership is allowed a deduction for the payment unless it constitutes a capital expenditure. While <b>guaranteed</b> <b>payments</b> typically are made in cash, it is possible to make them with property in kind.
