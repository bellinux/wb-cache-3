500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} a little like writing about the Beatles—that there are so many <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who know so much about him and who revere him that I just saw a {{minefield}} of disappointment.

500|$|The Game {{recorded}} tracks {{based on}} his life experiences from his childhood to his success as a rapper. When asked about the album, he stated: [...] The rapper commented on the album's perception before its release, saying, [...] "I know everybody was expecting gang-bang, 40-ounce, low-rider music, but that's not what I gave them... I'm telling a real story, and maybe there are <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who can relate to my experiences." [...] Rolling Stone observed that [...] "every song has a well-massaged hook and some immediate appeal, and verses that don't waste {{a lot of time}} getting to the point." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scenes with}} Sansa Stark were also noted. According to Elio Garcia from westeros.org, [...] "Sophie Turner really shines in her scenes. There {{are a lot}} of <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who judge Sansa very harshly, but you would have to have a heart of stone not to sympathize with her plight in this episode." [...] Many reviewers agreed with this sentiment, commenting on the {{transition}} from a [...] "spoiled brat" [...] to a young, confused, but courageous teenager were noted by several reviewers positively. Times reviewer James Poniewozik emphasized the growth of Robb Stark's character, praising both Martin's writing and Richard Madden's acting. Maureen Ryan highlighted the scene where Syrio Forel confronts the Lannister men to allow Arya's escape, which she considered masterfully staged.|$|E

500|$|Leafs {{co-owner}} Stafford Smythe rejected {{accusations that}} he opposed expansion to Vancouver, {{pointing out that}} he had offered to build and operate an $8million facility in the city's downtown area, a proposal that he contended made little sense unless Vancouver had an NHL team. However, Smythe's proposal was contingent on him acquiring the parcel of land required from the city, then valued at $2.5 million, for $1. The proposed transaction was defeated in a municipal referendum. [...] Smythe therefore placed the blame for Vancouver's failed bid on the city: [...] "Vancouver lost its chance the day it turned down the referendum on our arena proposal", Smythe said. [...] "That proved to me that the <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> aren't interested in going major league." ...|$|E
500|$|The album artwork for Mediocre {{meant to}} emulate the theme of mediocrity. Sariñana elaborated, [...] "The cover is a take {{on the idea that}} women in the ‘40s and ‘50s had to be ‘perfect.’ Perfect hair, perfect clothes, sitting quietly and making perfect meals and {{embroidering}} perfectly. And, ironically, they were all perfect in the same, uninteresting way so that ended up making them all mediocre. That was the idea." [...] Sariñana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: [...] "It’s {{not to say that the}} material is mediocre, but rather that it’s a message of irony, and I think the public gets that, but there are some <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who like to poke fun at the title." ...|$|E
500|$|Similarly, {{conservative}} talkshow host Glenn Beck, {{claiming that}} Miles resembled President Barack Obama, {{argued that the}} new Spider-Man {{was a result of}} a comment from Michelle Obama about changing traditions. However, Beck said he did not care about Miles' race, and also acknowledged out that this was not the mainstream Spider-Man. Axel Alonso denied the character was created out of political correctness, stating [...] "Simple fact is Marvel comics reflect the world in all its shapes, sizes and colors. We believe there's an audience of <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who is thirsty for a character like Miles Morales." [...] Original Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee approved of Miles, stating that [...] "Doing our bit to try to make our nation, and the world, color blind is definitely the right thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Coming off a shellacking against Ohio State, Penn State {{looked to}} rebound behind a strong {{defensive}} effort against Illinois. Linebacker Mike Hull noted, [...] "Practice Monday and (Tuesday) was real energetic {{and we were}} smacking <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> We’re ready to play another game on Saturday and get that taste of losing out of our mouth." [...] Keys to the game included moving on from the prior Saturday's defeat, limiting big plays on defense, containing Illinois quarterback Nathan Scheelhaase, and protecting quarterback Christian Hackenberg. A pre-game analysis of statistical comparisons between the two squads gave Penn State an advantage in most offensive and defensive stats, while it gave Illinois an advantage on special teams. The analyst blamed sanctions imposed by NCAA president Mark Emmert in wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal for that disparity, citing scholarship reductions hampering depth.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{to contain a}} {{flashback}} to a sixteen-year-old Sue, played by Colby Minifie, singing the title song of the musical Oklahoma! in a scene that would have explained Sue's antipathy to music in the schools. Series co-creator Ian Brennan said [...] "we wanted to show that Sue at one point had Broadway dreams", and Lynch reveals, [...] "Will tells Sue, 'Poor little Susie Sylvester was told she wasn't good, and now she's got to punish the world.' Like a lot of angry <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> Sue's a wannabe." [...] However, the scene was not broadcast because it was, according to Murphy, [...] "too long for the episode"; he also stated that the footage, with the title [...] "How Sue Sylvester Became a Bitch", would be released in the future, [...] "either as a DVD extra or online".|$|E
500|$|In another {{interview}} with IGN, both Jaffe and Barlog {{said that they}} did not view God of War II as a sequel, but rather a continuation of the previous game. Jaffe {{said that they did}} not want to include the Roman numeral number two (II) in the title for this reason, but they did not want the title to convey the impression it was an expansion pack. Both Jaffe and Barlog said that the reason God of War II appeared on the PlayStation 2 instead of the PlayStation 3—which was released four months prior to God of War II—was because [...] "there's a 100 million <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> that will be able to play God of War II as soon as it launches."
