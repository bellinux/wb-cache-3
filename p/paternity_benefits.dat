Only 9. 4 % of Canadian fathers outside Quebec claimed or intended to claim parental benefits in 2012. Fathers’ stronger labour force attachment and higher earnings contribute to their decreased likelihood of claiming parental benefits compared to mothers. Workplace values and work demands also significantly impact fathers’ use of parental benefits. Using a case study analysis of Quebec, the 2011 General Social Survey, and a supplemental online survey, this study evaluates {{the extent to which}} work-related and other factors facilitate or hinder fathers’ use of parental benefits.

40|$|Male redback spiders (Latrodectus hasselti) {{maximize}} paternity if they copulate {{twice with}} their cannibalistic mate. Facilitating cannibalistic attack {{during their first}} copulation yields <b>paternity</b> <b>benefits.</b> However, females have paired sperm-storage organs inseminated during two separate copulations, so males that succumb to partial cannibalism during the first copulation lose at least 50 % of their paternity to rivals. In this paper, we describe a novel male trait—an abdominal constriction that appears during courtship—that allows males to survive and mate with females for a second time, despite the substantial cannibalistic damage inflicted during the first copulation. Constricted males that were wounded to simulate early cannibalism had higher endurance, greater survivorship, longer subsequent courtship and higher mating success than wounded males that were not constricted. Constriction was not found in a non-sacrificial congener that rarely survived simulated cannibalism, and the protective effect of constriction in redbacks was specific {{to the type of}} damage inflicted by females during the first copulation. Thus, the abdominal constriction allows males to overcome the potential fitness limit imposed by their own suicidal strategy—paradoxically, by prolonging survival across two cannibalistic copulations...|$|E

40|$|Male redback spiders twist their abdomens {{onto the}} fangs of their mates during {{copulation}} and, if cannibalized (65 % of matings), increase their paternity relative to males {{that are not}} cannibalized. The adaptive male sacrifice hypothesis proposes that this increased reproductive payoff from a single mating outweighs the residual reproductive value of a cannibalized male, because high mortality during mate searching restricts alternative mating opportunities. It {{has been reported that}} redback male residual reproductive value is low because males are functionally sterile after one mating [...] a putative intrinsic constraint that could arguably favor self-sacrifice in the absence of ecological restrictions on multiple mating. However, sterility and self-sacrifice may both arise as aspects of a terminal investment strategy if the probability of multiple mating is sufficiently low. Here I report field data that support the adaptive male sacrifice hypothesis. More than 80 % of redback males die without finding a potential mate in nature. Data from two observational field studies and one release experiment suggest that in the absence of cannibalism, male redbacks would expect fewer than one mating opportunity in a lifetime. This expectation was not significantly higher for a large male or one in good condition. A simple quantitative analysis confirms that even if males are assumed to be fertile throughout life, the measured mortality rate during mate search in combination with previously documented <b>paternity</b> <b>benefits</b> of cannibalism is sufficient to ensure that self-sacrifice is adaptive for male redback spiders.

40|$|Partible paternity, the {{conception}} belief {{that more than}} one man can contribute to the formation of a fetus, is common in lowland South America and characterized by nonexclusive mating relationships and various institutionalized forms of recognition and investment by multiple cofathers. Previous work has emphasized the fitness benefits for women where partible paternity beliefs facilitate paternal investment from multiple men and may reduce the risk of infanticide. In this comparative study of 128 lowland South American societies, the prevalence of partible paternity beliefs may be as much as two times as common as biologically correct beliefs in singular paternity. Partible paternity beliefs are nearly ubiquitous in four large language families—Carib, Pano, Tupi, and Macro-Je. Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that partible paternity evolved deep in Amazonian prehistory at the root of a tentative Je-Carib-Tupi clade.

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} the scenario of when, through advanced medical technology, a procedure is performed {{resulting in the}} birth of a child more than three hundred days-a time suggested by some statutes-after the death of the gamete provider. The embryo may result from in vitro fertilization or from a woman being artificially inseminated with the sperm of a deceased male gamete provider. And of course the woman could have predeceased too and left a viable ova, that was then fertilized with the sperm of a living or a deceased male to create an embryo, which was then placed into a surrogate, a gestational carrier. The essential element is that the act, which results in a future birth, occurs after the death of one or both of the gamete providers. This is the essence of posthumous conception. That is, once the egg and sperm are brought together through assisted reproductive technology to form an embryo, both or either of the persons who donated the sperm and egg or embryo are dead, perhaps for a long time.

On the other hand, females may receive several <b>benefits</b> from multiple <b>paternity</b> (indirect and directly), and a potential sexual conflict can arise. This research describes the mating systems of an exploited crab species (Metacarcinus edwardsii), integrating (1) the individual level by assessing the mating behavior in a scenario of potential polyandry, (2) the organ level by examining histological sections of seminal receptacles from localities with scenarios of contrasting sex ratios, and (3) the genetic level by measuring the number of parents involved in egg clutches. We found that females can mate with multiple males under experimental conditions. Further, in all localities, we found histological evidences that sperm receptacles stored ejaculates {{from more than one}} male. However, contrary to expectations, genetic analysis revealed high probability of single male paternity of all progeny in each egg clutch. In this mating system, males compete to be the single male that mates with a receptive female, investing energy in guarding behavior and foregoing opportunities to mate with other females, all in order to ensure their <b>paternity.</b> However, females <b>benefit</b> from multiple mating (or potential for it) by prolonged guarding behavior, protecting them from predation after molt (soft-shelled period).

40|$|Abstract: Sexual {{selection}} theory {{predicts that}} males should be promiscuous {{to maximize their}} reproductive success, while females should be choosy. Yet females of many taxa often produce progeny sired by multiple males, indicating that promiscuity can be important for the reproductive success of females. Promiscuity may enhance the fitness of females if it increases the genetic quality, or the genetic variety, and thus the viability of their offspring. We quantified the number of sires per clutch in a population of Northern Map Turtles (Graptemys geographica (LeSueur, 1817)) in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, Canada, and tested {{whether the number of}} sires affects several metrics of viability in hatchlings. Based on the most conservative estimate, at least 71 % of clutches in this population are sired by multiple males, but {{there was no evidence that}} larger clutches are sired by more males. Clutches sired by more males had higher hatching success and survival, but the differences were not statistically significant. We did not find any effect of the number of sires on hatchling morphology or locomotor performance.

40|$|Reproductive skew is {{a measure}} of the {{proportion}} of individuals of each sex that breed in a group and is a valuable measure for understanding the evolution and maintenance of sociality. Here, we provide the first quantification of reproductive skew within social groups of European badgers Meles meles, throughout an 18 -year study in a high-density population. We used 22 microsatellite loci to analyse within-group relatedness and demonstrated that badger groups contained relatives. The average within-group relatedness was high (R = 0. 20) and approximately one-third of within-group dyads were more likely to represent first-order kin than unrelated pairs. Adult females within groups had higher pairwise relatedness than adult males, due to the high frequency of extra-group paternities, rather than permanent physical dispersal. Spatial clustering of relatives occurred among neighbouring groups, which we suggest was due to the majority of extra-group paternities being attributable to neighbouring males. Reproductive skew was found among within-group candidate fathers (B = 0. 26) and candidate mothers (B = 0. 07), but not among breeding individuals; our power to detect skew in the latter was low. We use these results to evaluate reproductive skew models. Although badger society best fits the assumptions of the incomplete-control models, our results were not consistent with their predictions. We suggest that this may be due to female control of paternity, female-female reproductive suppression occurring only in years with high food availability resulting in competition over access to breeding sites, extra-group <b>paternity</b> masking the <b>benefits</b> of natal philopatry, and/or the inconsistent occurrence of hierarchies that are linear when established...|$|R

40|$|El trabajo discute las soluciones que han dado en España el Tribunal Supremo y el Tribunal Constitucional a casos en los que se ven enfrentados la facultad de mantener el anonimato del {{progenitor}} y el derecho del hijo a conocer su identidad biológica. Se confronta la decisión del Tribunal Supremo de declarar inconstitucionales las normas legales que permiten a la madre no matrimonial resguardar su anonimato, con la sentencia del Tribunal Constitucional, emitida pocos meses antes, que declara constitucionalmente legítimo el anomimato del donante de esperma en el contexto de la aplicación de una técnica de reproducción humana asistida. Se argumenta en contra de ambas soluciones, sobre la base de que en la primera el anonimato materno cumple una función dirigida no directamente a proteger a la madre, sino a proteger al niño frente a un posible aborto o infanticidio por lo que el derecho a la identidad debe ser moderado. Para ilustrar la conveniencia y viabilidad de este razonamiento se hace un amplio análisis del caso "Odiévre" por el que el Tribunal Europeo de Derechos Humanos concluyó que el sistema francés de reserva de la identidad de la madre no era contrario al Convenio Europeo. En cambio, se critica la solución del Tribunal Constitucional sobre el donante de esperma por sobredimensionar el derecho a la intimidad del progenitor en desmedro del interés del hijo. La puesta en contraste de estas soluciones permite constatar que la madre, que contaba con medidas de apoyo en concretas situaciones que pudieran poner en riesgo la vida del hijo, las pierde; mientras el padre que, a partir de la reforma del año 1981 que impuso la libertad de investigación de la paternidad, había perdido sus antiguos privilegios, se ve beneficiado de la misma dispensa que ahora se niega para la madre. The present paper {{discuss the}} solutions that Spain's Constitutional Tribunal and Spain's Supreme Court have issued in filiation cases, {{in which the}} faculty to the anonymity of genetic parents and the children's right to know own biological identity, appear confronted. We will contrast a decision of the Supreme Tribunal who declared unconstitutional the norms which allow the unwed mother to refuse the child and protect the secrecy of her identity, with the Constitutional Tribunal's decision (issued a few months earlier) which legitimates the anonymity of the sperm donor {{in the context of}} an assisted reproduction proceeding. We argue, against both solutions, that in the first one, maternal anonymity seeks not to protect the mother, but to protect the child before a possible abortion or infanticide so the right to the identity must be limited. To illustrate the convenience and viability of this argument we analyze the "Odiévre" case, in which the European Human Rights Court concluded that the Trench system (that reserves the identity of the mother) was not contrary to the European Covenant. On the other hand, we criticize the Constitutional Tribunal's decision regarding the sperm donor because it overstate the right of privacy of the progenitor against the child's best interest. This contrast exercise shows that the mother, who used to have certain means that could jeopardize the child's life, loses them; however the father (that since 1981 reform that allowed free <b>paternity</b> investigation), <b>benefits</b> with the same dispense that the mother nowadays lack...|$|R
40|$|In most taxa, {{females are}} more likely than males to care for offspring. Why? Ever since Trivers' {{landmark}} work, the answer has been traced back to sexual differences in pre-mating reproductive investment (unequal gamete size or anisogamy). However, recent work shows that parental investment theory has inadvertently ignored a profoundly simple fact of life: every offspring has a mother and father. Taking this into account completely changes how we should think about sex differences in parental care. In one of the best-known evolutionary game theory models to explain sex differences in parental care [1], both males and females have the option to desert rather than care for offspring, but the benefits of desertion differ between the sexes. A deserting female saves energy that enables her to lay more eggs per breeding attempt, whereas a deserting male has the opportunity to mate again with another female. Why should this usually produce female care? The conventional argument is that, for any female, reproduction is constrained by the demands of producing large, costly eggs, so she only gains a limited (small) increase in fitness if she decides not to care for her previous brood. By contrast, because sperm are small and cheaply produced, male fitness is only limited by access to receptive females. The fitness of a male can therefore increase indefinitely and linearly with the number of females with whom he mates [2]. This difference in potential reproductive rates means that the payoffs from deserting are usually larger for males than for females, so male care is less likely to evolve [3]. Although factors other than potential rates of reproduction can influence which sex is more likely to care (e. g. territorial male fish can care for several broods simultaneously without reducing their mating rate), the general rule of thumb is that ‘the usually small investment of males [in endotherms] raises their potential reproductive rate so that any activity that constrains mating rate is likely to have heavy costs to males’ [4]. This logic is taught in most introductory behavioural ecology courses. A similar argument is used to explain the evolution of anisogamy where, given initial variation in gamete size, disruptive selection favours the production of ever smaller gametes by one type of individual (males) because fitness increases more rapidly with investment in gamete number than in gamete size. The converse is true for producers of larger gametes because these, when fertilized by small gametes, need high parental investment to survive [5]. The effect of an initial pre-mating asymmetry in parental investment on potential reproductive rates is also used to explain sexual selection. All else being equal, the sex with the smaller pre-mating reproductive investment (males) has a higher potential reproductive rate and competes for access to the more heavily investing sex (females), who can therefore afford to be more choosy. When all this is put together, the historical sequence of events is presented as follows. Isogamy is inherently unstable. The ensuing tradeoff between gamete number and size creates anisogamy. Because anisogamy affects potential rates of reproduction, it generates sexual differences in post-mating parental behaviour as males pay greater costs for caring. Differences in post-mating parental investment further elevate male competition for females, which again exaggerates sexual differences in mating behaviour. This chain of events therefore leads to the correlation between pre-mating and post-mating investment in offspring. But can you spot the flaw in this argument? If you can't, take solace in {{the fact that it has}} gone largely unnoticed for over 20 years. In spite of recent work on the benefits of polyandry, it is probably true that male fitness depends more strongly on the number of matings than does female fitness. Even so, imagine that a naı̈ve student asked you the following question: ‘You just said males get higher benefits from deserting. But if females spend a lot of time caring, aren't there more males than females around willing to mate? So shouldn't a male have a much harder time finding a mate if he deserts than a female would? So how come his fitness gain can be higher?’ Good point, indeed. It is impossible for the total number of matings that males and females engage in to differ. It takes two to tango. (Popular surveys uncritically report that men have more sexual partners of the opposite sex than do women. These only show that humans can deny logic, not that they can defy it). The average male cannot achieve his higher potential without violating the principle that every offspring in diploid species has exactly one mother and one father. The irrefutable fact of identical average reproductive output per sex should have an enormous equalizing effect on male and female patterns of reproductive allocation. Fisher [6] used this seemingly inconsequential insight to explain the evolution of equal sex ratios, spawning a series of hugely successful models. When it comes to parental care, however, our thinking has been somewhat careless. Wade and Shuster [7] recently highlighted this problem by reanalyzing Maynard Smith's original model [1]. They formally show that it has an internal inconsistency because it violates the requirement of equal average male and female fitness. The problem is that deserting males gain ‘extra’ offspring by mating with females who materialize ‘from nowhere’ (i. e. they do not appear in calculations of female fitness). Males therefore have more total paternity than females produce offspring. This flaw can be corrected by explicitly stating where these offspring come from. For example, Wade and Schuster model a case in which deserting males have paternity in care-giving males broods, or mate with females who have deserted care-givers [7]. In general, when the additional paternity of a deserting male comes at a cost to the paternity of other males, models become self-consistent [8], and the logical flaws disappear. The most exciting insight from Wade and Shuster's paper is that the initial direction of causality from parental care to sexual selection should be reversed. To understand why, it is instructive to glance at a delightfully simple but deeply insightful paper by Queller [9]. In this curiously neglected work, he noted that standard explanations for sexual differences in caring evaporate if we recognize that these costs must be measured in the currency of future offspring production. In spite of anisogamy, there is no inherent bias towards care by females if parents have identical future prospects of reproduction. On average they do, at least in populations with equal sex ratios. If one sex is rarer, however, then caring is more costly for that sex. One obvious way for males to become ‘rarer’ than females is when sexual selection generates nonrandom variance in mating success. Individuals that matter in the evolution of parental roles are those who ‘qualify to mate’ (sensu[10]) : only they are in a position to be selected to provide parental care. The costs of caring differ among males if some, by virtue of being more attractive or aggressive, are consistently more successful than others in obtaining mates. Such males have a higher average reproductive rate than do females, which elevates their gains from deserting. The second way in which sexual selection affects the evolution of caring is via the effect of sperm competition on certainty of parentage. With anisogamy, many small male gametes compete for access to eggs, be this because of female multiple mating or simultaneous sperm release in external fertilizers. Unless fertilization is internal and females are monogamous, males are less certain of their parentage in each zygote. But will this lead to less care? After all, males trade off current and future reproduction and low <b>paternity</b> could reduce <b>benefits</b> from both, without altering the balance [1]. Again, Queller [9] simply points out that low paternity does not imply low future reproduction for the male. Every future offspring has a father, and both legitimate and illegitimate progeny enter the equation for future reproductive success of males. Consequently, low paternity does not produce a sex bias in the costs of caring (reduction in future offspring production). The only question we must then ask is whether the benefits of caring are smaller for males. For any given zygote, the benefits for a male are devalued by his lower average parentage, so we can safely conclude that males should care less. To summarize, anisogamy does not generate a bias towards female parental care because males end up with a higher potential reproductive rate. It is actual rather than potential rates that count in evolution. Instead, anisogamy generates the conditions for sexual selection, as numerically abundant male gametes compete for access to rare female gametes. This lowers the confidence of males of paternity and, given direct male–male competition for access to females and/or female mate choice, creates an elite subset of males that are more eligible to mate. These two phenomena militate against the evolution of male care, relative to female care, because they reduce the benefits and increase the costs of caring, respectively. The arrow of causality therefore flies from sexual selection to post-mating sexual differences in parental care, rather than in the reverse direction. Of course, this is a statement about the origins of sexual differences in care. From a contemporary perspective, we know there is feedback between levels of care and the intensity of sexual selection [11]. As females spend more time caring, the greater is the intensity of sexual selection on males to gain access to ever fewer receptive females. This seemingly unbreakable feedback loop should not, however, deceive us into forgetting that every journey starts somewhere, even if it ends up being a round trip...|$|R
