40|$|ABSTRACTThis {{contribution}} {{is devoted to}} high-speed and high-resolution 3 -D imaging based on the light-section method. Our smart access image sensors achieve high-speed position detection on the sensor plane to realize real-time 3 -D imaging with high range accuracy. A high-speed position sensor using a quad-tree scan implementation achieves 10 k points/s position detection of a projected spot beam. To {{reduce the number of}} frames required for a 3 -D image, we present high-speed position sensors with new row-parallel architectures to get positions of a <b>projected</b> <b>sheet</b> beam efficiently. Moreover we present a high-speed readout scheme with adaptive threshold circuits to realize a higher-resolution 3 -D image sensor employing a compact pixel circuit. We discuss the features and advantages of smart access methods for advanced 3 -D imaging applications on the basis of comparison...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first real-time 3 -D imaging {{system based on}} the light-section method with VGA pixel resolu-tion. A 3 -D measurement system has {{a wide variety of}} ap-plications fields, however it is difficult for the conventional imaging systems to realize a real-time and high-resolution 3 -D measurement based on the light-section method since it requires a lot of frames per range map to acquire the positions of a scanning laser beam. Our developed image sensor achieves 41. 7 k fps position detection of a <b>projected</b> <b>sheet</b> beam in 640 × 480 pixel resolution. An integrated sys-tem controller implemented on an FPGA performs sensor control, light projection control, range data pre-processing and suppression of redundant data transmission for the fatal problems of the real-time system.
