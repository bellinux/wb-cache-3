5|$|Initially {{second to}} the 747 as Boeing's most {{profitable}} jetliner, the 777 became the company's most lucrative model in the 2000s. Program sales accounted for an estimated US$400million of Boeing's <b>pretax</b> earnings in 2000, US$50million more than the 747. By 2004, the airliner comprised the bulk of wide-body revenues for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division. In 2007, orders for second-generation 777 models approached 350 aircraft, and in November of that year, Boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 2012.

2500|$|In May 2017, {{new data}} sets from the economists Piketty, Saez, and Gabriel Zucman of University of California, Berkeley {{demonstrate}} that inequality runs {{much deeper than}} previous data indicated. The share of incomes {{for those in the}} bottom half of the U.S. population stagnated and declined during the years 1980 to 2014 from 20% in 1980 to 12% in 2014. By contrast, the top 1% share of income grew from 12% in 1980 to 20% in 2014. The top 1% now makes on average 81 times more than the bottom 50% of adults, where as in 1981 they made 27 times more. <b>Pretax</b> incomes for the top 0.001% surged 636% during the years 1980 to 2014. The economists also note that the growth of inequality during the 1970s to the 1990s can be attributed to wage growth among top earners, but the ever-widening gap has been [...] "a capital-driven phenomenon since the late 1990s." [...] They posit that [...] "the working rich are either turning into or being replaced by rentiers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2015, Boeing {{announced}} that it had taken a further $835 million <b>pretax</b> charge to pay for redesigns and retrofits required to address a faulty integrated fuel system. A Boeing spokesperson stated that “in preparing for and performing fuel system qualification testing, we {{identified a number of}} fuel system parts and components that did not meet specifications and needed to be redesigned. We’re adding the engineers and ancillary staff resources needed to support the engineering redesign, manufacturing retrofit and qualification and certification of the fuel system changes, and the conclusion of functional and flight testing." [...] Boeing may have to wait an extra eight months for $3 billion in contracts on the KC-46 because of delays caused by the wiring and fuel system parts flaws, according to the USAF. Low-rate production contracts to build the first 19 of the tankers may be delayed from August to as late as April 2016 in the latest schedule revision agreed on by the Air Force and Boeing. The planned first flight of a fully equipped KC-46 is being delayed to as late as September 2015. Air Force Spokesman, Charles Gulick, noted that the primary goal, [...] "delivery of 18 tankers by August 2017" [...] can be met. The Bank of America/Merrill Lynch noted in July 2015 “We fail to understand how Boeing could take a $1.26 billion pre-tax charge (since it won the contract over Airbus) on the Boeing KC-46A program since the program is based on the 767 airframe that has been in production for over 30 years.” ...|$|E
