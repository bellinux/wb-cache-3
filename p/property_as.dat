5|$|In 1920 keen {{supporters}} of the Port Adelaide Football Club, headed by Mr. Swain, collectively raised £77.13.8 and bought Harold a Rover 3.5hp motor-cycle so he could make his commute of over 200km to and from Berri where he eventually settled on his own <b>property</b> <b>as</b> a fruit grower during the 1920 season.|$|E

5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with <b>property</b> <b>as</b> the chief concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his {{sons and daughters}} should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E
5|$|Burns and Rigby {{found several}} prototiles, {{including}} the Koch snowflake, {{that may be}} used to tile the plane only by using copies of the prototile in two or more different sizes. An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles the plane only when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares, the square does not have the same <b>property</b> <b>as</b> these prototiles of only tiling by similarity, because it also is possible to tile the plane using only squares of a single size.|$|E

5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics required him to do so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish <b>property</b> <b>as</b> part of the Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses {{would have to be}} made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E
5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this <b>property.</b> <b>As</b> Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Railtrack {{announced}} that, {{due to its}} {{own financial}} problems, it would not undertake to purchase section2, triggering a second restructuring. The 2002 plan agreed that the two sections would have different owners (Railtrack for section1, LCR for section2) but with common Railtrack management. Following further financial problems at Railtrack, its interest was sold back to LCR, which then sold the operating rights for the completed line to Network Rail, Railtrack's successor. Under this arrangement LCR became the sole owner of both sections of the CTRL and the St Pancras <b>property,</b> <b>as</b> per the original 1996 plan. Amendments were made in 2001 for the new station at Stratford International and connections to the West Coast Main Line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, with its {{significant}} rainfall, wildfires {{are relatively small}} and have rarely posed great risk to life and <b>property.</b> <b>As</b> white settlements moved further west into drier areas, the first large scale fires were encountered.
