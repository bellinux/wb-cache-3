40|$|In the {{literature}} on the subject of economy there are three functions of public finance described: stabilazing, redistributing and allocating. Effectiveness of realization of the abovementioned functions depends to a large extent on the political system of a given country, especially on the degree to which it is decentralized.

40|$|Fiscal {{federalism}} {{refers to}} the attribution of <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> <b>functions</b> among different levels of government. We examine Portugal's metropolitan transportation sector through the fiscal federalist lens, {{in light of the}} country's decentralization efforts and new relevant legislation. We clarify basic principles of fiscal federalism and adapt them to the finance of metropolitan transportation systems – typically characterized by multiple jurisdictions, numerous externalities and equity concerns – showing the inadequacy of general practice. Portugal's overall public finance system partially adheres to fiscal federalist principles; the transportation sector less so. Metropolitan transportation faces particular troubles, with few direct user fees, prices inadequately reflecting costs, and heavy reliance on central government subsidies for public transportation investments and operations. A new law creating metropolitan transportation authorities is only modestly consistent with fiscal federalist principles, since it inadequately details financial responsibilities and remains under heavy central government control. Absent additional reforms, the new metropolitan authorities should aim to make the transportation finance system explicit and test incentive grants to induce inter-municipal cooperation.

40|$|The essays that {{comprise}} this Handbook cover {{a wide variety}} of topics in the theory of <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> As a field of systematic academic inquiry, <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> arose before economics or political economy. For instance, more than 90 chairs in <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> had been established in Europe before the first chair was established in political economy (Backhaus 2002, p. 615). The first scholars of <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> were the Cameralists, who emerged in central Europe in the 16 th century. For a long time after its Cameralist founding, <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> was conceived as a multi-disciplinary field of study, and most certainly not simply a subset of economic theory. The object that <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> scholarship examined, the public household, was examined in a manner that sought to integrate the economic, political, legal, and administrative elements of <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> In the post-war period, a splintering of approaches has taken place, sufficiently so that it is meaningful to distinguish between the old <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> and the new, recognizing that new is not a synonym for better. The old <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> has not been replaced by the new. Both are practiced currently, and are competing for the affection and attention of scholars. If the old-style <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> is still called <b>public</b> <b>finance,</b> the new style is often called public economics instead.
