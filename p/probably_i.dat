500|$|In 1967, Marshall Chess formed Cadet Concept Records as a {{subsidiary}} of Chess Records. The label's first release was the self-titled debut album of the psychedelic band Rotary Connection, whose members Chess described as [...] "the hottest, most avant garde rock guys in Chicago". As {{a result of the}} album's success, Chess felt that he could revive the career of bluesmen Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf by recording two albums of experimental, psychedelic blues, producing the albums Electric Mud and The Howlin' Wolf Album. [...] Chess hoped the new albums would sell well among fans of psychedelic rock bands influenced by Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. According to Muddy Waters, [...] "Quite naturally, I like a good-selling record. I was looking at it because I played for so many of these so-called hippies that I thought <b>probably</b> <b>I</b> could reach them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ricky Ponting {{found himself}} criticised by journalists on his {{captaincy}} and {{performances in the}} 2005 series during {{the run-up to the}} first Test. When questioned in a press conference on this subject, he said [...] "We didn't perform the way we would have liked and <b>probably</b> <b>I</b> didn't score the runs I would have liked to during the Ashes... It's important for us to move on, to move forward from that; that is me as a player, me as a captain {{and the rest of the}} team as well... We have managed to do that very well, we've actually played better cricket as a result of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, [...] "It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. I never knew what that was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was {{the kind of place where}} it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But <b>probably</b> <b>I</b> didn't." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] confessed Agatha apathetically. [...] "I suppose I {{shall have}} to go away--to Winnipeg, most <b>probably.</b> <b>I</b> could teach, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very <b>probably.</b> <b>I</b> am {{far from}} contradicting you there. Pray understand, Mr. Robarts, that I bring no {{accusation}} against the archdeacon. Why should I?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of that too," [...] said Frank. [...] "I shall take to {{painting}} pictures in earnest;--portraits <b>probably.</b> <b>I</b> don't see why I shouldn't {{do as well as}} anybody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let him {{be what he}} may, I {{was glad}} to have it. Most <b>probably</b> <b>I</b> shall never see him again. He sails from Southampton for the Mandarins on this day week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, indeed--if I {{was to be}} Sir Anything, which <b>probably</b> <b>I</b> never shall be, I would hold, like my forefathers, to my {{good old}} Antony, which {{it was not my}} doing to disregard.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel very}} much indebted to you anyhow, Hartington. <b>Probably</b> had <b>I</b> been in your place the matter {{would have gone}} {{altogether}} differently." ...|$|R
60|$|GERALD. Yes, <b>probably.</b> Only, <b>I</b> don't. I can't help it. I think we've {{gone the}} way we had to go, {{following}} our own natures.|$|R
