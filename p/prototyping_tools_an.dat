However, historically cell-free systems were used to explore natural phenomena before the advent of genetic modification and transformation technology.

For these cell-free systems to be effective <b>prototyping</b> <b>tools,</b> <b>an</b> understanding of cell-free system mechanics must be established that is not purely protein-expression driven.

The guidelines are then used to develop the prototype of an educational model of kinesin, a simple and vital motor protein.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic methodology {{for the design}} and manufacturing of deep drawing tools generating high quality components at an extremely short lead time. <b>Prototype</b> <b>tools</b> for five different super alloy Inconel 718 sheet metal components were designed, manufactured and tested in 15 weeks. Two of these <b>prototype</b> <b>tools</b> (<b>A,</b> B) are the topics of this paper. The methodology is based on virtual tool design in which the tool concepts are secured and optimized with respect to sheet metal formability and shape deviation using FE-analyses. Tool surfaces are compensated for springback, if necessary, using the *INTERFACE_COMPENSATED_NEW capability in LS-DYNA v 971 (B). The compensated FE tool surfaces are used as reference to generate high quality surfaces suitable for the milling process. Laser scanning {{was used to determine}} shape deviation. The CAD-evaluation revealed a minor shape deviation within tolerance of component (A) and a small over-compensation of the final geometry of component (B). The maximum shape deviation was however in the order of the sheet thickness.

40|$|Rapid {{construction}} of metal parts and <b>prototype</b> <b>tool</b> direct from CAD drawings {{has long been}} the main objective of the Rapid Prototyping (RP) industry. Laser Sintering {{is one of the few}} RP processes which possesses the capability of producing parts directly from metals. Tody it is mainly used for the production of prototype moulds and old inserts for polymer injection moulding, whereas their fast and economic fabrication and suitability for the production of technical prototypes is of vital importance. Thes technical prototypes cold be used for fit and function tests in a very early stage of the development process, thus resulting in product cost reduction and in profit due to the earlier introduction of a new product to marktet. Current laser sintered metal parts still suffer from shrinkage, porosity problems and thus poor mechanical properties. These problems have to be solved in a satisfactory manner when applying the Laser Sintering technology to the fabrication of <b>prototype</b> <b>tools.</b> <b>As</b> the past has proved, these problems can't be solved by just focusing on the Laser Sintering process itself.

40|$|Creating {{business}} vocabularies {{and rules}} {{is a difficult}} process, but ontologies is a different case with its strict structure policies and specialised tools with logic and syntax checkers. As {{a result of this}} there‘s a wider range of ontology examples created. So it‘s wise not to start creating business rules and vocabularies from scratch, but take an existing ontology and transform it to business vocabulary and rules. But there is no reliable solution how to achieve this transformation. This masters thesis examines the possibility of transforming a particular subject area ontology into SBVR business vocabularies and rules and describes the proposed methodology for transforming OWL 2 described ontology into SBVR. The methodology allows the transformation of OWL syntax elements without individuals. Activity diagrams and functional equations were used for describing the methodology in formal manner. The created methodology was successfully implemented in <b>a</b> <b>prototype</b> <b>tool.</b> <b>A</b> conclusion was drawn from the experimental results, that if the ontology element set does not exceed the defined rules set and the ontology itself is not ambiguous, the created methodology can be held as correct and can be used in business and information system creation processes...|$|R
