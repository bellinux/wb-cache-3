Fortunately, [...] "routine childhood immunization {{is perhaps the most}} well-established public health program globally, due to substantial technical/financial support it receives yearly from UNICEF, WHO and several donor agencies/partners" [...] (McPherson & Olusanya, 2008). [...] Mothers with newborns, regardless of the birthing location, take their babies to immunization clinics at designated community health centers. Immunization clinics have been used as platforms for delivering new child health intervention packages in developing countries (WHO, 2002) due their popularity derived from its known <b>preventive</b> <b>value</b> of preventing childhood deaths from killer disease and because it is offered free to parents. Therefore, community-based hearing screenings may be performed in immunization clinics in hopes of reaching the newborn babies missed in hospital-based screenings. Furthermore, Lin et al.

For that purpose, fleas from different colonies from North America, Germany and South Africa were used to induce infestations in cats under laboratory conditions. In each study, between 12 and 16 cats were allocated randomly to 2 groups. Cats in Group 1 were not treated and served as controls. Cats in Group 2 were treated once on Day 0 with BROADLINE® at the minimum recommended dosage of 0. 12 mg/kg body weight. In 4 studies, all animals were infested experimentally with unfed C. felis (100 ± 5) on Days 2 (or 1), 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Live fleas were counted 24 h post-treatment or infestation.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Current study investigates the anticancer activity of the methanolic extract of strawberry (MESB) fruits in leukaemia (CEM) and breast cancer (T 47 D) cell lines ex vivo, and its cancer therapeutic and chemopreventive potential in mice models. Results of MTT, trypan blue and LDH assays suggested that MESB can induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells, irrespective of origin, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Treatment of mice bearing breast adenocarcinoma with MESB blocked the proliferation of tumor cells in a time-dependent manner and resulted in extended life span.

Due to these properties, we analysed anti-thrombotic effects of H 2 S and {{the participation of the}} nitric oxide synthase (NOS) -pathway. Materials and MethodsIn individual venules of the ear of hairless SKH 1 -hr mice, thrombus formation was induced using a phototoxic light/dye-injury model and intravital fluorescence microscopy. Animals were treated intravenously with the H 2 S donor Na 2 S or NaCl as control. In a second setting, the NOS inhibitor L-NAME was applied intraperitoneally as a bolus 12 h prior to Na 2 S treatment and thrombus induction. Blood and ear tissue were sampled after microscopy for assessment of plasma concentrations of soluble (s) P-selectin, sE-selectin, sVCAM- 1 and sICAM- 1 and expression of endothelial (e) NOS and inducible (i) NOS, respectively. ResultsWhen mice were treated with Na 2 S, venular thrombus formation was significantly delayed versus that in animals of the NaCl-treated control group. While plasma levels of pro-thrombotic adhesion molecules were not affected by Na 2 S, immunohistochemistry of the vessel walls showed a significant up-regulation of eNOS and iNOS expression within the Na 2 S-treated group. The delay of thrombus formation in the Na 2 S-group was partly but significantly reverted by application of L-NAME.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The gradual {{increase}} of persons living with HIV, mainly {{due to the}} reduced mortality achieved with effective antiretroviral therapies, calls for increased rationality and awareness in health resources consumption also during the early illness phases. Aim of this work is the estimation of the budget impact related to the variation in backbone prescribing trends in naïve patients. METHODS: Target population {{is the number of}} patients starting antiretroviral therapy each year, according to the Italian HIV surveillance registry, excluding patients receiving non-authorized or non-recommended regimens. We modeled 3 -year mortality and durability rates on a dynamic cohort, basing on international literature. A prevalent patients analysis has also been conducted, for which the model is fed by a closed cohort consisting of all the patients without experience of virologic failure. The aim of this collateral analysis is to estimate the difference in current annual expenditures if the past prescription trends for patients starting therapy would have led to the evaluated hypothetical scenarios. Current Italian market shares of triple regimens containing first-choice or alternative backbones (tenofovir/emtricitabine, abacavir/lamivudine, tenofovir/lamivudine and zidovudine/lamivudine) are compared to three hypothetical scenarios (base-case, minimum and maximum) in which increasing shares of patients eligible to abacavir/lamivudine start first line treatment with this backbone. Annual cost for each regimen comprises drugs acquisition under hospital pricing rules, monitoring exams and <b>preventive</b> tests, <b>valued</b> basing on regional reimbursement tariffs. RESULTS: According to current prescribing trends, in the next three years about 13, 000 patients starting HIV therapy will receive tenofovir/emtricitabine (83 % of the target population), and minor portions other regimens (9 % abacavir/lamivudine, 8 % zidovudine/lamivudine). Patients that would be eligible to abacavir/lamivudine are 1. 5, 4. 5 and 6 thousand more than those presently treated according to the three hypothetical scenarios, leading to a cumulative saving of 850 thousand, 2. 4 million and 3. 3 million euro, respectively. If in the past the same modification of first line prescription trend was adopted, the annual current cost saving would vary from 922 thousands to 7. 3 million euro. Most of this amount is due to reduced acquisition costs and, secondarily, to lower monitoring needs. CONCLUSION: Where patient features don’t force the choice of the backbone, abacavir/lamivudine prescription may induce substantial savings, allowing the release of resources needed to manage more complicated/advanced cases.

40|$|Centella asiatica (雷公根 léi gōng gēn) is a {{traditional}} medicinal herb with high antioxidant activity, which decreases amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain. At the same time, aggregated Aβ-induced oxidative stress is the trigger in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the ability of C. asiatica ethanol extract (CAE) to protect PC 12 and IMR 32 cells from Aβ 1 – 40 -induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and concomitant neurotoxicity. Aggregated Aβ 1 – 40 treatment resulted in reduced cell viability, which can be reversed by cotreatment with 25, 50, and 100  μg/mL CAE. Moreover, CAE eliminated the Aβ 1 – 40 -mediated increase in ROS production. Thus, CAE-mediated protection against aggregated Aβ 1 – 40 -induced neurotoxicity is attributable to modulation of the antioxidative defense system in cells, including the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and levels of glutathione and glutathione disulfide by CAE.

Mice that received a HFD had significantly greater body weights than the control mice and also exhibited features consistent with knee OA. The mice that received a HFD in combination with low, intermediate, or high doses of resveratrol were only slightly heavier than the control mice at the end of 12 weeks. Quantitative histological assessments indicated that resveratrol treatment partly recovered joint structure in the mice that received a HFD, while high doses of resveratrol prevented the degradation of type II collagen into C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) and retained type II collagen expression in cartilage. Furthermore, TUNEL analyses revealed a reduction in chondrocyte apoptosis in the resveratrol-treated mice compared with the HFD mice. Thus, oral resveratrol appears to exert anti-OA effects in a mouse model of HFD-induced OA, thereby highlighting the potential <b>preventive</b> and therapeutic <b>value</b> of administering resveratrol for obesity-associated OA...|$|R
40|$|Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD), ranging from simple {{steatosis}} to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and eventually cirrhosis and liver failure, {{is seen to}} be increasing amongst Western children. NAFLD rates are rising in parallel with the epidemic of childhood obesity, and in particular, fatty liver evolves more easily in NASH when poor dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle are combined. In fact, its general prevalence in the child population varies between 2. 6 % and 10 %, but increases up to 80 % in obese children. Since NASH is expected {{to become the most}} common cause of pediatric chronic liver disease in the near future, there is broad interest amongst clinical researchers to move forward, both in diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, to date, the expensive and invasive procedure of liver biopsy is seen as the gold standard for NASH diagnosis and few noninvasive diagnostic methods can be applied successfully. Moreover, there are still no approved pharmacological interventions for NAFLD/NASH. Therefore, current management paradigms are based upon the presence of associated risk factors and aims to improve an individual’s quality of life, thus reducing NAFLD-associated morbidity and mortality. Today, lifestyle intervention (diet and exercise) is the treatment of choice for NAFLD/NASH. Thus far, no study has evaluated the potential preventive effect of lifestyle intervention on children at risk of NAFLD/NASH. Future studies will be required in this area with the perspective of developing a national program to promote nutrition education and increase physical activity as means of preventing the disease in individuals at risk. Here, we outline the clinical course, pathogenesis and management of NAFLD in children, highlighting the <b>preventive</b> and therapeutic <b>value</b> of lifestyle intervention...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Human Movement Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{prevalence}} of morphological asymmetry amongst sport participants and sedentary individuals {{has been well}} documented. The importance of studies in this field is accentuated {{by the fact that}} morphological asymmetry has a negative effect on the health and performance of elite athletes. The purpose of this study was, therefore, firstly to determine whether significant differences for thirty five anthropometrical measurements exist between the dominant and nondominant sides of male (n = 16) and female (n = 11) crawl stroke swimmers. Dependent t-tests were used for this purpose. All of the measurements were taken twice on both the dominant and nondominant sides of the body, according to the methods described by Norton et al. (1996). Amongst the male swimmers, the (relaxed-, tensed- and corrected-) upper arm girths, wrist girth, thigh girth and lower leg length showed statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences. Amongst the female swimmers statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences were found for the thigh girth, upper leg length and foot length. The second purpose was to compare the indices of morphological asymmetry of twenty upper body anthropometrical variables of the male swimmers to that of male fast bowlers (n = 27) and aged-matched sedentary males (n = 27). This comparison was done using an ANOVA with Tukey post hoc tests. The indices of morphological asymmetry were determined with Wolaiiski's Relative Indices of Asymmetry (RIA). The RIA for the twenty upper body measurements for the three groups in this comparison are also reported. Statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences were found for the (relaxed, tensed and corrected) upper arm girths and halfchest girth when the fast bowlers were compared to the male swimmers {{as well as for the}} comparison between the fast bowlers and the sedentary individuals. A statistically significant (p < 0. 05) difference was also found for the hand length between the fast bowlers and the sedentary individuals. To conclude, all four of the measured groups showed indices of morphological asymmetry for certain anthropometrical variables, with the fast bowlers showing the highest indices and the swimmers showing the lowest indices of morphological asymmetry. These results support the notion that swimming may have <b>preventive</b> and therapeutic <b>value</b> for athletes who show a high degree of morphological asymmetry due to participation in unilateral sport types. Further research is, however, required. Master...|$|R
