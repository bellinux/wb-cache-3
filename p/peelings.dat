Unavoidable foods, such as vegetable <b>peelings</b> and tea bags, account for 19 per cent of the total, with the remaining 20 per cent being unavoidable through preferences (e.g. bread crusts) and cooking types (e.g. potato skins). However, the vast majority of consumers (90%) are unaware of the amount of food they throw away; individuals who believed that their household wasted no food were shown to be throwing away 88kg of avoidable food per year.|$|E

2500|$|The Prisoner {{was very}} popular with the gaming press. [...] The {{magazine}} <b>Peelings</b> II awarded the game an A+, its highest rating, and noted that if only the game had high-resolution graphics, {{it would have been}} a candidate for its Game of the Year Award. According to Softalk, [...] "What puts this game head and shoulders above other adventures is that while the player is seeking the information needed to escape from the Island, the computer is actively seeking the information that will make the player lose the game. [...] The dual challenges of learning about the Island while avoiding the subtle and not-so-subtle traps laid by the computer make the game both interesting and exciting". Softline stated that the game [...] "that exercises your intellect like few games", and concluded that [...] "The Prisoner is imaginative, well presented and thought provoking. Hats off to Dave Mullich and Edu-ware Services for bringing real mental challenge to the game industry". BYTE stated that the game [...] "is not for the easily frustrated ... The Prisoner is complex beyond belief, nearly unbeatable, and at times irrational on purpose". It warned, [...] "if you follow the rules, trust your fellow man, or display anything less than a total commitment to anti-social, anti-island behavior, you will be hopelessly doomed to repeated failure", and concluded," [...] it will appeal to puzzle solvers and seekers of the bizarre".|$|E

You're to play the part of the solid but disheveled capitalist from the Far West. You despise the conventions. You've got so many stocks you can afford to shake socks. Conservative, homely, rough, shrewd, saving--that's your pose. It's a winner in New York. Keep your feet on the desk and eat apples. Whenever anybody comes in eat an apple.

60|$|It {{was after}} sunset, when the adventurers returned. I looked {{down over the}} ship's high side as if looking down over the curb of a well, and dimly saw the damp boat, deep in the sea with some unwonted weight. Ropes were dropt over, and {{presently}} three huge antediluvian-looking tortoises, after much straining, were landed on deck. They seemed hardly of the seed of earth. We had been broad upon the waters for five long months, a period amply sufficient to make all things of the land wear a fabulous hue to the dreamy mind. Had three Spanish custom-house officers boarded us then, it is not unlikely that I should have curiously stared at them, felt of them, and stroked them much as savages serve civilized guests. But instead of three custom-house officers, behold these really wondrous tortoises--none of your schoolboy mud-turtles--but black as widower's weeds, heavy as chests of plate, with vast shells medallioned and orbed like shields, and dented and blistered like shields that have breasted a battle, shaggy, too, here and there, with dark green moss, and slimy with the spray of the sea. These mystic creatures, suddenly translated by night from unutterable solitudes to our peopled deck, affected me in a manner not easy to unfold. They seemed newly crawled forth from beneath {{the foundations of the}} world. Yea, they seemed the identical tortoises whereon the Hindoo plants this total sphere. With a lantern I inspected them more closely. Such worshipful venerableness of aspect! Such furry greenness mantling the rude <b>peelings</b> and healing the fissures of their shattered shells. I no more saw three tortoises. They expanded--became transfigured. I seemed to see three Roman Coliseums in magnificent decay.|$|E

50|$|This convoy, {{especially}} {{the arrival of}} Ohio, was seen as Divine intervention {{by the people of}} Malta.

It had been agreed by military commanders at the time that if supplies became any lower, they would surrender the islands (the actual date, deferred as supplies were received, was referred to as the target date). At that time, to stretch the supply of flour, the Maltese mixed flour with potato <b>peelings,</b> making a sort of brown bread.
