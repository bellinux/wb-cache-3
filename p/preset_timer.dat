50|$|The rocket {{was able}} to be {{recovered}} as the recovery section contained a 5-foot parachute, to which the entire rocket was attached. After launch, a <b>preset</b> <b>timer</b> controlled deployment of the parachute.|$|E
50|$|The Group Temporal Key (GTK) used in {{the network}} {{may need to be}} updated due to the expiry of a <b>preset</b> <b>timer.</b> When a device leaves the network, the GTK also needs to be updated. This is to prevent the device from {{receiving}} any more multicast or broadcast messages from the AP.|$|E

At end of sampling period, fresh slide is automatically moved into position, and exposed filter is displaced into storage compartment.

2500|$|A common {{solution}} to the problem of electricity involves <b>preset</b> <b>timers</b> (Shabbat clocks) for electric appliances, to turn them on and off automatically, with no human intervention on Shabbat itself. Some Conservative authorities reject altogether the arguments for prohibiting the use of electricity. Some Orthodox also hire a [...] "Shabbos goy", a Gentile to perform prohibited tasks (like operating light switches) on Shabbat.|$|R
5000|$|Arcing {{time can}} be reduced by {{temporarily}} setting upstream protective devices to lower setpoints during maintenance periods, or by employing zone-selective interlocking protection (ZSIP). With zone-selective interlocking, a downstream breaker that detects a fault communicates with an upstream breaker to delay its instantaneous tripping function. In this way [...] "selectivity" [...] will be preserved, in other words faults in the circuit are cleared by the breaker nearest to the fault, minimizing {{the effect on the}} entire system. A fault on a branch circuit will be detected by all breakers upstream of the fault (closer to the source of power). The circuit breaker closest to the downstream fault will send a restraining signal to prevent upstream breakers from tripping instantaneously. The presence of the fault will nevertheless activate the <b>preset</b> trip delay <b>timer(s)</b> of the upstream circuit breaker(s); this will allow an upstream circuit breaker to interrupt the fault, if still necessary after the preset time has elapsed. The ZSIP system allows faster instantaneous trip settings to be used, without loss of selectivity. The faster trip times reduce the total energy in an arc fault discharge.|$|R
30|$|For the MAC layer, we have {{employed}} a simple CSMA/CA scheme without RTS/CTS, {{which is based}} on SMAC. Like [30], as an automatic repeat request (ARQ) mechanism, we retransmit a packet if an acknowledgement is not received after <b>timer</b> <b>preset.</b> The maximum number of retransmissions before dropping a packet is 4. The results were obtained for two sector-shaped configurations. In the first one, a sector-shaped area with R = 400 Â m which was divided into 4 annuluses and 16 cells where 50 nodes were deployed. In the second configuration, the sector-shaped area had a radius of 800, 8 annuluses, 64 cells, and 200 nodes. The number of sources for these configurations changed from 5 to 25 and 10 to 100, respectively. The data packet size was 120 bytes, and the routing update packets were 40 bytes. For the energy parameters, we assumed the same values as those mentioned in section 4. The simulations were performed for one period of sending report by the WSN sources. It should be noted that in all simulations, to report the energy consumption like in Section 4, we got the sum of the average energy consumption of all network nodes. All the simulation results were obtained by averaging the results of ten simulation runs. We have also shown the corresponding 90 % confidence interval for the results.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine the}} potential energy savings associated with implementing demand defrost strategies to defrost supermarket refrigerated display case evaporators, as compared to the widely accepted current practice of controlling display case defrost cycles with a <b>preset</b> <b>timer.</b> The defrost heater energy use of several representative display case types was evaluated. In addition, demand defrost strategies for refrigerated display cases as well as those used in residential refrigerator/freezers were evaluated. Furthermore, it is anticipated that future work will include identifying a preferred defrost strategy, with input from Retail Energy Alliance members. Based on this strategy, a demand defrost system will be designed which is suitable for supermarket refrigerated display cases. Limited field testing of the preferred defrost strategy will be performed in a supermarket environment...|$|E
40|$|A {{portable}} wind sensitive directional air sampler {{was developed}} {{as part of}} an air pollution source identification system. The system is designed to identify sources of air pollution based on the directional collection of field air samples and their analysis for TSP and trace element characteristics. Sources can be identified by analyzing the data on the basis of pattern recognition concepts. The unit, designated Air Scout, receives wind direction signals from an associated wind vane. Air samples are collected on filter slides using a standard high volume air sampler drawing air through a porting arrangement which tracks the wind direction and permits collection of discrete samples. A <b>preset</b> <b>timer</b> controls the length of time each filter is in the sampling position. At the conclusion of the sampling period a new filter is automatically moved into sampling position displacing the previous filter to a storage compartment. Thus the Air Scout may be set up at a field location, loaded with up to 12 filter slides, and left to acquire air samples automatically, according to the wind, at any timer interval desired from 1 to 30 hours...|$|E
40|$|The Automated Adaptive Directed Evolution Chamber (AADEC) is {{a device}} that allows {{operators}} to generate a micro-scale analog of real world systems {{that can be used}} to model the local-scale effects of climate change on microbial ecosystems. The AADEC uses an artificial environment to expose cultures of micro-organisms to environmental pressures, such as UV-C radiation, chemical toxins, and temperature. The AADEC autonomously exposes micro-organisms to selection pressures. This improves upon standard manual laboratory techniques: the process can take place over a longer period of time, involve more stressors, implement real-time adjustments based on the state of the population, and minimize the risk of contamination. We currently use UV-C radiation as the main selection pressure, UV-C is well studied both for its cell and DNA damaging effects as a type of selection pressure and for its related effectiveness as a mutagen; having these functions united makes it a good choice for a proof of concept. The AADEC roadmap includes expansion to different selection pressures, including heavy metal toxicity, temperature, and other forms of radiation. The AADEC uses closed-loop control to feedback the current state of the culture to the AADEC controller that modifies selection pressure intensity during experimentation, in this case culture density and growth rate. Culture density and growth rate are determined by measuring the optical density of the culture using 600 nm light. An array of 600 nm LEDs illuminate the culture and photodiodes are used to measure the shadow on the opposite side of the chamber. Previous experiments showed that we can produce a million fold increase to UV-C radiation over seven iterations. The most recent implements a microfluidic system that can expose cultures to multiple different selection pressures, perform non-survival based selection, and autonomously perform hundreds of exposure cycles. A scalable pump system gives the ability to pump in various different growth media to individual cultures and introduce chemical toxins during experimentation; AADEC can perform freeze and thaw cycles. We improved our baseline characterization by building a custom UV-C exposure hood, a shutter operates on a <b>preset</b> <b>timer</b> allowing the user to set exposure intensity consistently for multiple iterations...|$|E
