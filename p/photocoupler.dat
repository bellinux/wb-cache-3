50|$|In electronics, an opto-isolator, {{also called}} an optocoupler, <b>photocoupler,</b> or optical isolator, is a {{component}} that transfers electrical signals between two isolated circuits by using light. Opto-isolators prevent high voltages from affecting the system receiving the signal. Commercially available opto-isolators withstand input-to-output voltages up to 10 kV and voltage transients with {{speeds up to}} 10 kV/μs.|$|E
40|$|A full-charge {{indicator}} for battery chargers, {{includes a}} transistor {{which is in}} a conductive state as long as charging current to the battery {{is not less than}} a level which indicates that the battery did not reach full charge. When the battery reaches full charge, a voltage drop in a resistor in the charging current path is not sufficient to maintain the transistor in a conducting state, and therefore it is switched off. When this occurs an LED is turned on, to indicate a full charge state of the battery. A <b>photocoupler</b> together with a <b>photocoupler</b> transistor are included. When the transistor is off, the <b>photocoupler</b> activates the <b>photocoupler</b> transistor to shunt out a resistor, thereby reducing the charging current to the battery to a float charging current and prevent the battery from being overcharged and damaged...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{a design}} of {{high-speed}} power-off circuit and analysis. The incidence of high-dose transient radiation into the silicon-based semiconductor element induces the photocurrent {{due to the}} creation of electron-hole pairs, which causes the upset phenomenon of active elements or triggers the parasitic thyristor in the element, resulting in latch-up. High speed power-off circuit was designed to prevent burn-out of electronic device caused by Latch-up. The proposed high speed power-off circuit was configured with the darlington transistor and <b>photocoupler</b> so that the power was interrupted and recovered without the need for an additional circuit, in order to improve the existing problem of SCR off when using the thyristor. The discharge speed of the high speed power interruption circuit was measured to b...|$|E
40|$|As {{a type of}} {{isolator}} {{favored by}} manufacturers, <b>photocouplers</b> now serve as noise protectors in many electronic devices. Toshiba’s <b>photocouplers</b> consist of either a GaAs or GaA As infrared LED(s) and a silicon photodetector(s) housed in a white mold package. GaA As LEDs are adopted in high-speed photo-IC types due to their highspeed and high-light output. Toshiba’s innovative white mold packaging also greatly contributes to high sensitivity, high CTR and superb reliability. White overmol...|$|R
40|$|Major {{concerns}} {{which clearly}} express necessity of analog isolator applications, are removing ground loop, increasing common-mode voltage rejection, improving noise immunity and protecting operator, expensive equipment and data from transient voltages. Optical coupling is {{an approach to}} signal isolation in which all mentioned benefits are covered. This paper is going to propose a novel idea of a particular optical analog signal isolator. It is introduced {{for the first time}} and therefore the authors named it YOUTAB. The digital <b>photocoupler</b> NEC-PS 2501 constitutes the main structure of this new isolator. In general, the proposed configuration consist of two different parts that one of them transfers the signal and the other establishes a negative feedback to ensure that the output signal has the same features of the input signal. The operation, analysis and computer simulation results are shown. The simulation results show that this novel proposed analog isolator is linear in a wide range of inputs. </p...|$|E
