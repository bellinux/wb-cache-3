50|$|The {{drills and}} pipe <b>pushing</b> <b>machines</b> {{were used to}} bury a series of 3 in {{diameter}} pipes, each at a shallow angle to a maximum depth of about 8 ft. Each pipe was about 55 ft long and they were placed at intervals of 25 ft in an overlapping pattern such that {{the lower end of}} the first pipe would end up about 15 feet underground; the next pipe would then be pushed into the ground behind the first so that the upper end of that pipe would overlap with {{the lower end of the}} earlier pipe. The pipes were packed with explosives which when detonated would produce a very effective anti-tank obstacle about 28 ft wide and 8 ft deep with loose soil at the bottom. This ditch would be sufficient to either stop a tank altogether or to force it be exposed to anti-tank weapons for several minutes as it effected a crossing. Pipe <b>pushing</b> <b>machines</b> were used to drill into the approaches to bridges or embankments and left ready for instantaneous demolition.|$|R

50|$|The Old Loughborough {{became the}} {{standard}} lacemaking machine, particularly the 1820 form {{known as the}} Circular producing two-twist plain net. The smooth, unpatterned tulle produced on these machines was {{on a par with}} real, handmade lace net. Heathcoat’s bobbinet machine is so ingeniously designed that the ones used today have suffered little alteration. However during the next 30 years inventors were patenting improvements to their machines. The ones that stand out are the <b>Pusher</b> <b>machine,</b> the Levers machine (now spelled Leavers) and the Nottingham lace curtain machine. Each of these developed into separate machines. Others were the Traverse Warp machine and the Straight Bolt machine.|$|E
50|$|The frame {{viewed from}} the front is similar to Leavers machine. Its action is {{different}} as it produces a square net rather than a hexagonal one. The Nottingham lace curtain machine only has one warp and the patterning threads are carried on a spools not on a beam.

These patterns represent priors on observable motion, which can be utilized to describe a scene, answer behavior questions such as where is a vehicle going, how many vehicles are performing the same action, and to detect an abnormal event. The review focuses on two main methods for scene description, trajectory clustering and topic modeling. Example applications that utilize the behavioral modeling techniques are also presented.

50|$|Bobbinet {{machines}} were invented in 1808 by John Heathcoat. He studied the hand movements of a Northamptonshire manual lace maker and reproduced {{them in the}} roller-locker machine. The 1809 version of this machine (patent no.3216) {{became known as the}} Old Loughborough, it was 18 in wide and was designed for use with cotton. The Old Loughborough became the standard lacemaking machine, particularly the 1824 form known as the Circular, producing two-twist plain net. The smooth, unpatterned tulle produced on these machines was on a par with real, handmade lace net.

5000|$|The coin <b>pusher</b> <b>machine</b> {{consists}} of two shelves filled with flat circular counters; the upper shelf moves slowly back and forth, while the lower one is stationary. The rear face of the machine is divided into four [...] "drop zones," [...] each of which contains a pachinko-like pegboard. Contestants answer questions to win counters, then choose a drop zone and press their buzzer to release the counters into that zone. The {{goal is to have}} the counters land flat on the upper shelf so that its retraction will cause them to push other counters over its front edge, leading them in turn to push still others into a red [...] "win zone" [...] beneath the lower shelf. Contestants win £50 for each counter that drops into the win zone during their turn. Any counters that enter this zone when the machine is not in play, excluding the final round, are [...] "ambient drops" [...] and are removed from the machine with no effect on scoring. Counters that bounce out of the machine and onto the floor are treated as if they had landed in the win zone.|$|E
