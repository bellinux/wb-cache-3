40|$|Alignment between {{lithography}} layers {{is essential}} for device fabrication. A minor defect in a single marker can lead to incorrect alignment and this can {{be the source of}} wafer reworks. In this paper we show that this can be prevented by using extra alignment markers to check the alignment during patterning, rather than inspecting vernier patterns after the exposure is completed. Accurate vernier patterns can often only be read after pattern transfer has been carried out. We also show that by using a <b>Penrose</b> <b>tile</b> as a marker it is possible to locate the marker to about 1 nm without fully exposing the resist. This means that the marker can be reused with full accuracy, thus improving the layer to layer alignment accuracy. Lithography tool noise limits the process...|$|R

The modelling is based on <b>Penrose</b> <b>tile</b> decoration and uses Monte Carlo annealing to discover the dominant motifs, which are converted into rules for another level of description. The result is a network of edge-sharing large decagons on a binary tiling of edge 10. 5 A. A detailed analysis is given of the instability of a four-layer structure towards $c$-doubling and puckering of the atoms out of the layers, which is applied to explain the (pentagonal) orientational order.

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{influences}} {{in the design of}} the Storey Hall annex is the use of scientific theory on tile patterns by Roger Penrose. Penrose’s tiling pattern has been incorporated into the design, with the street façade being highly decorative with complex geometric forms and materials that lack ornament. The most striking feature of the Façade is the rhombus shaped tiles that start to come out of the façade which sit on a concrete wall. The colours that were used on the street façade are bright and make a bold statement with the neon green referencing the Hibernian Hall’s Irish heritage and of the building’s former use by the Suffragette movement early in the nineteenth century. The interior also uses the Penrose tiling system with patterns and geometry with the foyer containing rough concrete walls and columns with a curved stairwell. The main auditorium’s ceiling is decorated with brightly coloured geometric <b>Penrose</b> <b>tile</b> patterns and textures which reflect the rest of the building.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe present new {{results on}} the iron {{dynamics}} in the icosahedral quasicrystal i-AlCuFe and two cubic approximants {{as well as the}} non-approximant Al-Cu-Fe cubic B 2 phase. Conventional Mossbauer spectroscopy is used as well as, for the i-AlCuFe phase, high Doppler velocity Mossbauer spectroscopy and quasielastic neutron scattering for samples with different Fe isotope contents. We show that in the i-phase the Fe Lamb-Mossbauer recoilless fraction decreases below that predicted for lattice vibrations alone for temperatures above about 550 K. This decrease is correlated with the onset of a quasielastic signal seen in both Mossbauer and neutron backscattering spectroscopy, which indicates the presence above 550 K of Fe jump processes confined in a local cage. The timescale of the Fe jumps (660 ps at 1000 K) and their temperature dependence differ widely from those of Cu jumps in the same i-AlCuFe quasicrystal. From the temperature dependence of the quadrupole splitting of the (57) Fe Mossbauer spectrum, one can distinguish two kinds of Fe jumps, one starting at 550 K and the second above 800 K. In the two cubic approximants, a loss in the Fe recoilless fraction also occurs above 550 K, revealing the same kind of Fe dynamics as in the i-phase but the effect is smaller. On the other hand, no anomalous Fe dynamics (other than lattice vibrations) is detected in the B 2 -AlCuFe phase. Since the cubic approximants possess similar local configurations as the quasicrystal, we conclude that locally a <b>Penrose</b> <b>tile</b> description is appropriate. This shows that the detected Fe jumps can be interpreted in terms of phason-like local tiling flips...|$|R

According to this version, the two envelopes are filled first, then one is chosen at random and called Envelope A. Martin Gardner independently mentioned this same version in his 1989 book <b>Penrose</b> <b>Tiles</b> to Trapdoor Ciphers and the Return of Dr Matrix. Barry Nalebuff's asymmetric variant, often known as the Ali Baba problem, has one envelope filled first, called Envelope A, and given to Ali. Then a fair coin is tossed to decide whether Envelope B should contain half or twice that amount, and only then given to Baba.|$|E

[...] Noam Chomsky once wrote, [...] "Martin Gardner's contribution to contemporary intellectual culture is unique - in its range, its insight, and understanding of hard questions that matter." [...] Gardner repeatedly alerted the public (and other mathematicians) to recent discoveries in mathematics-recreational and otherwise. In addition to introducing many first-rate puzzles and topics such as <b>Penrose</b> <b>tiles</b> and Conway's Game of Life, he was equally adept at writing captivating columns about traditional mathematical topics such as knot theory, Fibonacci numbers, Pascal's triangle, the Möbius strip, transfinite numbers, four-dimensional space, Zeno's paradoxes, Fermat's last theorem, and the four-color problem.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, Hao Wang {{asked whether}} {{determining}} if {{a set of}} tiles admits a tiling of the plane is an algorithmically unsolvable problem or not. He conjectured that it is solvable, relying on the hypothesis that every set of tiles that can tile the plane can do it periodically (hence, it would suffice to try to tile bigger and bigger patterns until obtaining one that tiles periodically). Nevertheless, two years later, his student Robert Berger constructed a set of some 20,000 square tiles (now called Wang tiles) that can tile the plane {{but not in a}} periodic fashion. As further aperiodic sets of tiles were discovered, sets with fewer and fewer shapes were found. In 1976 Roger Penrose discovered a set of just two tiles, now referred to as <b>Penrose</b> <b>tiles,</b> that produced only non-periodic tilings of the plane. These tilings displayed instances of fivefold symmetry. One year later Alan Mackay showed experimentally that the diffraction pattern from the Penrose tiling had a two-dimensional Fourier transform consisting of sharp 'delta' peaks arranged in a fivefold symmetric pattern. Around the same time Robert Ammann created a set of aperiodic tiles that produced eightfold symmetry.|$|E
5000|$|One way {{to create}} {{quasi-periodic}} patterns {{is to create a}} Penrose tiling. Girih tiles can be subdivided into <b>Penrose</b> <b>tiles</b> called [...] "dart" [...] and [...] "kite", but {{there is no evidence that}} this approach was used by medieval artisans. Another {{way to create}} quasiperiodic patterns is by subdividing girih tiles repeatedly into smaller girih tiles using a subdivision rule. In the limit the plane would be divided into girih tiles that repeat with frequencies that are aperiodic. The use of such a subdivision rule would have been evidence that Islamic artisans of the 15th century were aware that girih tiles can produce patterns that never exactly repeat themselves. However, all known girih patterns made with girih tiles show no more than a two-level design. In fact, there would have been no practical need to have a girih pattern that had more than two levels of design, because a third level would have a scale either too large or too small to be perceived. It appears that medieval Islamic artisans were using a tool that had the potential of creating highly complex patterns, but they never realized it. As E. Makovicky argues, The artisans were satisfied by creating a large fundamental domain without being concerned with the mathematical notion of indefinitely expandable quasiperiodic patterns. However, they understood and used to their advantage some of the local geometric properties of the quasi-crystalline patterns they constructed.|$|E
