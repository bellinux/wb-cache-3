40|$|Path integration, the {{constant}} updating of the navigator's knowledge of position and orientation during movement, requires both visuospatial knowledge and memory. This study {{aimed to develop}} a systems-level understanding of human path integration by examining the basic building blocks of path integration in humans. To achieve this goal, we used functional imaging to examine the neural mechanisms that support the tracking and memory of translational and rotational components of human path integration. Critically, and in contrast to previous studies, we examined movement in translation and rotation tasks with no defined end-point or goal. Navigators accumulated translational and rotational information during virtual self-motion. Activity in hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) increased during both translation and rotation encoding, suggesting that these regions track self-motion information during path integration. These results address current questions regarding distance coding in the human brain. By implementing a modified delayed match to sample paradigm, we also examined the encoding and maintenance of path integration signals in working memory. Hippocampus, PHC, and RSC were recruited during successful encoding and maintenance of path integration information, with RSC selective for tasks that required <b>processing</b> <b>heading</b> rotation changes. These data indicate distinct working memory mechanisms for translation and rotation, which are essential for updating neural representations of current location. The results provide evidence that hippocampus, PHC, and RSC flexibly track task-relevant translation and rotation signals for path integration and could form the hub of a more distributed network supporting spatial navigation.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{repeatedly}} that visual and inertial sensory information on the heading of self-motion is fused by the CNS {{in a manner consistent}} with Bayesian Integration (BI). However, a few studies report violations of BI predictions. This dichotomy in experimental findings previously led us to develop a Causal Inference model for multisensory heading estimation, which could account for different strategies of <b>processing</b> multisensory <b>heading</b> information, based on discrepancies between the heading of the visual and inertial cues. Surprisingly, the results of an assessment of this model showed that multisensory heading estimates were consistent with BI regardless of any discrepancy. Here, we hypothesized that Causal Inference is a slow-top down process, and that heading estimates for discrepant cues show less consistency with BI when motion duration increases. Six participants were presented with unisensory visual and inertial horizontal linear motions with headings ranging between ± 180 °, and combinations thereof with discrepancies up to ± 90 °. Motion profiles followed a single period of a raised cosine bell with a maximum velocity of 0. 3 m/s, and had durations of two, four, and six seconds. For each stimulus, participants provided an estimate of the heading of self-motion. In general, the results showed that the probability that heading estimates are consistent with BI decreases as a function of stimulus duration, consistent with the hypothesis. We conclude that BI is likely to be a default mode of <b>processing</b> multisensory <b>heading</b> information, and that Causal Inference is a slow top-down process that interferes only given enough time...|$|R

40|$|Advanced laser sources enable {{manufacturers}} to produce weld seams {{of high quality}} at high process velocities. These processes require high degrees of precision and furthermore, process parameters have {{to be kept in}} close limits. The welding speed {{is one of the most}} important parameters among laser power which has to be held constantly in order to achieve a stable quality of the manufactured products. Only a constant energy input per unit length may ensure steady qualities of welded or brazed seams.
