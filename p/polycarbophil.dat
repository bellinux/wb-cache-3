40|$|Method for the quantitation of gastric {{emptying}} time of gel test meals 13 James Russell, PhD and Paul Bass, 4 PhD ABSTRACT Isotopic markers {{were developed}} to allow measurement ofthe gastric emptying times of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous gel meals. Meals containing the dietary fibers psyllium and guar gum presented as homogeneous, viscous gels while meals containing the synthetic polymer <b>polycarbophil</b> presented as discrete gel particle-water mixtures. Fiber meals were labeled differently than <b>polycarbophil</b> meals. Fiber meals were labeled with 5 tCr-CM-Sephadex. The marker was uniformly suspended in meals containing at least 1 % guar or 2 % psyllium. In contrast, <b>polycarbophil</b> particles were labeled by hydrating the dried granules with saline in which Na 251 CrO 4 had been dissolved. Use of the markers to measure gastric emptying was demonstrated in dogs fitted with duodenal cannulas. Half of the fiber meals emptied from the stomach in about 40 mm without significant dilution by secretions. In contrast, only 8 % of the <b>polycarbophil</b> particles emptied by 90 mm. Particle-specific labeling of <b>polycarbophil</b> was important because the meal effluent was diluted extensively by secretions.

40|$|Because of {{the central}} role of {{dendritic}} cells and/or Langerhans cells(DC/LC) in the induction of cellular immune responses, pharmacological agents that modulate the recruitment of these cells might have a clinical interest. The present study was designed to evaluate the capacity of several pharmaceutical formulations to topically deliver granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on human papillomavirus (HPV) -associated genital (pre) neoplastic lesions. The formulations were evaluated for their bioactivity and for their potential to recruit DC in organotypic cultures of HPV-transformed keratinocytes. We found that a bioadhesive <b>polycarbophil</b> gel (Noveon) at pH 5. 5 is able to maintain the bioactivity of GM-CSF at 4 or 37 °C for at least 7 days, whereas a decreased activity of GM-CSF was observed when the molecule is included in other polymer gels. GM-CSF incorporated in the <b>polycarbophil</b> gel was also a potent factor in enhancing the colonization of DC into organotypic cultures of HPV-transformed keratinocytes since the infiltration of DC in the in vitro-formed (pre) neoplastic epithelium was very low under basal conditions and dramatically increased in the presence of GM-CSF gel. We next demonstrated that GM-CSF incorporated in <b>polycarbophil</b> gel induces the recruitment of human DC in a human (pre) neoplastic epithelium grafted into NOD/SCID mice. The efficacy of GM-CSF in this formulation was equivalent to that observed with liquid GM-CSF.

Mucoadhesive polymeric nanodrug delivery systems of acyclovir have been designed and optimized using 23 full factorial design. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) (50 : 50) was used as the polymer along with <b>polycarbophil</b> (Noveon AA- 1) as the mucoadhesive polymer and pluronic F 68 as the stabilizer. From the preliminary trials, the constraints for independent variables X 1 (amount of PLGA), X 2 (amount of pluronic F 68) and X 3 (amount of <b>polycarbophil)</b> have been fixed. The dependent variables that were selected for study were particle size (Y 1), % drug entrapment (Y 2) and % drug release in 12 h (Y 3). The derived polynomial equations were verified by check point formulation. The application of factorial design gave a statistically systematic approach for the formulation and optimization of nanoparticles with the desired particle size, % drug release and high entrapment efficiency.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} both the in vitro and in vivo release of apomorphine from mucoadhesive powder formulations of Carbopol 971 P and <b>polycarbophil.</b> METHODS: The in vitro drug release from the mucoadhesive formulations was studied using a modified USP XXII rotating basket. The pharmacokinetics of apomorphine given as a solution was determined after subcutaneous and intranasal administrations to rabbits. The animals also received intranasally the mucoadhesive dosage forms and immediate release lactose powder mixture. Comparisons were made between the salient pharmacokinetic parameters of the different dosage forms. RESULTS: Sustained in vitro drug release was obtained from the mucoadhesive formulations. Apomorphine was absorbed more rapidly in rabbits when administered intranasally than as a subcutaneous injection. The mucoadhesive formulations both gave sustained plasma drug concentrations and bioavailabilities comparable to subcutaneous injections. The times taken to achieve peak plasma drug concentrations from these mucoadhesive formulations were more than three-fold that of lactose. With these mucoadhesive formulations apomorphine lasted longer in the blood. It could be detected for up to 6 - 8 h compared to approximately 3 h for the other forms of administration.

Dynamic swelling studies indicated that complexation/decomplexation processes occurred due to hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic {{groups of the}} poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and the ether groups of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The e!ects of copolymer composition, graft chain molecular weight, environmental pH and ion content on network structure and gel behavior were studied. The largest change in swelling ratio and mesh size of the gel structure was observed in gels containing the highest content of PEG and the longest molecular weight PEG grafts. Complexation was greatest in hydrogels containing the longest PEG grafts and equimolar amounts of MAA and PEG. The swelling was much less pronounced {{in the presence of}} calcium chloride compared to sodium chloride which could be attributed to the complexation of calcium of the carboxylic groups in the polymer.

These formulations prepared with Carbopol 971 P, Carbopol 974 P and <b>polycarbophil</b> sustained apomorphine release both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro release rate and mechanism were both influenced by the drug loading. There was no large influence of drug loading on the time to achieve the peak (Tmax) for a particular polymer, but Tmax differed between different polymers. For a particular drug loading, the Tmax from Carbopol 971 P was the slowest compared with that for Carbopol 974 P and polycarbophil; however, only the Tmax from Carbopol 971 P loaded with 15 % w/w of apomorphine was significantly longer than <b>polycarbophil</b> of similar drug loading (P= 0. 0386). The trend further observed was that increasing drug loading led to increased peak plasma concentration and area under the curve (AUC). In the second part of this study, a mixture containing an immediate release component and sustained release formulation was administered in an attempt to increase the initial plasma level, as this could be therapeutically beneficial. Only one peak plasma concentration was observed and the initial plasma concentrations were no higher than those obtained with solely sustained release formulation.

40|$|It is {{advantageous}} to develop controlled release dosage forms utilising site-specific delivery or gastric retention for those drugs with frequent or high dosing regimes. Cimetidine {{is a potent}} and selective H 2 -reception antagonist used {{in the treatment of}} various gastrointestinal disorders and localisation in the upper gastrointestinal tract could significantly improve the drug absorption. Three strategies were undertaken to prepare controlled release systems for the delivery of cimetidine to the GI tract. Firstly, increasing the contact time of the dosage form with the mucus layer which coats the gastrointestinal tract, may lead to increased gastric residence times. Mucoadhesive microspheres, by forming a gel-like structure in contact with the mucus, should prolong the contact between the delivery system and the mucus layer, and should have the potential for releasing the drug in sustained and controlled manner. Gelatin microspheres were prepared, optimised and characterised for their physicochemical properties. Crosslinking concentration, particle size and cimetidine loading influenced drug release profiles. Particle size was influenced by surfactant concentration and stirring speed. Mucoadheisve polymers such as alginates, chitosans, carbopols and <b>polycarbophil</b> were incorporated into the microspheres using different strategies. The mucoadhesion of the microspheres was determined using in vitro surface adsorption and ex vivo rat intestine models. The surface-modification strategy resulted in highest levels of microsphere adhesion, with chitosan, carbopols and <b>polycarbophil</b> as the most successful candidates for improvement of adhesion, with over 70 % of the microspheres retained ex vivo. Specific targeting agent UEA I lectin was conjugated to the surface of gelatin microspheres, which enhanced the adhesion of the microspheres.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to formulate, characterise and assess the feasibility of a novel drug delivery system known as the in situ gelling matrix (ISGM) where a hydrophilic polymer is suspended in a non-aqueous solvent that converts into a gel when injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly thus giving a controlled release matrix for a drug. Although the concept has been patented with claims that this kind of drug delivery is achievable in theory {{for a wide variety of}} candidate substances, actual formulation studies for making a commercially viable product for this technology are completely lacking in practice. The research embodied in this thesis addresses this lack. Initial studies involved conducting a biocompatibility study using the HET-CAM (hens egg test - chorioallantoic membrane) test on a range of possible ingredients for the delivery system. The materials deemed biocompatible were then carried through to a screening process where the physical stability of the hydrophilic polymers in non-aqueous solvents was monitored. It was found that the hydrophilic polymers tested sedimented rapidly in the non-aqueous solvents indicating such a system was not physically stable. Consequently, density-inducing or viscosity-inducing agents were added to the non-aqueous solvents to retard the sedimentation rate. The addition of <b>polycarbophil,</b> a viscosity-inducing agent, clearly increased the viscosity of the system. However, undesirable formation of <b>polycarbophil</b> globules occurred during the manufacturing process, which caused batch-to-batch variations in the viscosity of the continuous phase. Various manufacturing methods were tested before arriving at the optimum procedure to prevent globule formation using a high speed dispersion tool. A final physical sedimentation analysis of candidate continuous phases and hydrophilic polymers was conducted for determining the ideal combination of ingredients to use in the system. These investigations finally led to the adoption of an optimum mix of components consisting of 10 % (w/w) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) (the hydrophilic polymer) suspended in a continuous phase of propylene glycol (the non-aqueous solvent) containing 0. 67 % (w/w) <b>polycarbophil</b> (the viscosity inducing agent). Using this mix of components, the in situ gelling matrix system was then subjected to various characterisation studies including infrared (IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry and redispersion studies. The chemical stability of the hydrophilic polymer and the continuous phase (the non-aqueous solvent and <b>polycarbophil)</b> was monitored and were found to be chemically stable over a 9 month period. The feasibility of the in situ gelling matrix technology as a controlled release device was assessed using the drug propranolol. In vitro drug release studies were conducted using a custom-built dissolution apparatus. The effect of various parameters such as the concentration of the hydrophilic gelling agent on the drug release rate was investigated. Increasing the concentration of the gelling agent in the formulation resulted in a slower rate of release. The drug release data were modelled using the Higuchi relationship and a power law relationship to compare the effects of the various parameters on the release rate Stability studies on the drug in the in situ gelling matrix system were carried out by storing samples in accelerated ageing conditions of 40 C / 75 % relative humidity for 4 weeks. During this time, the samples were analysed each week by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These demonstrated that no apparent drug degradation had occurred over the 4 -week period. This indicates that the drug propranolol in the in situ gelling matrix system is stable under ambient conditions for at least 4 weeks.

Mucoadhesive microspheres were prepared by “Calcium induced ionotropic gelation ” method. Sodium alginate was used as encapsulating agent and carbopol 934 P & <b>polycarbophil</b> were used as bioadhesive polymer. A 32 - full factorial design was employed taking concentration of carbomer and sodium alginate as independent variables. The evaluation parameters included encapsulation efficiency, in vitro mucoadhesion, swelling study, in vitro release study. Microspheres were discrete, spherical and free flowing. Swelling index was ranging from 1. 2 to 2, indicating excellent swelling property. The microspheres exhibited excellent mucoadhesive property and good drug entrapment. Formulations showed polymer concentration dependent drug release {{over a period of}} 12 hrs. Microspheres were having good mucoadhesive property with good encapsulation capacity and a sustained release property...|$|E

D. Title of diploma thesis: Adhesive {{properties}} of branched polyesters plasticized with triacetin. The {{aim of this}} master thesis {{is the study of}} adhesive {{properties of}} the polyesters of glycolic acid and lactic acid, branched with tripentaerythritol and plasticized with triacetin of various concentrations. The theoretical part deals with the bioadhesion, bioadhesive polymers, testing of bioadhesion, and plasticizers. The practical part is focused on the study of adhesiveness, measured as maximal force needed for the detachment of the polymer from the model substrate. The influence of model substrate, type of polyester, plasticizer concentration and incorporation of the drug on adhesiveness was studied. It was found, than 20 % of triacetin is sufficient for decreasing the viscosity of the polyesters. Even the lower concentration could be used in the further studies. The cork base can serve as model substrate for screening of the adhesivity. Adhesiveness of the tested polyesters was higher in comparison with methylcellulose, carbomer, <b>polycarbophil</b> and gelatine gels [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The lactobacilli {{which are}} present in vaginal fluids play an {{important}} role in prevention of vaginosis and there are considerable interests in formulation of these friendly bacteria into suitable pharmaceutical dosage forms. Formulating these microorganisms for vaginal application is a critical issue as the products should retain viability of lactobacilli during formulation and also storage. The aim of this study was to examine the viability and release of Lactobacillus acidophilus from slow-release vaginal tablets prepared by using six different retarding polymers and from two effervescent tablets prepared by using citric or adipic acid. The Carbomer–based formulations showed high initial viablility compared to those based on HPMC-LV, HPMC-HV, <b>Polycarbophil</b> and SCMC polymers which showed one log decrease in viable cells. All retarding polymers in slow release formulations presented a strong bacterial release at about 2 h except Carbomer polymers which showed to be poor bacterial releasers. Although effervescent formulations produced a quick bacterial release in comparison with polymer based slow-release tablets, they were less stable in cold storage. Due to the strong chelating characteristic of citric acid, the viability was quickly lost for aqueous medium of citric acid in comparison with adipic acid based effervescent tablets...|$|E
