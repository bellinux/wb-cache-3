The ring, used for the right channel in stereo systems, is used instead for the inverting input. This is a common use in small audio mixing desks, where space is a premium and they offer a more compact alternative to XLR connectors. Another advantage offered by TRS phone connectors used for balanced microphone inputs is that a standard unbalanced signal lead using a TS phone jack can simply be plugged into such an input.

40|$|Ceramics {{represent}} a unique class of {{materials that are}} distinguished from common metals and plastics by their: (1) high hardness, stiffness, and good wear properties (i. e., abrasion resistance); (2) ability to withstand high temperatures (i. e., refractoriness); (3) chemical durability; and (4) electrical properties {{that allow them to}} be electrical insulators, semiconductors, or ionic conductors. Ceramics can be broken down into two general categories, traditional and advanced ceramics. Traditional ceramics include common household products such as clay pots, tiles, pipe, and bricks, porcelain china, sinks, and electrical insulators, and thermally insulating refractory bricks for ovens and fireplaces. Advanced ceramics, also referred to as ''high-tech'' ceramics, include products such as spark <b>plug</b> <b>bodies,</b> piston rings, catalyst supports, and water pump seals for automobiles, thermally insulating tiles for the space shuttle, sodium vapor lamp tubes in streetlights, and the capacitors, resistors, transducers, and varistors in the solid-state electronics we use daily. The major differences between traditional and advanced ceramics are in the processing tolerances and cost. Traditional ceramics are manufactured with inexpensive raw materials, are relatively tolerant of minor process deviations, and are relatively inexpensive. Advanced ceramics are typically made with more refined raw materials and processing to optimize a given property or combination of properties (e. g., mechanical, electrical, dielectric, optical, thermal, physical, and/or magnetic) for a given application. Advanced ceramics generally have improved performance and reliability over traditional ceramics, but are typically more expensive.

50|$|Glow plugs {{are used}} for {{starting}} as well as continuing the power cycle. The glow plug consists of a durable, mostly platinum, helically wound wire filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the <b>plug</b> <b>body,</b> exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) {{is applied to the}} glow plug, the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the glow plug to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the platinum in the filament, thus causing the ignition. This keeps the plug's filament glowing hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a spark ignition engine or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of glow plug, etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard ignition, slowing the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by adjusting a needle valve in the spraybar) to obtain maximum power. Glowplug engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the glow plug in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of methane}} in spark {{ignition}} engines is mainly {{due to its}} cleaner emissions and relatively low price. However, when methane replaces gasoline in the externally mixing carburettor or port injection engine, power is reduced and upper speed is limited. These are because the burning velocity of methane is slower than of gasoline, and some air is displaced in the intake manifold in order to compensate the low density methane. The problem can be mitigated when fuel is directly injected into the combustion chamber after the intake valve closes. This results in an increased volumetric efficiency, a higher absolute heating value of mixture and a faster burning rate. The work presented in this thesis aims to develop a conversion system that enables methane to be directly injected into the combustion chamber of a spark ignition engine without modifying the original structure of the engine. The system, named as Spark Plug Fuel Injector (SPFI) combines a fuel injector with a spark plug. A fuel path is drawn along {{the periphery of the}} spark <b>plug</b> <b>body</b> to deliver the injected fuel to the combustion chamber. The system was installed and tested on a Ricardo E 6 single cylinder engine with compression ratio of 10. 5 : 1. Cylinder pressures were taken as the main indicator of the engine performance and selected indicated performance were presented. A set of port injected data for the engine running on methane was also taken in order to provide a comparison of performance with SPFI direct injection. Results show that the indicated performance of the SPFI methane direct injection at the tested speed was lower than the optimised methane port injection operation. This was mainly due to the quality of air-fuel mixing, which is a result of spatial and temporal limitation of direct injection operation. Flow visualization using the PLIF method shows that even though sufficient gas jet penetration from SPFI injection nozzle was achieved, the cone angle was very narrow. The conclusion from imaging experiments implies poor mixing, hence the performance suffers drawback. However, with direct injection, volumetric efficiency is increased ands combustion duration is faster. These two factors are desirable for engine performance improvement. SPFI {{has proven to be a}} practical and low cost conversion to methane. Even though the performance is lower than port injection, its benefits are significant. As the SPFI design is simple and requires no modification to the original structure of the converted engine. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} ten year the {{mechanical}} power output of car engine increased significantly. This result has been possible especially through new injection systems that brought to an optimization of the combustion (direct injection, common rail) and to an improvement of the turbo charging. Moreover, these technical devices brought to a reduction of the exhaust emissions and an increasing of the engine efficiency. In particular, the specific power is increased from 34 kW/litre of the 1992 to the 63 kW/litre of the 2010. Furthermore, the pressure peaks into the combustion chamber and the fuel injection pressure have been increased to the aim of emission reduction and higher engine efficiency. In this scenario, car manufacturers are following {{the direction of the}} engine downsizing that means to have the same engine power by a lower engine displacement. The downsizing has as main consequence a thermal risks specially for the hot parts of the combustion chamber (exhaust valves, spark <b>plug</b> <b>body</b> and piston) because these parts have an increased high heat load and thermal stress. These temperatures could have as main consequence to the risk for engine damage by irregular combustion due to "surface ignition" by hot spot or by deposit of the combustion chamber. In this paper a method for optical measurement of piston temperature during the fired and unfired operation of an internal combustion engine has been developed. An optical access to the combustion chamber is achieved by an optical element made from sapphire lens that can be located in a special spark plug or other engine parts (injectors, cylinder head). The thermal radiation of the piston observed with this optical element is guided to the detector with optical fibers. As a detector InGaAs-photodiodes are used, which allow a detection of the infrared radiation up to 2. 6 μm. The relation between the signal intensity and piston temperature was determined outside the engine in a calibration unit: the piston was heated up to 400 °C. In the calibration unit the sensor and the piston are arranged in the same geometry as in the combustion chamber. During cool down the thermal radiation is simultaneously measured with the temperature of the piston surface, obtained from a thermocouple. AVL uses optical sensors in spark plugs to investigate combustion phenomena in spark ignited internal combustion engines. In a recent application the measurement of valve temperatures has been demonstrated using these sensors. In this paper the possibility to measure piston temperatures with this measurement system is investigated. For this purpose following tasks have been performed: The measurement range was extended from 400 ° down to 200 ° by selecting appropriate optical materials and detectors. A calibration unit was developed to determine the relation between radiation signal and piston temperature. The piston temperature was measured for different pistons in a single cylinder research engine...|$|E
