40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was study of the <b>particles</b> motions <b>and</b> {{interactions}} by the evaluation of <b>particles</b> positions, velocities <b>and</b> accelerations. It was shown that immersed boundary method is able to successfully describe interactions between <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> fluid, the interactions between <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> interactions between <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> wall. The results were quantitative compared with other studies...|$|R
50|$|The {{attachment}} of {{the particle}} to the bubble {{is controlled by}} the induction time of the <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> bubble. The <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> bubble need to bind and this occurs if the time in which the <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> bubble are in contact with each other is larger than the required induction time. This induction time is affected by the fluid viscosity, <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> bubble size and the forces between the <b>particle</b> <b>and</b> bubbles.|$|R

5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized {{this was due to}} the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective <b>particles,</b> <b>and</b> carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E

5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha <b>particles</b> <b>and</b> induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi {{wanted to see if}} he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged <b>particles,</b> <b>and</b> so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.|$|E

5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even <b>particles</b> <b>and</b> electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E
5|$|After the war Alvarez was {{involved}} in the design of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new <b>particles</b> <b>and</b> resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He {{was involved}} in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers.

In this formulation, interfaces of <b>particles,</b> liquid <b>and</b> structures are represented by the level set functions.

5|$|Although {{the weak}} {{interaction}} was once described by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed <b>particles</b> (<b>and</b> right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. Interestingly, the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.|$|E

Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' <b>particles</b> <b>and</b> Pym is shot.

5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne <b>particles</b> <b>and</b> by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E

This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting, to remove feather parasites.|$|E
