25|$|But <b>perhaps</b> <b>my</b> finest {{memory of}} this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E
500|$|Okereke's lyrics {{attempt to}} {{juxtapose}} the monotonous events—nights out on club dancefloors {{and waiting for}} a train—with the seemingly epic experiences—terrorist attacks and racial angst—witnessed in a city environment. The direct narrative approach divided reviewers. BBC's Tom Young concluded, [...] "Some will appreciate Kele's openness and revel in his philosophical focus on modern lives... others will be too distracted by questionable content such as... lines about sudoku to take Okereke's grumbles into consideration." [...] Okereke has conceded that he was disappointed with the abstraction in Silent Alarm; he used The Smiths as inspiration {{to try to make}} a personal album with [...] "a real centre". The lyricist has noted, [...] "I wanted it to be a snapshot, a frozen moment in time. Like in a city, with thousands of stories going on at once, layered on top of each other... Although I might be speaking through the voice of a character, I'm still expressing, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>my</b> sentiments." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] is {{a country}} pop song with a length of four minutes and 22 seconds. The song, written solely by Swift, is in the key of D minor with Swift's vocals {{spanning}} two octaves, from F3 to C5. Johnathan Keefe claimed that [...] "the a capella [...] "Drop everything now" [...] exclamation simply commands attention, with the desperation in Swift’s call-to-action answering the common criticisms that her work is sexless and chaste." [...] Bobby Peacock stated that [...] "I wouldn't mind if the banjo from the 2007 version were left in, but its omission is [...] hardly make-or-break. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>my</b> biggest {{problem is that the}} song's chorus undermines itself in the second half – it starts out emphatic [...] and anthemic as usual, but there's just no [...] "oomph" [...] on the hook. It almost feels as if she's trailing off mid-sentence." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 stated [...] ""Sparks Fly" [...] centers around a simple but effective hook—"I see sparks fly whenever you smile"—that further cements Swift’s reputation as one the craftiest songwriters in popular music." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country commented on the chorus of the song stating, [...] "Though Swift implies that this particular crush is a [...] "bad idea," [...] she still insists that they should try to make it work in the chorus: [...] "Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain / Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain / ‘Cause I see sparks fly / Whenever you smile," [...] she sings insistently." ...|$|E

500|$|The allusive {{literary}} references used in Fun Home are {{not merely}} structural or stylistic: Bechdel writes, [...] "I employ these allusions ... not only as descriptive devices, but because my parents are most real to me in fictional terms. And <b>perhaps</b> <b>my</b> cool aesthetic distance itself does more to convey the Arctic climate of our family than any particular literary comparison." [...] Bechdel, as the narrator, considers her relationship to her father through the myth of Daedalus and Icarus. As a child, she confused her family and their Gothic Revival home with the Addams Family seen in the cartoons of Charles Addams. Bruce Bechdel's suicide is discussed with reference to Albert Camus' novel A Happy Death and essay The Myth of Sisyphus. His careful construction of an aesthetic and intellectual world is compared to The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the narrator suggests that Bruce Bechdel modeled elements of his life after Fitzgerald's, as portrayed in the biography The Far Side of Paradise. His wife Helen is compared with the protagonists of the Henry James novels Washington Square and The Portrait of a Lady. Helen Bechdel was an amateur actress, and plays in which she acted are also used to illuminate aspects of her marriage. She met Bruce Bechdel when the two were appearing in a college production of The Taming of the Shrew, and Alison Bechdel intimates that this was [...] "a harbinger of my parents' later marriage". Helen Bechdel's role as Lady Bracknell in a local production of The Importance of Being Earnest is shown in some detail; Bruce Bechdel is compared with Oscar Wilde. His homosexuality is also examined with allusion to Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. The father and daughter's artistic and obsessive-compulsive tendencies are discussed with reference to E. H. Shepard's illustrations for The Wind in the Willows. Bruce and Alison Bechdel exchange hints about their sexualities by exchanging memoirs: the father gives the daughter Earthly Paradise, an autobiographical collection of the writings of Colette; shortly afterwards, in what Alison Bechdel describes as [...] "an eloquent unconscious gesture", she leaves a library copy of Kate Millett's memoir Flying for him. Finally, returning to the Daedalus myth, Alison Bechdel casts herself as Stephen Dedalus and her father as Leopold Bloom in James Joyce's Ulysses, with parallel references to the myth of Telemachus and Odysseus.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{occasion}} of the 2000 re-release of his Cat Stevens albums, Yusuf explained that he had stopped performing in English due to his misunderstanding of the Islamic faith. [...] "This issue of music in Islam is not as cut-and-dried as I was led to believe... I relied on heresy , that was <b>perhaps</b> <b>my</b> mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Jung Chang wrote a new {{foreword}} to Wild Swans, {{describing her}} early life in Britain and explaining why {{she wrote the}} book. Having lived in China during the 1960s and 1970s, she found Britain exciting and loved the country, especially its diverse range of culture, literature and arts. She found even colourful window-boxes worth writing home about – Hyde Park and the Kew Gardens were inspiring. She took every opportunity to watch Shakespeare's plays in both London and York. However she still has a special place for China in her heart, saying {{in an interview with}} HarperCollins, [...] "I feel <b>perhaps</b> <b>my</b> heart is still in China".|$|E

2500|$|After a {{successful}} audition {{in the spring}} of 1937, Scourby was cast in a small part in a recording of Antony and Cleopatra. During the following summer he was, again, the player king in a production of Hamlet in Dennis, Massachusetts that featured Eva Le Gallienne. When he returned to audition for the American Foundation for the Blind later in the year he was told that the company of actors was [...] "filled" [...] but that he might record a novel if he wished. [...] "That was the beginning of it," [...] he recalled years later, adding, [...] "The recordings for the blind are <b>perhaps</b> <b>my</b> greatest achievement. Most of the things I look back at in the theater were either insignificant parts in great plays or good parts in terrible plays. So it really doesn't amount to anything. Whereas I have recorded some great books. The greatest one being the Bible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013 Bryce {{delivered}} the annual ABC Boyer Lecture. Bryce stated {{she would like}} to see an Australia where: [...] "people are free to love and marry whom they choose [...] And where <b>perhaps,</b> <b>my</b> friends, one day, one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation's first head of state". Her comments drew severe criticism, not merely for their support of a republic while still serving as the Queen's representative, but because the role is meant to be strictly non-partisan. Senator Dean Smith called them, [...] "a {{slap in the face to}} many, many Australians, and a significant breach of trust". Amanda Vandstone accused her of possible grandstanding, and wrote: [...] "In publicly declaring these views, she has brought that high office into a political realm in which it does not belong....Someone might explain to her that the job is not about her … it's about us." [...] Although the Australian republican movement supported her comments, head of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy David Flint stated that [...] "There's this sense of division that she's created and the position is not intended to be divisive—it's intended to unite and be above politics." [...] The Prime Minister Tony Abbott supported her right to comment, saying [...] "It's more than appropriate for the Governor-General, approaching the end of her term, to express a personal view on a number of subjects, and that's what she was doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gladstone became {{concerned}} with the situation of [...] "coal whippers". These were the men who worked on London docks, [...] "whipping" [...] in baskets from ships to barges or wharves all incoming coal from the sea. They were called up and relieved through public-houses and therefore a man could not get this job unless he possessed the favourable opinion of the publican, who looked upon most favourably those who drank. The man's name was written down and the [...] "score" [...] followed. Publicans issued employment solely on {{the capacity of the}} man to pay, and men often left the pub to work drunk. They spent their savings on drink to secure the favourable opinion of publicans and therefore further employment. Gladstone passed the Coal Vendors Act 1843 to set up a central office for employment. When this Act expired in 1856 a Select Committee was appointed by the Lords in 1857 to look into the question. Gladstone gave evidence to the Committee: [...] "I approached the subject in the first instance as I think everyone in Parliament of necessity did, with the strongest possible prejudice against the proposal but the facts stated were of so extraordinary and deplorable a character, {{that it was impossible to}} withhold attention from them. Then the question being whether legislative interference was required I was at length induced to look at a remedy of an extraordinary character as the only one I thought applicable to the case...it was a great innovation". Looking back in 1883, Gladstone wrote that [...] "In principle, <b>perhaps</b> <b>my</b> Coalwhippers Act of 1843 was the most Socialistic measure of the last half century".|$|E
