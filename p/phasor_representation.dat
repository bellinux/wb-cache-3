40|$|Abstract Background Light {{and dark}} {{patterns}} {{are the major}} synchronizer of circadian rhythms to the 24 -hour solar day. Disruption of circadian rhythms {{has been associated with}} a variety of maladies. Ecological studies of human exposures to light are virtually nonexistent, however, making it difficult to determine if, in fact, light-induced circadian disruption directly affects human health. Methods A newly developed field measurement device recorded circadian light exposures and activity from day-shift and rotating-shift nurses. Circadian disruption defined in terms of behavioral entrainment was quantified for these two groups using phasor analyses of the circular cross-correlations between light exposure and activity. Circadian disruption also was determined for rats subjected to a consistent 12 -hour light/ 12 -hour dark pattern (12 L: 12 D) and ones subjected to a "jet-lagged" schedule. Results Day-shift nurses and rats exposed to the consistent light-dark pattern exhibited pronounced similarities in their circular cross-correlation functions and 24 -hour <b>phasor</b> <b>representations</b> except for an approximate 12 -hour phase difference between species. The phase difference reflects the diurnal versus nocturnal behavior of humans versus rodents. Phase differences within species likely reflect chronotype differences among individuals. Rotating-shift nurses and rats subjected to the "jet-lagged" schedule exhibited significant reductions in phasor magnitudes compared to the day-shift nurses and the 12 L: 12 D rats. The reductions in the 24 -hour phasor magnitudes indicate a loss of behavioral entrainment compared to the nurses and the rats with regular light-dark exposure patterns. Conclusion This paper provides a quantitative foundation for systematically studying the impact of light-induced circadian disruption in humans and in animal models. Ecological light and activity data are needed to develop the essential insights into circadian entrainment/disruption actually experienced by modern people. These data can now be obtained and analyzed to reveal the interrelationship between actual light exposures and markers of circadian rhythm such as rest-activity patterns, core body temperature, and melatonin synthesis. Moreover, it should now be possible to bridge ecological studies of circadian disruption in humans to parametric studies of the relationships between circadian disruption and health outcomes using animal models. </p...|$|R

Notice that the colors (red, blue, and yellow) of the separate sequence vectors correspond to three different phases (A, B, and C, for example). To arrive at the final plot, the sum of vectors of each phase is calculated. This resulting vector is the effective <b>phasor</b> <b>representation</b> of that particular phase.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Commonly in {{electric}} circuit theory courses, circuit laws are first {{introduced in the}} context of direct current (DC) electricity and first thereafter are alternating currents (AC) introduced. The extension of DC-theory to AC is quite easily done mathematically but is conceptually difficult for students. Engineering students have difficulties in understanding phase relationships and <b>phasor</b> <b>representations</b> in AC-electricity. Indeed, {{it has been suggested that}} phase should be seen as a threshold concept. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate if a re-designed introductory {{electric circuit}} course could improve students’ understanding of important concepts in AC-electricity. METHOD and COURSE DESIGN: The course was re-designed introducing AC and DC electricity simultaneously. DC was introduced as a special case of AC with requency equals zero. The re-designed course was taught for the first time during the spring semester 2014 and a new textbook was written. A conceptual test was developed and first administered in 2013 to serve as a baseline and in subsequent years to evaluate the revised course. In 2014 the students’ courses of action in selected lab-groups were video-recorded. RESULTS: In the first revision cycle many students had difficulties to complete the labs in time. Students revealed a mixed response towards the revised course and the results on the conceptual test showed neglible improvement. In the second cycle revisions the number tasks were reduced and focus was laid on tasks that were identified as most important for contributing to the development of student understanding. As a result the learning gain improved with an effect size (Cohen’s delta) of 0. 56. Also the course and the textbook were very well appreciated. In the third cycle only small revisions are made. CONCLUSION: The results show that that AC-electricity can be taught concurrently with DC. However, two revisions cycles was needed which demonstrates that curriculum development needs a sustained effort over a considerable period of time with continuous revisions in light of gained experiences. In further revision we will continue to refine the labs and to develop appropriate interactive lecture demonstrations for the lectures and to develop the problems...|$|R

Thanks to this model, the behavior of fans subject to control by variable frequency drives (VFD) can be predicted, which includes power absorbed by the fan and expected ventilation rates. Hence, it can help design energy control systems for buildings. The proposed model was based on the Modelica language and was developed from the dynamic <b>phasor</b> domain <b>representation,</b> because this representation is a trade-off between the basic non transient representation, that is computationally efficient but cannot describe fan dynamics, and the dynamic time domain model, that is the most representative one but computationally very demanding. A comparison among these models showed that, within fan frequency variations typical of ventilation systems in buildings, the phasor domain model is as representative as the more complex dynamic time domain model in terms of prediction of the dynamic behavior, that is neglected by the basic non transient model. Moreover, the new phasor domain model was validated against measured data relative to a fan installed in a subway station in Barcelona. Thanks to this model, energy consumption of dynamically driven fans can be estimated at the simulation stage, at the expense of a reasonable computational effort.

40|$|Microresonators are {{fundamental}} building {{blocks in the}} growing field of integrated photonics and several resonator-based devices such as filters, switches and routers are currently used in common optical telecommunication networks. In order to exploit the peculiar features offered by integrated resonators, a complete and consistent comprehension of their physics and of the processes they can accommodate is needed. More specifically, coupling of light to and from a resonator represents a crucial point: a correct comprehension of the coupling dynamics, a proper model for the system and its validation through experimental procedure are all essential elements for a fruitful exploitation of the device. Among the different resonator-waveguide coupling schemes, {{the most widely used}} is the in-plane coupling and it consists of a waveguide placed near to a microresonator and laying on the same plane. However, an alternative approach is represented by the vertical coupling scheme, where the waveguide lays under the resonator edge. The peculiar position of the waveguide in this last configuration causes the device to show specific properties not present in other common coupling schemes: namely, a working range spanning from almost visible wavelengths (780 nm) to the near IR domain (1600 nm), the selective excitation of high order resonator radial modes and the possibility to fabricate wedge and free-standing resonators without any detrimental effect on the bus waveguide. In order to fully exploit these and other features of the vertical coupling scheme, a detailed investigation has been carried out throughout this thesis. The waveguide-microresonator system has been studied at different levels, from the general coupling dynamics to more specific and peculiar phenomena. In particular, the basic model proposed for the vertical coupling has been extended to consider wavelength dependences and an experimental validation has been carried out consequently. The reactive coupling model, which describes the internal dynamics of a vertically coupled resonator in the case of multimodal operation, has been experimentally proven. A general model considering the presence counterpropagating modes has been theoretically proposed and experimentally investigated. Finally, the bistable behaviour generated by thermo-optic effect when a large amount of power circulates in the microresonator has been experimentally studied. In order to better characterize the system response, a specific interferometric setup has been implemented. It consists in a Mach-Zehnder computer driven interferometer, whose peculiar characteristic is the ability to perform simultaneous pump and probe transmittance and phase measurements of any integrated photonic device provided with input and output ports. In this way, the information carried by the phase of the propagating optical signal is added to the one provided by its intensity and contributes to produce a more complete picture of the investigated system. In the case of microresonators this phase information becomes even more fundamental. Indeed, the phase response of a resonating structure is highly influenced by variations in the coupling strength, and the phase spectrum of a single resonance allows to clearly identify the resonator coupling regime for that specific resonance. This fact does not hold in the case of transmittance measurements, where single resonance spectrum carries information only on the total losses of the system. Finally, in order to exploit the combined information provided by this measurement procedure, a <b>phasor</b> plot <b>representation</b> is extensively used throughout the thesis work...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} and background of Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast agents (CAs). MRI is now a widely applied, indispensable and powerful tool for diagnosis in modern clinical medicine. Contrast agents are used to shorten the relaxation time of water protons to give a better contrast of MRI. Different Gadolinium (Gd(III)) based contrast agents were summarized and reviewed. Such low molecular contrast agents have their own positive and negative attributes. To limit their risks and side effects, the use of bio-compatible macromolecular contrast agents were proposed. To build the nano-carriers, firstly, by analysing different monomers, the backbone of nano-carriers and functional monomers for attachment of targeting moieties or chelating agents were chosen. Secondly, reversible addition fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization was selected among different controlled radical polymerization (CRP) techniques. Thirdly, different complex polymer architectures were designed to encapsulate Gd(III). Finally, different techniques used to investigate Gd(III) -polymer CAs were discussed. Chapter 2 investigated macromolecular ligands for Gadolinium CAs which were prepared via a “grafting to” strategy. This work has been published in Macromolecules in 2012. Copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGA) and an activated ester monomer, pentafluorophenyl acrylate (PFPA), were synthesized and modified with a 1 -(5 -amino- 3 -aza- 2 -oxypentyl) - 4, 7, 10 -tris(t-butoxycarbonylmethyl) - 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraaza-cyclododecane (DO 3 A-tBu-NH 2) chelate for the complexation of Gd(III). The relaxivity properties of the ligated Gd(III) agents were then studied to evaluate the effect of macromolecular architecture on their behaviour as MRI CAs. Ligands made from linear polymer and hyperbranched polymer (HBP) showed a substantially increased relaxivity in comparison to existing commercial Gd(III) MRI contrast agents. In contrast, core cross-linked star polymers (CCS) exhibited a slightly lower relaxivity per Gd(III) ion (but still substantially higher relaxivity than existing low molecular weight commercial CAs). This work shows that macromolecular ligands {{have the potential to}} serve as components of Gd(III) MRI agents as there are enhanced effects on relaxivity, allowing for lower Gd(III) concentrations to be used to achieve contrast, whilst potentially imparting control over pharmacokinetics. Macromolecular contrast agent (Gd(III) -HBP and Gd(III) -CCS) were demonstrated as potential contrast agent and have better performance compared to low molecular contrast agent (Gd(III) -DOTA) in chapter 2. In this work, PEGA was used as the backbone of nano-structure, and PFPA as an activated ester was used as the functional monomer to introduce DOTA chelating agent into the nano-structure. However, the sequence of these two monomers in the nano-structure was not well studied. The investigation of the kinetics of polymerization of these two monomers and the activity of PFPA-amine reaction would help to understand better the nano-structure and the influence of the structure to the relaxivity. Therefore, in chapter 3, copolymerization reactions involving poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGA) or diethylene glycol acrylate (DEGA) with pentafluorophenyl acrylate (PFPA) have been studied. The effect of the reaction conditions on the nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions of PFPA was studied using a model amine (furfuryl amine). The resulting PEGA/PFPA functional copolymers were then used as scaffolds to produce a library of polymers by reaction with a range of amines. This work was collaborated with Dr. Mariana Beija and published in European Polymer Journal in 2013. Chapter 4 continues the work from Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 and has been published in Polymer Chemistry in 2014. Using the experience to build HBP and CCS structure from Chapter 2 and the kinetic study from Chapter 3, the influence of the structure of macromolecular ligands on the relaxivity of gadolinium contrast agents constructed as nanoparticle systems were studied in Chapter 4. Macromolecular ligands were assembled as single-molecule nanoparticles in the form of either discrete CCS or HBP structure. 1 -(5 -Amino- 3 -aza- 2 -oxypentyl) - 4, 7, 10 -tris(t-butoxycarbonylmethyl) - 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraaza-cyclododecane (DO 3 A-tBu-NH 2) chelate was incorporated into different parts (arms, cores, end-groups) of the polymeric structures using activated ester / amine nucleophilic substitutions, followed by deprotection and complexation with Gd(III). The relaxivity properties of the ligated Gd(III) agents were then studied to evaluate the effect of macromolecular architecture and Gd(III) placement on their behaviour as discrete nanoparticle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. The precise placement of Gd(III) in the polymeric structures (and therefore in the nanoparticles) proved critical in optimizing the performance of the nanoparticles as MRI contrast agents. The relaxivity was measured to vary from 11 to 22 mM- 1 s- 1; 2 - 5 times higher than a commercial Gd(III) -tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid (Gd(III) -DOTA) contrast agent when using a magnetic field strength of 0. 47 T. Under higher magnetic fields, a decrease in the measured relaxivity was observed. Chapter 5 is an in-depth study followed Chapter 3 which published in ACS Macro letters in 2013. The aim is to find a versatile and facile method for introducing functional groups into polymer structures by successively reacting two different activated ester functionalities (pentafluorophenyl (PFP) ester and azlactone (AZ) with different functional amine compounds. By exploiting the difference in reactivity of the two activated esters (PFP and AZ) towards different amino compounds, we demonstrate for the first time, a selective modification of the different activated ester groups, thereby introducing functional groups to the polymer backbone in a controlled manner. Statistical and block copolymers of vinyl dimethyl azlactone (VDM) and pentafluorophenyl acrylate (PFPA) were prepared using reversible addition fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization, and subsequently modified using a library of amino compounds, yielding macromolecules with bespoke functionality. In additional work, the functional macromolecules were self-assembled into nanoparticles. With the discovery of selective and sequence post-modification of activated esters, chapter 6 described the synthesis of dual functional CCS polymers (with a typical size of 15 nm) using an arm first approach with excellent colloidal stability in both water and serum. The CCS polymers were built with aldehyde groups in the core and the activated ester (pentafluorophenyl ester group) in the polymer arms. With the unique CCS polymer structure, we were able exploit the different reactivity between these two functional groups and functionalize sequentially using two different amino compounds: Doxorubicin (DOX), a commonly used chemotherapy drug, and 1 -(5 -amino- 3 -aza- 2 -oxypentyl) - 4, 7, 10 -tris(tert-butoxycarbonylmethyl) - 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane (DO 3 A-tBu-NH 2) chelating agent for the complexation of Gd(III) ion. The activated ester group was employed to attach DO 3 A chelating agent, while aldehyde group was exploited for DOX conjugation, providing a controlled release mechanism for DOX in acidic environments, as is typically observed in tumours or within the endosome in the cells. DOX/Gd(III) loaded CCS was proven to be rapidly taken up by MCF- 7 breast cancer cells and intracellular release of DOX was demonstrated by in vitro fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measurements in H 1299. Using the fluorescence lifetime difference exhibited by native DOX (typically ~ 1. 8 ns) compared to conjugated DOX (typically ~ 4. 0 ns), the release of conjugated DOX was monitored in situ in the breast cancer cells over time. DOX release in cells was estimated using <b>phasor</b> plot <b>representation,</b> showing a clear increase of ‘free’ (or native) DOX with time. The results obtained from FLIM were corroborated using confocal microscopy, clearly showing DOX accumulation in the nuclei. Additionally, the MRI properties were also assessed. We observed that the relaxivity of Gd(III) loaded in CCS is three times higher than the conventional organic Gd(III) -DO 3 A complex. Finally, we report that DOX/Gd(III) conjugated CCS presents a similar IC 50 than native DOX for breast cancer providing evidence that DOX integrity and efficacy was conserved during attachment and subsequent release...|$|R

The 3 LNPC four-leg inverter is controlled to manage a Hybrid Energy Storage System {{in order to satisfy}} the energy/power demand in a weak grid and simultaneously to balance the AC voltage during unbalanced 3 -phase loads. The proposed control strategy uses a special designed offset for the DC power/energy division and the decomposition of the supply three-phase voltage and current into symmetrical components using <b>phasor</b> <b>representation</b> for voltage balance. Real time simulations and experimental tests have been performed using a RT-LAB simulator, a 3 LNPC converter prototype and an experimental MicroGrid in order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed system in a weak grid context...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDetection of the {{fluorescent}} properties of Laurdan {{has been proven}} to be an efficient tool to investigate membrane packing and ordered lipid phases in model membranes and living cells. Traditionally the spectral shift of Laurdan’s emission from blue in the ordered lipid phase of the membrane (more rigid) toward green in the disordered lipid phase (more fluid) is quantified by the generalized polarization function. Here, we investigate the fluorescence lifetime of Laurdan at two different emission wavelengths and find that when the dipolar relaxation of Laurdan’s emission is spectrally isolated, analysis of the fluorescence decay can distinguish changes in membrane fluidity from changes in cholesterol content. Using the <b>phasor</b> <b>representation</b> to analyze changes in Laurdan’s fluorescence lifetime we obtain two different phasor trajectories for changes in polarity versus changes in cholesterol content. This gives us the ability to resolve in vivo membranes with different properties such as water content and cholesterol content and thus perform a more comprehensive analysis of cell membrane heterogeneity. We demonstrate this analysis in NIH 3 T 3 cells using Laurdan as a biosensor to monitor changes in the membrane water content during cell migration...|$|E

30|$|Using the {{representation}} of transfer function [6 – 13], the steady state of weight vector for the ANC systems can be determined and the convergence speed can be analyzed by eigenvalue spread. However, it can not explain {{the fact that the}} performance will be degraded at some frequencies. Based on the concepts of <b>phasor</b> <b>representation</b> [16], this paper discusses the selection of reference signals in narrowband ANC systems to illustrate the effect of phase compensation in delayed-X LMS approach [11]. The different selections of signal phasor to the reference signal are considered to describe the operation of narrowband ANC systems. In addition, this paper intends to modify the structure of Kuo's FIR-type ANC filter in order to achieve a better performance. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the basic two-weight adaptive filter and the delayed two-tap adaptive filter in the single-frequency ANC systems. Besides, the solution of weight vectors will be solved by using the phasor concept. In Section 3, the signal basis is discussed and illustrated for the above-mentioned adaptive filters based on the phasor concept. In Section 4, the eigenvalue spread is discussed to compare the convergence speed for different signal basis selections. The simulations will reflect the facts and discussions. Finally, the conclusions are addressed in Section 5.|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence {{lifetime}} imaging is {{a versatile}} tool that permits mapping the biochemical {{environment in the}} cell. Among various fluorescence lifetime imaging techniques, timecorrelated single photon counting and time-gating methods have been demonstrated to be very efficient and robust for the imaging of biological specimens. Recently, the <b>phasor</b> <b>representation</b> of lifetime images became popular because it provides an intuitive graphical view of the fluorescence lifetime content of the images and, when used for global analysis, significantly improves the overall S/N of lifetime analysis. Compared to time-correlated single photon counting, time gating methods can provide higher count rates (∼ 10 MHz) but {{at the cost of}} truncating and under sampling the decay curve due to the limited number of gates commonly used. These limitations also complicate the implementation of the phasor analysis for time-gated data. In this work, we propose and validate a theoretical framework that overcomes these problems. This modified approach is tested on both simulated lifetime images and on cells. We demonstrate that this method is able to retrieve two lifetimes from time gating data that cannot be resolved using standard (non-global) fitting techniques. The new approach increases the information that can be obtained from typical measurements and simplifies the analysis of fluorescence lifetime imaging data...|$|E
40|$|Ionic {{gradients}} {{are found}} across {{a variety of}} tissues and organs. In this report, we apply the <b>phasor</b> <b>representation</b> of fluorescence lifetime imaging data to the quantitative study of ionic concentrations in tissues, overcoming technical problems of tissue thickness, concentration artifacts of ion-sensitive dyes, and calibration across inhomogeneous tissue. We used epidermis as a model system, as Ca 2 + gradients in this organ have been shown previously to control essential biologic processes of differentiation and formation of the epidermal permeability barrier. The approach described here allowed much better localization of Ca 2 + stores than those used in previous studies, and revealed that the bulk of free Ca 2 + measured in the epidermis comes from intracellular Ca 2 + stores such as the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum, with extracellular Ca 2 + making a relatively small contribution to the epidermal Ca 2 + gradient. Due to the high spatial resolution of two-photon microscopy, we were able to measure a marked heterogeneity in average calcium concentrations from cell to cell in the basal keratinocytes. This finding, not reported in previous studies, calls into question the long-held hypothesis that keratinocytes increase intracellular Ca 2 +, cease proliferation, and differentiate passively in response to changes in extracellular Ca 2 +. The experimental results obtained using this approach illustrate the power of the experimental and analytical techniques outlined in this report. Our approach can be used in mechanistic studies to address the formation, maintenance, and function of the epidermal Ca 2 + gradient, and it should be broadly applicable to the study of other tissues with ionic gradients...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the modeling of electric power systems including FACTS and Custom Power (CP) devices and their stability analysis through application of bifurcation theory, continuation methods, and Newton methods {{to compute the}} periodic steady state. The previous stability analyses of FACTS and Custom Power devices based on bifurcation theory using continuation methods neglected the harmonic distortion introduced by the voltage source converter (VSC). Besides, the network transients have not been taken into account. Under this formulation, the electric power network was modeled through a <b>phasor</b> <b>representation,</b> and obviously, only the fundamental frequency was considered in those analyses. In this research, two VSC models based on Fourier series and hyperbolic tangent function are proposed. The proposed models {{can be used for}} fast simulation in the time domain of power-electronic devices based on sinusoidal pulse-width modulation VSCs; the undesirable error introduced by the high commutates rates are removed; even though the harmonic distortion coming from the converter is taken into account. The switching instants in the Fourier model are approximated in a closed form, and an iterative algorithm based on the Newton-Raphson method is developed for the exact calculation of the switching instants. The hyperbolic tangent model does not need the calculation of the switching instants {{as in the case of}} the Fourier model. With these VSC’s models the computation of the periodic steady-state solution of power systems including FACTS is efficiently obtained by extrapolation to the limit cycle using a Newton method. In addition, it is possible to assess the stability through the Floquet multiplier. Two Newton methods to compute efficiently the periodic steady state solution are presented. One is based on an Enhanced Numerical Differentiation technique, and the other one is based on Discrete Exponential Expansion approach of the transition matrix. These methods prove to be more efficient than the conventional methods such as [Aprille Jr. and Trick 1972], [Colon and Trick 1973], and [Semlyen and Medina 1995]. It is also presented the stability analysis for a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) that operates in current control mode and voltage control mode based on bifurcation theory. A control design for the DSTATCOM is proposed. Along with this control, a suitable mathematical representation of the DSTATCOM is proposed. In addition, the stability analysis for a capacitor-supported dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) based on bifurcation theory and a continuation method is presented. The stability regions in the Thevenin equivalent plane are computed for different operating scenarios. In addition, the stability regions in the control gain space, as well as the contour lines for different Floquet multipliers are computed. The proposed models and analysis are validated against the solution obtained with the power system blockset of Simulink and with PSCAD/EMTDC. Additionally, the proposed VSC models based on the Fourier series and the hyperbolic tangent approach are validated against the response obtained by measurements from a 1. 5 kVA ASD experimental setup system...|$|E
