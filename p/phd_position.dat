40|$|The proton nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance signal of the His 57 -Asp 102 hydrogen bonded proton in the charge relay system of chymotrypsinogen A and chymotrypsin Aδ has been monitored to {{determine the influence of}} substrate analogues and competitive inhibitors on the electronic state of the active site regions. Borate ion, benzene boronic acid and 2 -phenylethylboronic acid, when bound to chymotrypsin at pH 9. 5 shift the resonance position of the His-Asp hydrogen bonded proton to - 15. 9, - 16. 3 and - 17. 2 parts per million, respectively. These positions are intermediate between the low <b>pH</b> <b>position</b> in the free enzyme of - 18. 0 parts per million and the high <b>pH</b> <b>position</b> of - 14. 9 parts per million. The presence of these analogues prevents the His-Asp proton resonance from titrating in the region of pH 6 to 9. 5. Similar low field shifts are observed for the hydrogen bonded proton resonance of subtilisin BPN’ when complexed with these boronic acids. The results support the chemical and crystallographic data which show that negatively charged tetrahedral adducts of the boronic acid substrate analogues are formed at the active sites of these enzymes. When combined with similar nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} data for the binding of N-acetyl-L-tryptophan to chymotrypsin Aδ, they suggest that a direct interaction occurs between the active site histidine and the atom occupying the leaving group position of the substrate, presumably a hydrogen bond. The His-Asp proton resonance was also monitored in complexes of chymotrypsin Aδ with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor over the pH range 4 to 9. In the complex the low field proton resonance had a field position of - 14. 9 parts per million over the pH range 4 to 9 indicating that His 57 is in the neutral form, similar to the active enzyme at high pH. ...|$|R

40|$|Serum {{antibodies}} to the capsular polysaccharides A and C (PSA and PSC) of N. meningitidis in healthy adults {{before and after}} vaccination with the sole polysaccharides were analysed by isoelectric focusing (IEF). Before vaccination, 49 % and 28 % had naturally acquired antibodies against PSA and PSC, respectively, whereas 18 days after caccine administration 84 % and 91 %, respectively, showed a detectable spectrotypic pattern. Oligoclonality {{appeared to be the}} main feature of naturally acquired and vaccine-induced antibodies for both polysaccharides. In all subjects the anti-PSA response, showing dominant bands at the same <b>pH</b> <b>position,</b> was more homogeneous than anti-PSC one. Most subjects with naturally acquired antibodies (25 out of 38 for PSA and 20 out of 22 for PSC) showed a spectrotypic pattern after vaccination, similar to that observed before vaccination (any differences were just related to band intensity), suggesting that PSA and PSC are able to recruit the same B cell clones previously primed with a T-dependent form of the antigen, i. e. the whole bacterium. However, in one-third of subjects with naturally acquired anti-PSA antibodies, the appearance of new alkaline bands after vaccination was observed. Furthermore, in subjects with absence of detectable natural antibodies, the vaccine-induced antibody response started in correspondence of alkaline pH areas, subsequently extending to neutral and acidic areas. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that alkaline antibody-secreting B cell clones are the first to be recruited. The final spectrotype in these subjects was similar to that observed in subjects with naturally acquired antibodies. This observation, together with the above reported data, allow us to conclude that natural (T-dependent pathway) and vaccine (T-independent pathway) immunization induce the expression of the same antibody repertoire, for both meningococcal PSA and PSC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The recent {{browning}} (increase in color) {{of surface}} waters {{across much of}} the northern hemisphere has important implications for light climate, ecosystem func-tioning, and drinking water treatability. Using log-linear regressions and long-term (6 – 21 years) data from 112 Swedish watercourses, we identified temporal and spatial patterns in browning-related parameters [iron, absorbance, and total organic carbon (TOC) ]. Flow variability and lakes in the catchment were major influences on all parameters. Co-variation between seasonal, discharge-related, and trend effects on iron, TOC, and absorbance were dependent on <b>pH,</b> landscape <b>position,</b> catchment size, latitude, and dominant land cover. Large agriculture-dominated catch-ments had significantly larger trends in iron, TOC, and water color than small forest catchments. Our results sug-gest that while similarities exist, no single mechanism can explain the observed browning but show that multiple mechanisms related to land cover, climate, and acidificat-ion history are responsible for the ongoing browning of surface waters...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{simultaneously}} record tracheal and oesophageal pH in mechanically ventilated {{children to}} determine: (1) the feasibility {{and safety of}} the method; (2) the incidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and pulmonary contamination; and (3) their associated risk factors. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty mechanically ventilated children (mean age 6. 7 years) who met the following inclusion criteria: endotracheal tube with an internal diameter of 4 mm or more (cuffed or uncuffed), mechanical ventilation for an acute disease, no treatment with antiacids, prokinetics, or H 2 -receptor blockers, and no nasogastric or orogastric tube. METHODS: The tracheal antimony <b>pH</b> probe was <b>positioned</b> 1 cm below the distal end of the endotracheal tube. The oesophageal antimony <b>pH</b> probe was <b>positioned</b> at the lower third of the oesophagus. pH was recorded on a double channel recorder and analysed with EsopHogram 5. 01 software and by examination of the trace. The following definitions were used: GOR index, percentage of time pH 4. 8 %; tracheal reflux, fall in tracheal pH 10 % (p < 0. 01) and were more frequent with a maximal inspiratory pressure of < 25 cm H 2 O (p = 0. 03), but were {{not related to the}} indication for mechanical ventilation, whether the endotracheal tube was cuffed or not, age, or drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous tracheal and oesophageal pH monitoring was feasible in the setting of this study.

40|$|The LDL {{receptor}} (LDL-R) mediates cholesterol metabolism {{in humans}} by binding and internalizing cholesterol transported by LDL. Several different molecular mechanisms {{have been proposed}} for the binding of LDL to LDL-R at neutral plasma pH and for its release at acidic endosomal pH. The crystal structure of LDL-R at acidic pH shows that the receptor folds back on itself in a closed form, obscuring parts of the ligand binding domain with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) -precursor homology domain. We have used a structure-based site-directed mutagenesis approach to examine 12 residues in the extracellular domain of LDL-R for their effect on LDL binding and release. Our {{studies show that the}} interface between the ligand binding domain and the EGF-precursor homology domain seen at acidic pH buries residues mediating both LDL binding and release. Our results are consistent with an alternative model of LDL-R whereby multiple modules of the extracellular domain interact with LDL at neutral <b>pH,</b> concurrently <b>positioning</b> key residues so that at acidic pH the LDL-R:LDL interactions become unfavorable, triggering release. After LDL release, the closed form of LDL-R may target its return to the cell surface...|$|R

50|$|However, {{other factors}} beyond the {{presence}} of certain amino acids can affect the taste response of the peptide. The intensity of the umami taste increases when the acidic peptide interacts with cations to form a salt. At a threshold value of 1.25 millimolar (mM), the Asp-Glu dipeptide generates the strongest umami taste when exposed to NaOH and subjected to a <b>pH</b> increase. <b>Position</b> of the amino acids {{also play a role}} in taste intensity, as a Glu-Asp dipeptide registers at a threshold value of 3.14 mM, meaning it would need a higher amount of the compound in order for a person to register the umami taste. Additionally, while a Lys-Gly-HCl analog would register a salty, umami taste at 1.22mM, a Gly-Lys-HCl analog registers a sour and sweet taste at 5.48mM. Thus, the research findings indicated that flavor can be modified in taste and strength through modification of acidic residues in peptides, opening up possibilities for the production of BMP-like peptides with greater taste intensity. Although its taste intensity does not change according to pH, BMP has been described to produce different tastes according to pH changes. Notably, it is reported to be sour at a pH of 3.5, umami at a pH of 6.5, and sweet, sour, and umami at a pH of 9.5.|$|R

The aims of this study were to identify differences in spatiotemporal reflux characteristics (proximal extent and duration of reflux episodes, ascending velocity of the refluxate) between symptomatic and asymptomatic reflux episodes and to assess the influence of different <b>pH</b> sensor <b>positions</b> on the yield of symptom analysis. METHODS: Esophageal pH was measured for 24 hours at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in 18 symptomatic patients with GERD, and spatiotemporal reflux characteristics were assessed for symptomatic and asymptomatic reflux episodes. Additionally, the symptom-association probability (SAP) was calculated for each esophageal level. RESULTS: The median episode duration (at 3 cm above the LES) was longer and the proximal extent was higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic reflux episodes (P = 0. 006 and P = 0. 01). The ascending velocity of the refluxate was not significantly different. The SAP decreased significantly (P 95 %) SAP values.

40|$|Uveal {{melanoma}} is {{a highly}} malignant intraocular tumor with quite homogeneous tumor tissue and a diffuse leukocytic infiltration. In contrast with many other malignancies, the presence of infiltrating macrophages and T cells {{is associated with a}} poor prognosis rather than a good one. The clear link between inflammation and this malignancy provides a paradigm for macrophage plasticity and function. Macrophages in uveal melanoma have an M 2 -like phenotype and are associated with the loss of one specific chromosome - monosomy 3. The central players involved in this process and discussed include macrophages, T lymphocytes, chemokines and cytokines, including the macrophage-attraction molecules. When a tumor acquires the ability to release significant amounts of macrophage-attraction molecules it causes the expansion of a population of myeloid immature cells that may not only help the tumor to suppress immune reactions but also aid in the construction of new blood vessels for tumor growth. A better understanding of the molecular basis of a local myelomonocytic cell population will bring {{a better understanding of the}} immunopathology of this disease and will lead to therapeutic interventions in uveal melanoma.

The second excursion shows that automated computational techniques can display shape specifically in the retinal afterimage, a well-known effect in the human visual system. Promotor: S.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of enantioselectivity in the asymmetric Ru-catalyzed metathesis of olefins is investigated with a theoretical approach. The models {{are based on}} the chiral N-heterocyclic (NHC) -based catalysts developed by Grubbs. Our analysis indicates that the origin of enantioselectivity in the ring-closing metathesis of achiral trienes is correlated to the chiral folding of the N-bonded aromatic groups, which is imposed by the <b>Ph</b> groups in <b>positions</b> 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring of the NHC ligand. This chiral folding of the catalyst imposes a chiral orientation around the RudC bond, which, in turn, selects between the two enantiofaces of the substrate. In the ring-closing transition state, the geometry in which additional groups on the forming ring are in pseudoequatorial positions is favored over transition states in which this additional group is in a pseudoaxial position. These combined effects rationalize the enantiomeric excesses experimentally obtained...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to express my {{gratitude}} {{to all the people}} who supported me for the last four years, while I have been working on my Ph. D. thesis. I {{would like to}} thank Prof. Dr. Daniel Keim, my thesis advisor, for his excellent guidance during my Ph. D. I want to thank him first of all for letting me come to Germany to work in his group, for being there when I needed advice, and for letting (and encouraging) me to work on the topics that interested me most. I am also thankful for his friendship and the unconditional support that he gave me during all these years. I {{would also like to thank}} Prof. Dr. Gonzalo Navarro for his valuable suggestions and constant support. He encouraged me to publish my first paper when I was still an Engineering student at the University of Chile, and later to follow an academic career. He put me in contact with Prof. Dr. Keim and made it possible for me to get my <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>position</b> in Konstanz. He was always willing to discuss interesting topics that helped me tremendously during my ongoing research. Also, he generously accepted to serve as a second referee of my thesis and made useful comments that improved its quality. For all these reasons, I am very grateful to him. I must also offer my thanks to my colleagues and friends at the Universit...|$|R
