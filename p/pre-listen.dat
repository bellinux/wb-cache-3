40|$|The <b>Pre-listening</b> Stage in L 2 Listening Instruction to A 2 - B 1 Adult Learners By Hana Ždímalová This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} listening instruction to adult EFL learners in the Czech Republic and {{the phenomenon of}} <b>pre-listening,</b> which is currently under-researched.

The theoretical {{part of the study}} focuses on current developments in listening research and the historical context of the development of listening instruction in classical FLT methodology. The <b>pre-listening</b> stage has been integral to L 2 listening instruction since the beginning of Communicative Language Teaching. However, some controversial issues have recently been raised. For example, teachers are sometimes suspected of spending too much time on the pre- listening stage (Field 2002; 2008) and the overall usefulness of previewed comprehension questions in testing listening has been challenged (Sherman 1997). Moreover, adult students' listening needs and their perceptions of listening instruction have not yet been thoroughly researched (Graham 2006; Graham and Macaro 2008).

40|$|Listening {{skill is}} crucial to the {{learning}} of English as a second or foreign language. It is because (1) listening is the basis for the development of other language skills, (2) listening is important to communicative interaction, (3) listening is used to broaden people’s knowledge, (4) listening is a tool of “therapeutic value” (Nichols and Stevens, 1957 : 31) and (5) listening is used far more than other language skills (Rankin as quoted by Nichols and Stevens (1957 : 6), Rivers as quoted by Morley (1991 : 82), Rubin and Thompson (1994 : 85)). Automatically, teachers {{have to pay attention to}} listening skill. They also have to help their students achieve high level of listening proficiency. Theoritically, in teaching listening, teachers need to administer three stages namely: pre-, whilst- and post-listening stages (Rixon, 1986 : 65 - 73, Underwood, 1989 : 30 - 75 and Yagang, 1993 : 16 - 18). However, most teachers only ………………………. whilst and post-listening stages (Sheerin, 1987 : 126 and Yagang, 1993 : 16). The <b>pre-listening</b> stage is often neglected and considered not important. The writer of this study realizes that perhaps most of the listening teachers have not figured out the importance of conducting the <b>pre-listening</b> stage. Based on this reason, the writer conducts a library study to find out the nature and the teaching of listening with the focus on the <b>pre-listening</b> stage. To make her explanation clearer, she also provides some examples of the application of the <b>pre-listening</b> stage activities. From this study, it is concluded that listening is a complex skill: its process is passed over three stages and there are some parts involved in each stage. Another conclusion is that real-life listening is different from listening in a classroom or language laboratory. Some experts suggest the teachers conduct a <b>pre-listening</b> stage. The advantages of conducting this stage are: (1) the students get a general description of the coming materials, (2) the students elicit their prior knowledge relevant to the coming material, (3) the students reduce their anxiety and frustration and (4) the students increase their attention and motivation. In short, the <b>pre-listening</b> stage may encounter the potential difficulties that may occur. There are nine activities that may be applied namely (1) looking at and discussing a picture (Underwood, 1989 : 35 and Nation, 1985 : 819); (2) making list of possibilities, ideas (Underwood, 1989 : 37); (3) looking at the title, list of items/thoughts and discussing them (Rixon, 1986 : 65, Burbidge, 1986 : 10 and Underwood, 1989 : 36); 94) pre-viewing the questions Underwood, 1989 : 39 and Yagang, 1993 : 18); (5) labeling a picture or completing a chart (Nation, 1985 : 20 - 21 and ……………(6) previewing the vocabulary…………………… 1989 : 42); (7) story telling; (8) listening to or singing a song and (9) playing a game. Of course, there is a set of general guidelines in administering the <b>pre-listening</b> stage.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{addresses}} {{the role of}} strategy-based listening as an alternative methodological approach to develop pragmatic comprehension in L 2 contexts. Pragmatic comprehension refers {{to the understanding of}} speech acts and conversational implicatures. Listening comprehension comprises both bottom-up and top-down processes. Strategy-based listening encompasses the activation of pragmatic knowledge through <b>pre-listening</b> activities and the development of specific listening micro-skills. An empirical project which included a classroom project carried out with a group of eight learners preparing for the IELTS examination in 2009 corroborated the following assumptions: in order to achieve listening proficiency, learners need practice in making inferences as semantic and pragmatic inferences are embedded in verbal communication; semantic and pragmatic aspects affecting the meaning of utterances can be highlighted via comprehension activities focusing on specific listening sub-skills. The results of the classroom project suggested that strategy-based listening is potentially capable of directly enhancing pragmatic comprehension but were inconclusive with regards to pragmatic production...|$|R

It consists of four sections: evaluation statement, evaluation response, comprehension questions on dialogue and comprehensions on mini talks. Based on the students' tries-out are usually conducted in the writer's school before the national examination, she found that her students' scores are low in listening test. The students made mistakes in the listening section. Realizing the weaknesses of the students in comprehending the listening text, the writer argued to provide lessons which did not only improve students' listening comprehension but also increased listening scores. The writer proposed teaching listening using three stages of activities: <b>pre-listening,</b> while-listening and post-listening activities in which each stage provided listening strategies and skills. In <b>pre-listening</b> stage, the teacher started the lesson by brainstorming, discussing the listening-text which they listened to and asked questions related to the text. In the while-listening activities, the teacher gave a chance for students to do intensive listening and in the post-listening activities, the teachers helped students practice other language skills (speaking, reading and writing) by using the same topic. The objectives of the research were to know whether the three stage activities improve the students listening comprehension and to apply classroom action research as the design of the research. In conducting her study, the researcher took 30 students as the subjects of this study. Three instruments were used in this study: (1) teacher's observations given to her colleague to evaluate her teaching process, (2) students' questionnaires related to their problems in listening and (3) listening taken from part 4 of TOEIC. The observation was given to her colleagues before the teaching process; meanwhile, the two instruments were given to the students after the implementation of teaching listening through three stages.

40|$|This poster {{presents}} my PhD {{research about}} {{the appropriation of}} the practice of mobile music listening. Following an exploratory phase, I have described and interpreted some of the salient characteristics of that practice. It broadly shows that it is an automatic, background, unfocused listening used as an accompaniment to another activity. The music is therefore functional: it helps to relax, change mood, block unwanted sounds (or people), make non-places (Augé, 1992) more pleasant. This banal practice of mobile music listening can be described as an experience of ‘self-resonance’ (Rosa, 2012) from the listener. I argue that, besides this ‘art de faire’ (De Certeau, 1980), the technology of mobile listening affords another practice, at the extreme opposite, that stresses the creativity of the listener. This way of listening is characterized by a close attention to the music and the sound, a limitation of multitasking, a <b>pre-listening</b> preparation time, the playlist as a mean to appropriate a music collection, the use of random listening to discover hidden gems or unforeseen musical associations. A forthcoming ethnography of this practice will test this hypothesis and probably define new combinations of variables...|$|R

Although the relationship between L 2 {{linguistic knowledge}} and L 2 listening strategy use is under-determined, we might surmise from existing results that L 2 linguistic knowledge mediates the impact of L 2 listening strategy use on L 2 listening. Apart from Pae’s (2009) study of major factors affecting L 2 listening ability, few studies have examined the relationship between L 2 listening anxiety and L 2 linguistic knowledge. Pae’s (2009, 2013) research has demonstrated that L 2 listening anxiety mediates the influence that L 2 linguistic knowledge has on L 2 listening proficiency. These results suggest that as learners gain greater L 2 linguistic knowledge, their L 2 listening anxiety decreases resulting in better L 2 listening proficiency. Additionally, the link between L 2 listening anxiety and L 2 linguistic knowledge has also been shown in work investigating the effect of L 2 vocabulary instruction as <b>pre-listening</b> support (Chang 2007; Rost 2007). These studies illustrate that learners who are prepared linguistically for L 2 listening report lower anxiety levels.|$|R
