40|$|Abstract Background: Non-standard work {{arrangements}} are becoming {{an increasingly important}} determinant of health and safety among workers. The main objective {{of this study is}} to examine the relationship between indicators of non-standard work arrangements including <b>precarious</b> <b>contract,</b> long working hours, multiple jobs, shift work, and occupational injuries, using a representative European sample and taking into account several sociodemographic and work characteristics. Methods: The study was based on the data of the fifth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS). For the purpose of this analysis, the sample was restricted to 26839 respondents from the 27 countries of the European Union, who were all employed workers. Associations between non-standard work arrangements and occupational injuries were studied with multilevel modeling techniques while adjusting for several confounders. Results: About 8. 44 % of the workers suffered from an occupational injury. Multivariate regression model showed an increased injury risk for those working long hours (OR 1. 29, 95 % CI 1. 15 - 1. 44), having multiple jobs (OR 1. 23, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 47) and shift work (OR 1. 35, 95 % CI 1. 18 - 1. 54). The relationship between contract type and occupational injuries was not significant (OR 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 78 - 1. 07). No significant gender difference was observed. Conclusion: This study confirms that indicators of non-standard work arrangements, except for <b>precarious</b> <b>contract</b> type, were significantly associated with occupational injuries. To reduce the burden of occupational injuries, not only risk reduction strategies and interventions are needed but also policy efforts at European level should be undertaken to limit non-standard work arrangements...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the relationship between indicators of nonstandard work arrangements, including <b>precarious</b> <b>contract,</b> long working hours, multiple jobs, shift work, and work-related accident absence, using a representative Belgian sample and considering several socio-demographic and work characteristics. Methods: This study was based on the data of the fifth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS). For the analysis, the sample was restricted to 3343 respondents from Belgium who were all employed workers. The associations between non-standard work arrangements and work-related accident absence were studied with multivariate logistic regression modeling techniques while adjusting for several confounders. Results : During the last 12 months, about 11. 7 % of workers were absent from work because of work-related accident. A multivariate regression model showed an increased injury risk for those performing shift work (OR 1. 546, 95 % CI 1. 074 - 2. 224). The relationship between contract type and occupational injuries was not significant (OR 1. 163, 95 % CI 0. 739 - 1. 831). Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were observed for those performing long working hours (OR 1. 217, 95 % CI 0. 638 - 2. 321) and those performing multiple jobs (OR 1. 361, 95 % CI 0. 827 - 2. 240) in relation to work-related accident absence. Those who rated their health as bad, low educated workers, workers from the construction sector, and those exposed to biomechanical exposure (BM) were more frequent victims of work-related accident absence. No significant gender difference was observed. Conclusion : Indicators of nonstandard work arrangements under this study, except shift work, were not significantly associated with work-related accident absence. To reduce the burden of occupational injuries, not only risk reduction strategies and interventions are needed but also policy efforts are to be undertaken to limit shift work. In general, preventive measures and more training on the job are needed to ensure the safety and well-being of all workers...|$|E
40|$|Call {{centers have}} become a near-ubiquitous site of {{employment}} in our late capitalist world, with over a million people working there in the United Kingdom alone. The call center has become synonymous with low-paid, high-stress work under dictatorial supervision and <b>precarious</b> <b>contracts.</b> With Working the Phones, Jamie Woodcock draws on time spent employed in a non-unionized call center to take the public beyond anecdotal impressions to a true picture of what work is like there.

Evidence also indicates that a stricter regulation of regular contracts increases the immigrant-native earnings gap and immigrants' chances of holding temporary contracts. A stricter regulation of temporary contracts increases immigrants' risk of unemployment and underemployment.

40|$|Undeclared {{work and}} the hidden economy has been a {{constant}} feature of the Italian economic system. The phenomenon is not confined to the weaker economic areas, being spread throughout the national territory. The issue takes on a particular importance in these less developed areas, namely in the south, because these areas display the highest rates of unemployment and the lowest rates of economic activity. This observation is reinforced by the fact that, in the present phase, the largest share of informal work is found in economic sectors producing the lowest value-added: agriculture and construction. These are key sectors of activity for many regions of southern Italy, and have always been characterised by <b>precarious</b> <b>contracts</b> and seasonal work, and the low-skilled services (personal services, tourism and, more generally, commerce). Undeclared work is present, but to a lower degree, also in the manufacturing sector and in craft production...|$|R
30|$|In {{response}} to the weak economic recovery {{over the last few}} years, the Italian government has introduced some reforms in order to promote economic growth, as well as to increase the flexibility and competitiveness of the country. Regarding the labour market, Law n. 183 of 10 December 2014 (also known as the Jobs Act) modified and integrated the pre-existing normative framework. Specifically, the main aims of the Jobs Act are to (a) increase employment and reduce the share of the workforce with <b>precarious</b> <b>contracts</b> and to (b) stimulate enterprise productivity by encouraging the employment of a young labour force, thereby improving growth and competitiveness through reduced labour costs. Since the mid- 90 s, the gradual reform of the labour market has led the country towards a more flexible structure (for example, the use of additional types of employment contracts, the introduction of policies to facilitate the entry of young people into the labour market, the creation of work agencies, and the management of unemployment assistance).|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{employment}} patterns is a {{fast growing}} organisational policy. The enormous growth of temporary employment suggests that {{time spent in}} temporary employment may increasingly characterise typical career paths. For individuals building a career within a temporary employment environment may mean something very different from building a career {{in a world of}} permanent and stable employment relationships. It is anticipated that those on temporary or otherwise <b>precarious</b> <b>contracts</b> will conceivably display lower levels of commitment to the work organisation than those enjoying job security and career advancement within the ladder of hierarchy. Indeed, the combined promise of job security and career advancement within corporate hierarchies as linked with incremental increases in authority status and pay have constituted the major rewards through which organisations have been able to elicit organisational attachment and commitment from their employees.

5000|$|Since the {{implementation}} of the Equal Employment Opportunity Law in 1986, the largest increase in female labor participation has been in the sector of part-time jobs. For women who are rejoining the workforce after taking some time off it to raise their children, this means that they disproportionately obtain jobs with lower salaries and <b>precarious</b> <b>contracts.</b> [...] Motivated by this situation and the argument that more diversity in leadership positions leads to better management and more competitiveness, Prime Minister Abe has been encouraging companies and governmental agencies to create alternatives for women’s career advancement. This aspect of Womenomics mainly consists of campaigns and incentives for companies to promote more women to managerial positions, adopt internal gender-inclusiveness quotas, and disclose information regarding the share of female employees in different positions. The goal set for this element of the policy is to achieve 30% of leadership positions for women by 2020, where leadership positions are understood to encompass local and national parliaments; technical specialists; and chief positions in corporations.|$|R
30|$|We observe {{differences}} in transitions {{from the state}} of unemployment for males and females based on the age cohort and the level of GDP per capita. For example, we noted a probability of transit from unemployment to employment that was three times higher for a young male (20 – 30 years old) with a high school diploma, who had been unemployed for a few months (up to 6 months), who had labour experience, and who resided in a territory with a medium-high GDP per capita (more than 30, 000 euros) compared to an individual with the same characteristics but who lived in an area with a low GDP per capita (less than 15 – 20, 000 euros). This gap is important evidence that suggests how the policies introduced in recent labour market reforms (e.g. limiting <b>precarious</b> <b>contracts)</b> do not provide key ingredients needed to stimulate job growth (particularly among young people) in contexts that are economically disadvantaged. Of interest, we also noted that the probability of re-entry into the labour market is reduced with age. This decrease appears to be more gradual for males than for females.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{full-time}} employment {{has evolved into}} various types of occupational situations, and, nowadays, new work organization strategies have been developed. Previously overlooked risk factors have emerged, such as traffic accidents while commuting or during work hours, poor work organization, and detrimental lifestyles (like alcohol and substance abuse, although recent statistics seem to show a declining trend for the latter). The global scenario shows greater attention to occupational risks, but also, to the reduced degree of protection. Moreover, the elevated costs, the unacceptably high fatal accident rates in some sectors, {{the complexity of the}} prevention systems, the lack of prevention training, the inadequate controls (despite the numerous independent supervisory bodies) and the obsolescence of certain precepts, call for a prompt review of the regulatory system. This is especially needed for general simplification, streamlining certification bodies and minimizing references to other provisions in the legislation that make it difficult for Italian and foreign workers to read and understand the rules "without legal interpreters". "New" occupational diseases and occupational risk factors have also been reported in addition to pollution. There are concerns for continued economic and social destabilization, unemployment, commuting, temporary and <b>precarious</b> <b>contracts.</b> All of these contribute to the lack of wellbeing in the working population. Thus, the timing, duration, and types of prevention training should be carefully assessed, making prevention more appealing by evaluating costs and benefits with a widespread use of indicators that make appropriate actions for health promotion "visible", thus encouraging awareness. Although reducing prevention is never justified, it should still be "sustainable" economically in order to avoid waste of resources. It is also essential to have laws which are easily and consistently interpreted and to work on the ethics of employers and employees to ensure that they conform to the standards of other European countries that currently operate with greater effectiveness and lower costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the scientific area of tourism, particularly in higher education, requires an analysis and interpretation of its evolution in Portugal. Assuming the widespread recognition of tourism and leisure transversal influence in the contemporary society, one considers the need for rigorous studies on the implications of gender issues in knowledge production in higher education institutions (HEI). Therefore, this study intends to understand the trends in students’ demand for a degree in the tourism field and the {{importance of}} gender in higher education, and also their implication in the tourism sector labour market. This study is aimed mainly at interpreting the concern to understand the need and importance of studies on gender issues in tourism higher education, from different perspectives. To determine that the image of an HEI and the students’ demand for this field of study may rely on a policy and strategy that include these relevant gender issues, both in an educational and in an employment perspective, which is also a purpose of this study. In the tourism sector, according to Costa, Carvalho and Breda (2011, p. 39), the Portuguese reality is vertically segregated and, despite being a feminised sector, men occupy most top-level positions. Moreover, tourism workers, particularly female workers, are in general subject to poorer conditions of employment, such as low-pay, long working hours and more <b>precarious</b> <b>contracts.</b> The data [collected by these authors] hint at a very wide gender pay gap in the tourism industry. Costa, Carvalho, Caçador and Breda (2012, p. 70) also analysed the higher education and the labour market in the tourism sector and concluded that although women prevail among tourism graduates in Portugal, men earn higher salaries and fill most top-level positions in the tourism sector.

Multiple regression analysis pointed different predictors' variables for the three dimensions of burnout (more than 60 % of explained variance for emotional exhaustion, 16 % for personal accomplishment and 13 % for depersonalization).

The enormous growth of temporary employment suggests that time spent in temporary employment may increasingly characterise typical career paths. For individuals building a career within a temporary employment environment may mean something very different from building a career {{in a world of}} permanent and stable employment relationships. It is anticipated that those on temporary or otherwise <b>precarious</b> <b>contracts</b> will conceivably display lower levels of commitment to the work organisation than those enjoying job security and career advancement within the ladder of hierarchy. Indeed, the combined promise of job security and career advancement within corporate hierarchies as linked with incremental increases in authority status and pay have constituted the major rewards through which organisations have been able to elicit organisational attachment and commitment from their employees. The popularity of the concept appears to stem from its linkage with several desirable employee behaviours contributing to organisational effectiveness and efficiency. However, the HRM goals of improved employee commitment will potentially be undermined by the introduction of flexible work and employment patterns. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the degree the nature and antecedents of organisational commitment for short term professionals. The main argument of the present research is that the new forms of job security rest on the base of employability security. Employability security comes from the chance to accumulate human capital - skills reputation that can be invested in new opportunities as they arise. Our findings supported this argument and explained significant amount of variance in commitment. Additionally our findings reveal the changing nature of commitment. The emergence of "reflective" commitment put forward a new type of commitment.

30|$|Based on the analysis, further {{topics are}} on the agenda in Chile: low female labor market participation, a high share of {{temporary}} and often <b>precarious</b> employment <b>contracts,</b> limited knowledge of UISA, and the rather low amount of benefits. Women and workers with a temporary contract show significant higher hazard rates of terminating employment throughout the analysis. While labor market flexibility increases the dynamic and productivity of labor, it could also lead to unstable labor relations, generating situations, where the more vulnerable workers cannot access benefits as {{they are unable to}} fulfill the minimal conditions. In the competing risk analysis it further shows that women have a lower hazard of changing into a new employment, but a higher hazard of becoming unemployed or inactive compared to men, hinting to a more traditional attitude towards female labor market participation. While limited knowledge of UISA does not {{have a significant impact on}} labor duration in my sample, it might still prevent a share of workers from receiving benefits. And although the new UISA scheme certainly increases overall benefits, total amounts continue to be low, leading to restricted consumption smoothing and a possible severe drop in household income during unemployment spells.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – To {{investigate}} {{the level of}} organizational commitment in agency workers compared with permanent workers by taking into account {{relations between the two}} groups. Design/methodology/approach – A mixed methods design was employed comprising of a quantitative survey of 157 call centre workers followed by 29 qualitative interviews with permanent workers, agency workers and employers. Findings – Agency workers had a significantly lower level of organizational commitment compared with permanent workers once the relation between agency and permanent workers was controlled. Significant correlations were found within the sample between organizational commitment, being valued and job satisfaction further supported by a hierarchical multiple linear regression. Research limitations/implications – As with all cross‐sectional research causality cannot be confirmed and difficulty accessing call centre workers led to a restricted sample size. The measurement of worker relations needs developing. Further research is proposed to address these limitations and extend the findings. Practical implications – The implication for human resource management is that employers must be aware of the possible adverse influence that agency workers may have on permanent workers and as such try to incorporate agency workers within the organization to support their commitment. Originality/value – Previous studies have found inconsistent variations in the relative organizational commitment of permanent and temporary employees; a counter‐intuitive finding given the <b>precarious</b> employment <b>contract</b> held by temporary workers. This study casts light on these results by controlling for the relation between agency workers and permanent workers...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{strategies}} of neoliberalisation {{in relation to}} practices of dissent and resistance. It explores how struggles arising {{in the context of}} neoliberalisation may be subject to entanglement within the very processes they seek to contest and – in so doing - interrogates the political stakes of neoliberal governmental rationality. Drawing upon extensive ethnographic research, I trace the international trajectory of mobilisations against the dispossession visited upon Colombian farmers in the context of BP’s investment in oilfields in the mid- 1990 s. Reasoning through attention {{to the ways in which}} this one specific struggle was neutralised, I suggest that a key aim of neoliberal strategies of political control is to accomplish a sort of “political hygiene” by nullifying politically surplus subjects and containing dissent within manageable parameters. The invocation of discourses of rights and civil society can be seen to be integral to neoliberal political rationality in this regard: but rights are comprehended within a symbolic structuration of the population that coincides with neoliberal logics. I suggest that such logics are directed not so much at incorporating the population into a generalised “right of death and power over life”, as Foucault famously put it, but but at inscribing subjects into networks of unstable and <b>precarious</b> private <b>contract</b> that constrict the wider obligations of population and citizenship commonly associated with liberalism. Discourses of rights, civil society, and development are not antidotes to socio-economic dispossession or armed repression. Rather, all of these are complementary components of strategies aimed at the domestification of dissent...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{important}} work on the role that celebrity culture has played in providing working class audiences with a popular image of meritocracy – fuelled {{as it has been}} historically by the myth that anyone can ‘make it’, the sham that fame and fortune are open to all and are desirable (Dyer, 1979). Contemporary television culture has advanced that myth, as more and more ordinary people seem to ‘make it’ on reality TV, even while they are often denigrated. However, instead of focusing on representation, this paper will examine the role of ordinary celebrity in the political economy of the television industry. Producers of reality television came to rely on formats built around ‘ordinary’ celebrity in order to undermine the power of unions representing workers in the US and UK television industries {{at the end of the}} 1990 s. As in other industries, television attempted to address the challenges thrown up by the development of digital technology, increased competition and rising costs by attacking workers conditions. Unscripted, devoid of actors and less dependent on the skills of other creative and technical personnel, reality TV was able to temporarily side-step unionised labour in the US, while in the UK government policy forced public service broadcasters to outsource to independent companies, who were, unlike the workers in the BBC, non-unionised and often on <b>precarious</b> <b>contracts.</b> Thus an examination of the political economy of reality TV completely undermines the claims made by cultural populists that ordinary celebrity represents ‘democratainment’ (Hartley, 1999 and 2008). But it also opens up questions about the more critical view that reality TV is part of a broader shift in patterns of the social relations of exploitation (Andrejevic 2003, Terranova 2004), whereby ’free’ activities like the ‘work of watching’ TV’ or using the internet are considered to be a mode of exploited labour when media organisations ‘capture’ it and turn it to profit. This is seen to mark a new ubiquitous mode of exploitation that extends out of the factory and workplace and into the ‘social factory’ which is considered to be commensurate with the prominence of media communication and of digitised information in contemporary capitalism (Castells 1996). From this perspective all our activities can by understood as a form of exploitation, where work and leisure are collapsed together in an inescapable web of capitalist domination. This paper will challenge that view by returning to the explanation of exploitation found in Marx’s labour theory of value, to argue that there are important differences between the exploited labour of workers in the media industries and the way that audiences are taken advantage of. Furthermore, the requirement of the television industry to make a profit necessitates attacking the conditions of those who work in the industry and this directly clashes with workers’ need to minimize the rate at which surplus is extracted from their labour, (that is, the rate of exploitation) in order to have a decent life, or at least to be able to sustain themselves. Paradoxically, those companies who exploit workers also directly rely on the surplus value they create, which gives workers in the television industry the collective capacity and potential power to resist, and in the process perhaps, to call for new forms of television reality, both in form and in meaning...|$|R

40|$|Working {{conditions}} and the work environment have evolved significantly over the last decades. As one {{of the consequences of}} automation and productivity gains, working time has decreased, and unemployment has increased since the middle of the XIX century. The portion of the active Swiss population working part time was 4 % in 1960, 12 % in 1970, 19 % in 1990, 29 % in 2000 and 34 % in 2010. What would the job market be like in the post-automation and post-digitalization era? To answer these questions, the advocates of the popular initiative in Switzerland launched the debate on the Unconditional Basic Income. A UBI is a periodic cash payment unconditionally received by all individuals, without means-test or work obligations. This concept is not new and has been applied before in several countries around the globe with very different results. This debate led to the proposition of the federal initiative for an “Unconditional Basic Income”. The initiative was submitted to a popular vote on June 5 th, 2016 in Switzerland. Unfortunately for its supporters, the popular initiative was refused by 76. 9 % of the Swiss electorate. Knowing that Swiss voters were concerned about the increasing unemployment rates and <b>precarious</b> work <b>contracts,</b> this thesis investigates the reasons that led Switzerland to refuse the initiative. Results obtained from a survey realized in Geneva, shown that 83. 3 % of the Swiss electorate is concerned about changes in the work environment. However, the initiative failed to be approved as the proportion of voters supporting the initiative was inferior to 50 % of the electorate. Based on this fact, one can conclude that an important share of the population believed in the necessity of a security plan for unemployment but did not support the initiative. Furthermore, it can be concluded that being aware of the changes in the work environment and unemployment issues was not a sufficient reason to vote in favour of a UBI. Thus, this work proposes that the Swiss population do not believe that giving a lump sum to all citizens is the better solution to fight unemployment and counter arrest the threats of automation...|$|R
40|$|Depuis 1958, le droit social communautaire se forge. Mais avec la réalisation du grand marché intérieur en 1992 se trouve posées de nouvelles problématiques sociales qui peuvent être rapprochées de celles qui résulteront de l'ouverture économique entre les USA et le Canada avec l'Accord de libre-échange. Elles s'articulent autour de la nécessaire mobilité des travailleurs et de la {{recherche}} d'un statut social pour le travailleur communautaire. Social communal {{rights have}} been forging since 1958. New social problematics concerning the 1992 Common Market which can be compared from those resulting from the Free Trade Agreement between the U. S. A. and Canada are being questioned. These concerns focus on the necessity of workers mobility and their pursuit for a social status. I. The workers mobility should be increased to permit growth of economie trade and competitivity. The "liberty of circulation" principle for workers is based on community standards which permit and assure wage earners personal and family rights and of its protection. But the new stake is one of qualifications; so it is therefore necessary to acknowledge qualifications to increase the workers mobility; this can only be achieved through a true European negotiation, and in all professional branches. Without of such a negotiation, European groups would form their own mobility rules. II. The social status of European workers represents the genuine challenge for social Europe. Directives of key subjects on the economie (economie layoffs, company transfers) or social evolutions (equality M/W) have already been elaborated. Through the unique European Act, elaboration of restrictive norms in matters of hygiene and security and also by implementing a base for directive principles, a new movement model appears. 1. Regarding wage earners health and safety, technical and main directives have been issued, but {{the effectiveness of a}} true health protection community policy for workers is very difficult to control. 2. The recognition of fundamental social rights has been acquired since 1989 through adoption of the Charter, but its impact remains disputed: So the manifestation of social Europe depends either on the Commission's actions or on the development of a European negotiation. Standards that are susceptible of being harmonized are very delicate at the Commission's level (example: salary matters, <b>precarious</b> labour <b>contracts).</b> With a lack of institutional setting and adapted structures, European negotiation does not exist. Only a "social dialogue" would permit a concerted effort of social partners. Normative construction is therefore considerable {{and at the same time}} limited; it would seem that if a social European space exists, social Europe is not yet built...|$|R

The model integrates the heterogeneity of agents, and their decisions (firms and workers) based on "search theory", which gives rational microe-conomic foundations to behavior, albeit with decision rules using bounded rationality rather than optimal rules which cannot be computed in the complex system that the modeled labor market constitutes. We introduce many institutions and specially the two main labor contracts, Open-Ended contracts and Fixed Term Contracts. The WorkSim model simulates the gross flows between inactivity, unemployment and these two types of employment, with a consistent accounting system. It is calibrated by a powerful algorithm to set 63 parameters to fit more than 64 aggregate real variables. We analyze only the facilitation of the economic dismissals allowed by the El Khomri law but it is the most essential element of the law for the labor market. We find that it has little effect on global unemployment but benefits the young who crowd out the seniors. This result is based on the substitution by the employers of more <b>precarious</b> Open Ended <b>Contracts</b> to Fixed Duration Contracts which become useless, and the fact that young workers are more often in Fixed Duration Contracts than the other age categories. The labor market is deeply transformed. When aggregate demand is exogenously changed, the experiment shows that the employment and the unemployment react faster than before the law...|$|R

A vida cotidiana é o espaço onde acontecem as rotinas e estabelecem-se as relações, permitindo oportunidade para mudanças e construção do novo. Este estudo aborda a vida cotidiana no trabalho de enfermagem, tendo como objetivos apreender o cotidiano das trabalhadoras de enfermagem na clínica cirúrgica de um {{hospital}} público em São Luís - MA, e analisar esse cotidiano, partindo da prática hospitalar. A pesquisa foi realizada por meio da observação participante, entrevista e análise de fontes secundárias que normatizam o trabalho de enfermagem. A coleta teve início em julho de 2006 e término em setembro de 2007. Os dados resultantes das entrevistas e da observação indicaram duas categorias, a saber: cotidiano do trabalho de enfermagem e reflexões sobre o cotidiano; com as subcategorias da primeira: o processo de trabalho e as condições de trabalho. O trabalho de enfermagem caracterizou-se pela predominância do trabalho feminino e divisão técnica e social do trabalho entre seus membros, enfermeiras, técnicas e auxiliares de enfermagem, com as rotinas de serviço prevalecendo na prática hospitalar, a precariedade do contrato de trabalho com jornadas dupla e tripla permeia o cotidiano do trabalho de enfermagem na clínica cirúrgica. A segunda categoria de análise revelou as concepções de cotidiano dos sujeitos em estudo. O cotidiano para as mesmas, embora seja repetitivo, não é igual, por ser executado com pessoas distintas e em quadros clínicos diferentes. A importância deste estudo consiste em despertar nos sujeitos da pesquisa o interesse por novas formas de aprendizado, pela lógica da descoberta, mesmo em face da aparente monotonia do dia a dia do trabalhoThe {{routine is}} the daily life of every human. It {{is a part}} of the routine life our work, private life, leisure activities and resting period. The daily routine is the period when our dayby- day activities happen and when we establish our relations, allowing the changing possibilities and the chance to build something new. This study is aimed at the daily routine of the nursing activity, having as a goal the understanding of the nurses routine at the surgical clinic of a public hospital in São Luis MA, and analyze this routine, starting form the hospital practices. The research was carried out through participative observation, interviews and the analysis of secondary data sources which regulate the nursing work. The data gathering started in July 2006 and ended in September 2007. The data resulting from the interviews and observation have indicated two categories: the nursing work routine and the reflections regarding the routine; and connected to the first category the work process and condition. The nursing care routine is characterized by the predominance of female workers, and the social and technical division of the activities among their members, nurses, technical, and nursing assistants, each one with their respective routines, prevailing the hospital practices, the <b>precarious</b> job <b>contracts,</b> with double, triple shifts are common in the surgical clinical nursing routine. The second category reveals the routine conceptions of the studied individuals. Their routine, according to their opinion, although repetitive is not equal, since they are dealing with different people with different clinical conditions. The importance of this study is to encourage in the researched individuals the urge for new ways of learning, for the logic of discovery, even with all the monotony and the apparently boredom of the work routin...|$|R

A proteção social vinculada à Política Nacional de Assistência Social (PNAS) visa a reduzir e prevenir os impactos das desigualdades sociais e naturais que compõem o desenvolvimento do ser humano em todos os aspectos do indivíduo e da família através de ações de fortalecimento e de potencialização dos vínculos familiares e comunitários. Os procedimentos metodológicos usados foram pesquisa de campo baseada no método qualitativo e quantitativo, entrevistas e aplicação de formulário aos coordenadores e equipes técnicas que atuam nas cinco instituições de acolhimento de alta complexidade do município. As crianças e/ou adolescentes atendidos são atingidas, ao mesmo tempo, por mais de uma problemática social, aguçada pelas condições socioeconômicas, psicológicas, educacionais, culturais e políticas de suas famílias, provenientes das mudanças societárias e das sequelas da questão social acirrada pelo sistema capitalista. Dentre os motivos que levam crianças e adolescentes ao processo de afastamento da família e da comunidade, destacam-se: o abandono por parte dos pais e/ou responsáveis, a violência doméstica, o envolvimento com drogas, os conflitos na comunidade onde residem e a mendicância. Os dados estatísticos indicam ainda que das famílias dos acolhidos, 41 % convivem com ausência de um dos cônjuges; 44 % de crianças e adolescentes perderam o vínculo com a família; e 41 % com o local onde viviam. Em relação ao trabalho na instituição, as dificuldades estão presentes no dia-a-dia. As mais citadas são aproximação com as famílias no processo de reintegração; continuação e efetivação das ações de fortalecimento dos vínculos familiares e comunitários, durante o acolhimento e após desligamento do serviço; demora no atendimento aos encaminhamentos; desarticulação entre as políticas setoriais, que contribui para não concretização do trabalho em rede. As instituições apresentam número reduzido de funcionários, alguns sem qualificação para exercer o cargo, contratados com vínculos de trabalho precarizados, baixos salários e com poucas condições de trabalho. Além de infraestrutura precária, o espaço é insuficiente para as atividades socioeducativas. Faltam materiais pedagógicos, transportes, dentre outros. Com este conjunto de adversidades, fica comprometido o dever do estado de assegurar a garantia dos direitos promulgados no Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente (ECA), especialmente a convivência familiar e comunitária. This study aims {{to understand}} how the host institutions actualize care policy and social protection particularly advocated by the ECA and PNAS, to ensure social protection and the right to family and community. Social protection linked to the National Social Policy (PNAS) aims to reduce and prevent the impacts of natural and social inequalities that make up the human development in all aspects of the individual and the family empowerment through actions and potentiation of the family and the community bonds. The methodological procedures used were based on the field research method, qualitative and quantitative interviews and an application form to the coordinators and technical staff working in five host institutions of high complexity of the municipality. Children and / or adolescents served are met, while for more than a social problem, heightened by the socioeconomic, psychological, educational, cultural policies and their families, from the societal change and the legacy of bitter social issue by the capitalist system. Among the reasons that lead children and adolescents in the process of separation from family and community are: abandonment by parents and / or guardians, domestic violence, involvement with drugs, the conflicts in the community where they live and begging. The statistics also indicate that the families of the accepted ones, 41 % live with the absence of a spouse, 44 % of the children and adolescents have lost their bond with their family, and 41 % with where they lived. Concerning the work in the institution, the difficulties are present everyday. The most cited are closer to the families in the reintegration process, continuation and effectiveness of actions to strengthen family ties and community during the reception and after the service shutdown, the delay in the treatment referrals; disconnection between sectoral policies, which contributes to nonimplementation of networking. Institutions have few employees, some without qualification to hold the office, <b>contracted</b> with <b>precarious</b> work <b>contracts,</b> low wages and poor conditions of work. Besides the poor infrastructure, there is insufficient space for social and educational activities. Insufficient teaching materials, transportation, among others. With this set of adversities, it is committed the duty of the state to ensure the guarlantee of the rights enacted in the Child and Adolescent, especially the family and community...|$|R

A abordagem utilizada ? a quanti-qualitativa e os instrumentos de coleta de dados s?o a an?lise documental, observa??o e entrevista semi-estruturada, e a aprecia??o desses dados ? feita a partir da an?lise de conte?do. O trabalho apresenta os referenciais te?rico-anal?ticos mais universais para contextualizar a particularidade, para isso, recupera o movimento hist?rico da profiss?o, problematiza o Servi?o Social no contexto do neoliberalismo e da reestrutura??o produtiva e caracteriza o trabalho precarizado, apresenta uma discuss?o te?rica acerca da pol?tica social, descentraliza??o pol?tico-administrativa, pol?tica da assist?ncia social e a particularidade que essas categorias assumem na realidade do Munic?pio.

Studied the precarious of labor conditions of these professionals, with the objective to analyze as changes, which occurred in the relations of work, while a worldwide phenomenon had in bonds of work of public institutions and what implications thereof in the activity of the professional Social Service. The study assumed the hypothesis that the professionals of CRAS in Campina Grande have precarious and that this process of impoverishment of the contractual conditions focuses negatively on the practice of social workers, since the forms of integration and the limits set by its objective conditions impose obstacles to professional practice. The theoretical-methodological referential adopted is based on historic design critical thinking-dialectic, that part of the data provided by practical reality and examines the whole of their historical determinations, observing the relationship between the particular and the universal. The approach used is the quantitative-qualitative and instruments for data collection were the documentary analysis, observation and semi-structured interview. The assessment of such data guided-if the technique of content analysis, in addition to theoretical analysis in the light of theoretical-analytical more universal, which enabled contextualize the particularity of the profession in national and local area, recovers the historical movement and the change in direction policy of the profession. Thus, the Social Service was discussed in the context of neoliberalism and productive restructuring, which characterizes the precarious work. The research revealed that the ingress of professionals in CRAS is realized in a condition of <b>contract</b> <b>precarious</b> by means of an evaluation of curriculum riddled with too many by trafficking of influences, constitutional violating the prerogative of recruitment through the public tender. Ultimately, we infer that all social assistants are inserted, in CRASs in Campina Grande, has been precarious condition that requires a position of submission of the professional in the space socio-occupational, which undermines the quality of services and the materialization of Ethical-Political Project of the profession...|$|R
