40|$|Reflecting {{widespread}} {{interest in}} concepts of ‘nudging’ and ‘choice architecture’, {{there is increasing}} research and policy attention on altering aspects of the small-scale physical environment, such as portion sizes or product positioning, to change health-related behaviour at population-level. There is, however, a lack of clarity in characterising these interventions, and no reliable framework incorporating standardised definitions. This hampers both the synthesis of cumulative evidence about intervention effects, and the identification of intervention opportunities. To address this, a new tool, TIPPME (Typology of Interventions in Proximal Physical Micro-Environments) has been developed, here applied to the selection, purchase and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco. This provides a framework to reliably classify and describe, and enable more systematic design, reporting and analysis of, an important class of interventions. In doing so, it makes a distinct contribution to collective efforts to build the cumulative evidence-base for effective ways of changing behaviour across populations.

40|$|Background: The {{increase}} in use {{and costs of}} assisted reproductive therapies including in-vitro fertilization (IVF) has led to debate over public funding. A decision analytic model was designed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of IVF by additional treatment programmes and maternal age. Methods: Data from the Australian and New Zealand Assisted Reproductive Database were used to estimate incremental effects (live birth and other pregnancy outcomes) and costs for cohorts of women attempting up to three treatment programmes. A treatment programme included one fresh cycle and a variable number of frozen cycles dependent on maternal age. Results: The incremental cost per live birth ranged from AU$ 27 373 and AU$ 31 986 for women aged 30 – 33 on their first and third programmes to AU$ 130 951 and AU$ 187 515 for 42 – 45 -year-old women on their first and second attempts. Overall, these trends were not affected by inclusions of costs associated with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or multiple births. Conclusions: This study suggests that cost per live birth from IVF increases with maternal age and treatment <b>programme</b> <b>number</b> and indicates that maternal age has the much greater effect. This evidence may help decisionmakers target the use of IVF services conditional on societal willingness to pay for live births and equity considerations...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how the {{geographic}} distribution of and movements within a population influence the spatial spread of infections {{is crucial for}} the design of interventions to curb transmission. Existing knowledge is typically based on results from simulation studies whereas analyses of real data remain sparse. The main difficulty in quantifying the spatial pattern of disease spread is the paucity of available data together with the challenge of incorporating optimally the limited information into models of disease transmission. To address this challenge the role of routine migration on the spatial pattern of infection during the epidemic of 2009 pandemic influenza in England is investigated here through two modelling approaches: parallel-region models, where epidemics in different regions are assumed to occur in isolation with shared characteristics; and meta-region models where inter-region transmission is expressed {{as a function of the}} commuter flux between regions. Results highlight that the significantly less computationally demanding parallel-region approach is sufficiently flexible to capture the underlying dynamics. This suggests that inter-region movement is either inaccurately characterized by the available commuting data or insignificant once its initial impact on transmission has subsided.

Random-effects meta-analyses are very commonly used in medical statistics. Recent methodological developments include multivariate (multiple outcomes) and network (multiple treatments) meta-analysis. Here, we provide a new model and corresponding estimation procedure for multivariate network meta-analysis, so that multiple outcomes and treatments can {{be included in a}} single analysis. Our new multivariate model is a direct extension of a univariate model for network meta-analysis that has recently been proposed. We allow two types of unknown variance parameters in our model, which represent between-study heterogeneity and inconsistency. Inconsistency arises when different forms of direct and indirect evidence are not in agreement, even having taken between-study heterogeneity into account. However, the consistency assumption is often assumed in practice and so we also explain how to fit a reduced model which makes this assumption. Our estimation method extends several other commonly used methods for meta-analysis, including the method proposed by DerSimonian and Laird (1986). We investigate the use of our proposed methods in the context of both a simulation study and a real example.

40|$|SummaryThe Finnish National Prevention and Treatment Programme for Chronic Bronchitis and COPD, {{launched}} in 1998, has, to date, {{been running for}} 6 years (2003). The goals of this action programme were to {{reduce the incidence of}} COPD and the number of moderate and severe cases of the disease, and to reduce both the number of days of hospitalisation and treatment costs. A prevalent implementation of over 250 information and training events started. Health centres and pharmacies appointed a person in charge of COPD patients. In order to improve the cooperation between primary and specialised care, two thirds of hospital districts created local COPD treatment chains. The early diagnosis of COPD by spirometric examination was activated during the <b>programme.</b> <b>Number</b> of health centres with available spirometric services increased to 95 %. Before the start of the programme, approximately 5 – 9 % of the adult population had COPD. During the whole programme, the proportion of male and female smokers decreased from 30 % to 26 % and from 20 % to 19 %, respectively. The total number of hospitalisation periods and days due to COPD decreased by 15 % and 18 %, respectively. Both the number of pensioners and daily sickness days due to COPD also decreased by 18 %. Registered COPD induced deaths remained at their previous levels during the monitoring period, i. e. around 1000 deaths out of 5. 2 millions annually. The measures recommended by the programme have been widely introduced but they need to be still more effective...|$|E

Early puberty timing is {{associated}} with higher risks for type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) and cardiovascular disease in women and therefore represents a potential target for early preventive interventions. We characterised the range of diseases and other adverse health outcomes associated with early or late puberty timing in men and women in the very large UK Biobank study. Recalled puberty timing and past/current diseases were self-reported by questionnaire. We limited analyses to individuals of White ethnicity (250, 037 women; 197, 714 men) and to disease outcomes with at least 500 cases (~ 0. 2 % prevalence) and we applied stringent correction for multiple testing (corrected threshold P < 7. 48 × 10 (- 5)). In models adjusted for socioeconomic position and adiposity/body composition variables, both in women and men separately, earlier puberty timing was associated with higher risks for angina, hypertension and T 2 D. Furthermore, compared to the median/average group, earlier or later puberty timing in women or men was associated with higher risks for 48 adverse outcomes, across a range of cancers, cardio-metabolic, gynaecological/obstetric, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neuro-cognitive categories. Notably, both early and late menarche were associated with higher risks for early natural menopause in women. Puberty timing in both men and women appears to have a profound impact on later health.

40|$|This deposit is {{composed}} {{by the main}} article plus the supplementary materials of the publication. Rhomboids are intramembrane serine proteases conserved in all kingdoms of life. They regulate epidermal growth factor receptor signalling in Drosophila by releasing signalling ligands from their transmembrane tethers. Their functions in mammals are poorly understood, {{in part because of}} the lack of endogenous substrates identified thus far. We used a quantitative proteomics approach to investigate the substrate repertoire of rhomboid protease RHBDL 2 in human cells. We reveal a range of novel substrates that are specifically cleaved by RHBDL 2, including the interleukin- 6 receptor (IL 6 R), cell surface protease inhibitor Spint- 1, the collagen receptor tyrosine kinase DDR 1, N-Cadherin, CLCP 1 /DCBLD 2, KIRREL, BCAM and others. We further demonstrate that these substrates can be shed by endogenously expressed RHBDL 2 and that a subset of them is resistant to shedding by cell surface metalloproteases. The expression profiles and identity of the substrates implicate RHBDL 2 in physiological or pathological processes affecting epithelial homeostasis.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It first {{appeared}} from the Institute of Mathematical Statistics via [URL] genome sequencing of pathogens from multiple hosts in an epidemic offers the potential to investigate who infected whom with unparalleled resolution, potentially yielding important insights into disease dynamics and the impact of control measures. We considered disease outbreaks in a setting with dense genomic sampling, and formulated stochastic epidemic models to investigate person-to-person transmission, based on observed genomic and epidemiological data. We constructed models in which the genetic distance between sampled genotypes depends on the epidemiological relationship between the hosts. A data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to sample over the transmission trees, providing a posterior probability for any given transmission route. We investigated the predictive performance of our methodology using simulated data, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity, particularly for rapidly mutating pathogens with low transmissibility. We then analyzed data collected during an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a hospital, identifying probable transmission routes and estimating epidemiological parameters. Our approach overcomes limitations of previous methods, providing a framework with the flexibility to allow for unobserved infection times, multiple independent introductions of the pathogen and within-host genetic diversity, as well as allowing forward simulation.
