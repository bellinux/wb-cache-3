40|$|Two {{types of}} {{temperature}} sensors {{have been developed}} for wide-range temperature applications. The two sensors measure temperature in the range of - 190 to + 200 C and utilize a thin-film platinum RTD (resistance temperature detector) as the temperature-sensing element. Other parts used in the fabrication of these sensors include NPO (negative-positive- zero) type ceramic capacitors for timing, thermally-stable film or wirewound resistors, and high-temperature circuit boards and solder. The first type of temperature sensor is a relaxation oscillator circuit using an SOI (silicon-on-insulator) operational amplifier as a comparator. The output is a pulse train with a period that is roughly proportional to the temperature being measured. The voltage level of the pulse train is high-level, for example 10 V. The high-level output makes the sensor less sensitive to noise or electromagnetic interference. The output can be read by a frequency or <b>period</b> <b>meter</b> and then converted into a temperature reading. The second type of temperature sensor is made up of various types of multivibrator circuits using an SOI type 555 timer and the passive components mentioned above. Three configurations have been developed that were based on the technique of charging and discharging a capacitor through a resistive element to create a train of pulses governed by the capacitor-resistor time constant. Both types of sensors, which operated successfully over the wide temperature range, have potential use in extreme temperature environments including jet engines and space exploration missions...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship between continuing asthma morbidity and the attendance of and prescribing for symptomatic asthmatic patients in primary care. A random sample of 402 subjects from 801 who reported at least one of six symptoms in the previous month on most or every day were identified from responses to a validated morbidity questionnaire. An analysis of their care over a 2 -year period (1 year before and 1 year after the questionnaire) was carried out from their general practice case-notes. Data on 308 patients was available for analysis. Ninety-four per cent of these symptomatic asthma patients attended over the 2 -year period, with 77 % attending for an asthma related consultation. Most patients were managed exclusively in primary care. Inhaled steroids were prescribed for 78 % of patients and high dose inhaled steroids (⩾ 800 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent per day) were prescribed for 38 %. Patients with most symptoms were more likely to be prescribed inhaled steroids. Rescue courses of oral steroids were prescribed for 29 % of patients. Changes in asthma medications were recorded for 31 % during the study <b>period.</b> <b>Metered</b> dose inhalers (MDI) were prescribed for 86 % with more than half prescribed MDIs combined with some other delivery device. Elements of structured care were more frequently recorded in patients who reported most symptoms. In conclusion the asthma management of the majority of patients in this study was active with high levels of steroid prescribing. There appeared to be room to increase prescribing and to improve the structure of care. While patients who were ‘symptomatic on steroids’ should have had their medications, delivery devices and structured care reviewed regularly, many were already on maximal treatment and were therefore likely to remain symptomatic. It is unclear how practitioners could improve morbidity in many of these patients as under-treatment and low attendance seem unlikely to be the principal causes of continuing symptoms...|$|R

Chronology and region aside, these sanctuaries have several things in common: both occupy commanding positions in the landscape; both were located at frontiers, far from densely populated areas; and both were radically transformed by their respective rulers – Labraunda was monumentalized by Maussollos, satrap of Karia, and Mamurt Kale by Philetairos, founder of the Attalid dynasty at Pergamon. Intertwining ruler ideology with these regional cults was intended {{to create a new}} focus for the wider community, and this would have had several repercussions.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{efficiency}} of electricity use and potential of electricity reduction at 12 residential colleges located at University of Malaya Campus, Kuala Lumpur. Design/methodology/approach: The work presented applies an energy audit when energy consumption data were collected and analysed for a five-year period. The total savings of electricity used at residential colleges were identified through the difference between average total energy use in a year (kWh) and minimum electricity usage. Findings: The study finds that residential colleges with special features of building layout and arrangement performed better with regard to electricity consumption due to the prior group's superior utilisation of day lighting and natural ventilation. The floor area of the rooms, volume, density, enclosure and facade design, including window design, window area, and window-to-wall ratio also influenced the total electricity usage of the residential college buildings. Also, through adaptation of the corridor area to include more natural ventilation and daylight, approximately 40 to 90 percent of average electricity usage could be conserved in a year. Research limitations/implications: The methodology is limited to energy audit for a five-year <b>period</b> of <b>metered</b> data and walk-through analysis. Practical implications: The findings raised some issues related to thermal comfort of the residents. Originality/value: The study can be used as baseline data for a tropical region particularly on current electricity usage and potential of energy conservation in residential building.

40|$|Glacier {{variation}} {{is one of}} the best indicators of climate change in mountainous environment. In French Alps, many temporal data are acquired by glaciologists at glaciers scale: geometrical parameters (surface area, thickness, length and front altitude) are surveyed since the end of the 19 th century. Those parameters are necessary to estimate the mass-balance of glaciers and, then, an accurate temporal signal of glacier variation. However, the time-response of the glaciers can be highly variable because of the topoclimate, and more generally the local settings of the glaciers. Moreover, climatologists and hydrologists are requiring estimation of glacier variations at regional scale and not only at local scale. In this paper, we highlight that the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) is a parameter prone to spatio-temporal reconstructions at regional scale. ELA can indeed be interpolated at a region scale from local data: for instance, many geographers have reconstructed spatial trends during 1980 s. Here, we try to interpolate ELA from multi-dimensionnal regression analysis: ELA is explained by many local parameters (Incoming solar radiation, topographic indexes, snow-redistribution by wind, etc.). Regression model was adjusted from a spatio-temporal database of 50 glaciers, located in the Massif des Écrins. ELA was estimated for each glacier thanks to the Accumulation Area Ratio (ratio = 0. 65) at two stages: LIA maximum and at present. Results first show that the multiple regression analysis is efficient to interpolate ELA through space: the adjusted r 2 is about 0. 49 for the reconstruction during the LIA, and 0. 47 at present. Moreover, the RMSE error is about 50 meters for the LIA <b>period,</b> 55 <b>meters</b> at present. Finally, a high spatial variability (standard deviation of about 150 meters) is highlighted: incoming solar radiation and snow redistribution by wind mostly explain the observed differences.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{metering}} cost minimisation model that minimises metering cost under {{the constraints of}} sampling accuracy requirement for clean development mechanism (CDM) energy efficiency (EE) lighting project. Usually small scale (SSC) CDM EE lighting projects expect a crediting period of 10 years given that the lighting population will decay as time goes by. The SSC CDM sampling guideline requires that the monitored key parameters for the carbon emission reduction quantification must satisfy the sampling accuracy of 90 % confidence and 10 % precision, known as the 90 / 10 criterion. For the existing registered CDM lighting projects, sample sizes are either decided by professional judgment or by rule-of-thumb without considering any optimisation. Lighting samples are randomly selected and their energy consumptions are monitored continuously by power meters. In this study, the sampling size determination problem is formulated as a metering cost minimisation model by incorporating a linear lighting decay model as given by the CDM guideline AMS-II. J. The 90 / 10 criterion is formulated as constraints to the metering cost minimisation problem.

50|$|To reduce demand {{during the}} high cost peak usage <b>periods,</b> {{communications}} and <b>metering</b> technologies inform smart devices {{in the home and}} business when energy demand is high and track how much electricity is used and when it is used. It also gives utility companies the ability to reduce consumption by communicating to devices directly in order to prevent system overloads. Examples would be a utility reducing the usage of a group of electric vehicle charging stations or shifting temperature set points of air conditioners in a city. To motivate them to cut back use and perform what is called peak curtailment or peak leveling, prices of electricity are increased during high demand periods, and decreased during low demand periods. It is thought that consumers and businesses will tend to consume less during high demand periods if it is possible for consumers and consumer devices {{to be aware of the}} high price premium for using electricity at peak periods. This could mean making trade-offs such as cycling on/off air conditioners or running dishwashers at 9 pm instead of 5 pm. When businesses and consumers see a direct economic benefit of using energy at off-peak times, the theory is that they will include energy cost of operation into their consumer device and building construction decisions and hence become more energy efficient.

40|$|Although ancient verse {{has also}} been {{translated}} into Estonian with different non-equimetrical strategies, {{from the very beginning}} the equimetrical way of translation has prevailed, the purpose of which has been to convey the meter of a source text in the target text. Ancient meters are found in the Estonian tradition of translation {{from the end of the}} 19 th century, when several authors undertook the translation of voluminous hexametrical texts. During the following decades, hexameter became an important meter both in original and translated poetry, first in accentual-syllabic or syllabic-accentual versification systems, later different quantitative forms were added. In the case of Estonian quantitative hexameter, a two-way evolution can be observed: the aim of the first direction is to accommodate hexameter in the prosodic reality of the Estonian language and develop a form that allows licences in the metrical structure rather than deform language, the aim of the second is to create a verse form, which, first of all, follows the patterns of ancient verse and, if necessary, forms artificial rules of quantity in order to accommodate Estonian language with the structure of hexameter. The incidence of other ancient meters, including different Ionic and Aeolic verse forms, is  considerably  lower.  During  the  obser  ved  period,  Aeolic meter s  are  conveyed  in  two  dif  fe -rent forms: in syllabic-accentual verse, where quantity plays only a rhythmic role, and syllabic-accentual-quantitative form, where the number of syllables is always strictly fixed, the distribution  of  accent s  is  governed  by  cer tain  rule s,  while  quantit y  is  more  impor tant  in strong positions and less regulated in weak positions. At the same time, we come across non-equimetrical translations as well, where instead of the original meter some other verse form has been chosen for the translation. Such rendition can be a functional equivalent, but sometimes it is just the result of a random choice. On the other hand, mostly in the case of poems in hexameter or elegiac distichs, the verseto-prose translation strategy is also used. Therefore, we can see that during the observed <b>period</b> ancient <b>meters</b> were translated with a variety of strategies.

Analysis of the available wave data and optimisation of the WEC were carried out so as to design the optimum system that will interact efficiently with {{the conditions of the}} selected location. The electrical model was designed for wave heights and periods that yielded the maximum power throughout the year. The initial finite element simulations were undertaken on {{the design of}} a 4 -pole tubular permanent magnet (PM) linear synchronous machine. The performance of the system was optimised for a wave height and <b>period</b> of 3 <b>meters</b> and 6 seconds, respectively. The capacity of the linear generator was set at 15 kVA and the dimensions of the WEC (floating point absorber) were determined accordingly through the application of a simplified model for predicting the coupled dynamic response of the absorber and the linear generator. It was necessary that the machine gives a reasonable performan+ce when operating under the slower and most common waves. Thus an 8 -pole and a 16 -pole tubular linear PM machine were also simulated and their performance was compared. Through this analysis the 16 -pole design resulted in the best performance, especially at low speeds. Simulations were initially compared at fixed speed but were later simulated with variable speed conditions so as to represent more accurately the wave’s motion and monitor the power generator performance at variable loadings. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Prepared for: USX Corporation Technical Center, Monroeville, PAPilot-plant {{testing at}} the Coleraine Research Laboratory has {{indicated}} {{the potential benefits}} of dry magnetic separation (cobbing) of Minntac rod-mill feed. Therefore, a prototype commercial unit was installed on line 18 to establish the benefits of dry cobbing. Line 18 was operated with and without dry cobbing on alternate days. The initial test period indicated, that for a short period and one splitter position, dry cobbing produced about a 5 percent increase in the magnetic iron tons in the wet cobber concentrate with a concurrent 2 percent loss in magnetic iron recovery. About 25 percent of that iron loss was associated with fine material being carried along with the dry cobber tailings. In the second test <b>period,</b> a flow <b>meter</b> and density guage were installed in the final concentrate line so that the actual long tons per hour of concentrate produced could be measured. The second test period ran for. about 2 weeks and showed a production increase of about 3 percent with essentially no loss in magnetic iron recovery. While the tests are not totally conclusive they do indicate potential benefits with dry cobbing. It is anticipated that with the recommended optimization of the splitter position and with the potential for increased iron recovery by screening the dry cobbing tailings that production increases of greater than the observed 3 percent will be realized.
