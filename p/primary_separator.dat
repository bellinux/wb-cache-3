50|$|Effective oil-gas {{separation}} {{is important not}} only {{to ensure that the}} required export quality is achieved but also to prevent problems in downstream process equipment and compressors. Once the bulk liquid has been knocked out, which can be achieved in many ways, the remaining liquid droplets are separated from by a demisting device. Until recently the main technologies used for this application were reverse-flow cyclones, mesh pads and vane packs. More recently new devices with higher gas-handling have been developed which have enabled potential reduction in the scrubber vessel size. There are several new concepts currently under development in which the fluids are degassed upstream of the <b>primary</b> <b>separator.</b> These systems are based on centrifugal and turbine technology and have additional advantages in that they are compact and motion insensitive, hence ideal for floating production facilities. Below are some {{of the ways in which}} oil is separated from gas in separators.|$|E

Simulation {{cases with}} 100 -percent and 50 -percent power levels were run, {{and the results}} were compared to tests that were performed in the facility in the early 1980 s. Because the main interest was in the functionality of the <b>primary</b> <b>separator,</b> the model includes no steam dryer assembly. The only heat structures built into the model were the primary-secondary heat transfer elements, since the model was run in a steady state and therefore the heat capacities of the structures had little effect on the results.

When the drain area was smaller, the separation levels were not achieved, but the system became more stable. iii CONTENT...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of offshore process equipment on floating production platforms {{may be reduced}} through imposed sea motion. Fluid sloshing inside <b>primary</b> <b>separators</b> and non-segregated storage tanks may lead to oil/water mixing. The aim of previous work into sloshing has been to prevent damage to LNG tankers and increase the stability of space rockets. Work into oil/water sloshing appears limited. A computer controlled motion simulator was developed to conduct experiments with two rectangular vessels filled with air, refined oil and water. Two single sinusoidal forcing motions were applied, pitch and surge at various amplitudes and periods. Additional experiments were conducted with combined forcing motions pitch/roll and pitch/surge. Air/water interface profiles were measured and analysed using a computer based data logging and processing system. Air/oil and oil/water profiles were recorded using high speed video equipment. Also studied were the effect of baffles in reducing interface amplitude {{and the effect of}} forcing on oil/water transfer. A linear theory was derived to predict natural frequencies of three fluid systems and a numerical model was developed to predict near resonant behaviour. Air/water experiments and numerical model showed a coupling of natural and forcing frequencies in the free surface frequency spectrum. Favourable comparisons were also seen between the numerical model and oil/water experiments. Additional experiments indicated that oil/water mixing is promoted by resonant forcing in an unbaffled vessel. The presence of baffles reduces interfacial breakup and hence reduces oil content of water. SERCThe Marine Technology DirectorateBritoi...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} in any gravity separator to provide uniform flow conditions between the inlet and the outlets. In this study, two-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling was used to reveal the problems of a conventional <b>primary</b> gravity <b>separator</b> at the bulk liquid flow zone particularly. Internal device {{in the form of}} simple perforated baffle was incorporated to the separator and its effect on improving the uniformity of flow was investigated. A CFD commercial package, ANSYS was used as the simulation tool. The modelling effort concentrated on the inlet and momentum breaker zone and the bulk liquid flow zone. The problem was first simulated in its simplest form, leaving out baffle in order to understand its underlying transport phenomena. The observed results were then discussed and interpreted according to the law of physics. After the fundamental model was successfully developed, it facilitated the optimisation of hole spacing and diameter of a baffle on a separator’s performance. Derived Standard Deviation (SD) for the horizontal velocity along the locations at specific position was used as an indicator to the uniformity of flow and the relative severity of recirculation...|$|R

The main aim of the DAF experiments reported here was to measure the oil droplet removal efficiency, (η) mostly in the range 15 - 80 μm from oil-in-water mixtures. The DAF tank used in this investigation was a scale model of real DAF unit. Two kinds of oil, vegetable and mineral and two types of water, fresh and salty were used, and four other operating parameters were varied. A droplet counting and oil-in-water measuring methods were used to estimate the η. Dimensional analysis concluded that the η in this experiment is a function of eight other dimensionless groups and the experimental data has been subjected to multivariable linear regression. The resulting correlation was found to have a root mean square error of 6. 0 %, but predict η outside the range zero and one. An alternative mathematical formulation was devised that cannot predict η outside the range. Regression of the data by this formulation, which had the same number of adjustable parameters as the linear regression, was successful with a lower root mean square error of 5. 5 %...|$|R

They correlated the dew point pressure of a gas condensate fluid directly with its reservoir temperature, pseudo-reduced pressure and temperature, <b>primary</b> <b>separator</b> gas–oil ratio, the <b>primary</b> <b>separator</b> pressure and temperature, and relative densities of separator gas and heptanes plus specific gravity. The average error for this model was 4.33 %. Ovalle et al. (2005) used readily available field data to calculate the dew point pressure. Their database contained 615 points. Their model is based on initial producing gas condensate ratio from the first-stage separator, initial API of the stock tank liquid, specific gravity of the initial reservoir gas, and reservoir temperature. Nonparametric approaches for estimating optimal transformations of data were used to obtain the maximum correlation between observed variables. Al-Dhamen and Al-Marhoun (2011) developed a new model to predict dew point pressure for gas condensate reservoirs, using nonparametric approaches and artificial neural networks.

40|$|Abstract. Characteristics of rock populations on the {{surfaces}} of Mars and Venus {{can be derived from}} analyses of rock morphology and morphometry data. We present measurements of rock sizes and sphericifies made from Viking lander images using an interactive digital image display system. The rocks considered are in the gravel size range (16 - 256 mm in diameter). Mean sphericities, form ratios, and roundness factors a e found to be very similar for both Viking lander sites. Size distributions, however, demonstrate differences between the sites; there are significantly more cobble size fragments at VL- 2 than at VL- 1. A model calling for aphanitic basalts emplaced as ejecta or lava flows at the Viking sites is supported by the rock shape, size, and roundness data. Morphologic features pertaining to the modification history of a rock are considered for Mars and Venus. A multi-parameter clustering algorithm is utilized to bjectively categorize martian and venusian rocks in terms of various criteria. Erosional markings such asflutes are demonstrated to be most important in separating VL- 1 rock morphologic groups, while rock form (i. e., shape) represents the <b>primary</b> <b>separator</b> of subpopulations at VL- 2 and the Venera landing sites. Fillets are common around VL- 1 and Venera 10 fragments. Obstacle scours occur frequently only at VL- 1. Cavities in rocks are ubiquitous at all lander sites except Venera 9.

40|$|Dissolved air {{flotation}} (DAF) is a separation technique, often used after a <b>primary</b> gravity <b>separator</b> {{to enhance the}} quality of the wastewater, so it can be released to streams, rivers, and the sea in a manner not to violate the environment. DAF works by removing oil droplets from oil-in-water mixtures by air bubbles of an average diameter of 50 μm {{with a standard deviation of}} 5. 5 μm. The air bubbles used in these experiments were generated as a result of rapid pressure reduction of water saturated with air when it released from the bottom of the DAF tank. The main aim of the DAF experiments reported here was to measure the removal efficiency of oil droplet mostly in a diameter range between 15 and 80 μm that were created using a static mixer. The DAF tank located at the University of Surrey was a scale model of existing DAF unit used by Thames Water plc. The effects of seven operating parameters that are believed to affect the performance of DAF were investigated. The operating parameters consist of inlet oil concentration, air saturator pressure, temperature, the salinity of continuous phase, type of oil, flow rate of the mixture and coagulant dosage. Two independent analysis methods were used to estimate the removal efficiency of oil droplet. They are a droplet counting and an oil-in-water measuring methods. The droplet counting method used a Coulter Counter that provided numbers of oil droplet passed through the aperture based on the selected size range. The oil-in-water measuring method used an ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), which the removal efficiencies were estimated from the absorbance values that were measured at the optimum wavelength of 400 nm. The analyses done with these two methods found that the inlet oil concentration and flow rate of the mixture into DAF tank were inversely proportional to the oil droplet removal efficiency. The other parameters such as saturator pressure, temperature, water salinity and alum dosage were directly proportional to the oil droplet removal efficiency. Vegetable oil, which has larger spreading coefficient than lamp oil obtained a better oil droplet removal efficiency. Coulter Counter showed that a better removal efficiency for vegetable oil obtained at larger oil droplet ranges size, 50 μm and above. This was because the oil droplets were removed by gravity and enhanced by air bubbles. Contrary to lamp oil, which the worst removal efficiency was obtained at larger size ranges due to the coalescence of oil droplets. Results from these experiments were used to obtain a correlation that can predict removal efficiency. This was done by performing dimensional analysis. It was carried out using Buckingham Pi and scaling methods. It involved with the identification of two non-dimension and nine dimensional parameters. The dimensional analysis concluded that the removal efficiency is a function of eight other dimensionless groups, which are ratio of inlet oil and mixture flow rat...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} and separation {{of oil and}} water is a vital process to the oil and chemical industries. Fluids exiting from oil wells usually consist of gas, oil and water and these three phases need to be transported and separated {{before they can be}} processed further. Operation of the primary separators has often proved to be problematic due to the change in composition of the fluids as the well matures, often accompanied by the build up of sand or asphaltenes. These vessels are very expensive to install so there is motivation to improve their design and performance. One major factor affecting separator performance is the phase distribution of the inlet flow, as reflected in the flow pattern and droplet size. In this work, flow pattern boundaries and drop sizes of liquid-liquid dispersions were measured for vertical and horizontal flow of a kerosene and water mixture in a 0. 063 m tube. Drop size was investigated by using two different laser optical techniques. A laser backscatter technique was employed for concentrated dispersions and a diffraction technique was used at low concentrations. In order to develop a greater understanding of separator performance, a 1 / 5 th-scale model was constructed of diameter 0. 6 m and length 205 m. Residence Time Distributions were obtained for a range of different internal configurations and flow rates using a colorimetric tracer technique. Flow rates of 1. 5 - 4 kg/s oil and 1 - 4 kg/s water were used and the vessel was equipped with a perforated flow-spreading baffle at the inlet and an overflow weir. Experiments were performed with no internals and with dip or side baffles. The side baffles acted to create quiescent zones within the vessel while the dip baffle caused a local acceleration of both phases. These situations are similar to those that can be caused by blocked internals or existing baffling or structured packing within field separators. A Residence Time Distribution model of a <b>primary</b> <b>separator,</b> the Alternative Path Model, was developed using transfer functions. This model has the ability to reproduce features of the experimental data by representing the flow as a series of continuous stirred tanks in series or in parallel. The model was used to develop parameters {{that could be used to}} obtain information about the performance of the separator. This model was also applied to Residence Time Distribution data obtained from field separators by BP Exploration, to relate features of the pilot scale separator to the field vessels...|$|E
