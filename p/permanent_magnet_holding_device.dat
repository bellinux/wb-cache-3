Instead of squeezing a friction disk, via springs, it uses <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> to attract a single face armature. When the brake is engaged, the <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets</b> create magnetic lines of flux, which can in turn attract the armature to the brake housing.

40|$|In this paper, the {{partitioned}} rotor flux switching <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> {{machine with}} ferrite <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> is proposed. By {{the adoption of}} the partitioned rotor configuration, the stator flux leakage is eliminated and the <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> utilization is improved. The ferrite <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> machine often suffers from irreversible demagnetization due to the inherent relatively low coercivity of ferrite <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet.</b> To mitigate the machine irreversible demagnetization risk, an improved partitioned rotor flux switching <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> machine with hybrid <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> topology is also proposed. Two little pieces of rare-earth <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> are installed at the corners of ferrite <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet,</b> thus forming the hybrid <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> topology.
