The driving force for these phenomena is the minimization of surface energy (nanoparticles {{have a large}} surface to volume ratio). This tendency to reduce surface energy in the system can be counteracted by adding species which will adsorb {{to the surface of}} the nanoparticles and lowers the activity of the particle surface thus preventing <b>particle</b> <b>agglomeration</b> according to the DLVO theory and preventing growth by occupying attachment sites for metal atoms. Chemical species that adsorb to the surface of nanoparticles are called ligands.

Surface conduction was also considered to investigate {{the effect of a}} thin surface layer on the rate of charge accumulation. However, in electrostatic applications, particles are typically stacked in an arbitrary array. In the investigated model, multiple spherical <b>particle</b> <b>agglomerations</b> with a 20 Å moisture layer, finite volume conductivity, surface conductivity and permittivity have been simulated. Upon exposure to the electric field, electric shielding can occur due to the proximity of other particles. This can greatly reduce the maximum accumulated charge for a shielded particle and affect the charging time. All results have been obtained using the COMSOL commercial software, based on the Finite Element Method. The simulation results show that shielding the electric field from a given particle reduced its saturation charge significantly. The results also show that the rate of charge accumulation was mainly affected by the particles’ volume and surface conductivities. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} was to determine the effect of binder characteristics (surface tension and polymer concentration), initial particle morphology (size, surface roughness and shape), and operating conditions (binder addition rate) on <b>particle</b> <b>agglomeration</b> and granule strength following the wet granulation process. The amperage curve was used to determine the parameters of <b>particle</b> <b>agglomeration</b> (phase time, phase volume and phase adhesion) and the mechanism of <b>particle</b> <b>agglomeration</b> through an indirect measurement of the adhesion force which develops during the wet agglomeration process. The granule strength was determined by a confined compression test, and the granule strength curve was used to analyze the <b>particle</b> <b>agglomeration</b> in conjunction with the amperage curve. Both the amperage curve and granule strength analysis indicated the involvement of capillary phenomena in <b>particle</b> <b>agglomeration</b> throughout the wet massing process. Surface tension was found to affect <b>particle</b> <b>agglomeration</b> and granule strength by affecting both the liquid requirement and the particle distance of the agglomerates. Different degrees of polymer concentration were all found to produce similar <b>particle</b> <b>agglomeration</b> in the wet massing stage, but had a significant effect on granule strength in the dried stage. Particle size showed a significant effect on <b>particle</b> <b>agglomeration</b> in the wetting and bridge formation stage and also on granule strength in dried stage. The increase of granule strength depends on particle size. Particle surface roughness showed a significant effect on <b>particle</b> <b>agglomeration</b> and granule strength and dominated the differences in the chemical nature, particle size and shape of the powders. Surface roughness needed to be smoothed out to increase the available particle-particle contact area before particle-liquid-particle interactions. Granule strength varied inversely with particle surface roughness. Particle shape showed different particle-particle interactions induced by capillary phenomena depending on the particle 2 ̆ 7 s geometric parameters. An asymmetrically-shaped particle with a smooth surface starts orderly packing earlier than an asymmetrically-shaped powder with a rough surface. ...|$|E
