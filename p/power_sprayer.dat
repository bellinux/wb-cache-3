He went with his son Musa from Tamil Nadu to New Delhi, doing an average of 60 to 70 km a day. Though its maximum speed is only 35 km/h, Ali Manikfan claims it’s far cheaper and efficient than a petrol-driven two-wheeler.|$|E
50|$|Current {{practices}} of managing olive peacock spot disease aim to have consistent suppression {{by keeping the}} levels of inoculum low and through preventative measures. This is {{because there is no}} way to treat this disease once it appears in the spring or while the trees have fruit. The most common management approach is to spray the foliage with a copper compound after the fruit has been harvested in the fall and again in the late winter if the environment is extremely wet. A <b>power</b> <b>sprayer</b> with high pressure is the most effective as it helps coat the entire surface of each leaf, even in the interior of the tree. If copper is sprayed onto the fruit it is nearly impossible to wash away, and so late harvests are often lost to infection. The spray comes in various forms of copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride, tribasic copper sulfate, and copper oxide. A few of these have been legally classified as organic.|$|E

The use of fungicides can be both economically and environmentally costly and should only be applied on susceptible varieties and large-scale corn production. In order to prevent fungal resistance to fungicides, all fungicides are to be used alternatively, switching fungicides with different modes of action. Pyraclostrobin (Headline EC) and azoxystrobin are Quinone outside Inhibitor (QoI) fungicides, whereas propiconazole and prothioconazole are DeMethylation Inhibitors (DMI) fungicides.|$|R

40|$|Foliar {{fertilizer}} application on sugarcane plantations using a knapsack sprayer was ineffective in spraying liquid foliar fertilizer evenly {{across the surface}} of the leaf. To improve its performance, a knapsack <b>power</b> <b>sprayer</b> was modified and tested, for a better comfort and effectiveness of the liquid foliar {{fertilizer application}}. The motor sprayer was modified by replacing its big fluid tank with a smaller fluid tank of the manual sprayer. The nozzle pipe was modified in such a way to be used in spraying two rows of sugarcane in one pass. The modified motor sprayers were tested in sugarcane plantation for applying the foliar fertilizer. The test results showed that the motor sprayers could spray the fluid fertilizer in more effective and uniform spraying than that of the manual sprayer. Spraying using high pressure of the motor sprayer could spray the foliar fertilizer to the leaf surface uniformly. The droplet size was more tiny, and could reach the entire leaf of the sugarcane. The operators like to use the modified motor sprayer. The average working capacity of the <b>power</b> <b>sprayer</b> was 0. 4 ha/ hour per man...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of a single residual spraying of pyrethroids on the occurrence and abundance of Triatoma infestans in peridomestic ecotopes in rural La Rioja. Methods A total of 667 (32. 8 %) peridomestic sites positive for T. infestans in May 1999 were randomly assigned to treatment within each village, sprayed in December 1999, and reinspected in December 2000. Treatments included 2. 5 % suspension concentrate (SC) deltamethrin in water at 25 mg active ingredient (a. i.) /m 2 applied with: (a) manual compression sprayers (standard treatment) or (b) power sprayers; (c) 1. 5 % emulsifiable concentrate (EC) deltamethrin at 25 mg a. i. /m 2; and (d) 10 % EC cis-permethrin at 170 mg a. i. /m 2. EC pyrethroids were diluted in soybean oil and applied with <b>power</b> <b>sprayers.</b> All habitations were sprayed with the standard treatment. Findings The prevalence of T. infestans 1 -year post-spraying was significantly lower in sites treated with SC deltamethrin applied with manual (24 %) or <b>power</b> <b>sprayers</b> (31 %) than in sites treated with EC deltamethrin (40 %) or EC permethrin (53 %). The relative odds of infestation and catch of T. infestans 1 -year post-spraying significantly increased with the use of EC pyrethroids, the abundance of bugs per site before spraying, total surface, and host numbers. All insecticides had poor residual effects on wooden posts. Conclusion Most of the infestations probably originated from triatomines that survived exposure to insecticides at each site. Despite the standard treatment proving to be the most effective, the current tactics and procedures fail to eliminate peridomestic population...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} human energy expenditure, heart rate, field capacity and operating cost in oil palm plantation at Pembangunan Pertanian Melaka SDN. BHD. Based on recorded increasing of average of heart rate, conventional knapsack sprayer {{was found to be}} most strenuous operation, with an increasing of average of hemi rate of 28. 13 beats /min. There were significant differences in the increasing of average of heart rates of batteries operated knapsack sprayer and tractor mounted sprayer (<b>power</b> <b>sprayer)</b> with the increasing of average of heart rates for these two field operations being 14. 63 and 17. 83 beats /min, respectively. There highest average of energy expenditure of 6. 90 kcal/ min was observed for conventional knapsack sprayer and the lowest average of energy expenditure of 3. 80 Kcal/ min was for tractor mounted sprayer. The highest field capacity was recorded for tractor mounted sprayer (<b>Power</b> <b>Sprayer)</b> was about 6. 77 acre per hour; while the lowest was recorded for conventional knapsack sprayer (manual) was about 1. 40 acre per hour. The results indicate that the average increasing of heart rate Beats / Min was positively linked to the human energy expenditure Kcal/ Min of the subjects, while the human energy expenditure Kcal / Min was negatively linked to the field capacity. In the operation cost, it indicate that the tractor mounted sprayer was highest that estimated of total operation cost was about RM 52. 621 hour, while the lowest was conventional knapsack sprayer (manual) that estimated to be RM 9. 08 /hour. This study demonstrated that usage of farm machinery for field operations was significantly different in human energy expenditure, field capacity, heart rate and operation cost...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{the design}} and {{implementation}} of multiple power supplied fertilizer sprayer has been presented. The proposed system is the modified model of the two stroke petrol engine powered sprayer which minimizes the difficulties of the existing <b>power</b> <b>sprayer</b> such as operating cost, changing of fuel etc. The two stroke petrol engine {{has been replaced by}} a direct current motor and operated by the electrical energy stored in the battery attached to the unit. The battery can be charged by solar panel during the presence of sun. It could also be operated on direct current during rainy and cloudy weather conditions. This system can be used for spraying pesticides, fungicides, fertilizers and paints. The proposed system has been tested and compared with theoretical values of current and charging time. From the results it is found that the time taken to charge the full battery of capacity 12 V, 7 Ah has required 16. 67 hours. The fully charged battery could be used to spray 575 liters pesticides. Which is approximately covers 5 - 6 acres of land. It is also found that, if we charge the battery for a day, then it covers approximately 200 liters of pesticides which in turn covers 2 to 2. 5 acres of land. The developed systems initial cost is little more as compared to conventional sprayer but the running cost of the system is all most zero in other words minimum...|$|E
