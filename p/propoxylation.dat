40|$|Abstract In this research, new general {{processes}} of alkoxylation (ethoxylation and <b>propoxylation)</b> {{have been developed}} for converting polycarbonates (PC) into bis-phenol A (BPA) based diols for use in PU production. Improvements in alkoxylation of phenol and BPA were accomplished in the initial stage of our study by using ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate as the key reagents. Under the influence of sodium carbonate as the base catalyst at 170 ℃, high yields of mono-ethoxylated or propoxylated alcohol products for each phenol group were achieved. Further extension of similar alkoxylation chemistries, we could add urea directly into solution of phenols / BPAs to obtain the desired hydroxyl deriveatives. In this convient alkoxylation process, zinc oxide was found to be the suitable catalyst. The yield and selectivity of these urea-based alkoxylation were accomplished in the excess of 90 %. Different alkoxylation diols of BPA were synthesized from PC by our new alkoxylation process. They were used as raw materials in preparation of PU by an one-shot process. Now, we were able to produced high molecular weight PU with recycled diols. 摘要 在本研究中，我們發展出以乙烯醚化及丙烯醚化法[(ethoxylation and propoxylation); 總稱烯醚化(alkoxylation) ]轉換聚碳酸酯(PC) 成為BPA衍生的二元醇類，並且將其應用於聚胺酯(PU) 的製作。 在最初階段，我們改進了以乙基碳酸酯或丙基碳酸酯作為酚與BPA乙烯醚化法的關鍵試劑，當在溫度 170 ℃下，以及碳酸鈉(Na 2 CO 3) 為觸媒的影響下，可以得到酚團基上，以各接一個EO / PO單位取代的醇類。另外， 將烯醚化法更進一步的延伸，我們以尿素直接加入消化PC尚含EG/PG的反應溶液去得到醇類的產物，而ZnO為製備碳酸酯的適合觸媒，可獲得產率與選擇率大於 90 %的烯醚化產物。 新的烯醚化法可以從改質PC合成出的不同種類的BPA二元醇，這些二元醇類可被當作以一步驟法製備PU的原料，至目前為止，我們可以應用回收的二元醇製作出高分子量的PU。主目錄 摘要……………………………………………………………………………………I Abstract ………………………………………………………………………………II 主目錄………………………………………………………………………………III 圖目錄………………………………………………………………………………VI 表目錄……………………………………………………………………………VIII 第一章	序論………………………………………………………………………… 1 第二章	文獻回顧…………………………………………………………………… 5 2. 1 	 EO/PO乙烯醚化及丙烯醚化之應用………………………………………… 5 2. 2 	 合成alkylene carbonate的相關文獻………………………………………… 6 2. 3 	 聚碳酸酯與乙二醇的相關反應……………………………………………… 8 2. 4 	 BPA與乙基碳酸酯及丙基碳酸酯的相關反應……………………………… 10 2. 5 	 Polycarbonate光碟片的回收及應用……………………………………… 12 第三章	實驗內容………………………………………………………………… 15 3. 1 	實驗目的……………………………………………………………………… 15 3. 2 	實驗大綱……………………………………………………………………… 16 3. 3 	實驗藥品與儀器……………………………………………………………… 16 3. 3. 1 	合成化合物所用試藥……………………………………………… 16 3. 3. 2 	催化劑……………………………………………………………… 19 3. 3. 3 	其他試劑…………………………………………………………… 19 3. 3. 4 	實驗儀器…………………………………………………………… 20 3. 4 	第一部分：酚及BPA之乙烯醚化及丙烯醚化(Ethoxylation and <b>Propoxylation</b> of phenol/BPA) ……………………………………………………………………… 22 3. 4. 1 	乙烯醚化 (Ethxoylation) ……………………………………………… 22 3. 4. 1. 1 	酚的乙烯醚化 (Ethoxylation of Phenol) ……………………………… 22 3. 4. 1. 1. 1 	實驗步驟……………………………………………………… 22 3. 4. 1. 1. 2 	實驗結果……………………………………………………… 23 3. 4. 1. 1. 3 	實驗結果討論………………………………………………… 24 3. 4. 1. 2 	BPA的乙烯醚化 (Ethoxylation of BPA) …………………………… 24 3. 4. 1. 2. 1 	實驗步驟…………………………………………………… 25 3. 4. 1. 2. 2 	實驗結果…………………………………………………… 26 3. 4. 1. 2. 3 	實驗結果討論………………………………………………… 26 3. 4. 2 	丙烯醚化 (<b>Propoxylation)</b> ……………………………………………… 27 3. 4. 2. 1 	酚的丙烯醚化 (<b>Propoxylation</b> of Phenol) …………………………… 27 3. 4. 2. 2. 1 	實驗步驟…………………………………………………… 27 3. 4. 2. 2. 2 	實驗結果…………………………………………………… 28 3. 4. 2. 2. 3 	實驗結果討論………………………………………………… 29 3. 4. 2. 2 	BPA的丙烯醚化 (<b>Propoxylation</b> of BPA) …………………………… 30 3. 4. 2. 2. 1 	實驗步驟…………………………………………………… 30 3. 4. 2. 2. 2 	實驗結果…………………………………………………… 31 3. 4. 2. 2. 3 	實驗結果討論………………………………………………… 31 3. 5 	第二部分: 一步驟使聚碳酸酯廢料轉變成二元醇類 (Converting Waste Polycarbonate Into Diols by One-Step Method) …………………………………… 32 3. 5. 1 	分析方法:OH價測試方法……………………………………………… 32 3. 5. 1. 1 	實驗步驟……………………………………………………… 33 3. 5. 2 	以尿素和二醇類使聚碳酸酯轉變成二元醇之流程圖………………… 34 3. 5. 2. 1 	PC之乙烯醚化 (Ethoxylation of Polycarbonate) ；製作二元醇BHE-BPA…………………………………………………………………………… 35 3. 5. 2. 5. 1 	實驗步驟……………………………………………………… 35 3. 5. 2. 5. 2 	實驗結果……………………………………………………… 36 3. 5. 2. 5. 3 	實驗結果討論………………………………………………… 38 3. 5. 2. 2 	廢棄PC光碟之乙烯醚化 (Ethoxylation of Waste CD);製作二元醇Recycled BHE-BPA………………………………………………………………… 39 3. 5. 2. 5. 1 	實驗步驟……………………………………………………… 39 3. 5. 2. 5. 2 	實驗結果……………………………………………………… 41 3. 5. 2. 5. 3 	實驗結果討論………………………………………………… 42 3. 5. 2. 3 	PC之丙烯醚化 (<b>Propoxylation</b> of Polycarbonate) ；製作二元醇BHP-BPA…………………………………………………………………………… 44 3. 5. 2. 5. 1 	實驗步驟……………………………………………………… 44 3. 5. 2. 5. 2 	實驗結果……………………………………………………… 45 3. 5. 2. 5. 3 	實驗結果討論………………………………………………… 46 3. 5. 2. 4 	廢棄PC光碟的丙烯醚化 (<b>Propoxylation</b> of Waste CD) ；製作二元醇Recycled BHP-BPA………………………………………………………………… 47 3. 5. 2. 5. 1 	實驗步驟……………………………………………………… 47 3. 5. 2. 5. 2 	實驗結果……………………………………………………… 48 3. 5. 2. 5. 3 	實驗結果討論………………………………………………… 49 3. 5. 2. 5 	回收的BHP-BPA之鏈延長反應(End Capping Reaction of Recycled BHP-BPA) ；製作二元醇End-capping of Recycled BHP-BPA…………………… 50 3. 5. 2. 5. 1 	實驗步驟……………………………………………………… 50 3. 5. 2. 5. 2 	實驗結果……………………………………………………… 51 3. 5. 2. 5. 3 	實驗結果討論………………………………………………… 51 3. 6 	第三部份：應用回收之二元醇作為合成PU所需的原料 (Raw Materials for Synthesizing PU Based On Recycled Diols) ……………………………………… 53 3. 6. 1 	回收二元醇 (Recycled BHE-BPA，Recycled BHP-BPA與Endcapping of Recycled BHP-BPA) 在PU之製作………………………………………………… 53 3. 6. 1. 1 	從乙烯醚化/丙烯醚化PC回收之二元醇來合成PU (Synthesis of PU with Rrecycled Diols From Ethoxylation / <b>Propoxylation</b> of PC) ……………………… 53 3. 6. 1. 1. 1 	實驗步驟……………………………………………………… 53 3. 6. 1. 1. 2 	實驗結果……………………………………………………… 55 3. 6. 1. 1. 3 	實驗結果討論………………………………………………… 56 第四章	總結……………………………………………………………………… 58 參考文獻…………………………………………………………………………… 61 圖目錄 圖 3 -

40|$|Fluorocarbons {{which are}} less {{damaging}} to atmospheric ozone levels have recently become available on an industrial scale.

The equilibrium vapour pressures at 25 degrees C over the refrigerants R 22, R 124, R 142 b and R 134 a in propoxylated polyols, polyamines and polycarboxylates at 19 % and 20 % w(F) /w(S) have been measured.

For instance, phenol, bisphenol A (BPA), hydroquinone and resorcinol were converted into their respective mono-alkoxylated ether alcohols on each of their phenolic groups in 80 - 95 % isolated yields In <b>propoxylation</b> of phenols, this approach shows great product selectivity favoring production of high secondary alcohols over primary alcohols in isomeric ratios of nearing 95 / 5. Since ammonia (NH(3)) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) evolving from the reaction can be re-combined in theory into urea for re-use, the overall net-alkoxylation by this approach can be regarded as a simple condensation reaction of phenols with 1, 2 -glycols giving off water as its by-product This one-pot process is simple, safe and environmentally friendlier than the conventional alkoxylated processes based on ethylene oxide (EO) or propylene oxide (PO) Moreover, this process is particularly well-suited for making short chain-length alkoxyether alcohols of phenols...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{bio-based}} compounds containing phenols {{suitable for}} the syn­thesis of polyurethanes were prepared. The direct alkylation of phenols with different vegetable oils {{in the presence of}} superacids (HBF 4, triflic acid) as ca­talysts was studied. The reaction kinetics was followed by monitoring the de­crease of the double bond content (iodine value) with time. In order to under­stand the mechanism of the reaction, phenol was alkylated with model com­pounds. The model compounds containing one internal double bond were 9 -oc­tadecene and methyl oleate and those with three double bonds were triolein and high oleic safflower oil (82 % oleic acid). It was shown that the best structures for phenol alkylation are fatty acids with only one double bond (oleic acid). Fatty acids with two double bonds (linoleic acid) and three double bonds (lino­lenic acid) lead to polymerized oils by a Diels–Alder reaction, {{and to a lesser extent}} to phenol alkylated products. The reaction product of direct alkylation of phenol with vegetable oils is a complex mixture of phenol alkylated with poly­merized oil (30 – 60 %), phenyl esters formed by transesterification of phenol with triglyceride ester bonds (< 10 %) and unreacted oil (30 %).

40|$|In this research, we {{utilized}} bisphenol A (BPA), {{a low-cost}} commodity product, as the common starting material {{to develop new}} synthetic schemes for preparation of difunctional speciality intermediates for performance polymers, such as alkoxylated ether diols, isopropylidene bis-phenylene di-alkyl biscarbamates, 2, 2 -bis(4 -isocyanatophenyl) propane, 2, 2 -bis(4 -aminophenyl) propane, indane-ring bisphenols and dual functional hydroquinones. Some {{of them have been}} demonstrated in the synthesis of specialty polymers. First of all, a one-pot epoxide-free alkoxylation process has been developed for phenolic compounds particularly for diols of BPA. The process involves heating phenolic compounds and urea in 1, 2 -glycols using Na 2 CO 3 /ZnO as co-catalysts. This process is particularly well-suited for making short chain-length alkoxyether alcohols of phenols. For instance, BPA was converted into their respective mono-alkoxylated ether alcohols on each of their phenolic groups in 80 - 95 % isolated yields. In <b>propoxylation</b> of phenols, this approach shows great product selectivity favoring production of high secondary alcohols over primary alcohols in isomeric ratios of nearing 95 / 5. Since ammonia and carbon dioxide could be recycled back to urea for re-use, this alkoxylation can be regarded simply as a condensation reaction between phenols and 1, 2 -glycols giving off water as the only overall by-product. This one-pot process is simple, safe and environmentally friendlier than the conventional alkoxylated processes based on ethylene oxide (EO) or propylene oxide (PO). Secondly, through the experiments on BPA's cleavage by an acid-catalyzed condition, it was found that 4 -IPP carbocation can be readily generated by addition of BPA in concentrated sulfuric acid at ambient temperature so that it shows the facility and stability of the IPP carbocation in the acid-cleavage of BPA. For an extended utilization of the carbocation's mechanism, a trans-alkylation reaction has been developed for rapid synthesis of isopropylidene bis-phenylene biscarbamate 12 by adding mono-carbamates in the first step and followed by removal of the replaced phenol under reduced pressure. By this simple process, biscarbamate 12 a with isopropylidene bis-phenylene structure can be prepared in about 80 % yields. Furthermore, the biscarbamate was utilized as the precursor to prepare diisocyanate 13 a and dianiline 14 a by thermolysis and hydrolysis, respectively. In addition, these isopropylidene bis-phenylene intermediates could be served as the raw materials to carry out a non-phosgene route to prepare isocyanate or relative polymers. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} stable 4 -IPP carbocation could be also used for facile synthesis of 4 -IPP, 4 -IPP dimers, or indane-ring bisphenol derivatives specifically by choosing acid media of different acid-strength. Lastly, we have carried out a three-step synthetic approach of using 4 -IPP as the raw material for preparation of dual functional hydroquinone intermediates in the following three sequential steps: (1) functionalization of the hydroxyl group of IPP first, (2) oxidation of isopropenyl group of IPP derivatives from the first step with hydrogen peroxide, and (3) functionalization of the new hydroxyl group with another derivative from step two. This general strategy is new and can make varieties of hydroquinone derivatives in precision for the first time. Due to the reactivity differences between two functional groups, the synthesized hydroquinone intermediates are particular attractive for the use in iterative or prepolymer synthesis In summary, in this research, it was found that BPA could be utilized as an important raw material for synthesizing polymer intermediates especially those with isopropylidene bis-phenylene and hydroquinone skeletons which are not readily accessible by any known synthetic methodologies.

40|$|In this research, two green {{chemical}} processes for synthesizing intermediates for polyurethane-urea {{have been developed}} successfully. Firstly, environmental friendly processes of non-phosgene approach to two 4, 4 '-methylene diphenylcarbamates and isocyanate-free routes based on these intermediates to urea-prepolymers and polyureas have been devised. Secondly, one-pot reaction process with digestion and alkoxylation of the polycarbonate wastes conversion into bishydroxyalky ethers of bisphenol A for use as polyurethane raw materials also have been developed. In the part one of my study, I worked out a practical synthesis of amine-terminated urea prepolymers and polyureas through the amination of dimethyl 4, 4 '-methylene diphenylcarbamate (4, 4 '-DM-MDC) and diphenyl 4, 4 '-methylene diphenylcarbamate (4, 4 '-DP-MDC) in a novel non-phosgene route. The preparation of 4, 4 '-DM-MDC was achieved by condensation of methyl N-phenylcarbamate with formaldehyde using concentrated hydrochloric acid as a promotor in a methanol solution at 30 oC. Under these conditions, the result has improved to a 91 % conversion based on methyl N-phenylcarbamate with the selectivity of 2, 4 '-DM-MDC at 2 % and 4, 4 '-DM-MDC at 91 %. On the other hand, we performed a carbonylation of 4, 4 '-methylenedianiline (4, 4 '-MDA) with diphenyl carbonate with pivalic acid at 80 oC as the catalyst to achieve the highest yield of 94 % for 4, 4 '-DP-MDC. Amination of 4, 4 '-DM-MDC with high boiling-point polyetherdiamines resulted in rapid removal of methanol at around 160 oC to produce amine terminated urea-prepolymers which by reaction with a diisocyanate such as diphenylene diisocyanate (MDI), formed polyureas. This approach however, failed to give high molecular weight polyureas directly when equal moles of short-chained diamines and 4, 4 '-DM-MDC were mixed in a one-pot reaction process. On the other hand, amination of 4, 4 '-DP-MDC {{was found to be}} more efficient than those of 4, 4 '-DM-MDC, and could be used for both polyureas and a hydroxyl terminated urea-prepolymer synthesis. The preparation of hydroxyl terminated urea-prepolymer, like 4, 4 '-diphenylmethanebis-[(2 -hydroxyethyl) urea] for instance, can be prepared in high yield of 97 % in minutes, from amination of 4, 4 '-DP-MDC and ethanol amine. More conveniently, a one-pot amination of 4, 4 '-DP-MDC with a diamine or mixed diamines was also found to be an excellent method for the preparation of high molecular weight polyureas. Thus, the amination approach using 4, 4 '-DP-MDC as the key intermediate provides a general and excellent green chemistry route for introducing methylene diphenylene units into urea-prepolymers and polyurea elastomers without using phosgene or diphenylmethane diisocyanate in the overall process An efficient process of the chemical recycling of polycarbonate (PC) waste into diols of bis-phenol A (BPA) for use as raw materials in PU production also has been developed. This is another development of green process of making PU intermediates through waste materials. Digestion of PC waste in alkylene glycols, i. e., ethylene glycol (EG) and propylene glycol (PG), with catalytic amount of sodium carbonate at 180 oC under normal atmosphere pressure afforded partial alkoxylation products of BPA. This initial product mixture was found to be consisting of BPA (28 %) and monohydroxyethyl ether (MHE-BPA, 40 %) and bishydroxyethyl ether of bisphenol A (BHE-BPA, 25 %) when digested in EG solution. Whereas, in PG digestion solution, the corressponding digestion products consist of monohydroxyproply ether of BPA (MHP-BPA, 53 %) and bishydroxypropyl ether of BPA (BHP-BPA, 21 %) with the rest being un-propoxylated BPA (26 %). When these digested solutions were further treated with molar excess of urea with a catalytic amount of zinc oxide at 180 oC, BHE from EG or BHP-BPA from PG was produced in high yields. In both digestion processes, cyclic alkylene carbonates, i. e. ethylene carbonate (EC) or propylene carbonate (PPC), were observed as the transient intermediates which eventually disappears during the prolonged alkoxylation conditions. ZnO was added to the second step as the catalyst to accelerate urea's trans-esterification process. Both BHE and BHP products have been successfully utilized in making PU polymers of good mechanical properties. This chemical approach thus provides a viable alternative for PC recycling.
