25|$|Kawasaki disease often {{begins with}} a high and <b>persistent</b> <b>fever</b> that is not very {{responsive}} to normal treatment with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. It is the most prominent symptom in Kawasaki disease, is a characteristic sign of the acute phase of the disease, is normally high (above 39–40°C), is remittent, and is followed by extreme irritability. Recently, it {{is reported to be}} present in patients with atypical or incomplete Kawasaki disease; nevertheless, it is not present in 100% of cases. The first day of fever is considered the first day of illness, and the duration of fever is on average one to two weeks; in the absence of treatment, it may extend for three to four weeks. Prolonged fever is associated with higher incidence of cardiac involvement. It responds partially to antipyretic drugs and does not cease with the introduction of antibiotics. However, when appropriate therapy is started– intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin– the fever is gone after two days.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, several {{workers on}} Laysan {{contracted}} a feverish illness previously unknown there or anywhere else. It affected workers on Laysan in {{varying levels of}} severity: one woman was evacuated for <b>persistent</b> <b>fever,</b> but others exhibited very mild symptoms. Cedric Yoshimoto, of the University of Hawaii at Mānoa School of Public Health, wrote that [...] "surveillance has identified a newly-described illness of humans termed 'Laysan fever (LF)' It is associated with bites of the seabird tick Ornithodoros capensis... joins {{a short list of}} human illnesses associated with seabird colonies..." [...] The symptoms of Q fever overlap significantly with those of Laysan fever, and scientists have speculated as to their possible common causes.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) {{is a rare}} {{haematological}} {{disorder in}} children. However, this is probably an underestimation due to the difficulty in diagnosing the disease. HLH is characterized clinically by <b>persistent</b> <b>fevers,</b> organomegaly, cytopaenias and typical biochemical derangements viz. hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperferritinaemia and hypofibrinogenaemia. Other associated findings include decreased natural killer cell (NKC) function and raised soluble CD 25. The exact pathophysiology of HLH is not completely understood but involves a trigger (often an infection) which sets off an uncontrolled inflammatory cascade, characterized {{by an increase in}} hyperactivated macrophages and T lymphocytes which leads to increased production of cytokines, alongside reduced cellular cytotoxicity as a result of reduced or absent NKC function...|$|R

40|$|Human granulocytic {{anaplasmosis}} (HGA) is a tick-borne {{disease that}} can often result in <b>persistent</b> <b>fevers</b> and other non-specific symptoms including myalgias, headache, and malaise. The incidence among en-demic areas has been increasing, and clinician recognition of disease symptoms has aided {{in the correct}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} patients who have been exposed. While there have been few cases reported of HGA disease during pregnancy, all patients have undergone a rela-tively mild disease course without complications. HGA may cause more severe disease in the elderly and immunocompromised. Herein, we report an unusual presentation and severe disease complications of HGA in a pregnant female who was concomitantly immunocompro-mised due to azathioprine treatment of her Crohn’s disease. Follow-ing successful treatment with rifampin, she subsequently delivered a healthy female infant without any disease sequelae...|$|R

40|$|Cat scratch {{disease has}} been {{reported}} very rarely in cardiac transplant recipients. In a review of 1073 episodes of infection in 620 heart transplant patients over a 16 year period, only one case of infection secondary to Bartonella henselae was documented. Another case of hepatosplenic bacillary angiomatosis from B. henselae was reported 2 decades ago in a heart transplant recipient who had presented with fevers of unknown origin. Although the typical clinical manifestation {{is that of a}} skin lesion accompanied with lymphadenopathy, cat scratch disease may present with <b>persistent</b> <b>fevers</b> without a clinically overt infective focus in immunosuppressed individuals. Moreover, more than one disease process may coexist in immunocompromised hosts. While the lymphadenopathy in our patient was secondary to Cat scratch disease, interestingly, the adjacent skin lesion that was thought to represent unhealed site of inoculation of Bartonella was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma...|$|R
50|$|Many {{risk factors}} {{predicting}} coronary artery aneurysms have been identified, including <b>persistent</b> <b>fever</b> after IVIG therapy, low hemoglobin concentrations, low albumin concentrations, high white-blood-cell count, high band count, high CRP concentrations, male sex, and age {{less than one}} year.Coronary artery lesions resulting from Kawasaki disease change dynamically with time. Resolution {{one to two years}} after the onset of the disease has been observed in half of vessels with coronary aneurysms. Narrowing of the coronary artery, which occurs {{as a result of the}} healing process of the vessel wall, often leads to significant obstruction of the blood vessel and lead to the heart not receiving enough blood and oxygen. This can eventually lead to heart muscle tissue death (myocardial infarction).|$|E

Unfortunately he had to suspend his studies again and moved to his father in Dinajpur owing to <b>persistent</b> <b>fever.</b> Back in Krishnagar in 1886, he met Rabindranath Tagore, a friend of Ashutosh Chaudhuri, his elder brother, just returned from England. Later Ashutosh inspired his younger brother to learn French and Chaudhuri became an ardent student of French Literature and also obtained an absorbing interest in Pre-Raphaelite poets. Returning to Kolkata in 1887, he passes the Arts examination from St. Xavier's College, Calcutta with second division marks.|$|E
50|$|Septic pelvic {{thrombophlebitis}} (SPT) is a postpartum complication {{which consists}} of a <b>persistent</b> postpartum <b>fever</b> that is not responsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics in which pelvic infection leads to infection of the vein wall and intimal damage leading to thrombogenesis in the ovarian arteries (left or right). The thrombus is then invaded by microorganisms. Ascending infections cause 99% of postpartum SPT.|$|R
40|$|Juvenile polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare, necrotizing vasculitis, {{primarily}} affecting {{small to}} medium-sized muscular arteries. Cardiac involvement amongst patients with PAN is uncommon and reports of coronary artery aneurysms in juvenile PAN are exceedingly rare. We describe a 16 year old girl who presented with fever, arthritis and two giant coronary artery aneurysms, initially diagnosed as atypical Kawasaki disease and treated with IVIG and methylprednisolone. Her <b>persistent</b> <b>fevers,</b> arthritis, myalgias were refractory to treatment, and onset of a vasculitic rash suggested an alternative diagnosis. Based on angiographic abnormalities, polymyalgia, hypertension and skin involvement, this patient met criteria for juvenile PAN. She {{was treated with}} six months of intravenous cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids for presumed PAN related coronary vasculitis. Maintenance therapy was continued with azathioprine and the patient currently remains without evidence of active vasculitis. She remains on anticoagulation for persistence of the aneurysms.

40|$|Malignant peritoneal {{mesothelioma}} (MPM) {{is a rare}} tumor that develops in the peritoneum. In this paper, we describe an extremely rare case of MPM metastasizing to the appendix in a 48 -year-old female who initially presented with a <b>persistent</b> high <b>fever.</b> The woman reported a slight lower abdominal discomfort which had been relieved by urination for four months. She had lost 5 kg of weight. There was no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or abdominal distension. Many broad spectrum antibiotics were given without relief of fever. Computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a thickened omentum majus and diffused multiple omental nodules. An omentectomy, appendectomy, and adnexectomy were carried out. A gross pathologic specimen of omentum tissue revealed a firm gray-white mass. Microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations confirmed the diagnosis of appendiceal and bilateral adnexal metastases of an MPM. These results suggest that MPM {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of unexplained <b>persistent</b> high <b>fever.</b> Awareness of such atypical presentations of mesothelioma may help to make a correct diagnosis...|$|R
