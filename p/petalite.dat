50|$|Bikita is a {{district}} in the Masvingo Province of Zimbabwe. It is located about 80 km east of Masvingo.

50|$|One of the world's most {{significant}} and richest sources of caesium is the Tanco Mine at Bernic Lake in Manitoba, Canada, estimated to contain 350,000 {{metric tons of}} pollucite ore, representing {{more than two-thirds of}} the world's reserve base.

5000|$|Due to {{its large}} ionic radius, caesium {{is one of}} the [...] "incompatible elements". During magma crystallization, caesium is {{concentrated}} in the liquid phase and crystallizes last. Therefore, the largest deposits of caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process. Because caesium does not substitute for potassium as readily as rubidium, the alkali evaporite minerals sylvite (KCl) and carnallite (...) may contain only 0.002% caesium. Consequently, Cs is found in few minerals. Percentage amounts of caesium may be found in beryl (...) and avogadrite (...) , up to 15 wt% Cs2O in the closely related mineral pezzottaite (Cs(Be2Li)Al2Si6O18), up to 8.4 wt% Cs2O in the rare mineral londonite (...) , and less in the more widespread rhodizite. The only economically important ore for caesium is pollucite , which is found in a few places around the world in zoned pegmatites, associated with the more commercially important lithium minerals, lepidolite and <b>petalite.</b> Within the pegmatites, the large grain size and the strong separation of the minerals results in high-grade ore for mining.|$|E

40|$|The {{petrography}} and mineralogy of some Hercynian albite-pegmatites near Doade, Galicia, Spain is described.

40|$|The co-occurrence, at {{the thin}} section scale, {{of the three}} {{anhydrous}} Li-aluminosilicates spodumene, <b>petalite</b> and eucryptite, is not a common feature. Such an association occurs in some aplite–pegmatite dykes of the Covas de Barroso district, northern Portugal. We describe their mutual relationships: where spodumene is an early magmatic phase, <b>petalite</b> precipitates directly from a late orthomagmatic fluid, the spodumene remaining metastably, whereas eucryptite is obviously hydrothermal and secondary. Replacement of the primary Li-minerals is the rule, but is diversified and selective: spodumene is mainly replaced by albite and muscovite, <b>petalite</b> by K-feldspar and eucryptite. Muscovite is widespread, and the late hydrothermal paragenesis is dominated by quartz associated with various mixtures of phosphates. The assemblage eucryptite, K-feldspar and albite is obviously in chemical disequilibrium with the early phases. The compositional evolution of the hydrothermal fluids (Na, K, Li) is tentatively bracketed. There is disequilibrium among thermodynamically conflicting mineral phases in terms of pressure, temperature and fluid:rock ratio, in a mobile and partly open system. A genetic affiliation of the Li-enriched pegmatites with the nearby two-mica granites is difficult to prove. The tectonically controled intrusion of biotite granites {{to the east of}} the pegmatite belt would seem to be responsible of the drop in pressure that accounts for the spodumene–petalite transition and the development of the wide-spread replacement by feldspars, not present {{in the western part of}} the belt...|$|E

40|$|Rare-element pegmatites may host several {{economic}} commodities, such as tantalum (Ta-oxide minerals), tin (cassiterite), lithium (ceramic-grade spodumene and <b>petalite),</b> and cesium (pollucite). Key geological {{features that}} are common to pegmatites in the Superior province of Ontario and Manitoba, Canada, and in other large tantalum deposits worldwide, {{can be used in}} exploration. An exploration project for rare-element pegmatites should begin with an examination of a regional geology map. Rare-element pegmatites occur along large regional-scale faults in greenschist and amphibolite facies metamorphic terranes. They are typically hosted by mafic metavolcanic or metasedimentary rocks, and are located near peraluminous granite plutons (A/CNK > 1. 0).

The demand for lithium and lithium compounds to be used in lithium-ion batteries is increasing day by day. Zimbabwe possesses a considerable resource of lithium ore, estimated at 23 000 mt Li. Beneficiation of this lithium ore could indeed be a very promising business in the near future. This work focuses on processing of <b>petalite</b> concentrate from the Bikita deposit in Zimbabwe for production of Li 2 CO 3, with subsequent preparation of LiF and LiCl. Analysis performed on the <b>petalite</b> showed that the average Li 2 O content is 4. 10 %. The extraction method used involves roasting the pre-heated concentrate with concentrated H 2 SO 4 followed by water leaching of the resulting Li 2 SO 4, solution purification and precipitation of Li 2 CO 3 with subsequent preparation of LiF and LiCl. Investigation of the roasting and leaching showed that the dissolution rates are significantly influenced by roasting temperature and stirring speed. 97. 3 % optimum rate of extraction was attained at 320 rpm and roasting temperature of 300 C. Water-washed lithium carbonate with a purity of 99. 21 %(metal basis) and an average particle size of 1. 4 ìm was produced. Good quality LiF and LiCl can be produced with purity of 99. 36 % and 99. 02 % respectively. The pH, concentration and agitation have a great influence on the morphology of the precipitated LiF. Lower pH values and optimum concentration of the Li 2 CO 3 solution results in smaller particle size. High recovery of 96. 53 % LiF was realised. Anhydrous LiCl was found to absorb moisture when exposed to air at ambient temperature.
