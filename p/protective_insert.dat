50|$|Ceramics such as alumina and {{boron carbide}} {{have been used}} in {{ballistic}} armored vests to repel large-caliber rifle fire. Such plates are known commonly as small arms <b>protective</b> <b>inserts,</b> or SAPIs. Similar material is used to protect the cockpits of some military airplanes, because of the low weight of the material.|$|R
50|$|The US Army {{has adopted}} Interceptor body armour, which uses Enhanced Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Inserts</b> (E-S.A.P.I) in the chest, sides {{and back of}} the armour. Each plate is rated to stop a range of {{ammunition}} including 3 hits from a 7.62×51 NATO AP round at a range of 10 m. Dragon Skin body armour is another ballistic vest which is currently in testing with mixed results.|$|R

5000|$|The {{crystallization}} vessels {{used are}} autoclaves. These are usually thick-walled steel cylinders with a hermetic seal which must withstand high temperatures and pressures for prolonged periods of time. Furthermore, the autoclave material must be inert {{with respect to}} the solvent. The closure is the most important element of the autoclave. Many designs have been developed for seals, the most famous being the Bridgman seal. In most cases, steel-corroding solutions are used in hydrothermal experiments. To prevent corrosion of the internal cavity of the autoclave, <b>protective</b> <b>inserts</b> are generally used. These may have the same shape as the autoclave and fit in the internal cavity (contact-type insert), or be a [...] "floating" [...] type insert which occupies only part of the autoclave interior. Inserts may be made of carbon-free iron, copper, silver, gold, platinum, titanium, glass (or quartz), or Teflon, depending on the temperature and solution used.|$|R
5000|$|The US Department of Defense uses {{two classes}} of {{protection}} from armor-piercing rifle bullets. The first, the Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Insert</b> (SAPI), called for ceramic composite plates with a mass of 20-30 kg/m2 (4-5 lb/ft2). Later, the Enhanced SAPI (ESAPI) specification was developed to protect from more penetrative ammunition. ESAPI ceramic plates have a density of 35-45 kg/m2 (7-9 lb/ft2), and are designed to stop bullets like the [...]30-06 AP (M2) with an engineered hard core.|$|E
5000|$|The Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Insert</b> (SAPI) is {{a ceramic}} trauma plate {{used by the}} United States Armed Forces. It was first used in the Interceptor body armor, a {{ballistic}} vest. It is now also used in the Improved Outer Tactical Vest {{as well as the}} Modular Tactical Vest, in addition to commercially available [...] "plate carriers". The Kevlar Interceptor vest itself is designed to stop projectiles up to and including 9×19mm Parabellum submachine gun rounds, in addition to fragmentation. To protect against higher-velocity rifle rounds, SAPI plates are needed.|$|E
50|$|The Interceptor {{body armor}} system {{consists}} of an Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and two Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Insert</b> (SAPI) ballistic plates. The OTV features a carrier shell, and three main ballistic panel inserts (left and right side panels, and a rear back panel), which are made with a finely woven Kevlar KM2 fiber. These {{two parts of the}} vest are both bullet and heat resistant. The soft ballistic panels are produced in five different sizes (S-XXL), which are installed into their respective pocket on the OTV carrier shell.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{increased}} dangers of improvised explosive devices, newer versions of the vital plates and components have been developed. The Enhanced Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Inserts</b> (ESAPIs) and Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBIs) have become available, along with the Deltoid and Axillary Protector System (DAPS). These new systems are becoming the standard for forward deployed troops. The E-SAPI plates offer increased protection from 7.62mm armor-piercing ammunition. The ESBIs is an attachable MOLLE ballistic panel with a pouch for a 8x6 side-SAPI, for protection {{of the side of}} the torso/under the arm. DAPS consists of two ambidextrous modular components, the Deltoid (upper arm) Protector and the Axillary (under arm) Protector, and provide for additional protection from fragmentary and projectiles to the upper arm and underarm areas. With the Interceptor body armor, E-SAPI plates (10.9 pounds), ESBIs (7.75 pounds), DAPS (5.03 pounds) and with the neck, throat and groin protectors installed the armor is significantly heavier at 33.1 pounds (15 kg).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to producing ceramic components for industrial {{processes such as}} silicon foundries and ceramic fuel pellets for nuclear reactors, Ceradyne researched and produced varieties of ballistic armour for both personnel and vehicles. The ceramic armor was lighter than regular steel plate armor facilitating greater mobility. In September 16, 2007 the company was selling 25,000 sets of armor a month to the Pentagon.In December 2007, Ceradyne's lightweight armor {{was approved by the}} Army for use on military vehicles. Oshkosh Truck produced the first of these armored vehicles using the armor on HEMETT crew cabs.Ceradyne was also the producer of ceramic Enhanced Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Inserts</b> (E-SAPI) for the US Army's Interceptor body armor, and the blast-proof components of the Ceradyne BULL MRAP/MMPV vehicle project.In January 2008, the company also received an order for $9.6 million worth of body armor from UNICOR (Federal Prison Industries Inc.), which provided jobs and job training to inmates in US federal prisons.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It {{is known}} that {{crustaceans}} and insects can persistently carry one or more viral pathogens at low levels, without signs of disease. They may transmit them to their offspring or to naïve individuals, often with lethal consequences. The underlying molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated, but {{the process has been}} called viral accommodation. Since tolerance to one virus does not confer tolerance to another, tolerance is pathogen-specific, so the requirement for a specific pathogen response mechanism (memory) was included in the original viral accommodation concept. Later, it was hypothesized that specific responses were based on the presence of viruses in persistent infections. However, recent developments suggest that specific responses may be based on viral sequences inserted into the host genome. Presentation of the hypothesis Non-retroviral fragments of both RNA and DNA viruses have been found in insect and crustacean genomes. In addition, reverse-transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) sequences are also common in their genomes. It is hypothesized that shrimp and other arthropods use these RT to recognize "foreign" mRNA of both RNA and DNA viruses and use the integrases (IN) to randomly insert short cDNA sequences into their genomes. By chance, some of these sequences result in production of immunospecific RNA (imRNA) capable of stimulating RNAi that suppresses viral propagation. Individuals with <b>protective</b> <b>inserts</b> would pass these on to the next generation, together with similar <b>protective</b> <b>inserts</b> for other viruses that could be amalgamated rapidly in individual offspring by random assortment of chromosomes. The most successful individuals would be environmentally selected from billions of offspring. Conclusion This hypothesis for immunity based on an imRNA generation mechanism fits with the general principle of invertebrate immunity based on a non-host, "pattern recognition" process. If proven correct, understanding the process would allow directed preparation of vaccines for selection of crustacean and insect lines applicable in commercial production species (e. g., shrimp and bees) or in control of insect-borne diseases. Arising from a natural host mechanism, the resulting animals would not be artificially, genetically modified (GMO). Reviewers This article was reviewed by Akria Shibuya, Eugene V. Koonin and L. Aravind. </p...|$|R
50|$|Newer armor {{issued by}} the United States armed forces to large numbers of troops {{includes}} the United States Army's Improved Outer Tactical Vest and the United States Marine Corps Modular Tactical Vest. All of these systems are designed with the vest intended to provide protection from fragments and pistol rounds. Hard ceramic plates, such as the Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Insert,</b> as used with Interceptor Body Armor, are worn to protect the vital organs from higher level threats. These threats mostly {{take the form of}} high velocity and armor-piercing rifle rounds. Similar types of protective equipment have been adopted by modern armed forces over the world.|$|E
50|$|The Tactical Vest Antenna System is {{designed}} to be concealed within Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Insert</b> pouches found on contemporary body armor such as Interceptor body armor, Modular Tactical Vest, Full Spectrum Battle Equipment, and virtually any other type of body armor that utilizes SAPI or ESAPI plates. The radiating elements' placement is barely noticeable due to their thinness, approximately 1/8 in and their curved shape that lies flush against the shape of ESAPI plates. Hiding away the radiating elements brings more mobility to the operator when compared to whip antennas traditionally used military. TVAS is compatible with MBITR, PRC-152, and other common radios used by the U.S. Military.|$|E
5000|$|The Modular Tactical Vest (in short: MTV or MoTaV) is a {{ballistic}} vest originally {{adopted by the}} United States Marine Corps in 2006. The MTV {{was designed as a}} solution to shortcomings in the current, decade-old interceptor body armor (IBA) and was selected after a rigorous proposal and examination process by the Marine Corps. The MTV provides better protection levels than the IBA, although it uses the same Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Insert</b> (SAPI) plates. The MTV weighs three more than the IBA, but is designed to more effectively distribute its weight throughout the wearer's torso. The Navy also ordered 28,000 MTVs in August 2008.|$|E
5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with <b>protective</b> amulets <b>inserted</b> between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.|$|R
5000|$|Tanker {{boots are}} {{normally}} equipped with steel toe guards, steel or plastic shank/heel guards, and {{in at least}} modern variants, steel or other <b>protective</b> metal <b>inserts</b> in portions of the sole as well, as befit a boot intended for an operating environment filled with potentially injurious hazards, {{as opposed to the}} traditional combat boot designed for a sandy or muddy battlefield environment. When the desert tanker boots came out, it was not authorized to have steel toe inserts for fear that the crewman may have his toe cut off if too much weight was put on the boot.|$|R
40|$|IF 2. 759 International audiencePrevious {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} the efficacy of a two-stage surgical procedure - the induced membrane (IM) technique - for reconstruction of large bone defects or bone non-union. The first stage involves radical debridement and insertion of a cement spacer into the bone defect. The second stage, performed weeks to months later, consists of removing the spacer while leaving the foreign body membrane induced by the cement in place, and then filling the cavity with bone autograft. The IM {{has been shown to}} (1) act as a protective physical barrier by preventing bone autograft resorption and (2) act as a bioreactor by promoting healing through revascularisation and growth factor secretion, and by concentrating mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with osteogenic properties. New solutions to reduce this surgical procedure to a single step are being explored, for example by using an IM-like bioactive and <b>protective</b> barrier <b>inserted</b> into the bone defect {{at the same time as}} bone graft...|$|R
50|$|E-SAPI (Enhanced Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Insert)</b> {{plates and}} their smaller {{counterparts}} E-SBI (Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts) plates, are ceramic trauma plates {{that provide the}} bulk of the protection against projectiles when carried in an Improved Outer Tactical Vest, and are also used as part of many other body armors such as the Modular Tactical Vest. E-SAPI plates are designed to cover the vital front and back torso areas of the torso, while E-SBI plates are designed to protect the sides of the torso. The plate component itself is made of boron carbide, a widely used and extremely hard boron-carbon ceramic. Backing the plate is a layer of Spectra, a woven polymer material with extremely high tensile strength meant to stop any projectile that manages to pass through the ceramic strikeface.|$|E
5000|$|CIRAS (Combat Integrated Releasable Armor System) is a modular {{protective}} vest designed for US Special Operations Forces by Eagle Industries. The vest features PALS webbing, making it MOLLE compatible {{and allowing the}} attachment of various pouches or accessories. Two versions of the vest are available known as the [...] "Land" [...] and the [...] "Maritime" [...] versions. The vest consists of front and rear panels with pockets for BALCS or SPEAR cut soft armor panels and standard issue SAPI (Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Insert)</b> plates. This gives the wearer up to NIJ Level IV protection on front and back and Level IIIA protection on the sides. On the lower rear side of {{the front of the}} vest there are two quick-releasable buckles for attaching groin protection. The wearer's sides are covered by an external cummerbund which is also covered with PALS webbing. The vest body is constructed of 1000 Denier Cordura Nylon and the interior is lined with heavy duty mesh to aid in cooling the wearer.|$|E
5000|$|The Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Insert</b> (SAPI) and the {{enhanced}} SAPI plate for the US DOD generally has this form. [...] Because {{of the use}} of ceramic plates for rifle protection, these vests are 5-8 times as heavy on an area basis as handgun protection. The weight and stiffness of rifle armor is a major technical challenge. The density, hardness and impact toughness are among the materials properties that are balanced to design these systems. While ceramic materials have some outstanding properties for ballistics they have poor fracture toughness. Failure of ceramic plates by cracking must also be controlled. [...] For this reason many ceramic rifle plates are a composite. The strike face is ceramic with the backface formed of laminated fiber and resin materials. The hardness of the ceramic prevents the penetration of the bullet while the tensile strength of the fiber backing helps prevent tensile failure. Examples of rifle resistant outer vests include the Interceptor body armor and the Improved Outer Tactical Vest.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} provide {{protection}} against high velocity bullets, the PASGT vest was, in 1996, combined with the Interim Small Arms Protective Overvest (ISAPO) pending the adoption of Interceptor body armor. The ISAPO weighed about 16.5 lb and consisted of a carrier to hold two <b>protective</b> ceramic plate <b>inserts.</b> A PASGT armor system with overvest weighed more than 25 lb and was criticized by many U.S. troops as unacceptably cumbersome in combat. The ballistic fill consists of 13 plies of 14 oz. water repellent treated Aramid (Kevlar 29) fabric. The inner and outer cover, shoulder pads and front closure flap of the vest are water repellent treated 8 oz. ballistic nylon cloth.|$|R
60|$|Uncle John {{had secured}} {{considerable}} information from Mr. Watson, and this {{enabled him to}} act comprehensively. The advertising sign business {{in this part of}} the state was controlled by two firms, who contracted directly with the advertisers and then had the signs painted upon spaces secured from the farmers by their wide-awake agents. These signs were contracted for by the year, but the firms controlling the spaces always <b>inserted</b> <b>protective</b> clauses that provided for the removal of any sign when certain conditions required such removal. In such cases a rebate was allowed to the advertiser. This protective clause was absolutely necessary in case of fire, alteration or removal of buildings or destruction of fences and sign-boards by weather or the requirements of the owners. It was this saving clause in the contracts of which Uncle John had decided to take advantage. The contracting sign painters were merely in the business to make money.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Higher closure {{rates of}} the open abdomen have been {{reported}} with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) than with other wound management techniques. However, the method has occasionally been associated with increased development of fistulae. We have previously shown that NPWT induces ischemia in the underlying small intestines close to the vacuum source, and that a protective disc placed between the intestines and the vacuum source prevents the induction of ischemia. In the present study we compare macroscopic changes after 12, 24, and 48 hours, using conventional NPWT and NPWT with a protective disc between the intestines and the vacuum source. Methods Twelve pigs underwent midline incision.

50|$|Hours {{before the}} Marines were ambushed, they {{had set out}} on a rainy morning in a convoy in Laghman Province. It was May 8, 2005, the third day of a week-long patrol called Operation Tar Heels. The platoon of 30 men, {{commanded}} by Marine Lieutenant Samuel Monte, had driven as far as it could before the road ended, compelling the Marines to dismount and walk along a valley trail that led to several remote villages. The men had left their bulky flak vests at their patrol base and wore only their SAPI (Small Arms <b>Protective</b> <b>Insert),</b> two-inch-thick bulletproof plates that fit in a vest-so they would have a lighter load when hiking in the mountains. Without full body armor, they could move faster in case of coming into contact with the Taliban, who did not wear any body armor. The goal of the operation was to meet with tribal leaders to find out what help they needed, like medical kits or veterinary visits. The Marines were also hoping to obtain information about the drug lords and militiants who were freely operating and living in the area.|$|E
5000|$|A cycling pad, {{also known}} as [...] "chamois" [...] or [...] "bikepad" [...] or [...] "Fondello" [...] (Italian), [...] "Gamuza" [...] or [...] "Badana" [...] (Spanish), Peau (French) is a <b>protective</b> <b>insert</b> that is applied in cycling shorts with {{the main purpose of}} {{protecting}} the groin from the friction of constant and prolonged saddle contact. Cycling pads were developed {{at the beginning of the}} 1900s and were exclusively made of deer leather up until the 1980s, when technical fabrics were introduced, and allowed for enhanced performance. The first high-tech thermo molded cycling pads date back to the early 1990s; gel inserts also make their first appearance and are used in addition to polyurethane foams for extra comfort. It is only in the year 2000 that the chamois is produced with an elastic technology, which allows the pad to move with the cyclist's body. This technology acts as an elastic interface between the cyclist's body and the saddle, and it is these very few square inches that are vertically subject to body weight and pressure. For this reason it is essential for a cycling pad to be capable of protecting the body from the compression the body exerts in contact with the saddle and from chafing in the inner leg area, that is due to the thousands of pedal strokes and revolutions that a cyclist carries out during a normal workout.|$|E

40|$|Coordination among {{protective}} devices in distribution systems {{will be affected}} by adding distributed generators (DGs) to the existing network. That is attributed to the changes in power flow directions and fault currents magnitudes and directions due to the insertion of DG units in the distribution system, which may cause mis-coordination between protection devices. This paper presents an approach to overcome the impacts of DG units insertion on the protection system and to avoid the mis-coordination problem. The proposed approach depends on activating the directional protection feature which is available in most types of modern microprocessor-based reclosers. This will be accompanied by an updating of relays and reclosers settings to achieve the correct coordination. It's clear that this approach do not need any extra costs or any extra equipment to be installed in the distribution system. An existing 11 kV feeder, simulated on ETAP package, is used to prove the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results ensure the possibility of achieving the proper coordination between <b>protective</b> devices after <b>inserting</b> DG units if the proper and suitable settings of these devices are realized...|$|R
40|$|Lentiviruses {{provide a}} {{suitable}} {{starting point for}} the generation of viral vectors for vaccination due to their ability to transduce non-dividing cells, including dendritic cells. This allows the delivery of antigens directly to antigen presenting cells to stimulate an immune response. The most well developed and characterised lentiviral vector is based on HIV- 1 which now incorporates safety features to minimise the effects of hazards such as insertional oncogenesis. These HIV- 1 vectors have been shown to mediate immunity against several pathogens including: Plasmodium falciparum, the Influenza Virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mouse models. Our group has applied the advances in the HIV- 1 system to the visna maedi virus in order to engineer vaccines suitable for sheep. The vaccines will initially be targeted against the sheep pathogens: Teladorsagia circumcinta and Louping Ill Virus; these pathogens have been chosen as current control strategies are insufficient. In this project, antigens previously identified to provide <b>protective</b> immunity, were <b>inserted</b> into the vector cassette of the visna maedi virus system. Expression of these antigens was then shown in a mammalian system by using plasmids to transfect cells in vitro. Vectors encoding these antigens were used to assay expression in cell culture after infection; however, significant expression of antigens was not induced by these vectors. Further development of the vector cassettes is required before they are suitable to be vaccine candidates; however their ability to induce expression of antigens in mammalian cells provides a good basis for future work...|$|R
