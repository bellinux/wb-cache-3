25|$|The Phoenician abjad was {{a radical}} {{simplification}} of <b>phonetic</b> <b>writing,</b> since hieroglyphics required the writer {{to pick a}} hieroglyph starting with the same sound that the writer wanted to write in order to write phonetically, much as man'yougana (Chinese characters, or kanji, used solely for phonetic use) was used to represent Japanese phonetically before the invention of kana.|$|E
25|$|The ALUPEC is a <b>phonetic</b> <b>writing</b> {{system based}} on the Latin script and states only which letters {{should be used to}} {{represent}} each sound. The system does not establish rules for spelling (orthography). For that reason, Cape Verdean creole writing is not standardized; the same word or the same sentence may appear written in different ways. Cape Verdeans, then, write idiosyncratically — that is, each person writes {{in his or her own}} dialect, sociolect, and idiolect.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{creation}} of Hangul, people in Korea (known as Joseon at the time) primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside native <b>phonetic</b> <b>writing</b> systems that predate Hangul by hundreds of years, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. However, due to the fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and {{the large number of}} characters needed to be learned, there was much difficulty in learning how to write using Chinese characters for the lower classes, who often didn't have the privilege of education. To assuage this problem, King Sejong created the unique alphabet known as Hangul to promote literacy among the common people.|$|E
25|$|Shaw {{had served}} from 1926 to 1939 on the BBC's Advisory Committee on Spoken English, which {{included}} several exponents of <b>phonetic</b> <b>writing.</b> He also knew Henry Sweet, creator of Current Shorthand (and a prototype {{for the character}} of Henry Higgins), although Shaw himself used the shorthand system of Isaac Pitman. All of his interest in spelling and alphabet reform was made clear in Shaw's will of June 1950, in which provision was made for (Isaac) James Pitman, with a grant in aid from the Public Trustee, to establish a Shaw Alphabet. Following Shaw's death in November 1950, and after some legal dispute, the Trustee announced a worldwide competition to design such an alphabet, {{with the aim of}} producing a system which would be an economical way of writing and of printing the English language.|$|E
25|$|As active {{knowledge}} of the hieroglyphs and the related scripts disappeared, numerous {{attempts were made to}} decipher the hidden meaning of the ubiquitous inscriptions. The best known examples from Antiquity are the Hieroglyphica (dating to about the 5th century) by Horapollo, which offers an explanation of almost 200 glyphs. Horapollo seems to have had access to some genuine knowledge about the hieroglyphs, as some words are identified correctly, although the explanations given are invariably wrong (the goose character used to write the word for 'son', zꜣ, for example, is identified correctly, but explained wrongly to have been chosen because the goose loves his offspring the most while the real reason seems to have been purely phonetic). The Hieroglyphica thus represent the start of more than a millennium of (mis)interpreting the hieroglyphs as symbolic rather than <b>phonetic</b> <b>writing.</b>|$|E

60|$|Such is a {{brief history}} of the rise and {{progress}} of the art of writing in the States of Greece. Whether the phonetic principle which Cadmus introduced was brought originally from Egypt, or from the countries on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean sea, can not now be ascertained. It has generally been supposed among mankind, at least until within a recent period, that the art of <b>phonetic</b> <b>writing</b> did not originate in Egypt, for the inscriptions on all the ancient monuments in that country are of such a character that it has always been supposed that they were symbolical characters altogether, and that no traces of any <b>phonetic</b> <b>writing</b> existed in that land. Within the present century, however, the discovery has been made that a large portion of these hieroglyphics are phonetic in their character; and that the learned world in attempting for so many centuries, in vain, to affix symbolical meanings to them, had been altogether upon the wrong track. The delineations, though they consist almost wholly of the forms of plants and animals, and of other natural and artificial objects, are not symbolical representations of ideas, but letters, representing sounds and words. They are thus precisely similar, in principle, to the letters of Cadmus, though wholly different from them in form.|$|E

60|$|Speaking historically, {{there is}} nothing {{peculiar}} in the Chinese method of writing, which represents a stage through which all writing probably passed. Writing everywhere seems to have begun as pictures, not as a symbolic representation of sounds. I understand that in Egyptian hieroglyphics the course of development from ideograms to <b>phonetic</b> <b>writing</b> can be studied. What is peculiar in China is {{the preservation of the}} ideographic system throughout thousands of years of advanced civilization--a preservation probably due, at least in part, {{to the fact that the}} spoken language is monosyllabic, uninflected and full of homonyms.|$|E

40|$|This event-related {{functional}} MRI {{study examined}} the neural correlates for Chinese writing, by comparing the writing of logographic characters and that of pinyin, a phonetic notation system for Chinese characters.
