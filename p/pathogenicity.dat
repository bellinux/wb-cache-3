5|$|Study of the H. pylori genome is {{centered}} on attempts to understand pathogenesis, the ability of this organism to cause disease. About 29% of the loci have acolonization defectwhen mutated. Two of sequenced strains have an around 40-kb-long Cag <b>pathogenicity</b> island (a common gene sequence believed responsible for pathogenesis) that contains over 40 genes. This <b>pathogenicity</b> island is usually absent from H. pylori strains isolated from humans who are carriers of H. pylori but remain asymptomatic.|$|E
5|$|An RNA {{thermometer}} (or RNA thermosensor) is a temperature-sensitive non-coding RNA molecule which regulates gene expression. RNA thermometers often regulate genes required during {{either a}} heat shock or cold shock response, {{but have been}} implicated in other regulatory roles such as in <b>pathogenicity</b> and starvation.|$|E
5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans {{has been linked}} to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their <b>pathogenicity</b> or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Various immunoassays for T. cruzi are {{available}} {{and can be used}} to distinguish among strains (zymodemes of T.cruzi with divergent <b>pathogenicities).</b> These tests include: detecting complement fixation, indirect hemagglutination, indirect fluorescence assays, radioimmunoassays, and ELISA. Alternatively, diagnosis and strain identification can be made using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).|$|R

Here we report four genome sequences, {{those of the}} virulent strain B. melitensis M 28 - 12 and vaccine strains B. melitensis M 5 and M 111 and B. suis S 2, which show different virulences and <b>pathogenicities,</b> which will help to design a more effective brucellosis vaccine...|$|R
5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, <b>pathogenicity,</b> competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Mascarene martins will mob the Mauritius kestrel, {{suggesting}} that it {{is perceived as a}} potential predator. Martins on Mauritius may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the <b>pathogenicity</b> is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the martin on Mauritius, although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen. A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was first found on a martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the feather mite Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E
5|$|No predators or parasites are {{recorded}} for Brazza's martin, but Mascarene martins will mob the Mauritius kestrel, {{suggesting that it}} {{is perceived as a}} potential predator. Mascarene martins may host a variety of parasites. On Mauritius they may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the <b>pathogenicity</b> is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the Mascarene martin on Mauritius, although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen.

40|$|Phytophthora capsici Leonian is {{the causal}} agent of foot rot disease of black pepper (Piper nigrum L.). Foot rot disease {{is the most}} {{destructive}} disease which can cause significant economic losses of black pepper. Two mating types of P. capsici were found in black pepper plantations in Lampung. This research was aimed at examining the effects of temperature, light, and polycarbonate membrane on oospore formation. Also the effect of light on germination and determining both mating types of 30 randomly selected progenies. The results showed thatoospores were produced through either hyphal contact or without any contact. Oospores were produced abundantly on V 8 agar in the dark at 16 - 24 Â°C. Oospores germinated after 3 -weeks incubation in the dark followed by 1 -week incubation under TL fluorescent light. All progeny were heterothallic, and consisted of 16 isolates of A 1 mating type and 14 isolates of A 2 mating type. There was no correlation between mating type categories and their <b>pathogenicities</b> on black pepper leaves. Twenty-six progeny isolates may infect unwounded pepper leaves, whereas another four isolates may only infect wounded pepper leaves. <b>Pathogenicities</b> of all progenies were {{lower than those of}} their parents...|$|R
40|$|Egg drop {{syndrome}} virus (EDSV) can markedly decrease {{egg production}} in laying hens. Duck {{is the natural}} host of EDSV. EDSV derived from ducks abrogate egg drop in laying hens. We have previously confirmed that duck-derived EDSVs {{have a variety of}} replication activities in chick embryo liver (CEL) cells. However, it is currently unclear whether duck-derived EDSV could display tropism and adaptation in laying hens. This study assessed whether duck-derived EDSV can adapt to laying hens, and estimated the inducing factors. Complete genome sequences of duck-derived EDSVs (D 11 -JW- 012, D 11 -JW- 017, and D 11 -JW- 032 isolates) with various replication efficiency in CEL cells and C 10 -GY- 001 isolate causing disease in laying hens were analyzed to find their differences. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequence revealed that C 10 -GY- 001, D 11 -JW- 032, and strain 127 virus as vaccine were clustered into the same group, with D 11 -JW- 012 and D 11 -JW- 017 clustered in another group. Comparison between D 11 -JW- 012 isolate that poorly replicated and D 11 -JW- 017 isolate that replicated well in CEL cells in same cluster revealed six amino acid differences on IVa 2, DNA polymerase, endopeptidase, and DNA-binding protein. These amino acids might be key candidates enhancing cellular tropism in chicken. When the <b>pathogenicities</b> of these isolates in laying hens were compared, D 11 -JW- 032 showed severe signs similar to 127 virus, D 11 -JW- 017 showed intermediate signs, while D 11 -JW- 012 showed almost no sign. Eleven amino acids differed between D 11 -JW- 032 and D 11 -JW- 017, and 17 amino acids were different between D 11 -JW- 032 and D 11 -JW- 012. These results suggest that EDSVs derived from ducks have various <b>pathogenicities</b> in laying hens. Key amino acid candidates might have altered their affinity to tropism of laying hens, causing difference <b>pathogenicities...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of single-enzyme amplified-fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) {{analysis for the}} subtyping of Mycobacterium kansasii type I isolates was evaluated. This simplified technique classified 253 type I strains into 12 distinct clusters. The discriminating power of this technique was high, and the technique easily distinguished between the epidemiologically unrelated control strains and our clinical isolates. Overall, the technique was relatively rapid and technically simple, yet it gave reproducible and discriminatory results. This technique provides a powerful typing tool which may be helpful in solving many questions concerning the reservoirs, <b>pathogenicities,</b> and modes of transmission of these isolates...|$|R
5|$|The cagA gene {{codes for}} one of the major H. pylori {{virulence}} proteins. Bacterial strains with the cagA gene are associated with an ability to cause ulcers. The cagA gene codes for a relatively long (1186-amino acid) protein. The cag <b>pathogenicity</b> island (PAI) has about 30 genes, part of which code for a complex type IV secretion system. The low GC-content of the cag PAI relative {{to the rest of the}} Helicobacter genome suggests the island was acquired by horizontal transfer from another bacterial species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pathogenicity</b> of prions and {{proteins}} with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of amyloid fibrils. The presence of amyloid fibrils in patients with degenerative diseases has been well documented. These amyloid fibrils are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between amyloid and degenerative diseases, the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the overproduction of amyloid in familial cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic.|$|E
5|$|Unlike normal mice, {{transgenic}} poliovirus receptor (TgPVR) mice {{are susceptible}} to poliovirus injected intravenously or intramuscularly, and when injected directly into the spinal cord or the brain. Upon infection, TgPVR mice show signs of paralysis that resemble those of poliomyelitis in humans and monkeys, and the central nervous systems of paralyzed mice are histocytochemically {{similar to those of}} humans and monkeys. This mouse model of human poliovirus infection has proven to be an invaluable tool in understanding poliovirus biology and <b>pathogenicity.</b>|$|E
40|$|Wando' pea is {{susceptible}} to Ditylenchus dipsaci from Raleigh, N. C. (RNC) but resistant to the same species from Waynesville, N. C. (WNC). Homogenates of RNC and WNC were analyzed for pectolytic and cellulolytic enzyme activity; both had high Cx activity with WNC {{two to three times}} more active than RNC. Polymethylglacturonase activity was three to five times higher in RNC, but polygalacturonase was up to 100 times higher in WNC. Polygalacturonate-trans-eliminase was not detected although a Ca++-stimulated pectin methyl-trans-eliminase was present. Enzyme analyses of healthy and infected pea tissue showed only slight enzyme activity unrelated to that in nematode homogenates. No correlation between enzyme activity and the differing <b>pathogenicities</b> could be detected...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the molecular basis of virulence of pandemic H 1 N 1 / 09 influenza viruses by reverse genetics {{based on two}} H 1 N 1 / 09 virus isolates (A/California/ 04 / 2009 [CA 04] and A/swine/Shandong/ 731 / 2009 [SD 731]) with contrasting <b>pathogenicities</b> in mice. We found that four amino acid mutations (P 224 S in the PA protein [PA-P 224 S], PB 2 -T 588 I, NA-V 106 I, and NS 1 -I 123 V) contributed to the lethal phenotype of SD 731. In particular, the PA-P 224 S mutation when combined with PA-A 70 V in CA 04 drastically reduced the virus's 50 % mouse lethal dose (LD 50), by almost 1, 000 -fold...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pathogenicities</b> of the murine AIDS (MAIDS) virus complex (LP-BM 5) and ecotropic {{helper virus}} (BM 5 eco) {{isolated}} from the complex to BALB/c nude mice were studied to elucidate the possible role of replication-competent helper virus in inducing the monoclonal outgrowth of lymphoid cells. Neither LP-BM 5 nor BM 5 eco was pathogenic in adult BALB/c nude mice. However, B-cell lymphoma developed with a very high frequency when either virus was inoculated into newborn BALB/c nude (nu/nu) mice. The cells from the B-cell lymphoma were easily transplanted into nude mice. These results suggested that ecotropic helper virus in the MAIDS virus complex {{plays an important role}} in inducing the monoclonal outgrowth of lymphoid cells under immunodeficient conditions caused by defective virus...|$|R
5|$|Armillaria luteobubalina {{was first}} {{described}} in 1978, {{after having been}} discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive <b>pathogenicity.</b> It may take years for infected trees {{to show signs of}} disease, leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence. Studies show that the spread of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control the spread of disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. Phylogenetic analyses have determined that A.luteobubalina is closely related to A.montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A.paulensis. The distribution of A.luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Sharma et al. {{presented}} a comprehensive analysis of transcription at single-nucleotide resolution by differential RNA-seq that confirmed the known acid induction of major virulence loci, {{such as the}} urease (ure) operon or the cag <b>pathogenicity</b> island (see below). More importantly, this study identified a total of 1,907 transcriptional start sites, 337 primary operons, and 126 additional suboperons, and 66 monocistrons. Until 2010, only about 55 transcriptional start sites (TSSs) were known in this species. Notably, 27% of the primary TSSs are also antisense TSSs, indicating thatâsimilar to E. coliâantisense transcription occurs across the entire H. pylori genome. At least one antisense TSS is associated with about 46% of all open reading frames, including many housekeeping genes. Most (about 50%) of the 5' UTRs are 20â40 nucleotides (nt) in length and support the AAGGag motif located about 6 nt (median distance) upstream of start codons as the consensus ShineâDalgarno sequence in H. pylori.|$|E
5|$|Several parasites {{have been}} {{isolated}} from the hartebeest. These parasites regularly alternate between hartebeest and gazelles or wildebeest. Hartebeest can be infected with theileriosis due to Rhipicephalus evertsi and Theileria species. South of the Sahara, common parasites include Loewioestrus variolosus, Gedoelstia cristata and G. hassleri. The latter two species can cause serious diseases such as encephalitis. However, parasites are not always harmful â 252 larvae {{were found in the}} head of one Zambian individual without any <b>pathogenicity.</b> Nematodes, cestodes, paramphistomes; and the roundworm Setaria labiatopapillosa have also been {{isolated from the}} hartebeest. In 1931, a red hartebeest in Gobabis (southwestern Africa) was infected with long, thin worms. These were named Longistrongylus meyeri after their collector, T. Meyer.|$|E

BglII was the most discriminative enzyme. Mapping of altered restriction sites was also performed for all six enzymes. The genome types D 1 (like the prototype) and D 3 prevailed among 45 and 47 strains, respectively. All genome types could {{be divided into two}} groups related to D 1 or D 3. Several clusters of infections by strains with the same genome type were observed. Only hints of differences were found in the <b>pathogenicities</b> of individual genome types.

40|$|Background: The causative {{agent of}} Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, {{is divided into}} 6 Discrete Typing Units (DTU) : Tc I, IIa, IIb, IIc, IId and IIe. In order to assess the {{relative}} <b>pathogenicities</b> of different DTUs, blood samples from three different clinical groups of chronic Chagas disease patients (indeterminate, cardiac, megacolon) from Bolivia were analyzed for their circulating parasites lineages using minicircle kinetoplast DNA polymorphism. Methods and Findings: Between 2000 and 2007, patients sent to the Centro Nacional de Enfermedades Tropicales for diagnosis of Chagas from clinics and hospitals in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, were assessed by serology, cardiology and gastrointestinal examinations. Additionally, patients who underwent colonectomies due to Chagasic magacolon at the Hospital Universitario JaponÃ©s were also included. A total of 306 chronic Chagas patients were defined by their clinical types (81 wit...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>pathogenicities</b> of {{influenza}} viruses and paramyxoviruses {{have been proposed}} to be primarily determined by a host cell protease(s) that activates viral infectivity by proteolytic cleavage of the envelope glycoproteins. We recently isolated a trypsin-type endoprotease, named tryptase Clara, from rat bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial Clara cells, which is secreted into the airway lumen and activates Sendai virus and influenza A virus proteolytically. We report here that surfactant in the bronchial fluid inhibited tryptase Clara specifically, having a Ki value of 0. 13 Î¼M, and inhibited the proteolytic activations by tryptase Clara in vitro and in organ cultures of rat lung. Intranasal infection of rats with Sendai virus was shown to stimulate secretion of tryptase Clara without changing the amount of surfactant in the bronchial lumen, resulting in a preferable condition for proteolytic viral activation and multiplication...|$|R

40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood leukocytes (PBL) were examined {{for their ability}} to support growth of several group A arboviruses in vitro. Cells were refractory to infection with eastern (EEE) and western (WEE) equine encephalitis viruses, whereas Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus was shown to infect and replicate to a substantially high titer. When PBL were fractionated into purified subpopulations, only the monocytes were susceptible to predictive VEE virus infection. Lymphocytes treated 24 h before virus inoculation with phytohemagglutinin (10 microgram/ml) were capable of propagating significant amounts of VEE virus. A monocytic cell line, J- 111, was also susceptible to infection with VEE, EEE, and WEE viruses, whereas a lymphocytic cell line, Raji, was refractory. Additional information on the participation of PBL during human infection with these viruses may add considerably to our understanding of their differing <b>pathogenicities</b> and clinical pictures...|$|R
40|$|Rhodococcus equi is an {{emerging}} opportunistic pathogen of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Thirty-nine isolates of R. equi from immunocompromised patients {{with and without}} AIDS were analyzed {{for the presence of}} virulence plasmid DNA, expression of 15 - to 17 -kDa antigens, and their <b>pathogenicities</b> in mice. Of the human isolates, eight contained an 85 -kb virulence plasmid, expressed 15 - to 17 -kDa antigens, and were virulent in mice. Nineteen isolates carried cryptic plasmids of various sizes, and the remaining 12 isolates did not contain any plasmids. These 31 isolates did not express virulence-associated antigens and were not virulent in mice. The results suggested that opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients could be caused by both virulent and avirulent R. equi strains and that the pathogenesis of R. equi infection in immunocompromised patients appears to be different from that which occurs in foals...|$|R
40|$|Neisseria meningitidis colonizes the {{nasopharynx}} and, unlike commensal Neisseria species, {{is capable}} of entering the bloodstream, crossing the blood-brain barrier, and invading the meninges. The other pathogenic Neisseria species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, generally causes an infection which is localized to the genitourinary tract. In order to investigate the genetic basis of this difference in disease profiles, we used a strategy of genomic comparison. We used DNA arrays to compare the genome of N. meningitidis with those of N. gonorrhoeae and Neisseria lactamica, a commensal of the nasopharynx. We thus identified sequences conserved among a representative set of virulent strains which are either specific to N. meningitidis or shared with N. gonorrhoeae but absent from N. lactamica. Though these bacteria express dramatically different <b>pathogenicities,</b> these meningococcal sequences were limited and, in contrast {{to what has been}} found in other pathogenic bacterial species, they are not organized in large chromosomal islands...|$|R

Of those, six animal handlers eventually seroconverted, including one who had cut himself with a bloody scalpel.

40|$|<b>Pathogenicities</b> of 10 temperature-sensitive mutants of Venezuelan {{encephalitis}} virus {{were studied}} using the hamster model of human virulence. The parental strain and {{nine of the}} temperature-sensitive mutants produced lethal infections in hamsters. Strain ts 126 showed reduced hamster virulence. Deaths with the lethal mutants usually occurred 1 to 3 days later than with parental virus. Nine mutants produced lower levels of viremia than parental virus. Attenuation of ts 126 was related to restriction of viral growth in spleen and probably bone marrow and to absence of the usual pathological lesions in hemopoietic tissues and brain, but was functionally unrelated to temperature sensitivity since temperatures of both normal and infected hamsters remained within the permissive range of the mutant. Deaths did not correlate with titers of the 10 mutants in blood at permissive temperatures or with reversions of four temperature-sensitive mutants to non-temperature-sensitive virus in hamsters...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently found bat-derived {{influenza}} viruses (BatIVs) have hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments {{distinct from}} those of previously known influenza A viruses. However, <b>pathogenicities</b> of these BatIVs remain unknown since infectious virus strains have not been isolated yet. To gain insight into the biological properties of BatIVs, we generated vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) pseudotyped with the BatIV HA and NA. We found that VSVs pseudotyped with BatIV HAs and NAs efficiently infected particular bat cell lines but not those derived from primates, and that proteolytic cleavage with a trypsin-like protease was necessary for HA-mediated virus entry. Treatment of the susceptible bat cells with some enzymes and inhibitors revealed that BatIV HAs might recognize some cellular glycoproteins as receptors rather than the sialic acids used for the other known influenza viruses. These data provide fundamental information on the mechanisms underlying the cellular entry and host restriction of BatIVs...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} and {{propagation of}} misfolded Î±-synuclein (Î±-Syn) {{is a central}} feature of Parkinsonâs disease and other synucleinopathies. Molecular compatibility between a fibrillar seed and its native protein state is {{a major determinant of}} amyloid self-replication. We show that cross-seeded aggregation of human (Hu) and mouse (Ms) Î±-Syn is bidirectionally restricted. Although fibrils formed by Hu-Ms-Î±-Syn chimeric mutants can overcome this inhibition in cell-free systems, sequence homology poorly predicts their efficiency in inducing Î±-Syn pathology in primary neurons or after intracerebral injection into wild-type mice. Chimeric Î±-Syn fibrils demonstrate enhanced or reduced <b>pathogenicities</b> compared with wild-type Hu- or Ms-Î±-Syn fibrils. Furthermore, Î±-Syn mutants induced to polymerize by fibrillar seeds inherit the functional properties of their template, suggesting that transferable pathogenic and non-pathogenic states likely influence the initial engagement between exogenous Î±-Syn seeds and endogenous neuronal Î±-Syn. Thus, transmission of synucleinopathies is regulated by biological processes in addition to molecular compatibility...|$|R
