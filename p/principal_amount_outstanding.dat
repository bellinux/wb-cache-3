5000|$|Principal and interest: When {{the cost}} of {{borrowing}} is paid periodically, as commonly occurs, it is known as an interest payment. All other payments of economic value by the debtor to the creditor that reduce the <b>principal</b> <b>amount</b> <b>outstanding</b> are known as principal payments. However, the definition of external debt does not distinguish between principal payments or interest payments, or payments for both. Also, the definition does not specify that {{the timing of the}} future payments of principal and/or interest need be known for a liability to be classified as debt.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade dealing in {{derivative}} financial instruments (basically forwards, futures, options and combinations of these), particularly in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market has become a central activity for major wholesale banks and financial institutions. Measured in terms of notional <b>principal</b> <b>amount,</b> OTC derivatives <b>outstanding</b> are near, if not greater than, US$ 10 trillion, even after deduction of double-counting for intra-dealer transactions. Major new regulatory initiatives, including proposed new capital requirements, are under consideration {{as a means of}} reducing systemic risk. This paper examines the concept of systemic risk [...] that failure of one firm will lead to the failure {{of a large number of}} other firms or indeed the collapse of the international financial system. Alternative proposed definitions are considered and integrated and the effects of OTC derivatives on these risks discussed. The key conclusion is that systemic risk has been reduced by the development of the OTC derivatives market due to shifting economic risks to those better able either to bear the risk or, in many cases, cancel it against offsetting risks. The implications of the Basle II capital proposals for systemic risk are analyzed and shown to increase this risk due to encouraging transactions which increase portfolio risks of the dealers and discouraging transactions which decrease their portfolio risk. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{simple terms}} the {{notional}} <b>principal</b> <b>amount</b> is essentially {{how much of}} the asset or bonds a person has. For example, if a premium bond was bought for £1 then the notional <b>principal</b> <b>amount</b> would be the face value amount of premium bond that your £1 was able to purchase. Hence the notional <b>principal</b> <b>amount</b> is the quantity of the assets and bonds.|$|R

5000|$|In a swap, no {{principal}} changes {{hands at}} inception (start) or expiry (end), {{and in the}} meantime, interest payments are computed based on a notional amount, which acts {{as if it were}} the <b>principal</b> <b>amount</b> of a bond, hence the term notional <b>principal</b> <b>amount,</b> abbreviated to notional.|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} of an {{interest}} rate swap, the notional <b>principal</b> <b>amount</b> is the specified amount on which the exchanged interest payments are based; this could be 8000 US dollars, or 2.7 million pounds sterling, or any other combination of a number and a currency. Each period's rates are multiplied by the notional <b>principal</b> <b>amount</b> to determine the height and currency of each counter-party's payment. A notional <b>principal</b> <b>amount</b> is the amount used as a reference to calculate the amount of interest due on an 'interest only class' which is not entitled to any principal.|$|R

In nominal terms, over the previous ten years (1995–2004) ABS <b>amount</b> <b>outstanding</b> had grown about 19 percent annually, with mortgage-related debt and corporate debt each growing at about 9 percent.

25|$|Inflation-indexed bonds (linkers) (US) or Index-linked bond (UK), {{in which}} the <b>principal</b> <b>amount</b> and the {{interest}} payments are indexed to inflation. The interest rate is normally lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity (this position briefly reversed itself for short-term UK bonds in December 2008). However, as the <b>principal</b> <b>amount</b> grows, the payments increase with inflation. The United Kingdom was the first sovereign issuer to issue inflation linked gilts in the 1980s. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and I-bonds are examples of inflation linked bonds issued by the U.S. government.|$|R

50|$|For a fully amortizing loan, with a fixed (i.e., non-variable) {{interest}} rate, {{the payment}} {{remains the same}} throughout the term, regardless of principal balance owed. For example, the payment on the above scenario will remain $733.76 {{regardless of whether the}} outstanding (unpaid) principal balance is $100,000 or $50,000. Paying down more than the monthly contractual amount reduces the <b>amount</b> <b>outstanding</b> and thus the interest that is payable to the lender; if the contractual monthly payment stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must decrease. Conversely, paying down less than the monthly contractual amount increases the <b>amount</b> <b>outstanding</b> and thus the interest payable (negative amortization); if the contractual monthly payment stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must increase.|$|R
