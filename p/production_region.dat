5|$|The {{worldwide}} {{demand for}} Champagne has been continuously increasing throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. A record in worldwide shipping of Champagne (including domestic French consumption) of 327 million bottles {{was set in}} 1999 in anticipation of end of millennium celebrations, and a new record was set in 2007 at 338.7 million bottles. Since the entire vineyard area authorized by the 1927 AOC regulations is now planted, various ways of expanding the production have been considered. The allowed yield was increased (to a maximum of 15,500kg per hectare during an experimental period from 2007 to 2011) {{and the possibility of}} revising the <b>production</b> <b>region</b> was investigated.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND : Limited {{scientific}} {{information is available}} on the eating quality of potato cultivars in South Africa. This study aimed to determine, describe and compare the eating quality of three potato cultivars from two <b>production</b> <b>regions</b> (dry land and irrigated land) in SouthAfrica, through sensory and physical evaluation. Sensory descriptorswere identified for the sensory attributes and a lexicon was developed. A category scale was used to rate the sensory attributes and physical measurements of specific gravity, shear force resistance and scanning electronmicroscopy were performed. RESULTS : It became evident that both sensory evaluation and physical measurements need to be performed {{in order to determine the}} eating quality of potato cultivars, as one evaluation supports the other. A partial least squares regression modellingmethod was used to relate the sensory attributes and physical measurements. The intensity of the sensory attributes of the specific cultivars varied between the two <b>production</b> <b>regions.</b> CONCLUSION : The eating quality of potatoes obtained from two <b>production</b> <b>regions</b> differed from another due to climatic conditions and other production characteristics that exist (dry land vs. irrigation). The study confirms the valuable contribution of determining the eating quality of potato cultivars. Potato South Africa[URL]...|$|R

40|$|The Eagle Ford shale of South Texas {{has become}} one of the most active and most {{important}} shale plays in the U. S. This success has been possible because of the unique geology and richness of the play, allowing significant production of natural gas, condensate liquids, and oil; the rapid improvement of long horizontal lateral drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing completion technologies; and a long-term period of sustained high oil prices. This study develops a probabilistic before-tax economic model to estimate the reserves of the Eagle Ford shale, under different stochastic parameters and scenarios usually not considered by evaluators. The model is used to assess impact and sensitivity on reserves and economic yardsticks considering the variability and uncertainty of project inputs such as production streams, commodity prices, capital investments, and operational costs. We use existing probabilistic methodologies for production and price forecasting and use public and private sources to develop statistical distributions for additional parameters, including differentials for commodity prices, natural gas content for the different <b>production</b> <b>regions,</b> and water/gas and water/oil ratios. We consider three evaluation scenarios?single-well, 100 -well, and Full-well?in each of the proposed <b>production</b> <b>regions</b> of the Eagle Ford shale, with calibrated probabilistic inputs for each region. Single-well results show how it is hard to produce complete distributions of reserves all across the play, although <b>production</b> <b>regions</b> with better productivity are identified. Results from the scenarios with multiple wells, show how the commerciality of the considered development projects is achievable in liquid-rich <b>production</b> <b>regions</b> and with moderate to high price forecasts. This study provides useful information and results to oil and gas professionals about key areas that influence the commercial development of Eagle Ford shale. The methodology to perform evaluations with probabilistic components enables better project development and investment decisions and can be applied to other shale plays...|$|R
