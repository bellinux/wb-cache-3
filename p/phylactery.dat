2500|$|While O-Chul and Lien travel {{north to}} Kraagor's gate, the Order sails to the Western Continent. Their search for Girard's Gate {{takes them to}} the Empire of Blood, where Tarquin, the Empress's chief general (and the true power behind the throne), {{dramatically}} reveals himself to be Elan's father. Tarquin gives the Order a tip that Girard's relative Orrin Draketooth {{can be found in}} Windy Canyon. However, Tarquin and the Linear Guild join forces and plot to seize the gate for themselves. The action briefly cuts away to Azure City where Redcloak's troops recover Xykon's <b>phylactery</b> and destroy the resistance's base; Redcloak, who is plotting against Xykon, gives Xykon a fake <b>phylactery</b> and keeps the real one for himself. The Order discovers a magically cloaked pyramid in Windy Canyon but once inside finds the entire Draketooth clan dead [...] an unexpected result of Vaarsuvius's Familicide spell, which causes him/her to flee into the pyramid in horror. The Linear Guild arrives shortly after in hot pursuit. Belkar, Durkon, and Tarquin become separated from their respective groups in the ensuing battle. Belkar and Durkon encounter Tarquin's cleric Malack, who kills Durkon, turning him into a vampire thrall. Belkar reunites with the Order and they continue deeper into the pyramid, overcoming various traps and illusions along the way. When they discover the gate, Roy decides to destroy it, and consequently the entire pyramid, rather than risk it falling into the hands of Evil. Again the Order sees what appears to be another world in the rift. With Tarquin gone, Nale takes the opportunity to kill Malack, freeing Durkon who rejoins the Order. Tarquin kills Nale for disobedience upon returning and sends a vast army to attack the Order. With the help of Vaarsuvius (who was temporarily dragged into hell by the archfiends so that s/he could not prevent the Order from destroying the Gate), and Julio Scoundrel swooping in at the last moment, the Order is triumphant. Tarquin is left {{in the middle of the}} desert as the Order flies away on Julio's airship towards the last Gate. The final strip reveals that the Northern Death God, Hel, has placed a spirit in the vampirized body of Durkon, and plans for the spirit to bring ruin to the Dwarven lands as Durkon helplessly struggles trapped in his own body.

2500|$|Roy {{finds himself}} in the Afterlife with his father, who cannot rest until Xykon is gone. Roy is found worthy of {{entrance}} to paradise, but he returns to his father's side when he learns that almost four months have passed. Looking down, he sees that Haley and Belkar have formed an underground resistance movement in hobgoblin-occupied Azure City. Haley accidentally summons Celia, who convinces her {{to look for the}} other half of the party. Their travels take them to Greysky City, where Haley is betrayed by one of her old friends in the Thieves' Guild, but the Order triumphs over the Guild in the ensuing battle. Meanwhile, Elan, Durkon, and Vaarsuvius stop the nobleman Kubota's plot to assassinate Hinjo, and Vaarsuvius kills Kubota after capturing him. Vaarsuvius then flies to an isolated island to search for Haley, where Vaarsuvius is attacked and defeated by the mother of the black dragon whom Vaarsuvius had killed during No Cure for the Paladin Blues. After the dragon threatens to kill Vaarsuvius' children, Vaarsuvius contracts with fiends to rent out the souls of three evil spellcasters. Vaarsuvius then kills the black dragon and her entire lineage by [...] "renting" [...] an epic Familicide spell. Loath to waste this increased arcane power, Vaarsuvius teleports to Azure City to defeat Xykon, but is knocked out, during the battle, and loses control of the souls. Witnessing this, the paladin O-Chul escapes from prison and attempts to destroy Xykon's <b>phylactery,</b> but it falls into a storm drain and is lost. Vaarsuvius and O-Chul are teleported to Hinjo's fleet by Xykon's monster in the darkness, which O-Chul had befriended during his imprisonment. There, the Order regroups and Durkon resurrects Roy. The story arc ends with the Order sailing towards the next gate and Vaarsuvius apologizing to the neglected familiar Blackwing, who tells Vaarsuvius that it saw what appeared to be another world in the rift in space caused by the Snarl.

2500|$|The present Saint Thuriau {{church in}} Landivisiau was built between 1864 and 1865 {{replacing}} the earlier 16th-century building {{but the old}} church's porch and bell-tower were retained, fortunately so as they are both magnificent. The porch was dismantled and then re-erected in 1728 by Jean Perrot and Sébastien Roussel. The entrance to the porch comprises a semi-circular arch, with side buttresses and above the arch a pointed gable culminates in an elaborate lanteron. Inside the porch are statues of the apostles, and a two-door entrance to the church has further decorated arches, with further statues on the wall {{as well as a}} tympanum. Unusually for porches in churches in the Élorn valley, the porch is accessed using ten steps. As at Pencran, Bastien Prigent created a series of piédroits and voussures depicting biblical and other scenes as decoration of the arch over the porch's entrance (the blocks of stone at the part of the arch near to ground level are the piédroits and the remaining wedge-shaped stones used in constructing an arch form the voussoirs. [...] Above the biblical scenes in the arch's piédroits are depictions of the four Evangelists and their attributes, with Saints Luke and John positioned on the left and Mark and Matthew positioned on the right and finally a [...] "heavenly choir" [...] of thirty one winged angels are shown floating in the clouds and praying, singing, playing various instruments or holding censers. Above the entrance arch is a gable in the Gothic style and on this the sculptors placed a statue depicting a female saint reading a book and another female saint higher up has her hands crossed against her chest. [...] The gable is also decorated with two lions supporting the blason of François de Tournemine. [...] Above the gable there is an ornate lanteron with three niches. The central niche contains a statue of Saint Thuriau to whom the church is dedicated. [...] The two buttresses supporting the arch have niches containing statues of the four Evangelists each seated at a desk with their attributes at their side. The buttresses also hold a statue of the Virgin of the Annunciation and another depicting Saint Anne with the Virgin Mary. All these statues are by Bastien Prigent. [...] The inside of the porch is vaulted and is decorated with the blason of the Danycan family and Henry Prigent added statues of [...] "Christ the Saviour" [...] and the twelve apostles in niches each with an elaborate canopy. The heads of these apostles were damaged during the turmoil of the French revolution and bear signs of restoration and some of the attributes were destroyed which makes identification difficult. The arches around the two doors giving access to the church are in turn richly decorated with garlands of thistles ("chardon") and grapes and a series of statuettes in niches, these depicting Saint Yves, Saint Peter holding a book and a key, Saint Salomon the Breton king wearing armour, holding a sword and the royal crown, Saint Miliau carrying his head in his hands, Saint Thivisiau, a bishop, Saint Côme holding a vase containing medications, Saint Damien (Côme and Damien were brothers and both doctors martyred under Diocletian), and another bishop giving a blessing. On the left side angels hold a cartouche reading [...] "ANNO.DOMINI.1554" [...] and on the right the cartouche reads [...] "LAN.MIL.VCC.L1111.FVST.FONDE.CESTE.PORTAL.ET.ESTOIENT.LORS.FABRIQVES.Y.MART(I)N.J.ABGRALL". Above the doors a tympanun depicts angels holding phylacteries on either side of a statue of Jesus Christ. The <b>phylactery</b> held by the three angels on the left side reads [...] "MEMENTO.MEI/O.MATER.DEI/PAX VOBIS" [...] and that held by three angels on the right reads [...] "DOMVS MEA/SALVATOR MVNDI/ LETVS MARIA". There is an elaborate stoup on the wall between the two entrance doors.|$|E

6000|$|As typical a {{novel of}} the oracular kind as we can hope to meet with, is “The Enigma: a Leaf from the Chronicles of the Wolchorley House.” The “enigma” which this novel is to solve is {{certainly}} one that demands powers no less gigantic than those of a lady novelist, being neither more nor less than the existence of evil. The problem is stated and the answer dimly foreshadowed on the very first page. The spirited young lady, with raven hair, says, “All life is an inextricable confusion;” and the meek young lady, with auburn hair, looks {{at the picture of}} the Madonna which she is copying, and—“There seemed the solution of that mighty enigma.” The style of this novel is quite as lofty as its purpose; indeed, some passages on which we have spent much patient study are quite beyond our reach, in spite of the illustrative aid of italics and small caps; and we must await further “development” in order to understand them. Of Ernest, the model young clergyman, who sets every one right on all occasions, we read that “he held not of marriage in the marketable kind, after a social desecration;” that, on one eventful night, “sleep had not visited his divided heart, where tumultuated, in varied type and combination, the aggregate feelings of grief and joy;” and that, “for the marketable human article he had no toleration, be it of what sort, or set for what value it might, whether for worship or class, his upright soul abhorred it, whose ultimatum, the self-deceiver, was to him THE great spiritual lie, ‘living in a vain show, deceiving and being deceived;’ since he did not suppose the <b>phylactery</b> and enlarged border on the garment to be merely a social trick.” (The italics and small caps are the author’s, and we hope they assist the reader’s comprehension.) Of Sir Lionel, the model old gentleman, we are told that “the simple ideal of the middle age, apart from its anarchy and decadence, in him most truly seemed to live again, when the ties which knit men together were of heroic cast. The first-born colors of pristine faith and truth engraven on the common soul of man, and blent into the wide arch of brotherhood, where the primæval law of order grew and multiplied each perfect after his kind, and mutually interdependent.” You see clearly, of course, how colors are first engraven on the soul, and then blent into a wide arch, on which arch of colors—apparently a rainbow—the law of order grew and multiplied, each—apparently the arch and the law—perfect after his kind? If, after this, you can possibly want any further aid toward knowing what Sir Lionel was, we can tell you that in his soul “the scientific combinations of thought could educe no fuller harmonies of the good and the true than lay in the primæval pulses which floated as an atmosphere around it!” and that, when he was sealing a letter, “Lo! the responsive throb in that good man’s bosom echoed back in simple truth the honest witness of a heart that condemned him not, as his eye, bedewed with love, rested, too, with something of ancestral pride, on the undimmed motto of the family—‘LOIAUTE.’” ...|$|E
50|$|Since a lich's soul is mystically tied to its <b>phylactery,</b> {{destroying}} {{its body}} will not kill it. Rather, its soul {{will return to}} the <b>phylactery,</b> and its body will be recreated by the power keeping it immortal. Thus the only way to permanently destroy a lich is to destroy the <b>phylactery</b> as well. Therefore, the lich will generally be extremely protective of the priceless item. The <b>phylactery,</b> which can be of virtually any form (the default form is a metal box filled with rune-covered papers, but it usually appears as a valuable amulet or gemstone), will often be hidden in a secret place and protected by powerful spells, charms, monsters and/or other servants; the <b>phylactery</b> itself is usually of magical nature, meaning its destruction will generally be no easier than obtaining it.|$|E
