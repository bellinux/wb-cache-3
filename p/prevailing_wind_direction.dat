5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> <b>direction.</b> Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E

5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> <b>direction,</b> and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{stability}} of the boundary-layer stratification, high-latitude winds over complex terrain are strongly affected by blocking and channelling effects. Consequently, at many low-lying communities in the Canadian Archipelago, including Cape Dorset and Iqaluit considered in this study, surface winds for the most part are from two diametrically opposed directions, following the orientation of the elevated terrain. Shifts between the two <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> can be sudden and are associated with geostrophic <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> within a well defined narrow range. To quantitatively investigate the role of large-scale pressure gradients and the quasi-geostrophic overlying flow, an idealised dynamical system for the evolution of channelled surface winds is derived from the basic equations of motion, in which stability of stationary along-channel <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> is described {{as a function of the}} geostrophic wind. In comparison with long-term horizontal wind statistics at the two locations it is shown that the climatologically <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> can be identified as stationary states of the idealised wind model, and that shifts between <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> can be represented as stability transitions between these stationary states. In that sense, the <b>prevailing</b> local <b>wind</b> conditions can be interpreted as attracting states of the actual flow, with observed surface winds adjusting to a new stable direction as determined by the idealised system within 3 ? 9 h. Over these time-scales and longer it is therefore advantageous to determine the relatively slow evolution of the observationally well-resolved large-scale pressure distribution, instead of modelling highly variable surface winds directly. The simplified model also offers a tool for dynamical downscaling of global climate simulations, and for determining future scenarios for local <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> conditions. In particular, it allows an estimation of the sensitivity of local low-level winds to changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation...|$|R

40|$|Litterfall is an {{important}} ecological process in forest ecosystem functioning. Some {{attempts have been made}} to develop spatially explicit models of litterfall, but wind influence has never been included. Therefore, we studied the effect of wind on litterfall in an intimately mixed birch-oak forest using tree diameter and position as input data. After testing a litterfall model that assumed isotropic leaf dispersal, an anisotropic dispersal module was developed to account for wind influence. Using leaf fall data of 104 litter traps, isotropic and anisotropic models were optimized for silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), and red oak (Quercus rubra L.) and model quality was compared. The anisotropic leaf litterfall model proved to be relevant because (i) the estimated litterfall directions corresponded very well to <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> during leaf fall and (ii) including directionality significantly increased the goodness of fit of the models for both oak species but not for birch. Consequently, <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> during leaf fall affected leaf dispersal in a broad-leaved deciduous forest.

25|$|Most {{aircraft}} arriving into Manchester Airport use the Instrument Landing System, {{which in}} line with most other airports has a glide slope of 3 degrees equal to descending 318 feet per nautical mile. The <b>prevailing</b> <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> is westerly, so normally aircraft fly from northeast to southwest. In practice this means that normally aircraft land from the northeast over Stockport, Cheadle and Heald Green and takeoff towards Knutsford. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 1 (23R) and depart from Runway 2 (23L). When the wind direction changes, usually affecting 20% of movements per annum, operations are reversed with aircraft landing from the southwest, lining up to the south over Northwich and over Knutsford and taking off towards Stockport. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 2 (05R) and depart from Runway 1 (05L). Sometimes, aircraft arriving into Manchester Airport are held in stacks, usually in poor weather when the movement rate decreases. The airport has 3 stacks: DAYNE, MIRSI and ROSUN, each located approximately 15/20 miles from the airport. DAYNE serves arrivals from the south, ROSUN {{from the north and}} east and MIRSI from the west. If you live within 20 miles of the airport, you will likely see and hear aircraft.|$|E

In particular the so called Bora, a gusty wind from north to north-east. One goal of the campaign was to examine the performance of SODAR and LIDAR instruments under harsh meteorological conditions.
