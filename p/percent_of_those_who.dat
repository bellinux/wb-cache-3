Victims were buried alive, thrown bound into ponds, stripped naked and forced to labor in the middle of winter, doused in boiling water, forced to ingest excrement and urine, and subjected to mutilation (hair ripped out, noses and ears lopped off).

Although a system of compulsory training had been introduced in 1911 for home service, under Australian law it did not extend to overseas service. In Australia, two plebiscites on using conscription to expand the AIF were defeated in October 1916 and December 1917, thereby preserving the volunteer status but stretching the AIF's reserves towards the end of the war. A total of 416,809 men enlisted in the Army during the war, representing 38.7 percent of the white male population aged between 18 and 44. Of these, 331,781 men were sent overseas to serve as part of the AIF.

As the technology of our nation becomes increasingly complex, requiring highly trained and skilled workers, the pressures of attaining a higher education are greatly multiplied. The disheartening fact that many students enter college only to be frustrated and over-whelmed by the magnitude of the work that is beyond their capacity emphasizes the need of this study. The purpose of this study was to make a comparison of the high school and college grade point earned by students in the School of Agriculture at Oregon State University. The specific objectives were to compare (1) high school average grades with college average grades in the same subject areas, (2) the effect of high school preparation compared to college achievement in the same subject areas, and (3) students from various sized high schools in accordance with grades received. The data for this thesis was obtained from transcripts in the office of the Dean of Agriculture and from the student files in the Registrar's Office. Only <b>those</b> students <b>who</b> enrolled in the School of Agriculture as fall term (1962) freshmen were considered in this study.

Little is known about pain after healing. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the course of pain from baseline to time of healing of leg ulcers (venous or mixed etiology). In order to understand this phenomenon and develop implications for nursing practice, objectives included: 1) Measure incidence and prevalence of pain at baseline and healing; 2) Describe characteristics associated with leg ulcer pain at baseline; 3) Identify predictors of leg ulcer pain at healing. Methods: Data were from one randomized controlled trial (2004 - 2008) of 424 individuals with leg ulcers in the community receiving evidence-informed nursing management. The primary outcome was pain at the time of healing. Predictive factors included demographic, circumstance of living, clinical and ulcer characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression identified the subset of predictors of pain at healing. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Results: Eighty-two <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> participants reported pain at baseline and 32 % at healing. Five percent with no pain at baseline reported pain at healing.

40|$|Following {{recommendations}} from a Health Technology Assessment (HTA), a prospective cohort study of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening of all admissions (N = 29 690) to six acute hospitals in three regions in Scotland indicated that 7. 5 % of patientswere colonised on admission to hospital. Factors associated with colonisation included re-admission, specialty of admission (highest in nephrology, {{care of the}} elderly, dermatology and vascular surgery), increasing age, {{and the source of}} admission (care home or other hospital). Three <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> all <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were identified as colonised developed hospital-associated MRSA infection, compared with only 0. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> not colonised. Specialtieswith a high rate of colonisation on admission also had higher rates of MRSA infection. Very few patients refused screening (11 patients, 0. 03 %) or had treatment deferred (14 patients, 0. 05 %). Several organisational issues were identified, including difficulties in achieving complete uptake of screening (88 %) or decolonisation (41 %); the latter was largely due to short duration of stay and turnaround time for test results. Patient movement resulted in a decision to decontaminate all positive patients rather than just those in high risk specialties as proposed by the HTA. Issues also included a lack of isolation facilities to manage patients with MRSA. The study raises significant concerns about the contribution of decolonisation to reducing risks in hospital due to short duration of stay, and reinforces the central role of infection control precautions. Further study is required before the HTA model can be re-run and conclusions redrawn on the cost and clinical effectiveness of universal MRSA screening...|$|R
