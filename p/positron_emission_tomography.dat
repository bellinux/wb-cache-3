40|$|Abstract Introduction Rosai-Dorfman disease, {{also known}} as sinus {{histiocytosis}} with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare benign disorder characterized histologically by lymphatic sinus dilatation due to histiocyte proliferation. Rosai-Dorfman disease accompanied by IgG 4 + plasma cell infiltration is an even rarer situation. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, no imaging report of fluoro-deoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> findings of Rosai-Dorfman disease with IgG 4 + plasma cell infiltration has been published, although a series of pathological research has focused on this phenomenon. Case presentation We reviewed the 18 F-fluoro-deoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> scan of a 78 -year-old Chinese woman with a solid mass that was found in her right breast during a health checkup. 18 F-fluoro-deoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> showed a hypermetabolic nodule in her right breast and slightly heterogeneous increased fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake of the pulmonary nodules, which were histologically proven to be mammary Rosai-Dorfman disease with IgG 4 + plasma cell infiltration and pulmonary amyloidosis, respectively. A literature review was performed to gather information on this rare disease process. Conclusions Although distinguishing benign lymphoplasmacytic proliferation from malignancy may be difficult with 18 F-fluoro-deoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> in light of the pattern and intensity of fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake, our case highlights that whole-body <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> imaging not only can display the extent of the disease to help complete staging but also can provide functional information about disease activity to guide biopsy. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Primary or {{secondary}} malignancies {{of the heart}} is rare and difficult to diagnosis. Most cardiac masses are detected incidentally. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-computed <b>tomography,</b> thorax computed tomography are valuable tools for staging the disease of patient {{with a history of}} malignancy. As prognosis is poor, if a physician suspects a suspicious metastasis on heart, it must evaluated carefully in order to prompt therapeutic interventions. Herein. we report a false-positive <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-computed <b>tomography</b> finding which was superposition of lung metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma via confirming by thorax computed tomography and echocardiography. Case report: A 71 -year-old man diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma presented with a mass on the posterior-anterior lung graphy after 8 years of the diagnosis date. <b>Positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-computed <b>tomography,</b> thorax computed tomography, echocardiography, fine needle aspiration biopsies were performed in order to reveal the final diagnose. Although <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-computed <b>tomography</b> revealed a cardiac metastasis, the other tools showed that it was not cardiac metastasis but lung metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Henoch-Schonlein {{vasculitis}} is {{the most}} common systemic vasculitis in children. Arthritis or arthralgia occurs in 80 % of patients. We believe this to be the first case report to describe the finding of polyarthritis in a fludeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-computed <b>tomography</b> scan in a patient with Henoch-Schonlein vasculitis without clinical signs of arthritis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4. 5 -year-old Caucasian boy presented with fever of 4 days' duration followed by debilitating migratory arthralgia and inflammation. He underwent a fludeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-computed <b>tomography</b> scan to exclude a possible malignant cause or to detect any infectious or autoimmune focus of his symptoms. Fludeoxyglucose uptake was observed in multiple large joints and in multiple tendons. These findings suggested active polyarthritis and polytendinitis. However, physical and ultrasound evaluations did not show any signs of arthritis in our patient, despite his evident arthralgia. CONCLUSIONS: Fludeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-computed <b>tomography</b> might be able to detect inflammatory activity in painful joints that cannot yet be detected clinically or with ultrasound evaluation in a patient with Henoch-Schonlein vasculitis. Therefore, fludeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-computed <b>tomography</b> can be of additional value in the diagnostic workup of patients with an unresolved diagnosis of suspected autoimmune disease, especially in patients with unresolved arthralgia and fever of unknown cause...|$|R
40|$|PublisherINTRODUCTION: Myocardial {{sarcoidosis}} {{is known}} as a significant complication of sarcoidosis, but Holter electrocardiographic monitoring or echocardiograms might not be sensitive enough to detect cardiac involvement. While gallium scintigraphy has been recommended, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-computed <b>tomography</b> might be more sensitive to detect sarcoidosis. CASE PRESENTATIONS: This report comprises the cases of 12 Japanese patients. Two were male, and ten were female. Their age range was between 32 and 93 years. The average age of the patients was 63. We found internal involvement of sarcoidosis in eight (89 %) of nine patients by <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography-computed <b>tomography</b> and in two (67 %) of three patients by gallium scintigraphy. Myocardial sarcoidosis was detected in four (33 %) of twelve patients, and specifically in three (75 %) of four facial multiple plaque type sarcoidosis patients.

5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|Of the ten other {{isotopes}} produced synthetically, {{ranging from}} 12N to 23N, 13N has a half-life of ten minutes {{and the remaining}} isotopes have half-lives {{on the order of}} seconds (16N and 17N) or even milliseconds. No other nitrogen isotopes are possible as they would fall outside the nuclear drip lines, leaking out a proton or neutron. Given the half-life difference, 13N is the most important nitrogen radioisotope, being relatively long-lived enough to use in <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> (PET), although its half-life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the PET, for example in a cyclotron via proton bombardment of 16O producing 13N and an alpha particle.|$|E
5|$|Blood tests may be {{performed}} to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated creatine kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> scan of the body may also {{be performed}} to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose <b>positron</b> <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> is a {{well-established}} technique for diagnosis {{and management of}} a number of neoplastic conditions.
