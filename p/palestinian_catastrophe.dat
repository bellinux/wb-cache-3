50|$|In Geneva, {{while writing}} the report, the {{committee}} was subject to Jewish, Arab, and British pressure. Zionist representatives vigorously lobbied the committee. They repeatedly submitted memoranda and recruited a Palestinian Arab representative whose father had been murdered by the Husseini clan that dominated the Palestinian Arab community to argue {{in favor of a}} Jewish-Transjordanian partition of the country before the committee. The Arab League liaison submitted a memorandum demanding a solution satisfactory to the <b>Palestinian</b> Arabs, threatening <b>catastrophe</b> would result otherwise. The British submitted a memorandum arguing partition was a feasible option.|$|R
5000|$|After the war, {{which the}} Israelis call the War of Independence and the <b>Palestinians</b> call the <b>Catastrophe,</b> the 1949 Armistice Agreements {{established}} the separation lines between the combatants, leaving Israel {{in control of}} some of the areas which had been designated for the Arab state under the Partition Plan, Transjordan in control of the West Bank, Egypt in control of the Gaza Strip and Syria in control of the Himmah Area. The Arab League [...] "supervised" [...] the Egyptian trusteeship of the Palestinian government in Gaza after and secured assurances from Jordan that the 1950 Act of Union was [...] "without prejudice to the final settlement".|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines Palestinians’ and Israelis’ narratives {{about growing}} up in Jerusalem over the last sixty years, beginning with the 1948 Arab-Israeli War known alternatively as the <b>Palestinian</b> Nakba (<b>catastrophe)</b> and the Israeli War of Independence. Scholarship on modern Jerusalem has generally examined Arab and Jewish inhabitants separately, at the expense of a more comprehensive perspective of situated, daily interaction. Moreover, descriptions of young people’s lives are often overshadowed by adult-centered narratives of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. This ethnographic study considers how the Conflict shapes residents’ narratives about their childhood in the context of Jerusalem’s post- 1948 history, as well as how the other ‘side’ is implicated in their stories and in the consciousness of contemporary youth. ^ Because political divisions inform a great deal of daily life in Jerusalem, I treat the physical and social terrain as the foreground for analyzing young residents 2 ̆ 7 experiences over time. In particular, I focus on the contexts for their routines and folk traditions: Sites of leisure and play, patterns of mobility and routes, and places of tension and conflict. Adults’ narratives about their childhood past were solicited through personal interviews, public story-telling events, and personal and organized neighborhood tours. Research with contemporary teens involved informal interviews and guided tours to illuminate how they articulate their sense of local knowledge as they navigate familiar and strange terrains around the city, while revealing their landscapes of play and imagination. ^ While often tinged with nostalgia and romanticism, Palestinian and Israeli residents frame the narratives about their childhood past in light of their social and political status in present day Jerusalem. In the tone and content of their stories, they express the precariousness or stability of their status as Palestinians or Israelis in this divided city, respectively, and evaluate how their national and communal affiliations impact their views on Arab-Jewish relations. A comparison of adults’ childhood narratives with the experiences of contemporary teens reveals that in comparison with their elders, youth today are less familiar with the ‘other side’ and with the city as a whole {{as a result of the}} limitations they face by living in a divided city. ...|$|R

50|$|The Global Campaign to Return to Palestine {{has chosen}} the 15th of May {{as a central}} {{occasion}} to commemorate each year under the name “The Day of Return”. On this day the Campaign evokes the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>catastrophe</b> (An-Nakba 1948) and what have occurred during it; the horrible massacres, the oppression and persecution of Palestinians, and the land confiscations {{which resulted in the}} displacement of more than 840000 Palestinians from their homeland (out of 1.4 million Palestinians at that time).|$|E
5000|$|Brunner {{describes}} a [...] "watershed moment" [...] he experienced in 1988 after reading The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949 by Benny Morris, whereupon he envisioned making the book into a film. This was {{the impetus for}} his conception of Al-Nakba: The <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Catastrophe</b> 1948, the first documentary film to examine the displacement of 750,000 Palestinians during {{the birth of the}} state of Israel. Brunner toured with Al-Nakba to discuss the subject with audiences in Israel and San Francisco.|$|E
50|$|Al-Nakba: The <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Catastrophe</b> 1948 is a {{documentary}} film of Benny Brunner and Alexandra Jansse. It follows {{the events that}} surround the 1948 Palestinian exodus. It was filmed in 1996, is 58 minutes long and is in English. Based on the book The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949 by Benny Morris, {{it is the first}} documentary film to examine the displacement of 750,000 Palestinians during the birth of the state of Israel. The film shifts between interviews with Palestinian refugees and the reactions of Irgun and Haganah soldiers who witnessed and participated in the events of 1948.|$|E
40|$|The Balfour Declaration of 2 November 1917 {{was central}} to the wartime British-Zionist {{alliance}} and a powerful Zionist-Jewish propaganda tool.

This essay also calls on the United Kingdom to acknowledge its historic responsibility for the disastrous consequences of Zionist settler-colonialism in Palestine and the subsequent <b>Palestinian</b> <b>catastrophe</b> (Nakba) ...|$|E
