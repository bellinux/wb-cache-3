50|$|Painted {{buntings}} often feed by hopping {{along the}} ground, cautiously stopping every {{few moments to}} look around. The <b>painted</b> <b>bunting</b> regularly eats a large quantity of grass seeds, including; Panicum, Amaranthus, Oxalis, Euphorbia and Carex. Seeds are eaten almost exclusively during winter. While breeding, <b>painted</b> <b>bunting</b> and nestlings mainly eat small invertebrates, including; spiders, snails, grasshoppers, caterpillars and other insects.

Species of note include: Bald Eagles, Red Knots, <b>Painted</b> <b>Buntings,</b> Roseate Spoonbills, Black-necked Stilts, and Wood Storks.|$|R
50|$|Most birds moult, usually {{before and}} after breeding, {{resulting}} in a breeding or nuptial plumage and a basic plumage. Many ducks and some other species such as the red junglefowl have males wearing a bright nuptial plumage while breeding and a drab eclipse plumage for some months afterwards. The <b>painted</b> <b>bunting's</b> juveniles have two inserted moults in their first autumn, each yielding plumage like an adult females.

50|$|<b>Painted</b> <b>buntings</b> are shy, secretive {{and often}} {{difficult}} to observe for the human eye, though can be fairly approachable where habituated to bird feeders. Males sing in spring from exposed perches to advertise their territories. They also engage in visual displays including flying bouncingly like a butterfly or in an upright display, body-fluff display, bow display and wing-quiver display. These displays are used in agonistic conflicts with other males or in breeding displays for females, with females rarely engaging in displays. Occasionally, males may physically clash {{with each other and}} may even kill each other in such conflicts. When their breeding season has concluded, buntings migrate by night over short to medium distances. Western birds (Arizona and northern Mexico) molt in mid-migration, while eastern birds tend to molt before they migrate.|$|R

5000|$|The {{remaining}} two tracts {{on the island}} consist of the Cemetery Woods which is property of Louisiana State University and the Govan Tract. [...] The Cemetery Woods is roughly {{four and a half}} acres and like the Grilleta Tract, it contains old growth trees which are over 125 years old. In addition to the hardwood forest, the property contains salt flats and marshland which promote the habitation of ducks, moorhens, grebes, and other wading birds. The Govan Tract was donated by the Govan family to the Nature Conservancy in 2003. Originally, the land had belonged to the Govan family since the late 1800s. The tract only consists of half an acre, but within the tract, the mass availability of lives oaks, hackberries, dewberry, and poison oak attracts birds such as <b>painted</b> <b>buntings,</b> red-winged blackbirds, warblers, and other passerines that can been seen during the migratory season.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Stable isotope {{ratios of}} {{hydrogen}} (dD) and carbon (d 13 C) in feathers collected from <b>Painted</b> <b>Buntings</b> (Passerina ciris (L., 1758)) breeding in the midwestern United States revealed a surprising degree {{of variation in}} dD, {{as well as a}} clear bimodal signal in d 13 C in the innermost primary feather. Because this population does not molt on the breeding grounds, we reasoned that these observations could be due (i) to birds migrating to two (or possibly more) distinct molting areas or (ii) to differences in the timing of molt (as opposed to molt location) relative to arrival at the stopover site. To evaluate these hy-potheses, we collected feathers at a molting location in northwestern Mexico, which revealed patterns similar to those from the birds in the US (favoring the second hypothesis above). We suspect that some birds arrive at stopover sites and begin molting before their body tissues equilibrate to the new isoscape so that the first feathers grown represent a blend of materi-als from the breeding and stopover locations. Other birds may delay molt after arriving at the molting site, allowing them to equilibrate with the local isoscape and produce feathers with isotope signatures of the molting location.

Puisque cette population ne mue pas sur l’aire de reproduction, nous en déduisons que ces observations pourraient s’expliquer (i) par le fait que les oiseaux migrent vers deux (et peut-être plus) aires distinctes de mue ou (ii) par des différences dans le calendrier de la mu...|$|R

50|$|Painted {{buntings}} {{are mostly}} monogamous and are solitary or in pairs during the breeding season, but sometimes exhibit polygyny. The breeding season begins in late April and lasts through to early August, with activity peaking mid-May through to mid-July. The male arrives {{about a week}} before the female and starts to establish a small territory. The nest is typically hidden in low, dense vegetation and is built by the females and woven into the surrounding vegetation for strength. Each brood contains three or four gray-white eggs, often spotted with brown, which are incubated for around 10 days until the altricial young are hatched. The female alone cares for the young. The hatchlings are brooded for approximately 12 to 14 days and then fledge at that time. About 30 days after the first eggs hatch, the female <b>painted</b> <b>bunting</b> usually lays a second brood. Nests are often parasitized by cowbirds. Common predators at the nest of eggs, young, and brooding females are large snakes, including coachwhip snakes, eastern kingsnakes, eastern racers and black rat snakes. Bird-hunting raptors, including short-tailed hawks, Accipiter hawks, and even the small passerine loggerhead shrike, may hunt painted buntings, including the conspicuous breeding-plumaged male. The <b>painted</b> <b>bunting</b> can live to over 10 years of age, though most wild buntings probably live barely half that long.|$|E
50|$|The {{warbling}} vireo's song is {{a cheerful}} warble, {{similar to that}} of the <b>painted</b> <b>bunting.</b> There are subtle differences in song between eastern and western birds, at least where the ranges meet in Alberta. Some authorities split the eastern and western races of this species into separate species:The western warbling vireo, V. swainsoni, includes V. g. swainsoni, which breeds from southeastern Alaska and southwestern Northwest Territories to the Sierra San Pedro Mártir, Baja California, and V. g. brewsteri, which breeds from southern Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana to south-central Oaxaca. These two subspecies winter in Mexico. The swainsoni group also includes V. g. victoriae, an isolated population breeding in the Sierra de la Laguna, Baja California Sur, and migrating to unknown wintering grounds.|$|E
