40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management (Public Management and Government)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2013 Sound {{financial}} management {{is a growing}} concept in the public sector, especially in local government. The South African government has put in place policies and mechanisms to create a conducive environment for municipalities to manage finances in an effective manner. The management of municipal finance {{is supported by a}} set of policies and regulations to strengthen the use of public money. Among the respective policy frameworks, the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa expects the government entities to be transparent and accountable. Here in, these financial measures are also guided by the Municipal Finance Management Act 56 of 2003 and the Public Finance Management Act 1 of 1999 (as amended 29 of 1999). Measured transparency is critically important for management public funds. Accountability is an essential element in achieving institutional goals, especially where public funds are used. Accountability allows public institutions to provide assurance to the tax payers and to their <b>principals.</b> The <b>Auditor</b> General expects municipalities to be accountable for their financial activities through regular reporting. The Annual Report will therefore be compiled for reporting and it must include all required information. Audit Committee becomes very critical, as a structure established to guide the municipality on finances and ensure that the report is credible in every respect. Metsimaholo municipality has however been facing challenges as per the opinions of the Auditor General based on financial reporting, amongst other things. This study involves the extent to which financial reporting serves as a tool for promoting accountability. In order to test the hypothesis, literature was reviewed to analyse and evaluate financial reporting and accountability. Empirical research was conducted to test and analyse the existence of practices, procedures and policies that promote sound {{financial management}} and their effectiveness. Data was collected through questionnaires and face to face structured and unstructured interviews, with respondents from employees of Metsimaholo Local Municipality and community structures. This study found among others that: *Policies for financial reporting exist but are not fully complied with *There is a lack of follow up with and implementation of Auditor General’s recommendations *Audit Committee recommendations are not fully implemented *There are no clear lines of responsibilities between councillors and officials with regard to financial management The study concludes with recommendations to assist the municipality in committing themselves to adopt strategies towards financial reporting for improved accountability.

40|$|The largest {{corporate}} bankruptcy {{filed in}} the U. S., that of Enron in 2001, was preceded by a string of disclosures about errors in and corrections to their financial statements. The presence of such errors creates uncertainty {{about the quality of}} the financial statements, can lead to pricing distortions, and inefficient market allocations. Several causes have been suggested for the current state of affairs. Most important, perhaps, are managers' tendency to inflate stock prices for personal gain through deceit, "cooking the Books" - misrepresentations in financial reporting - and other unethical behavioral practices, and auditors' failure to fulfill their role as independent gatekeepers. Currently, the incentives driving auditors' behavior may not elicit unbiased reports. Auditors are paid by the companies they audit which creates an inherent conflict of interest that is endemic to the relation between the firm (the <b>principal)</b> and the <b>auditor</b> (the agent). Unfortunately, remedying these problems is not simple. Prosecution and punishment may not adequately deter wrongdoing, as intentional misrepresentation is difficult to discover or prove. Overhauling the regulatory structure and adding layers of supervision and monitoring by the government would be inefficient and socially wasteful. In addition, little can be done in the short run to cultivate ethical personalities. Rather, the solution lies in market mechanisms that eliminate the perverse incentives of gatekeepers, most notably the auditors. We present a financial statement insurance institutional mechanism that eliminates the conflict of interest auditors face and properly aligns their incentives with those of shareholders. We show analytically that the introduction of financial statement insurance can significantly mitigate market inefficiencies arising from uncertainty regarding the quality of financial statements. The basic structure of Financial Statement Insurance (FSI) can be described as follows. Instead of appointing and paying auditors, companies would purchase financial statement insurance that provides coverage to investors against losses suffered as a result of misrepresentation in financial reports. The insurance coverage that the companies are able to obtain is publicized, as are the premiums paid for that coverage. The insurance carriers would then appoint and pay the auditors who attest to the accuracy of the financial statements of the prospective insurance clients. Those firms announcing higher limits of coverage and smaller premiums would distinguish themselves in the eyes of the investors as companies with higher quality financial statements. In contrast, those with smaller or no coverage or higher premiums will reveal themselves as those with lower quality financial statements. Every company will be eager to get higher coverage and pay smaller premiums lest it be identified as the latter. A sort of Gresham's law in reverse would be set in operation, resulting in a flight to quality. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the audit pricing by the auditor {{of a parent}} company (i. e., <b>principal</b> <b>auditor)</b> when other independent auditors who are not affiliated with the <b>principal</b> <b>auditor</b> (i. e., other auditors) {{are involved in the}} audit of the group financial statements. Using Korean data, we find that audit fees charged to the parent company by the <b>principal</b> <b>auditor</b> are negatively associated with the proportion of total assets or sales of subsidiaries audited by other auditors in the pre-IFRS period. This finding is consistent with the argument that the <b>principal</b> <b>auditor</b> views subsidiaries audited by other auditors as a business opportunity to attract new clients and thus offers fee discounts to its client. However, in the post-IFRS period, this negative relation between audit fees and the involvement of other auditors becomes insignificant or positive, suggesting that IFRS adoption restricts auditors' strategic behavior in audit pricing because IFRS adoption increases the audit complexity and risk associated with the involvement of other auditors...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), is required to annually prepare and submit audited financial statements of the U. S. government to the President and Congress. We are required to audit these consolidated financial statements (CFS) and report {{on the results of}} our work. An issue meriting concern and close scrutiny that emerged during our fiscal year 2004 CFS audit was the growing number of Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies that restated certain of their financial statements for fiscal year 2003 to correct errors. Errors in financial statements can result from mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the financial statements were prepared. Frequent restatements to correct errors can undermine public trust and confidence in both the entity and all responsible parties. Further, when restatements do occur, it is important that financial statements clearly communicate and readers of the restated financial statements understand that the financial statements originally issued by management in the previous year and the opinion thereon should no longer be relied on and instead the restated financial statements and related auditor's opinion should be used. Nine of the 11 agencies that had restatements for fiscal year 2003 received unqualified opinions on their originally issued fiscal year 2003 financial statements. The auditors for 6 of these 9 agencies issued unqualified opinions on the restated financial statements, replacing the previous unqualified opinions on the respective agencies' original fiscal year 2003 financial statements. The auditors for 2 of these 9 withdrew their unqualified opinions on the fiscal year 2003 financial statements and issued other than unqualified opinions on the respective agencies' restated fiscal year 2003 financial statements because they could not determine whether there were any additional misstatements and the effect of any such misstatements on the restated fiscal year 2003 financial statements. For the remaining agency, the <b>principal</b> <b>auditor</b> of the agency's fiscal year 2004 financial statements was not the <b>principal</b> <b>auditor</b> of the agency's fiscal year 2003 financial statements, and an audit opinion on the agency's restated fiscal year 2003 financial statements was not issued. Because of the varying nature and circumstances surrounding the restatements, we are issuing a number of separate reports on the matter. This report communicates our observations regarding State's fiscal year 2003 restatements. We reviewed four key areas with respect to the restatements of State's fiscal year 2003 financial statements: (1) the nature and cause of the errors that necessitated the restatements, including planned corrective actions by the agency and its auditors; (2) the timing of communicating the material misstatement to users of the financial statements; (3) the extent of transparency exhibited in disclosing the nature and impact of the material misstatement in the financial statements and the reissued auditor's report; and (4) audit issues that contributed to the failure to detect the errors that necessitated the restatements during the audit of the agency's fiscal year 2003 financial statements. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role and}} ability of global audit firm networks (GAFNs), which are defined as networks that {{have the capacity to}} provide integrated audit services by coordinating member firms across countries, to provide international audits of high quality. In Studies 1 and 2, I evaluated GAFN audit quality at the client-level by examining the impact on audit quality and pricing of multiple audit firms participating in the same group audit over the period 2007 - 2013. In Study 1, I found that multi-firm group audits conducted by auditors from the same GAFN were of higher quality, as indicated by lower proportion of financial statement restatements, compared to group audits conducted by unrelated audit firms. However, audits are costlier when conducted by firms related through membership of a network. In Study 2, I replicated and extended Dee, Lulseged, and Zhang (2015), which utilised the same data source as Study 1, and did not find evidence of lower audit quality in either the replication or extended samples using performance-matched discretionary accruals. Considering consolidated findings of Studies 1 and 2, when the <b>principal</b> <b>auditor</b> and other auditors have common network membership, audit quality issues that can arise when multiple firms work together are potentially moderated but are more expensive. In Study 3, I evaluated GAFN audit quality at the firm-level by using the GAFN member-level disclosures pertaining to defects in firms’ audit quality control procedures. By constructing a firm-level audit quality determinant model, I examined whether GAFN members learned from prior negative inspection outcomes of their member firms around the world. I reviewed 2, 474 audit firm inspection reports from 44 countries over the period 2004 - 2015 and found no evidence of a systematic knowledge transfer between GAFN member firms. This thesis extends the theory of network structure in the global auditing industry and provides evidence that individual GAFN member firms work together across jurisdictions in multinational group audits and coordinate shared quality control systems for consistency within their respective GAFNs. These results are of interest to users of audited group financial reports, audit regulators and international clients with multinational operations...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In our role as <b>principal</b> <b>auditor</b> of the consolidated financial statements of the U. S. government (CFS), we plan to use {{the work of the}} inspectors general and contracted independent public accountants who audit the agency-level financial statements. The development of the joint PCIE/GAO Financial Audit Manual (FAM) has provided a common framework and methodology for federal financial statement auditing. Adherence to the FAM will enable us to readily review the work of other auditors as a basis for using that work under auditing standards. We want to all be on the same page so {{that we are in the}} position to use the work of the inspectors general. Certain CFS line items that will be subject to our concurrent review because of their significance, such as the federal employee and veteran benefits payable line item, involve federal agencies' significant actuarial estimations. Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 57, Auditing Accounting Estimates applies to such estimations. In addition, Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standard (SFFAS) No. 5 requires that federal agencies disclose specific information in their financial statements for pensions, other retirement benefits, and other postemployment benefits. Additional related audit guidance was provided in November 2004 when the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) issued its Statement of Position (SOP) 04 - 1, Auditing the Statement of Social Insurance effective for periods beginning after September 30, 2005. This audit guidance discusses the auditor's responsibility under SAS No. 57 and includes specific illustrative control and audit procedures that are applicable to auditing actuarial estimates to achieve SAS No. 57 objectives. Actuarial estimates for both social security and the federal employee and veteran benefit payable line item are developed by methods which calculate for the projection period covered by an actuarial valuation, the excess of (a) the present value of projected benefits of the group included in an actuarial valuation over (b) the actuarial value of program-related assets. Although the SOP 04 - 1 was specifically developed for use in auditing federal agencies' statements of social insurance, we consider the internal control and audit procedures discussed in SOP 04 - 1 to be appropriate for auditing the significant actuarial estimates in the federal employee and veteran benefit payable line item as well. Beginning in fiscal year 2006, we plan to use SOP 04 - 1 as criteria in determining the extent to which we can use audit work performed by agency auditors in this area. To the extent that the concepts and objectives of SOP 04 - 1 are found to be appropriate to other audit areas in the future, we will consider its use in such areas. ...|$|E
