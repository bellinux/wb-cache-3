Each {{side of the}} cassette has a <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> on the top that may be broken off, leaving a small indentation in the shell. This indentation allows the entry of a sensing lever that prevents {{the operation of the}} recording function when the cassette is inserted into a cassette deck. If the cassette is held with one of the labels facing the user and the tape opening at the bottom, the write-protect tab for the corresponding side is at the top-left. Occasionally, manufacturers provided a movable panel {{that could be used to}} enable or disable write-protect on tapes.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{basis of}} the PLCE webbing system is the belt; it {{features}} two D-rings at the back to attach to the shoulder harness, and many rows of narrow vertical slots sewn into the fabric. Two or more front pouches (ammunition or utility) attach to the belt; these have belt loops and feature T-Bar <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> attachments to provide more stability and security when connected to the belt. Every major component of the PLCE webbing system features two T-Bar <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> attachments.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, the {{mechanism}} used {{to attach the}} platters to the spindle motor was complex and tended to vibrate noisily. Iomega implemented an anti-gyro device (much like an optical CD/DVD drive) within the cartridge to prevent vibration at spin-up, but this device lost effectiveness with age. As a result, the two platters could lose alignment, rendering the cartridge unusable. The <b>plastic</b> <b>tabs</b> attached {{to the bottom of}} a Jaz cartridge could become stripped or broken, rendering the inserted disk physically incapable of spinning up to operating speed.|$|R
5000|$|The Pop-Port {{interface}} (originally code-named [...] "Tomahawk") was a plug-in port, {{available with}} many Nokia mobile phones. The port consists of one metal pin on either end, and a <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> containing thirteen contacts.|$|E
5000|$|Inbrima models had a [...] "black label" [...] {{attached}} to the base identifying the place of manufacture, {{while the majority of}} models had the later [...] "FAB ZF MANAUS” white <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> affixed to the base, indicating that the models had been made in that city.|$|E
50|$|The most known form of {{distinctive}} {{clothing for}} the priest is the easily identifiable clerical collar (or Roman collar), which takes form {{in either the}} traditional cassock, or modern day clerical shirt. The typical modern version consists of a white <b>plastic</b> <b>tab,</b> inserted into a specially made collar of a black shirt, although traditional cloth collars are still worn.|$|E
5000|$|As Chamberlin refined the build of his instruments, {{he began}} {{to bring them to}} music trade shows and {{competitors}} such as Hammond and Lowrey were often curious about the origin of Chamberlin sounds. In an effort to compete, these companies were forced to create drum rhythms and manufacture <b>plastic</b> <b>tabs</b> with orchestral instrument names on them. These tabs would generate tones that simulated the sound of the instrument selected. The American Federation of Musicians also took notice as well and tried to limit live performances of Chamberlin instruments fearing that their members would be put out of work. Despite the controversy, musicians worldwide embraced the Chamberlin and [...] "Mack the Knife" [...] singer Bobby Darin {{was one of the first}} customers, buying a customized model 300 without the rhythm section tapes.|$|R
50|$|Used in film {{processing}} labs to join film into large rolls before processing. These use a <b>plastic</b> coated <b>tab</b> {{to make the}} splice. The tab is heated and the plastic melts slightly, bonding to the film. The tabs are often printed with a number or bar code to identify the film after processing.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} few years, the club has raised several hundred dollars for various charities; adopted a whale, owl and {{chimpanzee}} and a polar bear; and collected over 2000 old prescription eyeglasses and over 200 pounds of <b>plastic</b> and aluminum <b>tabs</b> for recycling.|$|R
50|$|Similar to a mouse is a puck, which, {{rather than}} {{tracking}} {{the speed of}} the device, tracks the absolute position of a point on the device (typically a set of crosshairs painted on a transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> sticking out {{from the top of the}} puck). Pucks are typically used for tracing in CAD/CAM/CAE work, and are often accessories for larger graphics tablets.|$|E
50|$|The lower {{display of}} the Nintendo DS is {{overlaid}} with a touchscreen designed to accept input from the included stylus, the user's fingers, or a curved <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> attached to the optional wrist strap. The touchscreen lets users interact with in-game elements more directly than by pressing buttons; for example, in the included chatting software, PictoChat, the stylus is used to write messages or to draw.|$|E
5000|$|Mini Lindy {{was a line}} {{of small}} plastic model kits, {{about the size of}} Matchbox or Hot Wheels cars. They were part of the [...] "Lindberg Line". They had rubber tires, chrome wheels and clear windshields. The axles were fit under a <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> that {{provided}} limited suspension actions. Some of the subjects are difficult to find under other formats, such as Hot Wheels. These are often mistaken for Hot Wheels or slot cars, and are fairly rare, but can be found on eBay and websites.|$|E

Planner accessories such as monthly <b>tabs,</b> <b>plastic</b> sleeves and inserts, storage cases, and binders add to the system, keeping personal records in one place for improved organization.|$|R
50|$|Variants {{with higher}} voltage ratings (e.g. 2N3055HV, with a 100Vceo rating), {{different}} case material or type (e.g. steel, aluminium, or <b>plastic</b> with metal <b>tab),</b> and other variations exist, {{in addition to}} the minor variations in ratings (such as a power dissipation of 115 or 117 Watts) between 2N3055-marked devices from various manufacturers since RCA's original.|$|R
40|$|The NCV 33163 {{series are}} {{monolithic}} power switching regulators that contain the primary functions required for DC−to−DC converters. This series is {{specifically designed to}} be incorporated in step−up, step−down, and voltage−inverting applications with a minimum number of external components. These devices consist of two high gain voltage feedback comparators, temperature compensated reference, controlled duty cycle oscillator, driver with bootstrap capability for increased efficiency, and a high current output switch. Protective features consist of cycle−by−cycle current limiting, and internal thermal shutdown. Also included is a low voltage indicator output designed to interface with microprocessor based systems. These devices are contained in a 16 pin dual−in−line heat <b>tab</b> <b>plastic</b> package for improved thermal conduction...|$|R
50|$|The 110 cartridge, as {{specified}} by Kodak, has a <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> on one end. Camera designers {{had the option}} of using this tab to sense film speed, enabling sophisticated cameras to switch between high- and low-speed film. A short tab indicated high-speed film, and a long tab indicated low-speed film. Kodak left it to the film manufacturer to decide which film speeds were high or low. Only a few cameras took advantage of this feature: Rollei A110, Canon 110 ED, Minolta 110 Zoom SLR Mark I/II, Minox 110S, Pentax Auto 110.|$|E

5000|$|The XL-R was {{a runaway}} {{hit on the}} racing market and soon {{followed}} by the XL-S and XL-T versions for different performance levels. The XL series were also well known for the way they allowed water to leak into the boot where the lower cuffs folded over each other near the toe, and prompted many owners to cover the area with duct tape. The liners also tended to [...] "pack down" [...] fairly quickly, flattening out and no longer offering support. An improved version of the basic XL design was later introduced as the Z-model, which included a new low-profile locking buckle design that would not accidentally open once locked, and a small <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> {{in front of the}} toe flaps to prevent snow forcing its way in.|$|E
40|$|NASA's Ames Research Center has {{designed}} {{a simple but}} medically important device [...] one which holds temperature probes, called thermistors, to a person's skin without affecting {{the characteristics of the}} skin segment being measured. The device improves the accuracy of skin surface temperature measurements, valuable data in health evaluation. The need for such a device was recognized in the course of life science experiments at Ames. In earlier methods, the sensing head of the temperature probe was affixed to the patient's skin by tape or elastic bands. This created a heat variance which altered skin temperature readings. The Ames-developed thermistor holder is a <b>plastic</b> ring with <b>tab</b> extensions, shown in the upper photo on the chest, arm and leg of the patient undergoing examination. The ring holds the sensing head of the temperature probe and provides firm, constant pressure between the skin and the probe. The tabs help stabilize the ring and provide attachment points for the fastening tape or bands, which do not directly touch the sensor. With this new tool, it is possible to determine more accurately the physiological effects of strenuous exercise, particularly on the treadmill. The holder is commercially available from Yellow Springs Instrument Company, Inc., Yellow Springs, Ohio, which is producing the device under a NASA patent license...|$|R
40|$|Subjects wearing nasal dilators rated {{olfactory}} stimuli {{as being}} more intense compared with ratings done without nasal expansion. The results support a perceptual constancy model in olfaction. Chem. Senses 22 : 177 - 180, 1997. Nasal dilators are widely used by high school, college and professional athletes. The nasal dilator is an adhesive device consisting of two tabs {{at the ends of}} a connecting <b>plastic</b> spring. The <b>tabs</b> of the dilator are placed on the nares such that the spring, by its elasticity, continuously dilates the nasal valve. Nasal dilators have been shown to reduce the sound intensity and number of snores per minute, especially during slow wave sleep (Hoijer et al., 1992; Hoffstein et al, 1993). In addition, dilators have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of obstructed breathing during somnolence (Hoijer et al., 1992). Using rhinomanometry in awake, sitting subjects, Hoijer and co-workers (1992) observed that nasal dilators decreased nasal resistance by an average of 18 % compared with undilated controls. However, the effect, if any, this decreased resistance has on olfactory ability has yet to be studied. Certainly, one possibility is that the decreased resistance could affect sniff vigor. This change in sniff vigor could in turn, as proposed by Teghtsoonian et al. (1978) and Youngentob et al. (1986), influence the size of the perceptual response. Methods, results and discussion In experiment 1, 10 subjects (six females and four males, 22 - 40 years old) were recruited from the SUNY Health Science Center. Most had previous experience with psychophysical testing, but none had previously used nasal dilators. After signing an informed consent, subjects were randomly placed into one of two groups. After subjects in group 1 first rated the intensity of a series of odorants,...|$|R
5000|$|As the 1960s progressed, Monogram and Revell {{squared off}} as rivals {{in the scale}} model market. While {{companies}} like AMT and MPC focused almost exclusively on cars, Monogram and Revell were more diversified, offering aircraft, naval craft and other military vehicles. Monogram aircraft kits were known for imaginative [...] "operating features", such as a spring-loaded ejection seats on their F-105 Thunderchief model (operated by a tiny <b>plastic</b> <b>tab</b> {{on the side of}} the plane), and a tactical nuclear bomb which could be dropped from the RB-66A model - which also featured a moving tailgun turret.In the 1970s, Monogram wanted to portray a different perspective of its kits and add some spark to sales. 'Make it large' was one marketing approach that the company returned to. For example, Monogram introduced a 1978 Corvette kit in 1:8 scale - when assembled it was over 23 inches long (Model Cars 1979, pp. 14-15). Examples of vintage auto offerings were a 1930s Rolls-Royce Cabriolet with rumble seat, a 1930s Packard Phaeton, and a 1941 Lincoln Continental. The company's Early Iron series featured variants of Ford Model As (Model Cars 1979, pp. 13,23). During the 1970s, the company also hired modeler Sheperd Paine to construct and paint aircraft models and dioramas, which were used for photographs on boxes and instruction booklets (DeRogatis 2005). Some metal kits, like a 1953 Corvette, also appeared (Model Cars 1979, pp. 40-41).|$|E
