40|$|The paper {{studies the}} effect of terms of trade {{fluctuations}} on equilibrium debt position of a small open economy. I develop a simple model of a small open economy producing exportable and nontradable goods to investigate the effects of terms of trade shock assuming that terms of trade follow two state Markov switching process. Under this process, permanent terms of trade shock means change of regime. With switching probability, rational agent optimizes debt position according to the current state and the probability of transition. I define switching effect using transition probability and state dependent parameters. Unlike traditional argument, permanent terms of trade shock now has either positive or negative effect depending on the magnitude of state-contingent parameter. ∗This topic was motivated by my advisor <b>prof.</b> <b>Eric</b> Leeper.

30|$|Scientists {{continued}} to conduct in-depth researches in Aplysia and made numerous significant research findings, however, {{as pointed out}} by Hughes (1968): “apart {{from the work of}} Tchou Si-Ho (Tchou, 1942) and Arvanitaki few quantitative observations seem to have been recorded on the relative size of its nervous system or on the numbers and sizes of neurons in individuals of different sizes (p. 423)”. Thus, Dr. Arvanitaki and Dr. Tchou Si-Ho were the first ones who studied this feature in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia punctata (Hughes and Tauc, 1961; Kandel and Tauc, 1965; Koester and Kandel, 1977; Adams and Benson, 1985; Bailey and Chen, 1988; Cleary et al., 1991). As neurons are very difficult to grow, neurobiologists heavily depended on the established research methods, and Dr. Tchou’s work on the quantification of neuron cells and rhythmic discharge in Aplysia, as well as the experimental methods established during the researches, laid a solid foundation for the studies using Aplysia as a model organism. The following researches by many prominent neuroscientists has benefited from Dr. Tchou’s pioneering work. Such as <b>Prof.</b> <b>Eric</b> R. Kandel at Columbia University, who found that memory was linked to the synapses that connect nerve cells and uncovered its molecular mechanisms in Aplysia. <b>Prof.</b> <b>Eric</b> Kandel was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000. This was inseparable from the foundational work of Dr. Tchou and his colleagues on the investigation and establishment of Aplysia as a model organism (Coggeshall et al., 1966; Hughes, 1968;  Peretz and Lukowiak, 1975; Shapiro et al., 1980).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple experiment on detecting gyroscopic thrust demonstrated by <b>Prof.</b> <b>Eric</b> Laithwaite in 1974. In this experiment the gyroscope suspended {{on the line}} by one end of its rotation axis was deflecting from the pivot point during precession. In addition to the original setup the author has isolated the gyroscope from surrounding air and conducted a video recording of the experiment from two positions simul-taneously. The recording of gyroscope position and orientation allowed author to determine the trajectory of the gyroscope and analyze deflection dependency on gyroscope orientation. The results of this analysis indicate {{the existence of the}} external force acting on the gyroscope and causing the increase or decrease in linear mo-mentum. It is suggested that the force {{is a result of the}} difference in aether pressure in front and at the back of the gyroscope rotor. 1...|$|R
