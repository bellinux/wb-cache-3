40|$|Objectives A {{cross-sectional}} {{investigation was}} designed to assess the quality of local government plans for public health emergencies and to determine whether relevant regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> are in place. Methods Sixty-six municipalities were selected randomly using stratified sampling, and a questionnaire investigation on <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> was conducted in these municipalities. Results The findings show that approximately 50 % of <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> omitted important content; less than 50 % of municipalities had established three regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Conclusions Based on the analysis, the quality of existing public health <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> is not sufficient. More than 50 % of municipalities lack regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Suggestions regarding the responsibility of government at different levels are made. First, central government should draw up a set of standard development procedures and a standard template for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans.</b> Secondly, local governments should revise their plans. Thirdly, local govern-ments should establish regulations for <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> as soon as possible...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} performance indicators applied to nuclear emergency exercises {{for the assessment of}} a nuclear energy plan. The model was designed from the relationship between the actions forecasted in a nuclear <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> and the objectives challenged in emergency exercises. The nuclear <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> comprises a protocol that addresses structures, actions and procedures aimed at controlling and minimizing the effects of a nuclear <b>emergency.</b> The <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> is the last level of defense in depth used to ensure nuclear safety. Thus, the <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> must be efficient in preparing and organizing current means in order to ensure and assure an adequate protection of the population in the case of accidents in nuclear power plants. The model of performance indicators developed is based on the functional dependence observed in several different nuclear <b>emergency</b> <b>plans,</b> which facilitates the analysis of the state of preparedness of nuclear emergency response organizations. The model allows comparing different stages of preparedness of a nuclear <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> as well as nuclear <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> for different facilities...|$|R

40|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>plans</b> play {{a central}} role in {{emergency}} management processes. However, the technical problems associated to <b>emergency</b> <b>plan</b> development have received very little attention. As a matter of fact, most <b>emergency</b> <b>plans</b> are <b>printed</b> documents prepared with the sole support of a word processing system.

40|$|In {{the event}} of a {{disaster}} in Germany a so-called executive staff is set up.

40|$|Emergency {{response}} combines with {{prevention and}} mitigation {{to form the}} risk management triad of control measures for reducing chemical accident risks. In fact, standard good practice dictates that appropriate emergency response measures are identified for every major accident scenario of a hazardous operation. Consistent with this philosophy, <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> has been taken on board as {{an essential component of}} the Seveso Directive since its inception in 1982. Within the current Seveso Directive (2012 / 18 /EU), under Article 12, <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> for upper-tier sites is assigned as a direct obligation to both the operator (for internal <b>emergency</b> <b>planning)</b> and the authorities (for external <b>emergency</b> <b>planning).</b> These obligations present considerable challenges for the authorities, in particular, in verifying that internal <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> of each upper tier site is conducted in accordance with Seveso requirements and existing performance standard; that a parallel process for external <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> is established; and an appropriate strategy is defined to inform populations potentially at risk from the accident scenarios of concern. To bring improvements and consistency to Member State practices in this regard, the European Commission and the Irish Health and Safety Authority organised a workshop in 2012 for Seveso inspectors from EU and aligned countries to exchange information on challenges and successes in implementing <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> obligations.
