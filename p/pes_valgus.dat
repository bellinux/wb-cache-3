40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} {{the effect of}} customized foot orthoses (FOs) on the kinematic, kinetic and EMG features in patients with RA, tibialis posterior (TP) tenosynovitis and associated <b>pes</b> plano <b>valgus.</b> Methods. Patients with RA and US-confirmed tenosynovitis of TP underwent gait analysis, including three-dimensional (3 D) kinematics, kinetics, intramuscular EMG of TP and surface EMG of tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, soleus and medial gastrocnemius. Findings were compared between barefoot and shod with customized FO conditions. Results. Ten patients with RA with a median (range) disease duration of 3 (1 – 18) years were recruited. Moderate levels of foot pain and foot-related impairment and disability were present with moderately active disease states. Altered timing of the soleus (P = 0. 05) and medial gastrocnemius (P = 0. 02) and increased magnitude of tibialis anterior (P = 0. 03) were noted when barefoot was compared with shod with FO. Trends were noted for reduced TP activity in the contact period (P = 0. 09), but this did not achieve statistical significance. Differences in foot motion characteristics were recorded for peak rearfoot eversion (P = 0. 01), peak rearfoot plantarflexion (P &# 60; 0. 001) and peak forefoot abduction (P = 0. 02) in the shod with FOs compared with barefoot conditions. No differences in kinetic variables were recorded. Conclusion. This study has demonstrated, for the first time, alterations in muscle activation profiles and foot motion characteristics in patients with RA, <b>pes</b> plano <b>valgus</b> and US-confirmed TP tenosynovitis in response to customized FOs. Complex adaptations were evident in this cohort and further work is required to determine whether these functional alterations lead to improvements in patient symptoms. </p...|$|R

Most younger patients {{do not have any}} structural changes to the PFJ, such as an increased Q angle and a cartilage damage. This clinical entity is known as patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Older patients usually present with signs of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). A key factor in PFPS development is dynamic valgus of the lower extremity, which leads to lateral patellar maltracking. Causes of dynamic valgus include weak hip muscles and rearfoot eversion with <b>pes</b> pronatus <b>valgus.</b> These factors can also be observed in patients with PFOA. The available evidence suggests that patients with PFP are best managed with a tailored, multimodal, nonoperative treatment program that includes short-term pain relief with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), passive correction of patellar maltracking with medially directed tape or braces, correction of the dynamic valgus with exercise programs that target the muscles of the lower extremity, hip, and trunk, and the use of foot orthoses in patients with additional foot abnormalities.

To compare electromyographic (EMG), kinematic, kinetic, and {{ultrasound}} (US) {{features of}} <b>pes</b> plano <b>valgus</b> associated with US-confirmed tibialis posterior (TP) tenosynovitis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy control subjects. Methods. In this cross-sectional study, patients with RA and US-confirmed tenosynovitis of TP underwent gait analysis, including 3 -dimensional kinematics, kinetics, and intramuscular EMG of TP, and findings {{were compared with}} a group of healthy individuals. The RA group also underwent B mode and power Doppler US scanning of the TP tendon to assess and score levels of pathology. Results. Ten patients with RA, median (range) disease duration of 3 years (1 – 18 years), and 5 control subjects were recruited. Compared to control subjects, the RA patients walked slower and presented with moderate levels of foot-related disability. The mean SD Disease Activity Score in 28 joints was 4. 6 1. 6. Increased magnitude of TP activity was recorded in the RA group compared to controls in the contact period of stance (P 0. 007), in conjunction with reduced ankle joint power (P 0. 005), reduced navicular height in the medial arch (P 0. 023), and increased forefoot dorsiflexion (P 0. 027). TP tendon thickening, fluid, and power Doppler signal were observed in the majority of patients. Conclusion. This study has demonstrated, for the first time, increased TP EMG activity in the presence of US-confirmed TP tenosynovitis in RA. Altered muscle function occurred in conjunction with suboptimal mechanics, moderate levels of tendon pathology, and active disease.

40|$|A {{dissection}} {{was carried}} out on bilateral congenital convex <b>pes</b> <b>valgus</b> in a newborn who died of congenital visceral malformations. The main finding was a modification in the neck-body relations of the talus. Nearly all muscles showed morphologic alterations. No insertional or histologic anomalies were shown. The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament was stretched and attenuated. The alterations observed in our case affected all the anatomic structures forming and stabilizing the coxa pedis. Our case suggests that the dysplastic evolution of the talar body-neck angle halts, and the neck assumes an adducted, medially inclined and plantar-tilted angle {{with respect to the}} talar body.

40|$|Introduction In {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA), {{signs and symptoms}} of feet and ankle are common. To evaluate the dynamic function of feet and ankles, namely walking, a variety of gait studies have been published. In this systematic review, we provide a systematic overview of the available gait studies in RA, give a clinimetrical assignment, and review the general conclusions regarding gait in RA. Methods A systematic literature search within the databases PubMed, CINAHL, sportdiscus, Embase, and Scopus was described and performed and delivered 78 original gait studies that were included for further data extraction. Results The clinimetrical quality of the 78 included RA gait studies measured according a tailored QUADAS item list and proposed clinimetrical criteria by Terwee and coworkers are moderate. General conclusions regarding the walking abnormalities of RA patients point to a slower walk, longer double support time, and avoidance of extreme positions. Frequently found static features in RA are hallux <b>valgus,</b> <b>pes</b> planovalgus, and hind foot abnormalities. Conclusions Gait studies in RA patients show moderate clinimetrical properties, but are a challenging way of expressing walking disability. Future gait research should focus on more uniformity in methodology. When this need is satisfied, more clinical applicable conclusions can be drawn...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar retrospectivamente o tratamento dos pés planos espásticos com a artrorrise da articulação subtalar, proposta por Pisani, bem como o comportamento de 12 parâmetros radiográficos. MÉTODOS: Entre fevereiro de 1992 e dezembro de 2002 foram operadas 29 crianças (57 pés), com média de idade de seis anos. O tempo de seguimento médio foi de oito anos e nove meses. RESULTADOS: Obteve-se 65 % de resultado satisfatório e 35 % de insatisfatório (20 pés), avaliados segundo critérios exclusivamente clínicos no momento da revisão final. Oito parâmetros radiográficos mostraram diferenças estatisticamente significativas entre os grupos satisfatório e insatisfatório na revisão final e correlações significativas entre si. CONCLUSÃO: Considerando-se o rigor dos critérios clínicos utilizados, a complexidade da patologia e o grau de comprometimento dos pacientes da amostra, concluímos que a técnica proposta por Pisani é uma boa opção às osteotomias e artrodeses no tratamento das deformidades iniciais e redutíveis por manipulação passiva. O valor médio do ângulo de inclinação do tálus de 52 º foi associado ao resultado insatisfatório. OBJETCTIVE: The goal of {{this study}} is to {{retrospectively}} evaluate the treatment of the spastic <b>pes</b> planus <b>valgus</b> with the technique presented by Pisani, also the behavior of 12 radiographic parameters. METHODS: Between February 1992 and December 2002 29 children (57 feet) with spastic Cerebral Palsy were submited to surgical treatment, the mean age was six years. The mean follow-up period was eight years and nine months. RESULTS: They presented 65 % (37 feet) of satisfactory and 35 % (20 feet) of unsatisfactory results, according to exclusive clinical criteria at the final revision. From the 12 radiographic parameters studied eight shown statistical significant differences between the satisfactory and unsatisfactory groups at the final revision with significant correlations. CONCLUSION: Considering that the clinical evaluation was stricted, the severity and the degree of involvement of the patients the author concluded that the Pisani's technique is still a good option when comparing with osteotomies and arthrodesis in the treatment of the still flexible deformities. Among the radiographic angles the mean preoperative value of the talar decllination angle of 52 º was associated with unsatisfactory result...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The tibialis {{posterior}} (TP) tendon {{is vulnerable}} to inflammatory damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TP tendon disease is frequently associated with <b>pes</b> pIano <b>valgus</b> (PPV) deformity; both inflammatory and mechanical factors are thought to contribute. Minimal evidence exists {{in terms of the}} contribution of the TP muscle, determined by electromyography (EMG), to the deformity in RA. To date this has not been combined with current multi-segment foot (MSFoot) models or diagnostic imaging. Moreover, the response of these features to intervention is currently unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} undertake a detailed description of TP tenosynovitis and PPV in RA and to determine the effect of targeting mechanics and inflammation. Methods: Patients with RA and PPV and control participants were recruited to establish the reliability of TP EMG and the MSFoot model in the first phase of the study. A further cohort of RA patients with RA, PPV and ultrasound (US) confirmed tenosynovitis were recruited to determine the effect of targeting mechanics with customised foot orthoses (FO) and inflammation with a peri-tendinous corticosteroid injection. Results: Reliability of the MSFoot model was established barefoot and shod in five healthy controls and five patients with RA and PPV. Ten patients were recruited to the proof-of-concept study; all were issued with customised FO and four were issued with peri-tendinous corticosteroid injections in combination with FO. Differences between patients and controls were recorded across all domains. Mechanical and inflammatory intervention for three months did not significantly improve movement patterns, muscle activity or impairments and disability in the presence of highly active disease states. Improvements to levels of TP tendon pathology were recorded following targeted local corticosteroid intervention in this population. Results demonstrated response to intervention on an individual level due to high levels of disease activity. Conclusion: This study has provided an insight into muscle function in RA in the presence of active tendon disease and PPV. Suboptimal mechanics in this population are linked with increased muscle activity relative to healthy control participants and occur in conjunction with pathological tendon features on US. Technical and methodological issues adversely affected the results and the importance of disease related factors was highlighted. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
