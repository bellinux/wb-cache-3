[...] These methods {{can be categorized}} according to which aspects of the cell are controlled and which are measured. The four main categories are <b>potentiometry</b> (the difference in electrode potentials is measured), coulometry (the transferred charge is measured over time), amperometry (the cell's current is measured over time), and voltammetry (the cell's current is measured while actively altering the cell's potential).|$|E
50|$|<b>Potentiometry</b> passively {{measures}} {{the potential of}} a solution between two electrodes, affecting the solution {{very little in the}} process. One electrode is called the reference electrode and has a constant potential, while the other one is an indicator electrode whose potential changes with the composition of the sample. Therefore, the difference of potential between the two electrodes gives an assessment of the composition of the sample. In fact, since potentiometric measurements in a non-destructive measurement, assuming that the electrode is in equilibrium with the solution we are measuring the potential of the solution. <b>Potentiometry</b> usually uses indicator electrodes made selectively sensitive to the ion of interest, such as fluoride in fluoride selective electrodes, so that the potential solely depends on the activity of this ion of interest.The time that takes the electrode to establish equilibrium with the solution will affect the sensitivity or accuracy of the measurement. In aquatic environments Platinum due to its high electron transfer kinetics is often used, although an electrode made from several metals can be used in order to enhance to electron transfer kinetics. The most common potentiometric electrode, by far is the glass-membrane electrode used in a pH meter.|$|E

[...] values between about 2 and 11 can be measured directly by potentiometric titration using a glass electrode. This enormous range is possible because of the logarithmic response of the electrode. The limitations arise because the Nernst equation breaks down at very low or very high pH. The range can be extended by using the competition method.

40|$|Serum {{consists}} of water (93 % of serum volume) and nonaqueous components, mainly lipids and proteins (7 % of serum volume). Sodium {{is restricted to}} serum water. In states of hyperproteinemia or hyperlipidemia, there is an increased mass of the nonaqueous components of serum and a concomitant decrease {{in the proportion of}} serum composed of water.
