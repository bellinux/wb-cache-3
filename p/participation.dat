5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there has been}} a gradual decline in <b>participation</b> in the {{nutrition}} assistance program. <b>Participation</b> in the previous Food Stamp program was estimated at 56%, more than 1.5 million island residents, before the creation of the block grant. By 1994, <b>participation</b> in the NAP program had decreased to 1.3 million, and by 2006 it had decreased to just over 1 million. While the Puerto Rican population has steadily increased throughout those periods, the percentage of the population participating in the nutrition assistance program has significantly declined. With Puerto Rico's current population estimated at 3,944,000 residents and a current estimated NAP <b>participation</b> of 1 million beneficiaries, the program's <b>participation</b> rate is roughly 26%, almost half of the <b>participation</b> under the original Food Stamp program in 1981.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the efficacy of a “defense in participations” policy consisting of competitors acquiring cross equity <b>participations</b> within the same industry to prevent hostile takeovers. This defense in <b>participations</b> strategy provides disincentive for raiders as partial ownerships increase market power of competitors and then reinforce the “outsider effect”. Also, we find conditions for a general result which states that takeovers are less profitable in an industry with <b>participations</b> rather than in an industry without any capital links. We provide information to regulators about the positive social impact of cross <b>participations</b> {{in the context of}} mergers, and expose an economic dilemma between a “laisser-faire” and an interventionist approach...|$|R

Afghanistan's female labor force <b>participation</b> rate, for example, was 15% in 2010 according to World Bank figures. That percentage nearly doubles to 28.9% if data from UNESCAP is cited. The same discrepancy is true for figures for Iran for which the World Bank lists its female <b>participation</b> rate at 16% in 2010 and UNESCAP lists it as 26.9%.
