500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We had our plans for {{what we were going to}} do; but when the bigger picture happened, all of our plans came unraveled. We don’t know what tomorrow will hold. When you make your own <b>plans,</b> <b>you</b> suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God wants us in the first place".|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 2012, his 50th birthday, Flea gave an {{interview}} with CNN discussing the Chili Peppers and {{was asked if he}} plans to continue with them. Flea responded by saying [...] "I love the Chili Peppers, and I would love to. If there's anything I know, it's every time you start making <b>plans,</b> <b>you</b> don't know what's going to come up next. Anything can happen. So I love being in the Chili Peppers and it's my home, and I've been doing it for more than half my life. Of course, during the course of doing it, there's been all kinds of ups and downs, and moments of extreme (positivity), floating on clouds of greatness, and times of just groveling, and misery, and uncertainty, and anger, and love and all those things. Like being in a family. I really can't predict. But I love being in it for now, and right now, about as far as I'm thinking is getting through this tour that we're doing, performing at the highest level possible, then hunkering down and writing another record." ...|$|E

Your whole mental and moral and {{physical and spiritual}} system must be out of kilter, my child. No vacation <b>plans!</b> <b>You</b> must have vacation <b>plans.</b> <b>You</b> must be going somewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot even command yourself, Ongoloo, to be a Christian. How, then, can you command others? It is the Great Father who {{has put it}} {{into your}} heart to wish to be a Christian. If you will now take His <b>plan,</b> <b>you</b> will succeed. If you refuse, and try your own <b>plan,</b> <b>you</b> shall fail." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY (spitefully, openly {{giving up}} her <b>plan).</b> <b>You</b> may save {{yourself}} the trouble. They are not there.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I daresay there are,’ {{my mother}} would say with conviction, ‘but if <b>you</b> try that <b>plan</b> <b>you</b> will never need to try another.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith, Madame," [...] he replied, [...] "'tis {{only because}} in making your rose-coloured <b>plans,</b> <b>you</b> are forgetting the most {{important}} factor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and his letters. He writes me {{pages on}} pages--with the most adorable little {{drawings}} and <b>plans.</b> <b>You</b> should see his diagrams!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Dias," [...] Harry said, [...] "we must {{talk over}} our <b>plans.</b> <b>You</b> {{said that we}} would not decide upon {{anything}} till we got here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Far better, Porus. The <b>plan</b> <b>you</b> suggest is an {{excellent}} one. We must try and make this chamber a little more fitting for Aemilia's abode." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn’t that," [...] said Blundell, slowly, [...] "but {{you told}} me to improve on your <b>plan,</b> <b>you</b> know, and I’ve been {{thinking}} out improvements." ...|$|R
6000|$|George Hatchard coughed agin. [...] "I 'ope you haven't {{been going}} on with that wicked <b>plan</b> <b>you</b> spoke {{to me about the}} other night," [...] he ses.|$|R
6000|$|... "These!" [...] he gasped. [...] "These are the <b>plans!...</b> <b>You</b> know! Mr. Butteridge--his machine! What died! I was the chap {{that went}} off in that balloon!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's all right,' said John, after contemplating his visitor's {{proceedings}} with infinite satisfaction. 'Now, {{about our}} <b>plans.</b> <b>You</b> {{are going to}} stay with me, of course. Where's your box?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That sounds fairly, Oswald, but 'tis {{always better}} {{to carry out}} the <b>plans</b> <b>you</b> have made; and this absence of Glendower, at the point arranged, to my mind augurs ill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you do {{like the}} <b>plan?</b> <b>You</b> didn't cry because I {{seemed to be}} kind of patronising? I truly didn't mean to be," [...] cried Rose, delighted.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sincerely}} hope," [...] {{said the}} wounded man, {{with a look}} of anxiety, [...] "that the <b>plan</b> <b>you</b> speak of does not involve the slaughter of these men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't deny," [...] I said, [...] "that the <b>plan</b> <b>you</b> propose {{meets the}} {{difficulty}} {{in a way that}} is very daring, and very ingenious, and very new. But----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] complained his wife, [...] "you're always raising {{objections}} to my most charming and sensible <b>plans.</b> <b>You</b> {{act as though}} you wanted Honora and Howard to stay in Rivington." ...|$|E
6000|$|CURTIS--[With {{a gesture}} of aversion.] I loathe this book-writing. It isn't my part, I realize now. But when I made the <b>plans</b> <b>you</b> speak of, how could I know that then? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} excellently, Mr. Davenant, and your escape from capture was an {{extraordinary}} one. Unfortunately, the betrayal of what was doing, and the arrest of our friends, is likely to upset all the <b>plans</b> <b>you</b> had arranged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, ça, M. le préfet," [...] he ejaculated abruptly, [...] "but meseems {{that the}} splendid <b>plan</b> <b>you</b> thought on merely {{consists}} in transferring responsibility from your shoulders to mine own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Anne, I've {{a little}} <b>plan.</b> <b>You</b> know how I loathe boarding. I've boarded {{for four years}} and I'm so tired of it. I don't feel like {{enduring}} three years more of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Father," [...] {{said the}} boy, {{in a serious}} tone, {{as they entered the}} forest, [...] "surely you don't mean to carry out in earnest the <b>plan</b> <b>you</b> spoke of to Grummidge and the others yesterday?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "sometimes {{you look}} {{about to see}} how you can alter matters and what <b>plans</b> <b>you</b> can make; but when they're made they won't always work. It's {{different}} when you don't have to look." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ena," [...] he said, {{dropping}} his voice a little, [...] "what {{are you going}} to do with that child? I have never quite understood your <b>plans.</b> <b>You</b> promised to talk to me about it while we were down here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{have put}} poison into Philip's mind, and the surest poison always works slow. Besides, the {{mischief}} has been done. Good-by. I {{will come and}} {{see you in a}} day or two, when I have made my <b>plans.</b> <b>You</b> see I mean to earn my letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why, I hardly know. By making play of it, {{you will}} have the {{greatest}} pleasure as you go along. But, in the other <b>plan,</b> <b>you</b> will have some good crops of vegetables, fruits, and flowers.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's why I'm here, Mr. Crow,' I said quickly, getting excited again. 'I'm just {{regularly}} {{dying to}} know how old Slowly Turtle can {{do anything to help}} along the <b>plan</b> <b>you</b> said you'd worked out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And wisely <b>planned.</b> <b>You</b> {{were right}} in {{starting}} out {{and seeing the}} distant parts. One may not always have the energy which such an expedition requires. You can keep Italy for a later and calmer day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--no, I haven't {{anybody in}} the world. That is why I hate vacation, that is why I've hated to hear you and the others {{discussing}} your vacation <b>plans.</b> <b>You</b> all have somebody to go to. It has just filled me up with hatred of my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's marked," [...] Ethel answered. [...] "But we are old friends, Andrew; {{follow your}} own bent, {{stick to your}} guns. Whatever <b>plans</b> <b>you</b> have {{determined}} on will be fair. Once before I {{told you not to}} be daunted; but it strikes me that you need less encouragement now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{your plans}} for my reform? Then, {{you have some}} <b>plans.</b> <b>You</b> are, so to speak, missionaries. Well, I imagine Marston is fitter for the job. His {{confidence}} can't be shaken, and he doesn't bother about the other fellow's point of view. The successful missionary is a fanatic." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bertha {{seized the}} moment to put a {{question}} she had been minded many times to ask. [...] "Lucius, what's your <b>plan?</b> <b>You</b> can't intend to do this all your life? Tell us your ambition--maybe we can help you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{ought to}} mention that he marked the parenthesis, in the air, with his finger. It seemed to me a very good <b>plan.</b> <b>You</b> know there's no sound to {{represent}} it--any more than there is for a question.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{it turned}} out a good <b>plan,</b> <b>you</b> see!" [...] remarked the girl to the wife. [...] "I knew it would with such as him. He's a dear good fellow, and {{you ought to be}} proud of un." ...|$|R
