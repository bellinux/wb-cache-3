Kelly Lawler of USA Today wrote, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} gender stereotypes. There is a very, very catchy melody", and compared the nature of the video to that of Taylor Swift's music video for [...] "Blank Space" [...] (2014). The video received accusations of sexism, and backlash from feminists. In a negative review of the video, Julia Shumway of State Press wrote, [...] "The video calls back to a romanticized version of the 1950s or '60s, featuring a yellow version of a little pink house, complete with gramophone and groovy colors". MTV News' Christina Garibaldi criticized the video, writing [...] "the video depicts Meghan going back to the 1950s, scrubbing floors and working hard in the kitchen". Trainor responded to the criticism of the video, saying, [...] "Just surprised the random places <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> me if I was being sexist.

They {{captured}} only 26.2 per cent of the popular vote— two points lower than the disastrous showing in 1984 under John Turner and only four points ahead of the party's worst ever result in 1867. Dion said that the party lost {{because he did not}} get the Liberal message out, and took responsibility saying “If <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> why, it's because I failed.” Dion added that he {{never had a chance to}} establish his personal image with voters because of the Conservative ads depicting him as a [...] "dithering egghead". Liberal veterans described Dion as a [...] "lone wolf" [...] who dismissed suggestions from his senior advisers to avoid using the Green Shift as an election platform. A party insider also said that Dion was reluctant to emphasize the Liberal team because he felt that he was being overshadowed by leadership rival Bob Rae.|$|E
2500|$|In 1863, the now Emperor Napoleon III {{began to}} loosen {{some of the}} {{restrictions}} on political opposition. Thiers was encouraged to re-enter political life by his friends, and by a new acquaintance, the Prussian ambassador to Paris, Otto von Bismarck. Thiers {{decided to run for}} election to the Assembly. On 31 May 1863, at the age of sixty-six, he was elected as a deputy for Paris. He returned to the Assembly on 6 November 1863 and took his seat, but found that under Napoleon III the protocol had changed. Instead of speaking from the tribune, members were only allowed to speak from their seats. Thiers was uncomfortable with this way of speaking, and his first few speeches were failures, but he soon mastered the form. On 11 January 1864 he delivered a blistering attack on Napoleon's government, and listed the [...] "necessary liberties" [...] he said were lacking in France: [...] "Security of the citizen against violence from individuals or from the arbitrary use of power; [...] liberty, but not impunity, for the press; free elections; freedom of the people's representatives; [...] and public opinion expressed by the majority guiding the steps of the government. These are the liberties that the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> for today; [...] tomorrow, in a tone very different, they may be demanding them." [...] The speech made him again a leading figure of the opposition; he was cheered by a crowd outside his house when he returned home.|$|E

So compared to what people {{have been talking about}} here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point." [...] CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was [...] "mixed": [...] "Some people react positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they – many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from – it's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party. It says that an apology is not enough for the torture [...] of Iraqi prisoners." ...|$|E

I dined with the Secretary; but we did no business after dinner, and at six I walked into the fields; the days are grown pure and long; then I went to visit Perceval(6) and his family, whom I had seen but twice since they came to town.
