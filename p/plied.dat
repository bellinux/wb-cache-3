40|$|A {{criterion}} for matrix failure of laminated composite <b>plies</b> in transverse tension and in-plane shear is developed {{by examining the}} mechanics of transverse matrix crack growth. Matrix cracks are assumed to initiate from manufacturing defects and can propagate within planes parallel to the fiber direction and normal to the <b>ply</b> mid-plane. Fracture mechanics models of cracks in unidirectional laminates, embedded <b>plies</b> and outer <b>plies</b> are developed to determine the onset and direction of propagation for unstable crack growth. The models for each <b>ply</b> configuration relate <b>ply</b> thickness and <b>ply</b> toughness to the corresponding in-situ <b>ply</b> strength.

5|$|As a {{respected}} military hero and large landowner, he held local office and {{was elected to}} the Virginia provincial legislature, representing Frederick County in the House of Burgesses for seven years beginning in 1758. In the 1758 election, he <b>plied</b> the voters with 170 gallons of rice punch, beer, wine, hard cider, and brandy, though he was largely absent while serving on the Forbes Expedition. With the help of several local elites, Washington won election with roughly forty percent of the vote, defeating three other candidates for the seat. Early in his legislative career, Washington rarely spoke, but he became a prominent critic of Britain's taxation and mercantilist policies in the 1760s.|$|E
5|$|Charlton was {{approached}} by the FAI to manage the Republic of Ireland in December 1985. He was the first foreigner to be appointed to the role. In May 1986, Ireland won the Iceland Triangular Tournament at Laugardalsvöllur, in Iceland's capital of Reykjavík, with a 2–1 victory over Iceland and a 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia. By this time Charlton had developed his tactics, which {{were based on the}} traditional British 4–4–2 system, as opposed to the continental approach of using deep-lying midfielders, as he noted that most of the Ireland international players <b>plied</b> their trade in England. Crucially he instructed all members of his team to pressure opposition players and in particular force ball-playing defenders into mistakes.|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{structures}} are generally assembled with face sheet <b>plies</b> in their application. It {{is necessary to}} understand the influence of assembled <b>plies</b> on deformation and energy absorption before using textile composite cellular structures in engineering design. In this paper, effects of <b>ply</b> assembly, outer <b>ply</b> material, outer <b>ply</b> thickness, and loading area on energy absorption and deformation of the applied structure including cellular structure and face sheet <b>plies</b> are investigated. Three-dimensional finite element analyses are carried out employing orthotropic mechanical properties of the applied materials, textile composite, wood, E-glass, aluminium alloy 2024 -T 3 and unidirectional fiber-epoxy composite T- 300. The predicted results show that deformation and distributed strain energy density of both outer and inner surfaces of the applied structure are significantly affected by <b>ply</b> assembly, outer <b>ply</b> material, outer <b>ply</b> thickness, and loading area...|$|R

The hamlet of Kersal, which now forms part of the City of Salford, was gifted to the Cluniac Priory of Lenton, near Nottingham, in 1142.

5|$|Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons, and {{physicians}} were suspected {{because of the}} manner of the mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City Police, indicates that the alibis were investigated of local butchers and slaughterers, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry. A report from Inspector Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months. Some contemporary figures, including Queen Victoria, thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that <b>plied</b> between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks, and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday. The cattle boats were examined but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is {{a leading}} cause of human {{diseases}} such as pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and otitis media. Pneumolysin (<b>Ply)</b> is an important virulence factor of S. pneumoniae and a promising future vaccine target. However, the expansion of clones carrying <b>ply</b> alleles with reduced hemolytic activity has been observed in serotypes associated with outbreaks of invasive disease and includes an allele identified in a highly virulent serotype 1 isolate (<b>ply</b> 4496). The virulence of Ply-deficient and <b>ply</b> allelic-replacement derivatives of S. pneumoniae D 39 was compared with that of wild-type D 39. In addition, the protective immunogenicity of <b>Ply</b> against pneumococci with low versus high hemolytic activity was also investigated. Replacement of D 39 <b>ply</b> with <b>ply</b> 4496 resulted in a small but statistically significant reduction of virulence. However, both native Ply- and <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing strains were significantly more virulent than a Ply-deficient mutant. While the numbers of both Ply- and <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing isolate cells were higher in the blood than the numbers of Ply-deficient mutant cells, the growth of the <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing strain was superior to that of the wild type in the first 15 h postchallenge. <b>Ply</b> immunization provided protection regardless of the hemolytic activity of the challenge strain. In summary, we show that low-hemolytic-activity <b>Ply</b> alleles contribute to systemic virulence and may provide a survival advantage in the blood. Moreover, pneumococci expressing such alleles remain vulnerable to Ply-based vaccines. Richard M. Harvey, Abiodun D. Ogunniyi, Austen Y. Chen, and James C. Pato...|$|R
40|$|Pneumolysin (<b>PLY),</b> an {{important}} protein virulence factor {{of the human}} bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, could {{be a candidate for}} inclusion in a new anti-streptococcal vaccine. <b>PLY</b> solution species from monomer via multimeric intermediates to ring-shaped oligomers were studied with time-dependent sedimentation velocity in the analytical ultracentrifuge (AUC). Hydrodynamic bead modeling was used to interpret the data obtained. <b>PLY</b> remained mostly monomeric in solution; intermediate <b>PLY</b> multimers were detected in small quantities. Current understanding of <b>PLY</b> molecular mechanism is guided by a model built {{on the basis of its}} homology with perfringolysin O (PFO) for which there is an atomic structure.
