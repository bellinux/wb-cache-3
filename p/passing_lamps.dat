60|$|Somerset, as I have written, was not unprepared; it {{had long}} been his {{particular}} pleasure to rehearse his conduct in the most unlikely situations; and this, among others, of the patrician ravisher, was one he had familiarly studied. Strange as it may seem, however, he could find no apposite remark; and as the lady, on her side, vouchsafed no further sign, they continued to drive in silence through the streets. Except for alternate flashes from the <b>passing</b> <b>lamps,</b> the carriage was plunged in obscurity; and beyond {{the fact that the}} fittings were luxurious, and that the lady was singularly small and slender in person and, all but one gloved hand, still swathed in her costly veil, the young man could decipher no detail of an inspiring nature. The suspense began to grow unbearable. Twice he cleared his throat, and twice the whole resources of the language failed him. In similar scenes, when he had forecast them on the theatre of fancy, his presence of mind had always been complete, his eloquence remarkable; and at this disparity between the rehearsal and the performance, he began to be seized with a panic of apprehension. Here, on the very threshold of adventure, suppose him ignominiously to fail; suppose that after ten, twenty, or sixty seconds of still uninterrupted silence, the lady should touch the check-string and re-deposit him, weighed and found wanting, on the common street! Thousands of persons of no mind at all, he reasoned, would be found more equal to the part; could, that very instant, by some decisive step, prove the lady's choice to have been well inspired, and put a stop to this intolerable silence.|$|E

5000|$|Oxidant - {{there is}} an oxidant {{in the form of}} air present outside the lamp. The design of the lamp must allow the oxidant to <b>pass</b> into the <b>lamp</b> (and {{therefore}} exhaust gases to escape) or else the lamp will extinguish.|$|R
60|$|As they <b>passed</b> {{under the}} <b>lamps</b> {{he saw her}} face lifted, the eyes shining, the {{delicate}} nostrils dilated, as of one who scents battle and laughs to herself. She seemed to laugh with a certain proud, sinister recklessness. His hands trembled with desire.|$|R

50|$|Creating Colors from White Light:A {{projector}} using 3LCD technology {{works by}} first splitting the white {{light from the}} lamp into its three primary colors of red, green and blue by <b>passing</b> the <b>lamp</b> light through special dichroic filter / reflector assemblies called “dichroic mirrors.” Each dichroic mirror only allows specific colored wavelengths of light to pass through while reflecting the rest away. In this way, the white light is split into its three primary color beams and each is directed toward, and subsequently through its own LCD panel.|$|R
60|$|The {{door opened}} slowly, {{and out of}} the half obscurity of the passage a thickset figure lurched toward him into the full light of the room. Randolph half rose, and then sank back into his chair, awed, spellbound, and motionless. He saw the figure {{standing}} plainly before him; he saw distinctly the familiar furniture of his room, the storm-twinkling lights in the windows opposite, the flash of <b>passing</b> carriage <b>lamps</b> in the street below. But the figure before him was none other than the dead man of whom he had just been thinking.|$|R
60|$|We {{found the}} night-air keen; {{or at least}} I did: {{he did not seem}} to feel it; but it was very still, and the star-sown sky spread cloudless. I was wrapped in a fur shawl. We took some turns on the pavement; in <b>passing</b> under a <b>lamp,</b> Graham {{encountered}} my eye.|$|R

50|$|On 3 May 1870 {{there was}} a gas {{explosion}} at the station. The platform edging stones were built on a double wall of bricks, separated by a gap, into which gas had leaked.

60|$|Other rocks fell also at a distance, {{making a}} great noise, and somehow I found {{myself on the}} ground, my stool had slid away from me. Next {{followed}} a muffled, awful roar, and with it came a blast of wind blowing where wind never blew before {{since the beginning of}} the world, that with a terrible wailing howled itself to silence in the thousand recesses of the cave city. As it <b>passed</b> our <b>lamps</b> went out. Lastly, quite a minute later I should think, there was a thud, as though something of enormous weight had fallen on the surface of the earth far above us.|$|R
60|$|I had to apologise, of course. The wheels rumbled and jolted {{over the}} cobbles of Edinburgh; the windows rattled and shook under the {{uncertain}} gusts of the city.

Fortunately, Fat Cat is forced to <b>pass</b> the <b>lamp</b> on to his henchmen after he exhausts his own three wishes, allowing Monterey to trick the henchmen into making wishes that will actually benefit his friends until Chip and Dale can get their hands on the lamp. The chipmunks subsequently wish that the previous events never happened, undoing the events that led to Montery finding the lamp.|$|R

60|$|Edith said no more, {{but looked}} on thoughtfully while they {{prepared}} {{the table for}} two persons, and set the wine upon it. She arose before they had finished, and taking a <b>lamp,</b> <b>passed</b> into the bed-chamber and into the drawing-room, where she hurriedly but narrowly examined all the doors; particularly one in the former room that opened on the passage in the wall.

60|$|He had no {{ground for}} {{thinking}} Daly noticed {{him during the}} meal, and {{did not see the}} man for an hour afterwards. Then finding that he wanted a railway guide he had left in his room, he went up the stairs and along a corridor. As he did so, he saw a man and woman some distance in front. The carpet was thick, and it was obvious that the others did not hear him, because the man put his arm round his companion's waist. So far as Foster could see, the girl yielded willingly to his embrace, and not wishing to overtake them he stopped. Next moment they <b>passed</b> a <b>lamp</b> and he noted that the man was Daly, though he was unable to distinguish his companion's face. He, however, thought he would know her dress again.|$|R

60|$|The Arab was a swarthy, sinewy man of forty, {{with all}} his fibres {{indurated}} and worked down to the whip-cord meagreness and rigidity of a racer, his frame presenting a perfect picture {{of the sort of}} being one would fancy suited to the exhausting motion of a dromedary, and to the fare of a desert. He carried a formidable knife, in addition to the long musket of which he had been deprived, and his principal garment was the coarse mantle of camel's hair, that served equally for cap, coat and robe. His wild dark eyes gleamed, as Captain Truck <b>passed</b> the <b>lamp</b> before his face, and it was sufficiently apparent that he fancied a very serious misfortune had befallen him. As any verbal communication was out of the question, some abortive attempts were essayed by the two mariners to make themselves understood by signs, which, like some men's reasoning, produced results exactly contrary to what had been expected.|$|R

We present a method for actively controlling the illumination in a room so that it is consistent with a virtual world. This procedure triggers natural adaptation processes in the human visual system. Combined with conventional or high dynamic range displays, the system improves the realism of transitions from dark to light environments and vice versa. It also helps with directional illumination in the user’s peripheral field of view. We describe both the hardware and the software aspects of this approach, and discuss the results of an informal user survey that we conducted to verify the concept. ...|$|R
50|$|Ultraviolet {{germicidal}} irradiation - UVGI {{can be used}} {{to sterilize}} air that <b>passes</b> UV <b>lamps</b> via forced air. Air purification UVGI systems can be freestanding units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves micro-organisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead micro-organisms. For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drainpan of cooling system will keep micro-organisms from forming in these naturally damp places. The most effective method for treating the air rather than the coils is in-line duct systems, these systems are placed {{in the center of the}} duct and parallel to the air flow.|$|R

60|$|The dwarf again whistled, and summoned {{from beneath}} a companion. This second figure ascended {{in the same}} manner as the first; but it was a female arm in this second {{instance}} which upheld the lamp from the subterranean vault out of which these presentments arose, and it was a female form, much resembling the first in shape and proportions, which slowly emerged from the floor. Her dress was also of red samite, fantastically cut and flounced, as if she had been dressed for some exhibition of mimes or jugglers; and with the same minuteness which her predecessor had exhibited, she <b>passed</b> the <b>lamp</b> over her face and person, which seemed to rival the male's in ugliness. But with all this most unfavourable exterior, there was one trait in the features of both which argued alertness and intelligence in the most uncommon degree. This arose from the brilliancy of their eyes, which, deep-set beneath black and shaggy brows, gleamed with a lustre which, like that in the eye of the toad, seemed to make some amends for the extreme ugliness of countenance and person.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Instantaneous image {{motion in}} a camera {{on-board}} a mobile robot contains rich {{information about the}} structure of the environment. We present a new framework, optical flow templates, for capturing this information and an experimental proof-of-concept that labels superpixels using them. Optical flow templates encode the possible optical flow fields due to egomotion for a specific environment shape and robot attitude. We label optical flow in superpixels with the environment shape they image according to how consistent they are with each template. Specifically, in this paper we employ templates highly relevant to mobile robot navigation. Image regions consistent with ground plane and distant structure templates likely indicate free and traversable space, while image regions consistent with neither of these are likely to be nearby objects that are obstacles. We evaluate our method qualitatively and quantitatively in an urban driving scenario, labeling the ground plane, and obstacles such as <b>passing</b> cars, <b>lamp</b> posts, and parked cars. One key advantage of this framework is low computational complexity, and we demonstrate per-frame computation times of 20 ms, excluding optical flow and superpixel calculation. I...|$|R

50|$|For {{that major}} change in approach, the light used had to be both {{monochromatic}} and coherent, properties that were already a requirement on the radar radiation. Lasers also then being in the future, the best then-available approximation to a coherent light source was the output of a mercury vapor <b>lamp,</b> <b>passed</b> through a color filter that was matched to the lamp spectrum's green band, and then concentrated as well as possible onto a very small beam-limiting aperture. While the resulting amount of light was so weak that very long exposure times had to be used, a workable optical correlator was assembled in time to be used when appropriate data became available.|$|R
50|$|The lamp {{is in part}} a {{development}} of the Geordie. Air enters into a ring near the base which is protected by gauze or perforated plate. The air passes {{down the side of}} the <b>lamp</b> <b>passing</b> through a series of gauze covered holes and enters the base through another yet another series of gauze covered holes. Any attempt to unscrew the base causes the lever (shown at f in the illustration) to extinguish the flame. The gauze covered holes and passageways restrict the flow to that required for combustion, so if any part of the oxygen is replaced by firedamp, then the flame is extinguished for want of oxidant.|$|R
