5|$|The Odyssey was {{released}} by Magnavox in September 1972. After initially ordering a production run of 50,000 units, prior to release Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built up a large stock of the systems, as market testing had shown an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers and not through general retailers; Magnavox felt that as the first video game console it would draw consumers into its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased along with a Magnavox television. There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey product manager Bob Fritsche recalls selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalls sales being closer to 100,000. Baer has stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high price—US$100 being the equivalent of US$587 in 2017—and because of Magnavox restricting sales to their dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealership salespeople would try to mislead customers to that effect {{in order to try}} to sell more television sets. Magnavox assistant <b>product</b> <b>planner</b> Don Emry has noted that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not with the production run.|$|E

40|$|Developing an {{effective}} marketing mix {{is an important}} task for <b>product</b> <b>planners</b> seeking to gain competitive advantage in industrial markets. In these markets, product planning is made complex due to inadequate data sources, stochastic behavior, and the peculiar response of industrial markets to marketing instruments. By employing a simulation model as {{the heart of a}} marketing decision support system (MKDSS) it is possible to model the stochastic elements of the marketing mix, the interactions between marketing instruments, and competitive effects, to support marketing decision-making processes. This paper describes such a simulation model for aiding <b>product</b> <b>planners</b> in developing the marketing mix. The model utilizes Monte Carlo simulation in representing market dynamics, comparative marketing efforts, and competitive actions, in order to assess the effectiveness of combinations of marketing actions, that is, marketing policies. It is therefore viewed as a tool for improving decision-making effectiveness, and the basis of a marketing decision support system (MKDSS) for marketing managers. The methodology for applying the decision model is outlined, together with an illustrative example of its use, based on data from case study in a British firm. industrial marketing Monte Carlo simulation marketing mix decisions decision support systems...|$|R

Using a shortened Ranger four-wheel drive chassis, the 1983 Bronco II was only slightly longer and wider than the 1966 generation. In sharp contrast to its spartan predecessor, the Bronco II offered all of the convenience features available on any Ranger. Unlike its larger namesake, the Bronco II was not designed with a removable top; it was distinguished with large side windows which extended into the rear roofline.|$|R

50|$|In May 2007, a Toyota {{spokesperson}} stated 20 camshaft failures {{occurred in}} Toyota's all-new 5.7 L 3UR-FE V-8 engine.

In the event of a camshaft failure Toyota will either replace the engine and extend the warranty or repurchase the truck from the owner.

Though they are positioned to manage stock, they still operate within the limits of the buying plan, and merchandisers ensure they remain within this realm. Buyers provide guidelines for distribution such as the type of stores where product should be distributed; for example, a product may have only been acquired for the top 3 stores. The team also supports the goals of an organization through being instrumental in responding to trends.|$|R

[...] Following the firing of Lee Iaccoca in 1978, the expansion of the Mark was limited to the four-door sedan.|$|R
40|$|Managers and {{designers}} for technological systems face a common difficulty: new projects or products are inherently risky, both technologically and financially, {{especially given the}} rate of change in the high technology, deregulated economy. Consequently, they need solid methods for valuing prospective investments, so that they can justify their development strategies. Their fundamental problem is compounded by two methodological difficulties: (a) traditional net present value (discounted cash flow) evaluations are inadequate for many risky projects, and (b) the available methods for valuing these projects are limited and often impractical. This paper identifies practical solutions to this problem. Conceptually, it is crucial to focus on dynamic strategies of development, rather than on specific projects or <b>products.</b> <b>Planners</b> need to understand that they are consciously managing risk, and will do so most effectively by developing options they can exploi...|$|R
40|$|Product {{development}} can support proactive CSR strategies by changing product features, materials, and processes {{in order to}} reduce or even eliminate negative environmental and social impacts. However, the CSR literature provides little practical guidance for new product development, but promotes general principles for responding to environmental and social issues. One of these guiding principles is the concept of stakeholder engagement, but to date, few practical approaches for integrating stakeholder views and needs into product development exist. To address this gap, the paper discusses the use of Fuzzy Cognitive Map Modeling. The method, which has been applied in participatory stakeholder studies and in product development before, but never in conjunction, helps <b>product</b> <b>planners</b> to understand and assess stakeholder needs and to select product concepts that respond to them. It thus allows organizations to remain true to their CSR strategies...|$|R

50|$|Work {{on the new}} car {{began in}} 1970 under project code M550. Development was led by Matra's head of {{engineering}} and design Phillipe Guédon and Chrysler-Simca <b>product</b> <b>planner</b> Jacques Rousseau. Additional direction for the design was provided by Chrysler-Simca planner Marc Honoré. Honoré identified Simca's strongest market as being cars displacing between 1.3 and 1.5 litres and suggested the team focus on building a car of that class, which would constrain {{the size of the}} car if performance was to be acceptable. As many as possible of the major components were sourced from the Chrysler-Simca parts inventory. Although the engine, gearbox and many suspension elements came directly from the Simca 1100, this new Matra was to be a mid-engined car rather than front-wheel drive like the donor car.|$|E
