5|$|In 1666, Newton {{observed}} that the spectrum of colours exiting a <b>prism</b> {{in the position of}} minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the <b>prism</b> is circular, which is to say, the <b>prism</b> refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E

5|$|From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During {{this period}} he {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum {{produced by a}} <b>prism</b> could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second <b>prism.</b> Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd {{recorded}} The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The {{title is}} {{an allusion to}} lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on Dark Side while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting <b>prism</b> design on the cover. Thorgerson's Dark Side album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a <b>prism,</b> which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prism</b> {{made its}} {{official}} debut in Ireland, where it charted atop the charts. In the United States, the album {{opened at the}} top spot on the US Billboard 200, becoming her second consecutive number one album in the country. The album sold 286,000 copies in its first week. <b>Prism</b> acquired the largest first week sum by a female artist for 2013, surpassing Miley Cyrus' Bangerz (270,000 copies). However, this feat was surpassed by Beyoncé's self-titled fifth album, Beyoncé (617,213 digital copies), released in December 2013. At {{the time of its}} release <b>Prism</b> had the fourth highest first week sales of the year for a pop record, trailing behind Daft Punk's May 2013 album Random Access Memories, which sold 339,000 copies and Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience which debuted to 968,000 copies and its follow-up The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2 which debuted to just 350,000 copies. The first week sales also marks Perry's highest weekly sales, with her previous album Teenage Dream selling 192,000 copies in its first week in August 2010. <b>Prism</b> has the highest first week sales for a female pop artist since Madonna's twelfth studio album, MDNA. <b>Prism</b> sold 92,000 copies during its second week of availability, falling to number two on the Billboard 200. This represented the smallest sales dip for a number one album in the United States since the August 2013 release of The Civil Wars. <b>Prism</b> has spent 17 weeks so far in the top-ten on the chart. The album has been certified double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 1.7 million copies in the United States as of February 2017. In June 2014, Billboard announced its Mid Year Top 20 Best-selling albums with <b>Prism</b> coming in at number 9 with sales of 453,000 in 2014 alone. Pharrell Williams and Perry were the only two people in to have an album and a single in the Mid Year Top 10 charts. In February 2015, following Perry's performance at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, sales for the album increased by 85% and the album rebounded back into the Top 50.|$|E

40|$|Organic {{components}} of typical prismatic layers in several molluscan shells were reexamined by applying {{scanning electron microscopy}} to preparations treated with the freeze-dry or the critical-point-dry method, with the result showing the following: The interior of <b>prisms</b> is almost filled up with a spongy intraprismatic matrix. Also three principal types of <b>prisms</b> are distinguishable {{according to the state}} of development and the histochemical nature of a vertical (interprismatic) wall. Namely, <b>prisms</b> of type 1 are separated from their neighbor by a rigid vertical wall, and are represented by calcite simple <b>prisms</b> of Pinctada and aragonite simple <b>prisms</b> of Anodonta: <b>prisms</b> of type 2 are separated by a compound (partly rigid and partly spongy) vertical wall, and are represented by aragonite simple <b>prisms</b> of Unio; <b>prisms</b> of type 3 are separated by a spongy vertical wall, and are represented by composite <b>prisms</b> of Tapes and Peronidia. These findings suggest that type 2 is intermediate between types 1 and 3, and that transformation of an interprismatic matrix from a "primitive" rigid matrix to a more "advanced" spongy one has probably taken place in the course of evolution of <b>prisms.</b> In addition, the histochemical nature of the rigid matrix is acidophilic like the shell epidermis. Meanwhile, the spongy matrix, regardless of being inter- or intraprismatic, is basophilic, and will have some connections with mineralization of <b>prisms...</b>|$|R

5|$|The impasse {{is broken}} by the return of Miss <b>Prism,</b> whom Lady Bracknell {{recognises}} as the person who, twenty-eight years earlier, as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy {{for a walk in}} a perambulator (baby carriage) and never returned. Challenged, Miss <b>Prism</b> explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator, and the baby in a handbag, which she had left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the very same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the elder son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as a suitor for Gwendolen after all.|$|E
