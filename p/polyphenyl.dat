We consider the enumeration of tree-like <b>polyphenyls</b> (C(6) nH(4 n+ 2)).

By characterizing the symmetry groups with respect to TL-polyphenyls and MTL-polyphenyls, we establish two functional equations for these two generating functions. This yields for the first time an efficient recursion formula for calculating the numbers t(n) and r(n). The two functional equations are also the fundamentals for analyzing their asymptotic behaviors, from which we derive the precise asymptotic values for both r(n) and t(n). The resulting asymptotic values are shown to fit well to the numerical results obtained by using our recursion formula.

5000|$|... 5R4E PPE has {{a surface}} tension of 49.9 dynes/cm, which is amongst {{the highest in}} pure organic liquids. Because of this, this PPE and the other PPEs do not {{effectively}} wet metal surfaces. This property is useful when migration of a lubricant {{from one part of}} the equipment to another part must be avoided, such as in certain electronic devices. A thin film of <b>polyphenyl</b> ether on a surface is not a thin contiguous film as one would envision, but rather comprises tiny droplets. This PPE property tends to keep the film stationary, or at least to cause it to remain in the area where the lubrication is needed, rather than migrating away by spreading and forming a new surface. As a result, contamination of other components and equipment, which do not require a lubricant, is avoided. The high surface tension of PPEs, therefore, makes them useful in lubricating electronic contacts. [...] <b>Polyphenyl</b> ether lubricants have a 30-year history of commercial service for connectors with precious and base metal contacts in telecom, automotive, aerospace, instrumentation and general-purpose applications. [...] In addition to maintaining the current flow and providing long-term lubrication, PPEs offer protection to connectors against aggressive acidic and oxidative environments. By providing a protective surface film, <b>polyphenyl</b> ethers not only protect connectors against corrosion but also against vibration-related wear and abrasion that leads to fretting wear.

Of these, the model that predicts the room-temperature crystal structure well has been used to understand the behavior of ρ -terphenyl under pressure.

High Pressure Res. 2002, 22, 105). The nonplanar structure of ρ -terphenyl transforms to a planar structure with gradual disappearance of disorder associated with ring flipping.

Preliminary investigations on SAP (sintered aluminum powder) alloys are reported. The mechanical properties of SAP at elevated temperatures are oniy slightly altered by prolonged heating. Its structaral stability is not effected by temperatures at 450 deg C and lower temperatures, blistering starts at 520 deg C and fissures appear in thin walled SAP 930 tubes at temperatures higher than 500 deg C. Thermal cyclings have no influence on the mechanical and structural stability of SAP 930 tabes. Vacuum tightness of SAP tabes can be maintained with temperatures up to 620 deg C.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the interaction of a neutron with molecular nuclei and with a special view to organic molecules (<b>polyphenyls),</b> a preliminary analysis is made in this paper on the scattering by bound protons in the benzene molecule (this molecule is assumed to be a fundamental dynamic unit). In evaluating the effect of the molecular dynamics on the scattering of thermal neutrons, several physical hypotheses have been tried. The main purpose of these assumptions is to enable us, when considering explicitly the dynamics of the proton, to investigate both the influence of the different individual features of the molecular dynamics and the effect of different mathematical approximations on the explicit consideration of such dynamical features. This has been performed with reference to experimental results both on integral quantities (e. g. the total scattering cross-section) and on differential ones. In {{the framework}} of the gas model we have first investigated the effect of a single " structure " parameter, namely the effective mass Mo. We have then considered a " molecular gas " by introducing two parameters (Krieger-Nelkin) : one, of the effective mass Mo type, accounting for rotations and translations and a second one formally taking into account the elastic vibrational transitions from the ground state. The possibility is here discussed of calculating the best fitted value of the parameter Mo from experimental data, the value of the vibrational parameter being determined once the frequency distribution of the proton in the molecule is known. The particular structure of this vibrational spectrum induced us to discuss a " two-vibrational model " in analogy to the Nelkin model for the H 2 O molecule, where, in the explicit consideration of the various degrees of freedom, the complicated vibrational spectrum has been replaced by an isotropic, very simplified one. Finally we have treated as predominant the purely vibrational features (still in the frame of the harmonic approximation), considering explicitly the anisotropy of the vibrational spectrum and evaluating in a more correct way the relation of the molecular orientations. In view of this, we started by neglecting (as a first approximation) the rotational and translational degrees of freedom; these will be appropriately introduced later by means of a correction in the vibrational spectrum in the low energy region. We also made a comparison between this analysis, which—in the frame work of an analogy with a polycrystalline assembly of graphite microcrystals — adopts the formalism of Schofield and Hassitt and the set of more refined and mathematically more correct assumptions contained in the Summit code which translates the Parks' viewpoint...|$|R
40|$|Crystallographically solids with {{well defined}} crystal {{structures}} are normally {{assumed to be}} highly ordered. However, {{it is not uncommon}} to find considerable degree of disorder amongst many of these crystalline substances. Disorder among crystalline substances often arise from the rotational motion which leads to the well known class of plastic crystalline substances. Typically, globular molecules such as methane, carbon tetrachloride or adamantane exhibit plastic crystalline phase with significant amount of orientational disorder. In many other substances, disorder arises from torsional motion as in the case of biphenyl, p- or o-terphenyls, stilbene or azobenzenes. In case of molecules with flexible segment, such as alkanes or surfactants, motion of the terminal methyl group or terminal ethyl group is responsible for the observed disorder. Chapter 1 discusses various aspects of disorder in crystals. A new pressure induced solid phase of biphenyl is reported at room temperature. Isothermal-isobaric ensemble variable shape simulation cell Monte Carlo calculations are reported on biphenyl at 300 K as a function of pressure between 0 - 4 GPa. The potential proposed by Williams for inter-molecular and Benkert-Heine-Simmons(BHS) for intramolecular interactions have been employed. Different properties indicating changes in the crystal structure, molecular structure, distributions of inter- and intra-molecular energy are reported as a function of pressure. With increase in pressure beyond 0. 8 GPa, the dihedral angle distribution undergoes a change from a bimodal to an unimodal distribution. The changes in IR and Raman spectra across the transition computed from ab initio calculations are in agreement with the experimental measurements. It is shown that at pressures larger than 0. 8 GPa, competition between inter-molecular interactions with intra-molecular terms v/z., conjugation energy and the ortho-ortho repulsion favors a planar biphenyl due to better packing and consequently a predominant inter-molecular term. The exact value of the transition pressure will depend on the accuracy of the inter- and intra-molecular potentials employed here. p-terphenyl has been modeled at 300 K and atmospheric pressure with different potential models. Modified Fihppini parameters for mtermolecular interactions and BHS potential for inter-ring torsion predict the structure of p-terphenyl reasonably well. Pressure variation calculations are carried out with this combination of inter- and intra-molecular potential. The structure as a function of pressure upto 5 GPa has been compared with experimental structure provided by Puschnig et al. The transformation of functional form of the potential energy curve (associated with the inter-ring flipping) from W-shaped to [/-shaped form as a function of pressure has been observed. This is in excellent agreement with previous studies of <b>polyphenyls</b> including biphenyl and p-hexaphenyl. The complete planarization of molecules occurs when the pressure range is 1. 0 GPa- 1. 5 GPa. Molecular simulation of solid stilbene in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble with variable shape simulation are reported. Structure has been characterized by means of lattice parameters and radial distribution functions. Simulations show existence of pedal-like motion at higher temperatures in agreement with the recent X-ray diffraction measurements by Ogawa and co-workers and several others previously. Difference in energy between the major and minor conformers, barrier to conformational change at both the crystallographic sites have been calculated. Temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant between the two conformers as well as the rate of conversion between the con-formers at the two sites have been calculated. These are in agreement with the recent analysis by Harada and Ogawa of non-equilibrium states obtained by rapid cooling of stilbene. Volume and total intermolecular energy suggest existence of two transitions in agreement with previous Raman phonon spectroscopic and calorimetric studies. They seem to be associated with change from order to disorder at the two sites. Ab initio calculations coupled with simulations suggest that the disorder accounts for only a small part of the observed shortening in ethylene bond ength. A Monte Carlo simulation with variable shape simulation cell has been carried out on stilbene. The study attempts to investigate the disorder at various pressures upto 4 GPa. It is seen that the population of minor conformers at sites 1 and 2 decrease with increase in pressure. Population of minor conformers at site 2 decreases to zero by 1. 5 GPa. In contrast, the population of minor conformers at site 1 remains finite for the runs reported here. It is seen that the population of minor conformers at site 1 is higher than at site 2 at room temperature which is to be expected on the basis of the activation energies. Associated changes in the unit cell as well as molecular conformation are discussed. Isothermal-isobaric ensemble Monte Carlo simulation of adamantane has been earned out with variable shape simulation cell. Low temperature crystalline phase and the room temperature plastic crystalline phases have been studied employing the Williams potential. We show that at room temperature, the plastic crystalline phase transforms to the crystalline phase on increase in pressure. Further, we show that this is the same phase as the low temperature ordered tetragonal phase of adamantane. The high pressure ordered phase appears to be characterized by a slightly larger shift of the first peak towards lower value of r in C-C, C-H and H-H rdfs as compared to the low temperature tetragonal phase. Co-existence curve between the crystalline and plastic crystalline phase has been obtained approximately upto a pressure of 4 GPa. We investigate the equation of state, variation of lattice parameters and the distortion of molecular geometry of low temperature phase of adamantane upto 26 GPa pressure. A rigid and a flexible model of adamantane have been studied using variable shape simulation within the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. Including six low frequency modes obtained from density functional theory carried out on a single-molecule has incorporated the flexibility. These calculations used Becke 3 -parameter method and Lee-Yang-Parr electron correlation functional with 6 - 31 G(d) basis set. The simulated equation of state and variation of c/a ratio as a function of pressure are compared with the experimental results. The results are in good agreement with high pressure experiments.
