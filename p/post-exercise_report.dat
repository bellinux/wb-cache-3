40|$|SummaryIntroductionRespiratory {{symptoms}} {{in relationship to}} exercise, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and exercise-induced asthma (EIA) are very common in elite winter athletes. Symptom-based screening for BHR would facilitate selection of athletes with possible EIA. ObjectivesThe aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of self-reported symptoms as predictors of BHR in an unselected population of adult elite cross-country skiers. MethodsForty-six Swedish adult skiers competing at national or international level were included. They had a mean (SD) training volume in the past 12 months of 593 (122) hours. Twenty-four subjects had previous physician-diagnosed asthma. The European Community Respiratory Health Survey questionnaire was used to evaluate the presence of respiratory symptoms. BHR was defined as bronchoconstriction to either eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation, dry powder mannitol or methacholine provocation. ResultsThe “classical” EIA symptom of shortness of breath <b>post-exercise</b> was <b>reported</b> by 17 % of all skiers. Eight subjects (17 %) had BHR. None of the self-reported respiratory symptoms had high positive predictive values. However, symptoms caused by grass or pollen had high negative predictive values. DiscussionEIA in elite winter athletes cannot accurately be based only on self-reported symptoms but requires verification with objective testing of BHR. Bronchoprovocation of elite winter athletes reporting respiratory {{symptoms in}} rest or because of exercise will probably reveal a high proportion of athletes without BHR.

30|$|There are {{numerous}} cardiovascular health {{benefits associated with}} regular participation in exercise and physical activity. Growing attention, however, {{has been placed on}} how single acute exercise sessions influence cardiovascular function. For example, strenuous exercise in humans has been shown to promote cardiac fatigue (Oxbourough et al. 2010; Starnes and Bowles 1995; Scharag et al. 2008) and tissue damage in the heart (George et al. 2004) with several studies showing transient cardiac functional decrements (Dawson et al. 2007) and increased plasma concentrations of cardiac-specific troponins following exercise (George et al. 2004; Urhausen et al. 2004; Trivax et al. 2010). While factors such as the duration/intensity of exercise (Urhausen et al. 2004), training status (Neilan et al. 2006), gender (Scott et al. 2006; Scott & Warburton 2008), and environmental factors (Shave et al. 2004) are all significantly involved in the magnitude of the <b>reported</b> <b>post-exercise</b> dysfunction, the underlying cellular events remain elusive. One hypothesis is that acute aerobic exercise promotes oxidative stress and apoptosis in the heart (Huang et al. 2009; La Gerche et al. 2007) and this contributes to post-exercise cardiac dysfunction.|$|R
40|$|THESIS 9967 Recovery {{requires}} {{the restoration of}} physiological and psychological mechanisms and is heavily influenced by the availability and actions of specific hormones and nutrients (Mujika et al., 1996; Kraemer et al., 1998; Filaire et al., 2001). Cortisol (C) and testosterone (T) influence the regeneration phase post-exercise through modulation of anabolic and catabolic processes, and are reported to respond to even slight increases in training load (Coutts et al., 2007). The ingestion of a combined carbohydrate and protein supplement (CHO-PRO) immediately <b>post-exercise</b> has been <b>reported</b> to mediate greater muscle glycogen resynthesis compared with CHO alone (Ivy et al, 2002) as well as significantly improving time to failure in subsequent exercise (Betts et al., 2007). Data suggested that nutritional interventions may suppress the exercise-induced increase in C by providing sufficient exogenous CHO to maintain blood glucose (BGlu) concentration so that muscle glycogen is spared during subsequent exercise, or restored post-exercise (Henson et al., 1998; Bishop et al., 1999 b; Gleeson & Bishop, 2000; Bangsbo et al., 2006; Krustrup et al., 2006 a; Lane et al., 2010) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The optimal {{resistance}} training program to elicit muscle hypertrophy {{has been consistently}} debated and researched. Although 3 sets of 10 repetitions at 70 - 80 % of the 1 -repetition maximum (1 RM) is widely recommended, {{recent studies have shown}} that low-load (~ 30 % 1 RM), high-repetition (3 sets of 30 - 40 repetitions) {{resistance training}} can elicit similar muscular hypertrophy. Therefore, this type of resistance training has gained popularity, perhaps because less weight is lifted for a longer duration. In the process of testing this hypothesis in a research study in our laboratory, a subject diagnosed with exertional rhabdomyolysis after completing a single resistance training session that involved 3 sets to failure at 30 % 1 RM. Exertional rhabdomyolysis is a condition characterized by the excessive breakdown of striated skeletal muscle that releases proteins from the muscle cell, particularly myoglobin, into the blood that can be toxic to the kidneys and is a significant health concern. Case Report: Reviewed were the events leading up to and throughout the diagnosis of exertional rhabdomyolysis in a healthy, recreationally-trained, 21 -year-old female that was enrolled in a study that compared the acute effects of the traditional high-load, low-repetition versus low-load, high-repetition resistance training. The subject completed a total of 143 repetitions of the bilateral dumbbell bicep curl exercise. Three days <b>post-exercise</b> she <b>reported</b> excessive muscle soreness and swelling and sought medical attention. She was briefly hospitalized and then discharged with instructions to take acetaminophen for soreness, drink plenty of water, rest, and monitor her creatine kinase (CK) concentrations. Changes in the subject’s CK concentrations, ultrasound-determined muscle thickness and echo intensity were monitored over a 14 -day period are reported. Discussion: This case illustrates the potential risk of developing exertional rhabdomyolysis after a low-load, high-repetition resistance training session in healthy, young, recreationally-trained women. The fact that exertional rhabdomyolysis is a possible outcome is enough to warrant caution when prescribing this type of resistance exercise...|$|R
30|$|The {{exercise}} stimulus, particularly exercise {{duration and}} intensity {{has often been}} cited as key elements in stimulating IL- 6 synthesis and secretion by skeletal muscles [53, 57]. Three out of the four studies that reported significant differences in IL- 6 employed aerobic exercise protocols lasting approximately 1  h in duration. In addition to the exercise stimulus, the muscle mass recruited and physical fitness have also been postulated to affect plasma IL- 6 concentrations [57]. As the participants are untrained, the extended duration and intensity of exercise may promote a reduction or depletion in intramuscular glycogen. Untrained skeletal muscles are less adept at conserving glycogen stores, and as a consequence, this stimulates the upregulation of IL- 6 expression [30] possibly in some {{part due to the}} enhanced activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [41] or skeletal muscle mRNA expression. Louis et al. [38] and Buford et al. [8] confirmed this by reporting increased IL- 6 mRNA expression following a single bout of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise in recreationally active participants. Therefore, enhanced gene expression may result in the observed increase in plasma concentrations of the functional IL- 6 protein. The remaining study that <b>reported</b> <b>post-exercise</b> changes assessed the IL- 6 response to both high-intensity low-volume and low-intensity high-volume resistance exercise. The results from this study indicate that a greater exercise volume promotes a greater increase in IL- 6 concentration although the exercise mode and intensity is also a contributory factor.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} <b>reported</b> <b>post-exercise</b> {{increases}} of urinary concentrations of plasma proteins. However, under normal conditions, through mechanisms of size and electrical charge selection, the kidney restricts the clearance of molecules {{as large as}} albumin. Post-exercise increases in albuminuria occur following the physiological stress of intense exercise, most likely {{as a result of}} the exercise induced blood acidity changes which lead to a change in the arrangement of the albumin molecule, and subsequently the filtration characteristics of the glomerular capillary wall. The purpose of the present study was therefore to determine the extent to which different types of exercise could induce a transient condition of post-exercise increases in the urinary output of total protein and albumin. All 14 males, who agreed to participate in the study, performed a continuous and an intermittent cycling protocol on a stationary bicycle ergometer. The results showed that: a) intermittent exercise had a greater influence than continuous exercise on the total output of urine albumin, and of urine total protein; b) concentrations of blood pH and blood lactate, were associated with changes in the clearance of urine albumin and urine total protein. Post-exercise proteinuria response seems to be transient and therefore renal trauma is not suspected at the early stages of observation. Furthermore, these results indicate that the kidney undergoes distinct physiological adjustments during exercise, and that these adjustments are relative to the intensity of the exercise stress...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{controlled}} {{experimental study}} {{was performed to}} examine the efﬁcacy of the endogenous pain inhibitory systems and whether this (mal) functioning is associated with symptom increases following exercise in patients with chronic whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). In addition, 2 types of exercise were compared. Twenty-two women with chronic WAD and 22 healthy controls performed a submaximal and a self-paced, physiologically limited exercise test on a cycle ergometer with cardiorespiratory monitoring on 2 separate occasions. Pain pressure thresholds (PPT), health status, and activity levels were assessed {{in response to the}} 2 exercise bouts. In chronic WAD, PPT decreased following submaximal exercise, whereas they increased in healthy subjects. The same effect was established in response to the self-paced, physiologically limited exercise, with exception of the PPT at the calf which increased. A worsening of the chronic WAD symptom complex was <b>reported</b> <b>post-exercise.</b> Fewer symptoms were reported in response to the self-paced, physiologically limited exercise. These observations suggest abnormal central pain processing during exercise in patients with chronic WAD. Submaximal exercise triggers post-exertional malaise, while a self-paced and physiologically limited exercise will trigger less severe symptoms, and therefore seems more appropriate for chronic WAD patients. Perspective: The results from this exercise study suggest impaired endogenous pain inhibition during exercise in people with chronic WAD. This ﬁnding highlights the fact that one should be cautious when evaluating and recommending exercise in people with chronic WAD, and that the use of more individual, targeted exercise therapies is recommended. </p...|$|R
40|$|Evidence for altered central pain {{processing}} and central sensitization in chronic whiplash associated disorders (CWAD) is accumulating. Dysfunctional descending inhibitory action {{is one of}} the major characteristics of central sensitization and has been studied during exercise in some chronic pain conditions but no data regarding the response of people with CWAD to exercise are available. PURPOSE: To examine the efficacy of the endogenous pain inhibitory systems during exercise and exercise response in CWAD patients during two different types of exercise. METHODS: Twenty-two women with CWAD and 22 healthy sedentary controls performed a submaximal and a self-paced, physiologically limited exercise test on a cycle ergometer on two separate occasions. The exercise tests were undertaken with cardiorespiratory monitoring. Before and after the exercise bouts, subjects filled out questionnaires to assess health status, and underwent pain pressure threshold (PPT) measurements. Throughout the study, subjects’ activity levels were assessed using accelerometry in order to monitor potential influences of daily activity levels. Possible changes in any of the outcome measures in response to exercise were compared between the two groups, and between the two types of exercise, using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: In CWAD PPTs decreased following submaximal exercise, whereas they increased in healthy subjects. The same effect was established in response to the self-paced, physiologically limited exercise, with exception of the PPTs measured at the calf which increased. A worsening of the CWAD symptom complex was <b>reported</b> <b>post-exercise.</b> Fewer symptoms were reported in response to the self-paced, physiologically limited exercise. In addition, no differences in submaximal exercise capacity or daily physical activity were observed between people with CWAD and controls. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first to examine and suggest an impaired descending endogenous pain inhibition during exercise in CWAD patients, and hence provides additional evidence for the presence of central sensitization in CWAD. Submaximal exercise triggers post-exertional malaise, while a self-paced and physiologically limited exercise will trigger less ‘severe’ symptoms, and therefore seems more appropriate for CWAD patients...|$|R
