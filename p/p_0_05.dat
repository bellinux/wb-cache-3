Prenatal androgenization is one such model that results in reproductive and metabolic features that are present in conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We examined the effect of prenatal androgens on liver function and metabolism of adult sheep. As non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increased in PCOS we hypothesized that this, and other important liver pathways including metabolic function, insulin–like growth factor (IGF) and steroid receptivity, would be affected. Pregnant ewes received vehicle control (C; n = 5) or testosterone propionate (TP; n = 9) twice weekly (100 mg; i. m) from d 62 – 102 (gestation 147 days). In a novel treatment paradigm, a second cohort received a direct C (n = 4) or TP (20 mg; n = 7) fetal injection at d 62 and d 82. In adults, maternal TP exposure resulted in increased insulin secretion to glucose load (<b>P,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> and the histological presence of fatty liver (<b>P,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> independent of central obesity.

Except for Arg 8 X (<b>P.</b> <b>0.</b> <b>05),</b> the expression of STAT 5 in the other experimental groups was higher than those of the control (<b>P,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>05).</b> It also was observed that except for Arg 0. 5 X, the S 6 K expression was higher in other experimental groups than the control (<b>P,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>05).</b> In contrast, except for Arg 0. 25 X the other experimental groups resulted in lower 4 EBP 1 expression than the control (<b>P,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>05).</b> Among groups, the expression of CSN 1 S 1, CSN 1 S 2, CSN 2, CSN 3, JAK 2, STAT 5, mTOR and S 6 K gene was highest with Arg 2 X (P, 0. 05); the reverse was true for 4 EBP 1 gene, with the lowest expression in this group (<b>P,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>05).</b> Taken together, Arg appears {{to play an important role}} in th...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{a supportive}} intervention for fatigue in patients undergoing chemotherapy. One hundred three chemotherapy-naïve patients were recruited, stratified by treatment regimen, and randomly allocated to intervention or usual care. The intervention was conducted over three months. Recipients {{were provided with}} an investigator-designed information pack and Fatigue Diary that they completed during the week following each treatment. Additionally, support nurses visited them monthly at home. They assessed fatigue, provided psychological support, and coached participants in self-care. The intervention group reported significantly less fatigue (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05),</b> lower associated distress (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05),</b> and less impact of fatigue on valued pastimes (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> than the control group. Further, they reported significantly less anxiety (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> and depression (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> and displayed more adaptive coping (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05).</b> The intervention enabled patients to adapt to living with fatigue and contributed to their psychological/emotional well-being and {{ability to cope with}} their illness and treatmen...|$|R
40|$|Amino acid, {{fatty acid}} profile, cholesterol, vitamin E and mineral {{contents}} were assessed in restructured beef steak with 20 % added walnut (20 W). Compared with control restructured beef steak (0 % added walnut), the product with added walnut presented a lower (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> lysine/arginine ratio, larger (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> quantities (mg/ 100 g product) of monounsaturated (MUFA) and n 3 polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids (mainly α-linolenic acid), a lower (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> n 6 /n 3 PUFA ratio {{and a higher}} (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio. The replacement of raw meat material by walnut reduced (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> the cholesterol content and increased (more than 400 times) the amount of γ-tocopherol. Iron, calcium, magnesium and manganese contents of 20 W sample were greater (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> than in the control. Some changes induced by added walnut in the nutritional quality of the restructured product may present health benefits. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{pregnancy}} maternal tissues become increasingly more insensitive to insulin. As 6 days of euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamping, from day 8 until 14 of gestation, ameliorates total glucose consumption, we analysed the contribution of individual tissues in this phenomenon. We measured not only glucose consumption, but also concentrations of the glucose transporter protein GLUT 4 in selected tissues. On day 15 of pregnancy in saline-infused (pregnant control) rats. F- 18 -fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) consumption, as measured by positron emission tomography, as well as GLUT 4 content were diminished in heart (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05).</b> and in brown (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> and white adipose tissues (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> when compared with non-pregnant controls. During clamping, on day 13 of the experiments, both in pregnant and non-pregnant rats FDG consumption was increased in liver (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05).</b> skeletal muscle (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05).</b> brown (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> and white adipose tissues (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> when compared with saline-infused controls. In both the reproductive conditions, only in white adipose tissue was this increased FDG consumption associated with increased GLUT 4 levels (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> 05); GLUT 4 content of m. gastrocnemius, m. soleus, heart and brown adipose tissue was unaffected by clamping. In non-pregnant rats, 24 h after clamping ceased, FDG consumption was diminished in heart compared with control non-pregnant rats (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05).</b> In pregnant rats, however, 24 h after clamping (i. e. day 15 of pregnancy) both FDG consumption (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> and GLUT 4 content (<b>P</b> < <b>0.</b> <b>05)</b> were still increased in white adipose tissue only, when compared with saline-infused pregnant rats {{on the same day}} of gestation. It is suggested that hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamping ameliorates insulin action halfway pregnancy, in particular by stimulation of glucose consumption and GLUT 4 protein content in white adipose tissue...|$|R
