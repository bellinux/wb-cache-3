50|$|Acceleration (0-60) for the 4-cylinder {{models is}} {{improved}} (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: 23 mpg/city and 30 mpg/hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and <b>piston</b> <b>slap.</b> Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|E
40|$|The {{friction}} pair of {{piston rings}} and cylinder liner {{is one of}} the most important friction couplings in an internal combustion engine. It influences engine efficiency and service life. Under the excitation of <b>piston</b> <b>slaps,</b> the dynamic deformation of cylinder liner is close to the surface roughness magnitudes, which can affect the friction and lubrication performance between the piston rings and cylinder assemblies. To investigate the potential influences of structural deformations to tribological behaviours of cylinder assemblies, the dynamic deformation of the inner surface due to <b>pistons</b> <b>slaps</b> is obtained by dynamic simulations, and then coupled into an improved lubrication model. Different from the traditional lubrication model which takes the pressure stress factor and shear stress factor to be constant, the model proposed in this paper calculated these factors in real time using numerical integration to achieve a more realistic simulation. Based on the improved piston rings and cylinder liner lubrication model, the minimum oil film thickness and friction force curves are obtained for an entire work cycle. It shows that the friction force obtained from the improved model manifests clear oscillations in each stoke, which is different from the smoothed profiles predicted traditionally. Moreover, the average amplitude of the friction forces also shows clear reduction...|$|R

This study focuses on characterising AE signals measured on the cylinder head of a diesel engine for injection fault diagnosis. Firstly, AE signals are analysed to understand AE signals in association with engine operating conditions and sensor placement. Then, faulty injectors are tested to evaluate AE based injection fault detection.

This then led to an increase of overall vibration amplitude of the time domain statistical features such as RMS, Crest Factor, Skewness and Kurtosis in all loading conditions. The simulated worn-off piston not only increased the impact amplitude of <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> during the engine combustion, it also produced a distinct impulse response during the air induction stroke of the cylinder attributing to an increase of lateral impact force as a result of piston reciprocating motion and the increased clearance between the worn-off piston and the cylinder.

Therefore, better understanding of the conditions favouring <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> can be beneficial for the reduction of engine Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH). Past research has attempted to determine the exact position of <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> events during the engine cycle and correlate them to the engine block vibration response. Validated numerical/analytical models of the piston assembly can be very useful towards this aim, since extracting the relevant information from experimental measurements can be a tedious and complicated process. In the present work, a coupled simulation of piston dynamics and engine tribology (tribodynamics) has been performed using quasi-static and transient numerical codes. Thus, the inertia and reaction forces developed in the piston are calculated. The occurrence of <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> events in the engine cycle is monitored by introducing six alternative concepts: (i) the quasi-static lateral force, (ii) the transient lateral force, (iii) the minimum film thickness occurrence, (iv) the maximum energy transfer, (v) the lubricant squeeze velocity and (vi) the piston-impact angular duration. The validation of the proposed methods is achieved using experimental measurements taken from a single cylinder petrol engine in laboratory conditions. The surface acceleration of the engine block is measured at the thrust- and anti-thrust side locations. The correlation between the theoretically predicted events and the measured acceleration signals has been satisfactory in determining <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> incidents, using the aforementioned concepts.

40|$|Abstract- In an IC engine {{during the}} power stroke, after {{combustion}} of fuel, the thermal energy is converted in to mechanical energy by exerting combustion {{pressure on the}} piston. The primary motion of the piston is transferred to the crank.

40|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine noise source separation process, the combustion noise and the <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> noise are found to be seriously aliased in time-frequency domain. It is difficult to accurately separate them. Therefore, the noise source separation method which is based on Gammatone filter bank and robust independent component analysis (RobustICA) is proposed. The 6 -cylinder {{internal combustion engine}} vibration and noise test are carried out in a semianechoic chamber. The lead covering method is adopted to isolate the interference noise from numbers 1 to 5 cylinder parts, with only the number 6 cylinder parts left bare. Firstly, many mode components of the measured near-field radiated noise signals are extracted through the designed Gammatone filter bank. Then, the RobustICA algorithm is utilised to extract the independent components. Finally, the spectrum analysis, the continuous wavelet time-frequency analysis, the correlation function method, and the drag test are employed to further identify the separation results. The research results show that the frequency of the combustion noise and the <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> noise are, respectively, concentrated at 4025 [*]Hz and 1725 [*]Hz.

40|$|Simulation {{was used}} as a viable way of {{generating}} data to train Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to detect, diagnose and classify faults in Internal Combustion engines. Engine faults can be divided into combustion faults such as misfire, and mechanical faults such as <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> fault and big end bearing knock fault. Experimental vibration signals with combustion faults and mechanical faults were studied first. The torsional vibration of the crankshaft and angular acceleration of the engine block were used to detect engine misfires. It has been observed that the amplitude and phase of the first few harmonics of the cycle frequency are suitable feature vector components when using either torsional vibration or angular acceleration of the engine block. As opposed to the misfires, the vibration signals from mechanical faults are typical second order cyclostationary signals and it has been demonstrated that an appropriate signal processing approach for their diagnosis is envelope analysis of the vibration signals. The kurtogram was applied to select the optimum demodulation band before the envelope analysis. Then, selected amplitude and phase features of the Fourier coefficients of the squared envelope were used for the diagnosis of <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> and bearing knock faults. The simulation models are based on the thermodynamic and mechanical principles of Internal Combustion engines. As inputs to the simulation models, the inertial properties of the engine components and the parameters of the engine mounts were first measured and/or calculated. Simulation software was found suitable for modelling the effects of misfire, on both crankshaft torsional vibration and block angular accelerations. For mechanical faults such as <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> fault and bearing knock fault, because the squared envelopes were used for their diagnosis, the simulations only had to produce the correct envelope signals, so the dynamic response {{did not have to be}} reproduced exactly; the results were not sensitive to small changes in resonance frequencies. The simulated signals were processed by the same signal processing techniques as the measurements and the selected features from the processed data were used to train the networks. The processed simulated data, with added random variations of the same order as in the measurements, provided sufficient data for the training of the ANNs. Three-stage network systems are proposed to diagnose faults: fault detection, fault localization and fault severity identification. The detection stage and severity/prognosis stage were enacted by MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) networks and PNNs (Probabilistic Neural Networks) were used to identify which cylinder has faults. Finally, it was demonstrated that the networks trained on simulated data can efficiently detect both the combustion faults and mechanical faults in real tests and identify the location and severity of the faults as well...|$|E

Engines can produce different types of noise: 1) aerodynamic noise due to intake and exhaust systems and 2) surface radiated noise. Identification and analysis of noise sources are essential to evaluate the individual contribution (injection, combustion, <b>piston</b> <b>slap,</b> turbocharger, oil pump, valves) to the overall noise with the aim of selecting appropriate control strategies. Previous paper focused on the combustion related noise emission. The research activity aimed at diagnosing and controlling the combustion process via acoustic measurements. The optimal placement of the microphone was selected, where the signal was strongly correlated to the in-cylinder pressure development during the combustion process. Analysis and processing of the sound emission allowed the acoustic contribution of the combustion event to be isolated. Some indices capable of relating the combustion noise radiation back to the combustion development were defined.

40|$|The gas force {{due to the}} {{combustion}} in the cylinder of an IC engine will cause the piston to move with primary motion and secondary motion. The primary motion of the piston from TDC to BDC is linear in nature. This motion is desired for translation of motion of engine components.

The secondary motion of the piston is considered as the main source for the <b>piston</b> <b>slap,</b> which in turn causes the impact on the cylinder walls resulting in engine vibration and noise. In the present study, an effort is made to understand the effect of the thermal load, generated by {{the combustion}} of fuel inside the cylinder, on the piston deformation and thermal stresses induced in piston. This deformation of the piston inside the cylinder causes the gap between the cylinder and piston to vary and also the piston to move transversely along with impact forces. The transverse motion of the piston in the cylinder is observed experimentally by measuring the gap between piston and cylinder at thrust side load condition. Finite element analysis (FEA) is considered {{as one of the best}} numerical tools to model and analyze the physical systems. FEA is carried out to find the piston deformation due to thermal load on the piston for the temperature data obtained from experiments. The three dimensional piston is modeled in CATIA V 5 R 19 and analyzed in ANSYS 12 solver. The simulation results are used to predict effect of temperature on piston deformation and its secondary motion which are the principal source of engine vibration and noise...|$|E
40|$|A {{condition}} monitoring program applied to diesel engines, improves safety, productivity, increases serviceability and reduces maintenance costs. Investigation {{of a novel}} {{condition monitoring}} systems for diesel engine is attracting considerable attention due to both the increasing demands placed upon engine components and the limitations of conventional techniques. This thesis documents research conducted to assess the monitoring capabilities used acoustic emission (AE) analysis. It focuses {{on the possibility of}} using AE signals to monitor the fuel injector and oil condition. A series of experiments were performed on a JCB, four-stroke diesel engine. Tests under healthy operating conditions developed a detailed understanding of typical acoustic emission generation in terms of both the source mechanisms and the characteristics of the resulting activity. This was supplemented by specific tests to investigate possible acoustic emission generation due to the <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> and friction. The effect of faults on the injector waveform was investigated using the injection system and at one sensor location. To overcome the reflections and injection system configuration effects the method of acoustic emission impedance was used. This enabled the injector signal to be successfully extracted and clearly shows its capability for detecting even minor combustion deviations between engine cylinders. Comparison between signals and measurement of the oil condition showed both provided useful information about the lubrication processes. Simulation and experimental work have demonstrated the capability of this technique to detect lubrication related faults and irregular lubrication variability between the engine's cylinders. A review of the AE sources in diesel engines and how to represent the AE signals generated is presented. Three analysis methods were used: time-domain analysis using parameters such as Root Mean Square (RMS), variance, mean and kurtosis; frequency-domain analysis which relied on the amplitudes of the frequency components of the measured signals; and time-frequency domain analysis extracting features so that the energy content of the signals and the frequency components were localized simultaneously. In this work, data has been obtained from tests on a diesel engine, where the engine load, speed, temperature and the oil lubrication type were changed. The monitored signal and its difference from that obtained for normal engine conditions was noted as a fault signature {{that could be used for}} fault detection and diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Blind Source Separation is {{a modern}} signal {{processing}} technique which recovers both the unknown sources and unknown mixing systems from only measured mixtures of signals. It has application in diverse fields such as communication, image processing, geological exploration and biomedical signal processing etc. This project studies the BSS problem, develop separation methods and reveal the potential for mechanical engineering applications. There are two models for blind source separation corresponding to the two ways that the sources are mixed, the instantaneous mixing model and the convolved mixing model. The author carried out a theoretical study of the first model by proposing an idea called Redundant Data Elimination which leads to geometric interpretation of the model, explains that circular distribution property {{is the reason why}} Gaussian signal mixtures can not be separated, and showed that this idea can improve separation accuracy for unsymmetrically distributed sources. This new idea enabled evaluation and comparison of two well-known algorithms and proposal of a simplified algorithm based on Joint Approximate Diagonalization of fourth order cumulant matrices, which is further developed by determining an optimized parameter value for separation convergence. Also based on the understanding from the RDE, an outlier spherical projection method is proposed to improve separation accuracy against outlier errors. Mechanical vibration or acoustic problems belong to the second model. After some theoretical study of the problem and the model, a novel application of the Blind Least Mean Square algorithm using Gray's variable norm as cost function is applied to engine vibration data to separate <b>piston</b> <b>slap,</b> fuel injection noise and cylinder pressure effects. Further, the algorithm is combined with a deflation algorithm for successive subtraction of recovered source responses from the measured mixture to enable the recovery of more sources. The algorithms are verified to be successful by simulation, and the separated engine sources are proved reasonable by analysing the engine operation and physical properties of the sources. The author also studied the relationship between these two models, the problems of different approaches for solving the model such as the frequency domain approach and the Bussgang approach, and sets out future research interests...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} {{theoretical}} engine noise prediction, using such techniques as finite element modelling, is highly {{dependent upon the}} understanding of the various mechanisms of noise generation in the running engine. The forcing mechanism of an operating engine is complicated as it involves a large number of forces taking place simultaneously or in rapid succession at various positions in the structure. A number of test methods have been developed to simulate individually each one of these loading mechanisms on non-running engines. These test methods are reviewed in this thesis with an objective judgement on their representation of the actual forcing on the running engine. A new hydraulic test method has been successfully developed to simulate various forms of loading mechanisms on the non-running engine like the gas force on top of the piston, main bearings axial and vertical loading, and <b>piston</b> <b>slap</b> force. This test method is shown to be more comprehensive, realistic, practical and representative than previous simulation techniques, especially with respect to the level of forcing which corresponds well with that of the running engine. The structural sensitivity of the engine has been evaluated for different representative loading, the most sensitive input being that of the axial force at the main bearings. The damping characteristics of a large six cylinder diesel engine block has been calculated and the crank shaft is shown to affect it as well as affecting the wave propagation through the structure. The simulation technique has also allowed the detailed study of the various forms of wave propagation in a diesel engine load carrying structrue and this has shown the importance of both bending and longitudinal travelling waves in noise radiation. It is shown that bending waves provide the maximum amplitudes of vibration, whereas longitudinal wave propagation allows for the fast transfer of energy through the structure which can then convert into bending waves with high noise radiation potential. Analysis of the results has shown that some doubt must be placed on the normal mode method for predicting the response in the lower frequency range, and an alternative model based on highly damped travelling bending waves is visualized to be suitable to model the crank case wall but not the stiff upper...|$|E
40|$|Besides {{pollutant}} emissions, {{fuel consumption}} and performance, vehicle NVH constitutes a further object during engine development and optimization. In recent years, research activity for diesel {{engine noise reduction}} {{has been devoted to}} investigate aerodynamic noise due to intake and exhaust systems and surface radiated noise. Most of the attention has been concerned with the identification and analysis of noise sources in order to evaluate the individual contribution (injection, combustion, <b>piston</b> <b>slap,</b> turbocharger, oil pump, valves) to the overall noise with the aim of selecting appropriate control strategies. Several studies have been devoted to analyze combustion process that has a direct influence on engine noise emission; the impact of injection strategies on the combustion noise has been evaluated and approaches able to separate engine combustion and mechanical noise components have been presented. This work fits in a research program that aims at analyzing the engine noise emission for both the combustion diagnosis via non-intrusive sensors and the definition of potential strategies for combustion related noise emission improvement. Previous works have been devoted to analyze the entire noise generation process of a diesel engine in order to identify the contribution of the different sources to the overall emission and to investigate the correlation between noise radiation and in-cylinder pressure measurement aimed at assessing the in-cylinder pressure development during the combustion process via its related emission. Therefore, during such activity, the attention was focused on the excitation forces and on their effect, the radiated noise. This work has been devoted to deeper insight into the structural response of the engine, that represents the transfer function between in-cylinder pressure and radiated noise. A small displacement common-rail diesel engine has been fully instrumented and its noise radiation has been investigated by analyzing the signals of microphones placed in selected locations around the engine. A method in the frequency domain is presented for evaluating the engine structural response function; the engine is considered as a black box in which the input is the in-cylinder pressure and the output is the noise radiation. Once the dynamic response of the engine is estimated, combustion development can be characterized via the engine noise radiation, thus allowing to get indication about possible strategies for noise emission improvement, that could be obtained through structural modification and/or combustion process control by injection strategy variation...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Most modern engines utilise pistons with an offset gudgeon pin. In internal combustion engines, the offset is to the major thrust side of the piston. The piston thrust side {{is the part of}} the piston perpendicular to the gudgeon pin that carries the majority of side loading during the power stroke. Primary reason for having the gudgeon pin positioned eccentrically is to prevent the piston from slamming into the cylinder bore after the connecting rod journal passes the top dead centre. This phenomenon is referred to as <b>piston</b> <b>slap,</b> and is more pronounced in compression ignition and high performance engines due to higher combustion pressure than that of commercial spark ignition engines. The coming together of the piston and the bore results in scuffing, at best, or, catastrophic failure at worst. Clearance space between bore and piston is filled by a lubricant film. The main role of the lubricant is to separate the piston and bore by reacting to the applied load. Investigating the above problem requires a holistic approach, whereby a dynamic three degree-of-freedom piston model is coupled with a lubrication model to represent the actual system. The dynamic model determines the motion of the piston in combined axial, lateral and rotation about the gudgeon pin. The reactive forces due to lubricant films on the major and minor thrust sides of the piston play significant roles in piston dynamics and are evaluated by either quasi-static or transient solution of the lubricant contact conjunctions. The novel quasi-static analysis is carried out in the sense of its detailed approach, including many key practical features. not incorporated in other analyses, hitherto reported in literature. These features include first and foremost the development of a specific contact mechanics model for evaluation of conforming contacts for piston skirt against liner or bore. The quasi-static analysis includes many practical feature not encountered in other literature on the subject, such as detailed surface irregularities and modification features, and with thermal distortion. The analysis has been extended to thermohydrodynamics, as well as micro-hydrodynamics, all with high computational mesh densities, and robust methods of solution in space and time domains, including effective influence Newton-Raphson method and linear acceleration integration scheme. The transient tribo-elasto-multi-body dynamics problem includes physics of motion study from film thickness prediction and secondary motion evaluation of the order of micrometers and minutes of arc to large rigid body dynamics, including simultaneous solution of the contact problem at both major and minor thrust sides. Such a comprehensive solution has not hitherto been reported in literature. The thesis discusses many aspects of piston dynamics problem, through the broad spectrum of vehicle manufacture, with many pertinent practical engineering issues. In particular, it provides solutions for high performance Formula 1 racing engines. This is the first ever comprehensive analysis of piston tribodynamics for this range of engines at very high combustion pressures. This study has shown the paramount influence of profile of piston in promoting lubrication between the contiguous bodies, as evident from the pattern of lubricant flow through the contact. Deformation of the bodies increases the volume of lubricant in the contact. During the reversal in direction of piston motion, when the entraining velocity momentarily cases and reversal takes place, the load is held by an elastic squeez...|$|E
