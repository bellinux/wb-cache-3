Consequently, the output ratios on the 3rd ordinate (carrier of the third planetary gearset) follows closely those of the actual transmission. This advantageous geometric construction sets us free from Willis' famous and tedious formula, because all calculations are exclusively determined by lengths ratios, respectively teeth numbers on the abscissa for the 4 epicyclic ratios, and of rotational speeds on the 3rd ordinate for the 10 gear ratios.|$|E

5000|$|The Gibson Victory was an {{electric}} guitar produced by Gibson Guitars from 1981 until 1983 (although some sources say production lasted until 1984). [...] During the late 1970s and early 1980s, musicians watched Eddie Van Halen play his Frankenstrat and questioned and rethought everything about their instruments. They insisted on engineering advances allowing more speed and playability of skyscraping leads and rock crushing shred. The master luthiers in Kalamazoo responded to these demanding guitarists by designing the Victory. The Victory, a superstrat, was {{radical departure from}} Gibson's image as an old-fashioned guitar maker. MV stood for Multi-Voice. X stood for ten They were created by the Gibson research and development team in Kalamazoo, MI, with the body work by Chuck Burge, and the multi-voice electronics by Tim Shaw. The Victory MV's were available with an optional / special order Kahler Tremolo System. The Victory MV's had a three-point top-adjust [...] "tune-o-matic" [...] bridge designed by  Rendal Wall and patent granted in June 1982. The three post holes in the underside allow {{either side of the}} bridge unit to be moved forwards or backwards for intonation of ultra light to extremely heavy string gauges, and twelve interchangeable individually-adjustable saddles, six standard nylon saddles and 6 optional brass saddles to set the fine intonation and affect tone. The Victory MV's came with a series of specially designed Humbucker Pickups carefully made one at a time on the “center focused” KZ/LP115 PAF Pickup Winder, with high sensitivity and unique tonal signature with fewer turns of wire compared to high production winding machines that produce more scatter and a wider magnetic aperture, Each pickup across the range was different, and specifically designed for the role it was assigned. The location of the Pickups were carefully calculated to provide full frequency response and minimize dead spots by avoidance of string nodal points. Humbucker pickups are inherently low noise because the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation, however the Victory MV’s had additional shielding connected to ground with the use of special electrically conductive black paint in the routed out area under the pickguard. Truly silent when it should be. The coil tap switch in the up position is humbucker; in the down position is single coil. Gibson had well established business agreements for over 100 years with the best wood suppliers in the world and Gibson Luthiers had first pick to craft the Victory MV's. The availability of premium old growth wood with tight grain was better in the 1980s than it is today because of new laws and limited natural resources. The Victory MV's body and tri-laminated quartersawn neck was crafted from solid eastern hard rock maple, with a Janka Hardness ranking of 1450 pound-force, a crushing strength of 7,830 pound-force per square inch , and a tensile elasticity modulus of 1,830,000 pound-force per square inch, eastern hard rock maple is extremely hard, dense, and stiff, producing earthquaking sustain. [...] The tri-laminate opposing wood grain neck design strengthened the overall neck and gave more tuning stabilization. Evidence shows that wood improves with age, the polymerization of sap over decades, once the wood is removed from the living tree crystalizes. Aged wood also loses its ability to absorb moisture, causing the wood to become more stiff and stable as it ages… the perfect recipe for a straight, high quality guitar neck, level fret board, and great sound. The Victory MV's Set-in neck [...] and silky smooth rock-hard quartersawn Madagascan ebony fret board required better tools, more time, accuracy, attention to detail, and skill to craft, but produces a warmer fuller tone and transfers resonant energy freely and immediately due to the tight <b>permanent</b> <b>coupling,</b> and facilitates ripples of vibrational energy that round out and thicken the sound, in comparison to buzzy guitars with removable screw-on necks having a metal plate and adjustment shims. The chamfered cutaway offers musicians with large hands better access to play in the top frets. The fourteen degree pitch headstock shape and tuning machine alignment allows for a perfectly straight pull on the strings and optimum string down pressure. The Gibson Victory MV's are not recommended for the weak, these sledge axes weigh a solid nine pounds but are perfectly balanced both on the strap or on the knee, Luthiers know guitars with more mass and density have more brilliance and sustain. in fact some older Gibson models weighed as much as twelve pounds. According to Gibson, Victory MV’s were only produced in Candy Apple Red, Antique Cherry Sunburst, & Twilight Blue. However sometimes a retailer who did a lot of business with Gibson would be able to ask for a small number of guitars with a special finish. Mention has been made of Roy Orbison's special order black Victory MVX. [...] The Victory MV's came standard with a rugged black Gibson branded [...] "8170" [...] dual lock and key padded hard case with internal storage box. Decode the serial number {{on the back of the}} headstock to determine where your Victory was made and the date of it's manufacture.|$|E

A quantum memory effect that we term system-mediated detector-detector interaction is crucial to observe non-commuting observables simultaneously. Finally, we propose a mesoscopic double-dot detector setup in which the memory effect is tunable and that can be used to explore the transition to non-Markovian quantum measurements experimentally.

60|$|Now {{it is only}} in {{the last}} three hundred years that any human being seems to have {{anticipated}} this. It stimulates the imagination to remark how entirely it was overlooked as a modifying cause in human development. [Footnote: It is interesting to note how little even Bacon seems to see of this, in his New Atlantis.] Plato clearly had no ideas about machines at all as a force affecting social organisation. There was nothing in his world to suggest them to him. I suppose there arose no invention, no new mechanical appliance or method of the slightest social importance through all his length of years. He never thought of a State that did not rely for its force upon human muscle, just as he never thought of a State that was not primarily organised for warfare hand to hand. Political and moral inventions he saw enough of and to spare, and in that direction he still stimulates the imagination. But in regard to all material possibilities he deadens rather than stimulates. [Footnote: The lost Utopia of Hippodamus provided rewards for inventors, but unless Aristotle misunderstood him, and it is certainly the fate of all Utopias to be more or less misread, the inventions contemplated were political devices.] An infinitude of nonsense about the Greek mind would never have been written if the distinctive intellectual and artistic quality of Plato's time, its extraordinarily clear definition of certain material conditions as absolutely <b>permanent,</b> <b>coupled</b> with its politico-social instability, had been borne in mind. The food of the Greek imagination was the very antithesis of our own nourishment. We are educated by our circumstances to think no revolution in appliances and economic organisation incredible, our minds play freely about possibilities that would have struck the men of the Academy as outrageous extravagance, and it is in regard to politico-social expedients that our imaginations fail. Sparta, for all the evidence of history, is scarcely more credible to us than a motor-car throbbing in the agora would have been to Socrates.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Many new {{applications}} of energy system devices {{have been developed}} to save energy, improve the controllability and stability of industrial processes, and reduce the weight, volume and cost of consumer devices. Due to the novelty of these devices, traditional empirical methods and lumped-parameter circuit theory methods are not sufficient for product development and optimization. Electromagnetic analysis approaches can provide accurate parameter calculation and performance prediction for these new products / prototypes of energy system devices. They are powerful and efficient tools for new product development and existing product optimization. The research analysis work of this thesis applied the LTA (Layer Theory Approach) and FEM (Finite Element Method) to analyze two types of new energy system devices, a <b>permanent</b> magnet <b>coupling</b> and its derivatives and the prototype of a linear reluctance machine, respectively. LTA is a suitable and efficient tool for devices like linear induction machines and permanent magnet couplings, which include sheet conductors as secondaries. FEM is an analysis tool with wider application area. It is applicable for most devices even with complicated structures. But, it has numerous disadvantages including large memory requirements and very long computational times. The performance of a <b>permanent</b> magnet dynamometer-brake <b>coupling</b> was predicted with the LTA program and compared with experimental results.

40|$|In the mid- 1990 s, {{genetic testing}} was {{introduced}} for two breast and ovarian cancer predisposition genes: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2. For mutation carriers, lifetime risks of breast and ovarian cancer approach 90 %, and 54 %, respectively, versus general population risks of 12 % and 2 %. Women {{testing positive for}} mutations during young adulthood face numerous challenges related to navigating basic life course tasks, including establishing <b>permanent</b> <b>couple</b> relationships, family formation, and risk-management decision-making. These complex choices require young carriers to balance personal and family desires and provider recommendations for health maintenance and disease avoidance against their own desires/plans for personal, relationship, and family fulfillment. How they accomplish these tasks is significantly influenced by their experiences with cancer in close relatives, personal cancer risk assessment, and partner presence and support. Although the experience of older carriers and cancer survivors has been thoughtfully explored, {{little attention has been}} paid to the experiences of younger women. Using qualitative methods and grounded theory, I analyzed in-depth interviews with forty women aged 18 - 35 who knew themselves to be BRCA 1 / 2 -positive. Participants were recruited from: 1) an ongoing NCI Clinical Genetics Branch Breast Imaging Study; 2) the membership of FORCE, an online support network for mutation-positive individuals; and 3) snowball sampling, whereby participants referred others whom they knew to be mutation-positive. Using a semi-structured, open-ended interview format, participants were asked about family relationships and background; couple relationships; experiences and perceptions regarding family formation; and experiences and perceptions related to utilization of risk management strategies over time (i. e., surveillance, chemoprevention, risk-reducing surgery). Questions were developed using sensitizing concepts from the biopsychosocial perspective on health and illness and life course perspective, as well as attachment and feminist theories. Interviews were conducted by telephone, digitally recorded and transcribed, and analyzed using QSR N-Vivo software, version 8. The data-driven model indicates that risk perception and management decisions are closely tied to family and couple relationship experiences.

40|$|Plastoglobules are {{lipoprotein}} particles inside chloroplasts. Their {{numbers have}} been shown to increase during the upregulation of plastid lipid metabolism in response to oxidative stress and during senescence. In this study, we used stateof-the-art high-pressure freezing/freeze-substitution methods combined with electron tomography as well as freeze-etch electron microscopy to characterize the structure and spatial relationship of plastoglobules to thylakoid membranes in developing, mature, and senescing chloroplasts. We demonstrate that plastoglobules are attached to thylakoids through a half-lipid bilayer that surrounds the globule contents and is continuous with the stroma-side leaflet of the thylakoid membrane. During oxidative stress and senescence, plastoglobules form linkage groups that are attached to each other and remain continuous with the thylakoid membrane by extensions of the half-lipid bilayer. Using three-dimensional tomography combined with immunolabeling techniques, we show that the plastoglobules contain the enzyme tocopherol cyclase (VTE 1) and that this enzyme extends across the surface monolayer into the interior of the plastoglobules. These findings demonstrate that plastoglobules function as both lipid biosynthesis and storage subcompartments of thylakoid membranes. The <b>permanent</b> structural <b>coupling</b> between plastoglobules and thylakoid membranes suggests that the lipid molecules contained in the plastoglobule cores (carotenoids, plastoquinone, and tocopherol [vitamin E]) are in a dynamic equilibrium with those located in the thylakoid membranes...|$|R

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first in providing reliable architectures for these variants of CORDIC. The former is suitable for low-area applications and, hence, we propose recomputing with encoded operands schemes which add negligible area overhead to the designs. Moreover, the proposed error detection schemes for the latter variant are optimized for efficient applications which hamper the performance of the architectures negligibly. We present three variants of recomputing with encoded operands to detect both transient and <b>permanent</b> faults, <b>coupled</b> with signature-based schemes. The overheads of the proposed designs are assessed through Xilinx FPGA implementations and their effectiveness is benchmarked through error simulations.

The consistency of the integrated techniques allowed to achieve a comprehensive and affordable characterization of the main joint sets on the sea cliff slope. The observed joint sets were considered to evaluate the proneness of the slope to rock failures by attributing safety factor (SF) values to the topple- and wedge-prone rock blocks under three combined or independent triggering conditions: (a) hydrostatic water pressures within the joints, (b) seismic action, and (c) strength reduction due to weathering of the joint surfaces.

40|$|Abstract –This paper {{investigates the}} {{steady-state}} and the transient performances of an axial magnetic coupling by using analytical formulas issued from an analytical model {{based on a}} two-dimensional approximation for the magnetic field distribution (mean radius model). From the magnetic field expression, simple analytical formulas are derived for computing the pull-out torque and the torsional stiffness of the coupling {{as a function of}} the geometrical parameters. Here, a special attention is given to the overload torque condition during the transient which lead to the loss of synchronism for the coupling. Moreover, radial and angular misalignment conditions are also studied. In order to study the accuracy of the proposed analytical model, the results are compared with those obtained from 3 D finite element simulations and measurements.

40|$|In the 1990 s, Spain {{approved}} two labour reforms {{aimed at}} reducing the unemploy-ment level and its volatility. Overall, these reforms involved two measures designed to induce rms to meet their labor needs via adjustment of permanent positions: restrict-ing the use of temporary workers and {{reducing the amount of}} severance payments. This paper empirically assesses the impact of these reforms on the allocative e ¢ ciency of the labor input employing Petrin and Sivadasans (2011) value of the marginal product-marginal cost gap methodology. We 8 ̆ 5 nd a statistically signi 8 ̆ 5 cant increase in within- 8 ̆ 5 rm permanent labor gaps following the reforms. These results suggest that restrictions on the use of temporary workers (increasing the probability of hiring fragile workers for <b>permanent</b> positions), when <b>coupled</b> with uncertainty about enforcement of reduced sev-erance payments, could more than o¤set the reduction in severance payments; hence, the net e¤ect of the reforms could be to increase adjustments costs for permanent positions...|$|R
40|$|Cell based cancer {{analysis}} {{is an important}} analytic method to monitor cancer progress on stages by detecting the density of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in the blood. Among the existing microfluidic techniques, dielectrophoresis (DEP), which is a label-free detection method, is favoured by researchers. However, {{because of the high}} conductivity of blood as well as the rare presence of CTCs, high separation efficiency is difficult to achieve in most DEP microdevices. Through this study, we have proposed a strategy to improve the isolation performance, as such by integrating a magnetophoretic (MAP) platform into a DEP device. Several important aspects to be taken into MAP design consideration, such as permanent magnet orientation, magnetic track configuration, fluid flow parameter and separation efficiency, are discussed. The design was examined and validated by numerical simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics v 4. 4 software (COMSOL Inc., Burlington, MA, USA), mainly presented in three forms: surface plot, line plot, and arrow plot. From these results, we showed that the use of a single <b>permanent</b> magnet <b>coupled</b> with an inbuilt magnetic track of 250 μm significantly strengthens the magnetic field distribution within the proposed MAP stage. Besides, in order to improve dynamic pressure without compromising the uniformity of fluid flow, a wide channel inlet and a tree-like network were employed. When the cell trajectory within a finalized MAP stage is computed with a particle tracing module, a high separation efficiency of red blood cell (RBC) is obtained for blood samples corresponding up to a dilution ratio of 1 : 7. Moreover, a substantial enhancement of the CTCs’ recovery rate was also observed in the simulation when the purposed platform was integrated with a planar DEP microdevice...|$|R
