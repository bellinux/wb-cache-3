The aim of this thesis is to determine which factors influenced the formally strong system of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> in the Slovak National Assembly. 6 factors will be analyzed - Late accession to the EU, parliamentary strength, bargaining strength in the Council of EU, public euroscepticism, euroscepticism of political parties {{and the frequency of}} coalition and minority governments. The strength of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> can also be influenced by informal aspects. The informal aspects in this thesis will be mainly concerned with the efforts {{of the members of the}} European Affairs Committee to acquire additional information about legislative proposals of the EU in an informal way and also their efforts for a better cooperation in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> among various political parties. The empirical analysis found, that the factor of late accession to the EU and euroscepticism of political parties had the biggest effect on the formally strong system of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> in Slovakia. A partial effect can be also attributed to the factors of public euroscepticism and the frequency of coalition and minority governments.

With this decision, the idea of a body to ensure <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the European Police Office (Europol) finally manifests itself in the JPSG. In the emerging Security Union that the EU seeks to create, also in reaction to recent terror attacks, the responsible actors at the EU level must be subject to <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> According to Article 51 of the new Europol Regulation No. 2016 / 794, the JPSG will play an essential role to “politically monitor Europol’s activities in fulfilling its mission, including as regards the impact of those activities on the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. ” In its first part, the Policy Paper examines the political difficulties to move forward with respect to intentions and provisions for enhancing the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> over Europol. The in-depth analysis of the positions of national parliaments and EU institutions is based on reports, resolutions, publicly available minutes and amendments to draft conclusions as well as other texts. This paper evaluates the agreement on the JPSG for Europol as promising. The second part of the Policy Paper presents concrete proposals in order to make the JPSG work efficiently: The JPSG should complement the existing scrutiny of Europol by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in the European Parliament and it should adopt ambitious Rules of Procedure at its first meeting in order to clarify and fix its internal functioning. The new body could subsequently become a blueprint for interparliamentary scrutiny in the EU...|$|R

Journal of Contemporary European Research, 7 (4), 500 - 519. Since {{the terrorist attacks}} in New York and Washington, DC (2001), Madrid (2004) and London (2005), the European Union (EU) has stepped up its efforts to develop new instruments and reinforce existing ones to fight terrorism jointly. One of the key aspects of the EU-wide fight against terrorism and serious crime is the facilitation and enforcement of information and intelligence exchange among law enforcement authorities and, to a limited extent, security and intelligence services. This article examines how far the EU?s commitment to democracy, accountability and transparency is actually fulfilled with respect to its efforts at fighting terrorism by drawing on {{the example of the}} activities of the European Police Office (Europol). Taking the European Parliament (EP) and National Parliaments (NPs), but also inter-parliamentary forums, into account, the article analyses how, and to what extent, mechanisms of democratic accountability and, in particular, <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> are in place to hold EU-wide counter-terrorism actors, such as Europol, to account. This is a particularly timely question given that Europol?s <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> procedures are currently subject to considerable changes due to the change in its legal mandate as of 1 January 2010 and the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> {{reserves}} {{have become}} a popular parliamentary instrument for the scrutiny of EU documents {{over the last two}} decades. While the exact provisions for them vary between the member states and according to their parliaments’ overall <b>scrutiny</b> system, <b>parliamentary</b> reserves generally mean that government representatives do not, or cannot, officially agree to a proposal in the Council (or COREPER or the working groups) while the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> process is ongoing. Yet despite the proliferation of reserve provisions, we actually know very little about them. The paper will therefore provide an overview over the specific features of scrutiny reserves in different member states. In addition, it investigates whether scrutiny reserves actually are an effective instrument to safeguard parliamentary influence in EU affairs by looking at how they are being dealt with at different levels of the Council negotiations...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of 9 / 11, the war in Iraq and the {{terrorist}} attacks in London, the Westminster parliament has become increasingly involved in the scrutiny of legislation and policy related {{to the use of}} intelligence. Yet until recently <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of intelligence in the UK was limited and uninformed. The creation of a parliamentary intelligence oversight committee in 1994 for the first time allowed for <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the intelligence agencies. This article aims to assess whether parliament has begun to understand about intelligence since the establishment of the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC). It considers whether parliament and parliamentary committees in particular {{have a role to play}} in allowing parliamentarians to develop expertise in particular policy areas, and then questions whether the ISC has, through its membership and its published output, served to generate a wider parliamentary understanding of intelligence...|$|R
40|$|The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the European Union (EU) is {{considered}} to be an intergovernmental policy at the European level and a domain of the executive at the national level. Yet, despite the prerogative of the executive, there is still <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of CFSP, but it has received little academic attention, although there is a growing debate about the democratic deficit of the policy that the Lisbon Treaty attempted to alleviate. This research offers insight into how national parliaments scrutinise CFSP by comparing the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Estonian Riigikogu and Finnish Eduskunta. Usually both are considered by the scholarly literature strong scrutinisers and both have similar formal powers and mandating-systems of CFSP scrutiny. Yet, similarities in the formal setup notwithstanding, there still seems to be a difference in how the two parliaments engage in CFSP scrutiny with Riigikogu described as a rubber stamp and Eduskunta an active policy shaper. This discrepancy {{can be explained by the}} fact that the literature on <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of EU affairs has focused mostly on the formal powers that the parliaments have. In contrast this study concentrates not only on the legal rights and capabilities, but emphasises the role of the informal factors that affect the level of scrutiny of CFSP. It argues that as CFSP is a EU policy with less automatic <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> than other policy fields, informal factors such as attitude and willingness of the parliamentarians to engage in CFSP scrutiny and motivational factors play a more important role. Through expert interviews and the analytical framework developed by Born and Hänggi that takes into account authority, ability and attitude, this research concludes that attitude and the willingness of parliamentarians to engage in CFSP scrutiny explains the difference of the levels of scrutiny of CFSP of Riigikogu and Eduskunta. These findings support the new institutionalist theory of sociological institutionalism that emphasises the role of culture, role perception and institutional identity as determining the level of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny...</b>|$|R

40|$|Enhancing {{the role}} of {{national}} parliaments in the European Union’s decision-making process has for some time been a popular way in which policy-makers have sought to address legitimacy problems in the European Union, the Early Warning Mechanism being only one example. In response to these developments, {{an increasing number of}} scholars have addressed the question of how parliaments make use of these powers in practice. An important dimension of the process – {{the role of}} parliamentary officials in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> and control – has so far been neglected in the literature. Against this background, this article examines the role of the representatives of national parliaments in the European Parliament with the aim of understanding the role and the nature of this ‘bureaucratic network’.

40|$|This article compares {{national}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> over European Union {{matters in}} two countries with coalition governments, Germany and the Netherlands, {{based on interviews}} with members of parliament serving on their European Affairs Committee. While acknowledging that legal powers and institutional structures are important when evaluating parliamentary-government relations, the examination focuses on the goals and methods of party groups when overseeing government. In Germany, the goal of the governing coalition parties is to protect the government, whereas in the Netherlands they scrutinize the government's position in order to be sure the compromise in the cabinet sufficiently protects the party's interests. Although the Dutch governing parties normally support the government, a `floating coalition' occasionally emerges with ruling parties working with parts of the opposition to amend a proposal toward their own preferences. The study concludes that {{it is not only the}} legal powers and institutional structures that determine <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> in a given member state, but also party interactions. ...|$|R
40|$|The essay proposes two {{theoretical}} models that hypothesize the critical variables that explain {{differences in the}} power of the institutional structures for <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> and the political processes that occur within these institutions, in the member states. The main argument is that the structures and processes of parliament scrutiny are dependent on the strategic incentives of parliamentary party groups to create and effectively utilize these institutions for their own purposes. These incentives are dependent on the risks and opportunities that the EU poses to government stability and re-election of a political party. The essay uses these models to compare national <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> over EU matter in Germany and the Netherlands [...] .
