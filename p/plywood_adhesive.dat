40|$|The current {{production}} of wood composites relies mostly on formaldehyde-based adhesives such as urea formaldehyde (UF) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins. As these resins are produced from non-renewable resources, {{and there are some}} ongoing issues with possible health hazard due to formaldehyde emission from such products, the purpose of this research was to develop a formaldehyde-free <b>plywood</b> <b>adhesive</b> utilizing waste protein as a renewable feedstock. The feedstock for this work was specified risk material (SRM), which is currently being disposed of either by incineration or by landfilling. In this report, we describe a technology for utilization of SRM for the development of an environmentally friendly <b>plywood</b> <b>adhesive.</b> SRM was thermally hydrolyzed using a Canadian government-approved protocol, and the peptides were recovered from the hydrolyzate. The recovered peptides were chemically crosslinked with polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin (PAE) resin to develop an adhesive system for bonding of plywood specimens. The effects of crosslinking time, peptides/crosslinking agent ratio, and temperature of hot pressing of plywood specimens on the strength of formulated adhesives were investigated. Formulations containing as much as 78 % (wt/wt) peptides met the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) specifications of minimum dry and soaked shear strength requirement for UF resin type adhesives. Under the optimum conditions tested, the peptides–PAE resin-based formulations resulted in plywood specimens having comparable dry as well as soaked shear strength to that of commercial PF resin...|$|E

Therefore, the PAE improved the wet bond strength, and the LB improved the dry bond strength. The improvement was attributed to: (1) the reaction of LB/PAE with the functions of the soy protein to form a cross-linking network; (2) a polycondensation reaction between the LB molecules improved the crosslinking density of the adhesive to form an interpenetration structure with cross-linked proteins; and (3) the easy penetration of the LB into the wood surface that enhanced interlocking between the wood and adhesive.

The lignin methylolated under optimized conditions was found to successfully substitute 50 % of phenolic resin as wood adhesive with approved bonding strength and lower free formaldehyde and phenol contents. The FOR and GPC analysis suggested that lignin showed higher content of carbonyl group and narrower molecular weight distribution due to depolymerization effect during steam explosion and formaldehyde was mainly incorporated into the aromatic C- 5 position of G unit in the methylolation process. Overall, the study indicates that steam explosion is an effective treatment to improve the purity of lignin liquor and the direct substitution of phenolic adhesive by methylolated lignin liquor significantly reduces the costs for lignin recovery, which offers a promising approach for enhancing the commercial operation of a steam-explosion-derived biorefinery.

40|$|Soy-based {{adhesives}} inherently possess {{low water}} resistance and brittleness, which limit their application on plywood fabrication. This investigation involves using a long chain cross-linker, neopentyl glycol diglycidyl ether (NGDE), {{to produce an}} intrinsic toughening effect to reduce the brittleness and improve the water resistance of a soybean meal–based adhesive. The solids content, viscosity, functional groups, fracture surface micrographs, and thermal stability of the adhesives were measured. Three-layer plywood was fabricated using the resultant adhesive, and the tensile shear strength of the plywood was measured. All adhesive properties were compared with a soybean meal/polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin (PAE) adhesive and commercial melamine urea formaldehyde resin. The results showed that adding 6 g NGDE improved the water resistance of the soybean meal-based adhesive by 12. 5 %. This improvement is attributed to the following reasons: (1) a dense cross-linked network is formed by the chemical reaction between NGDE and protein molecules; (2) the toughness of the adhesive increases and a smooth and homogeneous fracture surface is created, which effectively prevents moisture intrusion; (3) the addition of NGDE increases the thermostability of the cured adhesive. The tensile shear strength of the plywood bonded with the soybean meal-based adhesive with 6 g NGDE was 286. 2 % higher than that without NGDE and attained 1. 12 MPa, which was attributed to {{the reduction in the}} adhesive’s viscosity, and the improvement in the water resistance and toughness of the adhesive.

Neutral phenolic soy (NPS) and alkaline phenolic soy (APS) resins were prepared and used to bond southern pine <b>plywood.</b> <b>Adhesive</b> bond quality of the soybean-based phenolic resins was evaluated by glueline shear test following the procedure detailed in Product Standard PS 1 - 95 for construction and industrial plywood. Within the range of variable levels investigated, the following conditions produced higher wet wood failure than a control glue mix. For NPS resins best results were obtained with a 160 cps PF, a 30 minute assembly time, and no extender. For APS resins best results were obtained with a 50 cps PF, a 200 °C press temperature, 19 % corn-cob powder, and a 60 minute assembly time. Comparable results were obtained with either a 40 % or 50 % PF level in the resins. Under these conditions, the wet wood failure of plywood bonded with both resins approached the requirement of PS 1 - 95 for construction and industrial plywood. The APS resins were also used to fabricate homogeneous hybrid poplar flakeboards with different resin solid levels (5 %, 7 %, and 9 %), press temperatures (175 and 200 °C), and press times of 8 and 10 minutes. Internal bond strength, wet modulus of rupture, and dimensional stabilities of flakeboard improved with increased press time, press temperature, and PF level in the resins. In particular, increased press time can be used to offset the poor internal bonding associated with high resin content and the excessive moisture present in the mat. However, APS resin-bonded flakeboards provided higher mechanical and better dimensional stability properties compared to the Canadian Standard Association O 437 standard, except for modulus of elasticity, which could be easily improved by flake alignment. Optimum production condition for flakeboard bonded with the APS resins are a 5 % resin level, a 50 % PF level, a 200 °C press temperature, and an 8 minute press time. Although NPS and APS resins can be competitive with other conventional adhesives, further improvements are required to reduce press times for industrial applications...|$|E

Considering that very small amounts of fibrillated bark adhesives produced high-quality wood bonding, the bark components such as tannin, hemicellulose, lignin, cellulose nanofibers and other components may well be contributing to produce such a good bonding.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Present {{methods of}} {{determining}} proper glueline cure are inadequate in either production or laboratory situations {{because they are}} time consuming and "after the fact". Monitoring the glueline while the wood composite {{is still in the}} press would provide many advantages over existing methods. Such a system would provide greater control over the degree of cure, helping eliminate variable quality in the glue bond. Dielectric spectroscopy has been proposed as a method capable of continuously monitoring adhesive cure and a specific machine, the Audrey II dielectrometer, has been advertised as being capable of detecting cure of resin systems common to the forest products industry. The objectives of this research were to determine if the Audrey II dielectrometer could measure cure of a highly caustic phenolic <b>plywood</b> <b>adhesive</b> and a resorcinol-formaldehyde laminating adhesive in Douglas-fir gluelines under conditions analogous to mill production. The dielectric spectrometer used in this study produced frequencies of 100 - 1000 Hz and measured voltage, capacitance, phase angle, and dissipation of the glued assembly placed between its electrodes. Capacitance was found to be the property that was most sensitive to changes in the wood-adhesive composite during the cure process. The dielectric spectrometer was able to accurately and consistently measure the capacitance of oven dried wood. Dielectric measurements were very sensitive to the presence of water, and the increase in capacitance with an increase in moisture content was reproducible. Problems were encountered when using the dielectric spectrometer to monitor cure of a resin in wood composites. The lack of repeatability in capacitance measurements led {{to the conclusion that the}} Audrey II dielectric spectrometer could not measure cure of a highly caustic phenolic adhesive or a resorcinolformaldehyde laminating adhesive in Douglas-fir gluelines. Components of a phenol-formaldehyde resin were examined to determine what caused the lack of reproducibility. The capacitance was reproducible with either water or aqueous caustic on the veneers. However, the presence of either phenol or formalin on the veneers resulted in a total lack of repeatability in capacitance. Both phenol and formalin are excellent swelling agents for wood and as wood swells, its microstructure is opened and plasticized. This would increase the capacitance. Other factors that would influence variation in swelling and capacitance would include depth of lathe checks, wood damage, porosity, density, and natural anatomical variation that influences the rate of penetration of chemicals into wood. Even considering the swelling effects and natural variation of wood, the variability in capacitance of the wood-adhesive composite is not readily understood...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryX. Susan SunThe {{ecological}} {{and public health}} liabilities related with consuming petroleum resources have inspired the development of sustainable and environmental friendly materials. Plant protein, as a byproduct of oil extraction, {{has been identified as}} an economical biomaterial source and has previously demonstrated excellent potential for commercial use. Due to the intrinsic structure, protein-based materials are vulnerable to water and present relatively low wet mechanical properties. The purpose of this study focuses on increasing protein surface hydrophobicity through chemical modifications in order to improve wet mechanical strength. However, most of the water sensitive groups (WSG), such as amine, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups, are also attributed to adhesion. Therefore, the goal of this research is to reduce water sensitive groups to an optimum level that the modified soy protein presents good wet adhesion and wet mechanical strength. In this research, we proposed two major approaches to reduce WSG: 1). By grafting hydrophobic chemicals onto the WSGs on protein surface; 2). By interacting hydrophobic chemicals with the WSGs. For grafting, undecylenic acid (UA), a castor oil derivative with 11 -carbon chain with a carboxyl group at one end and naturally hydrophobic, was used. Carboxyl groups from UA reacted with amine groups from protein and converted amines into ester with hydrophobic chains grafting on protein surface. The successful grafting of UA onto soy protein isolate (SPI) was proved by both Infrared spectroscopy (IR) and ninhydrin test. Wood adhesive made from UA modified soy protein had reached the highest wet strength of 3. 30 ± 0. 24 MPa with fiber pulled out, which was 65 % improvement than control soy protein. Grafting fatty acid chain was verified to improve soy protein water resistance. For interaction approach, soy oil with three fatty acid chains was used to modify soy protein. Soy oil was first modified into waterborne polyurethanes (WPU) to improve its compatibility and reactivity with aqueous protein. The main forces between WPU and protein were hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and physical entanglement. Our results showed that WPU not only increased protein surface hydrophobicity with its fatty acid chains but also enhanced the three-dimensional network structure in WPU-SPI adhesives. WPU modification had increased wet adhesion strength up to 3. 81 ± 0. 34 MPa with fiber pulled out compared with 2. 01 ± 0. 46 MPa of SPI. Based on IR and thermal behavior changes observed by DSC, it was inferred that a new crosslinking network formed between WPU and SPI. To exam if the UA and WPU technologies developed using soy protein are suitable for other plant proteins, we selected camelina protein because camelina oil has superior functional properties for jet fuels and polymers. Like soy protein, camelina protein is also highly water sensitive. However, simply applied UA and WPU to camelina protein following the same methods used for soy proteins, we did not obtain the same good adhesion results compared to what we achieved with soy protein. After protein structure analysis, we realized that camelina protein is more compact in structure compared to soy protein that made it weak in both dry and wet adhesion strength. Therefore, for camelina protein, we unfolded its compact structure with Polymericamine epichlorohydrine (PAE) first to improve flexible chains with more adhesion groups for future reaction with UA or WPU. PAE with charged groups interacted camelina protein through electrostatic interaction and promoted protein unfolding to increase reactivity within protein subunits and between protein and wood cells. Therefore, the wet adhesion strength of camelina protein was improved from zero to 1. 30 ± 0. 23 MPa, which met the industrial standard for <b>plywood</b> <b>adhesives</b> in terms of adhesion strength. Then the wet adhesion strength of camelina protein was further improved after applying UA and WPU into the PAE modified camelina protein. In addition, we also found PAE unfolding significantly improved the dry adhesion strength of camelina protein from 2. 39 ± 0. 52 to 5. 39 ± 0. 50 MPa with 100 % wood failure on two-layer wood test. Camelina meal which is even more economical than camelina protein was studied as wood adhesive. Through a combination of PAE and laccase modification method, the wet adhesion strength of camelina meal was improved as high as 1. 04 ± 0. 19 MPa, which also met industrial standards for <b>plywood</b> <b>adhesives.</b> The results of this study had proven successful modification of oilseed protein to increase water resistance and wet mechanical strength. We have gained in-depth understanding of the relationship between protein structure and wet adhesion strength. The successful modification of plant proteins meeting the industrial needs for bio-adhesives will promote the development of eco-friendly and sustainable materials...|$|R

40|$|The {{extraction}} {{and processing}} of starch from agricultural commodities {{is one of}} the most important agro-industries world wide. By the early 1990 s, global production of starch probably exceeded 38 million metric tons (mmt) per year for a market value of at least $ 11 billion. In Asia, starch production was about 16 mmt and demand for starch by food and non-food industries was growing by 5 - 10 percent per year. Starch is very versatile and has a wide variety of uses. Almost all major industries have found some uses for starch. In food industries, starch is used to impart “functional” properties to processed foods such as thickening, binding, filling, and taste. Starch is used in canned soups, instant desserts, ice creams, processed meats, sauces, and bakery products. Starch can also be converted into sugar. It is used to manufacture sweeteners and syrups and to feed enzymes for the manufacture of MSG, a popular taste enhancer. Uses of starch in non-food industries are just as numerous. Major users include the textile, paper, <b>plywood,</b> and <b>adhesive</b> industries. Starch is also used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. Starch is not a uniform commodity, however. Starch extracted from different commoditie...|$|R

Chitosan is produced from the structural {{element in the}} exoskeleton of crustaceans (such as crabs and shrimp), and {{has the ability to}} absorb HCHO. In this study, the HCHO removal efficiency by chitosan additives was evaluated for two building materials- <b>adhesive</b> and <b>plywood.</b> The experiments were performed in a small chamber based on the method of Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) A 1901 to evaluate the HCHO emission from <b>adhesive</b> and <b>plywood</b> before and after the application of chitosan additives. Both the HCHO concentration in the chamber and the HCHO emission factor of two adhesives, urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin and Poly Vinyl Acetate (PVAC) resin, were reduced from 0. 02 ~ 0. 21 ppm and 0. 12 ~ 1. 05 mg/m 2 h to 0 ~ 0. 14 ppm and 0. 12 ~ 0. 63 mg/m 2 h after using chitosan additives. The best HCHO removal efficiency was adding 9 % chitosan additives in the adhesives. The amount of absorbed HCHO is proportional to the amount of chitosan additives, and approximate 0. 02 mg of HCHO can be absorbed by per mg of chitosan additive (i. e. absorption capacity 0. 02 g HCHO/g Chitosan) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] In {{order to}} predict the service life of plywood heating floors, {{dry-heat}} exposure test of lauan plywood made with each of six type of typical wood adhesives was carried out at 50 °, 70 °, 100 ° and 150 °C for 250 days. Internal bond strength and location of failure of the exposed specimens were measured at selected intervals. Data were plotted {{as a function of}} the exposed time. Confidence limit was applied on the regression and the service life was calculated by extraporating the lower confidence limit curve to the half-strength. The apparent mechanism of dry-heat degradation of plywood in 1500 and 100 °C seemed to differ from the lower temperature exposures. On 70 ° and 50 °C, more conservative estimation was made by the kinetic method on the Arrhenius relationship. The result showed the detrimen-tal effect of the acid catalyst on polyvinyl-acetate cross-linked and urea resin <b>adhesives.</b> <b>Plywood</b> specimens produced with melamine, phenol, phenol-resorcinol, and resorcinol resin adhesives showed excellent durability in dry-heat exposure at temperature normally found in service of floor heating...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{sandwich}} structures can increase the variety of products by tailoring the functional properties even for well established products as plywood. By merging different materials into one the spectrum of the material properties and its performance becomes attractive for different applications. In particular interest from the transport industry {{is associated with the}} concept of twinning the textile fabrics with the high performance plywood. Therefore deriving the weight efficient panel structure with enhanced vibration, thermal and electromagnetic damping properties are the prerequisites to enter new market sector. Textile fabrics are in particularly effective when impact energy absorption of the structures are required. Moreover combination of plywood and textiles made out of natural fibres contributes to eco friendly manufacturing philosophy of the European car industry. The present research is focused on assessment of the mechanical properties of the laminate composed of 3 D textile fabrics made of glass, flax or basalt fibres and the plywood. Textile fabrics made by twill, panama, satin, also leno (fig. 1. a.) and multiaxial weave (fig. 1. b.) configurations are most frequent ones. The production of multi fibre textiles is quite simple as specific configuration of fibres and fibre content can be done varied within each lay-up. Laboratory scale produced laminated plywood and fabric composites were tested in tension and bending together with the impact energy absorption tests in order to measure corresponding mechanical properties and evaluate overall advantages of the individual textile fabric type. These textile fabrics were attached to the <b>plywood</b> using wood <b>adhesive</b> glue or thermoplastic polymer film processed in hot pressing. It has been shown that the energy absorption properties of the plywood laminates can be enhances by order of magnitude compared to the traditional plywood plates.
