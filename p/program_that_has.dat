25|$|Ethiopia {{has been}} {{pioneering}} a <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> now {{become part of}} the World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food. Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.|$|E
25|$|Broad {{protection}} {{actions are}} geared towards children who {{could potentially be}} trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities. This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work. Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and conditional cash transfer programs. Another major broad protection <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been readily endorsed by UN.GIFT, the I.L.O, and UNICEF involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education. Another way to raise awareness for child trafficking is by communities {{from all over the}} world dedicating a week to this situation. Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims. The events held by communities could include films, guest speakers, booths, and many more things that can help people understand the seriousness of this issue.

Kansas has had four head coaches inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, more than any other program in the nation. A perennial conference powerhouse, Kansas leads Division I all-time in regular season conference titles with 60 in 110 years of conference play (the MVIAA Conference was created in 1907) through the 2016–17 regular season. The Jayhawks have won a record 17 conference titles and a record 10 conference tournament titles in the 21 years of the Big 12's existence. The program also owns the best Big 12 records in both those areas with a 274–57 record in conference play and a 41–10 record in tournament play.

500|$|Jean Holm (The Times Higher Education Supplement) too {{noted the}} fast growth of {{conservative}} Christian schools {{but added that}} the book was also relevant in Britain, which was experiencing similar growth. She found the first few chapters somewhat repetitive as it expressed the uniformity of the school's practices. Richard V. Pierard (Christian Century) felt that Peshkin wrote with [...] "deeply respect" [...] for the school and its community, but Pierard, himself an evangelical, was [...] "disturbed" [...] by the community's [...] "indoctrinated" [...] values—"biblical absolutes" [...] that are [...] "part of a conservative <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been read into Scripture". Paul F. Parsons (Christianity Today) noted that Peshkin found the school successful by traditional terms, with standardized tests, orderly climate, and [...] "fun-loving" [...] students, but lacking free exchange of ideas, as education is seen more as a transfer than a quest, and students do not learn [...] "choice, doubt, suspended judgment, [...] dissent". Parsons affirmed Peshkin's findings as [...] "remarkably representative" [...] based on his own visits to [...] "Christian schools in 60 cities", though others are less absolutist. And while Julian McAllister Groves (Journal of Contemporary Ethnography) described the text as [...] "beautifully written" [...] and [...] "poetic", he doubted whether the school's students were as converted as they said, and felt that Peshkin might have seen more [...] "role distance" [...] and examples of playing along simply for community acceptance had he stayed for lunch and other informal observations.|$|E
