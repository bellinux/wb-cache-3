Bad {{news about the}} risk of the asset underlying the derivative increases the expected liability of a <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> and undermines her risk prevention incentives. This limits risk-sharing, and may create endogenous counterparty risk and contagion from news about the hedged risk to the balance sheet of <b>protection</b> <b>sellers.</b> Margin calls after bad news can improve <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> incentives and enhance the ability to share risk. Central clearing can provide insurance against counterparty risk but must be designed to preserve risk-prevention incentives...|$|R

40|$|We analyze optimal hedging {{contracts}} between a protection buyer and <b>protection</b> <b>sellers.</b> When a seller observes that the hedge {{is likely to}} become a liability for her, it reduces her incentives to exert unobservable risk-prevention effort. Hedging can thus generate endogenous counterparty risk. To avoid such risk, the protection buyer may prefer to give up some insurance to maintain the seller’s incentives. Variation margins, compelling the <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> to liquidate some of her risky positions after bad news, relax the incentive problem.

40|$|International audienceCredit default swaps (CDSs), {{initially}} {{intended as}} instruments for hedging and managing credit risk, have been pinpointed {{during the recent}} crisis as being detrimental to ﬁ nancial stability. We argue {{that the impact of}} credit default swap markets on ﬁ nancial stability crucially depends on clearing mechanisms and capital and liquidity requirements for large <b>protection</b> <b>sellers.</b> In particular, the culprits are not so much speculative or “naked” credit default swaps but inadequate risk management and supervision of <b>protection</b> <b>sellers.</b> When <b>protection</b> <b>sellers</b> are inadequately capitalised, OTC (over-the-counter) CDS markets may act as channels for contagion and systemic risk. On the other hand, a CDS market where all major dealers participate in a central clearing facility with adequate reserves can actually contribute to mitigating systemic risk. In the latter case, a key element is the risk management of the central counterparties, for which we outline some recommendations...|$|R

40|$|Investments in {{any form}} of {{financial}} product, other than a bank deposit at the risk-free interest rate, involve some sort of risk due to the volatility of the economy. Interest rate risk is the most critical risk factor affecting fixed income securities. However, the growing credit derivatives market is based primarily on credit or default risk. This is the risk caused by {{the possibility that a}} company will have financial troubles and will have to default on payments which it owes to its lenders. US treasury securities are considered to be free of credit risk because they are backed by the government. In order to protect investors from this risk, the credit derivatives market emerged with various products whose sole purpose is to hedge credit risk. A credit derivative is a contract between a protection buyer and a <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> to transfer the credit risk of an asset without the actual transfer of the asset. The most fundamental credit derivative is the credit default swap. In a credit default swap, the protection buyer makes periodic premium payments to the <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> in exchange for the promise that if default occurs, the <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> will receive the defaulted security and repay the protection buyer a percentage of what was owed.

40|$|We analyze optimal hedging {{contracts}} {{and show that}} although hedging aims at sharing risk, {{it can lead to}} more risk-taking. News implying that a hedge is likely to be loss-making undermines the risk-prevention incentives of the <b>protection</b> <b>seller.</b> This incentive problem limits the capacity to share risks and generates endogenous counterparty risk. Optimal hedging can therefore lead to contagion from news about insured risks to the balance sheet of insurers. Such endogenous risk is more likely to materialize ex post when the ex ante probability of counterparty default is low. Variation margins emerge as an optimal mechanism to enhance risk-sharing capacity. Paradoxically, they can also induce more risk-taking.

5000|$|Movements of {{financial}} capital are normally dependent on either credit or equity transfers. The global credit market {{is three times}} the size of global equity. [...] Credit is in turn dependent on the reputation or creditworthiness of the entity which takes responsibility for the funds. Credit is also traded in financial markets. The purest form is the credit default swap market, which is essentially a traded market in credit insurance. A credit default swap represents the price at which two parties exchange this riskthe <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> takes the risk of default of the credit in return for a payment, commonly denoted in basis points (one basis point is 1/100 of a percent) of the notional amount to be referenced, while the protection buyer pays this premium and in the case of default of the underlying (a loan, bond or other receivable), delivers this receivable to the <b>protection</b> <b>seller</b> and receives from the seller the par amount (that is, is made whole).|$|R

2500|$|Another kind of {{risk for}} the seller of credit default swaps is jump risk or jump-to-default risk.
