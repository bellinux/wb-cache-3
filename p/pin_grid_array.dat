25|$|The 80286 was {{designed}} for multi-user systems with multitasking applications, including communications (such as automated PBXs) and real-time process control. It had 134,000 transistors and consisted of four independent units: address unit, bus unit, instruction unit and execution unit, organized into a loosely coupled (buffered) pipeline {{just as in the}} 8086. The significantly increased performance over the 8086 was primarily due to the non-multiplexed address and data buses, more address-calculation hardware (most importantly, a dedicated adder) and a faster (more hardware-based) multiplier. It was produced in a 68-pin package, including PLCC (plastic leaded chip carrier), LCC (leadless chip carrier) and PGA (<b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array)</b> packages.|$|E
2500|$|Interestingly, the Palomino core {{actually}} debuted {{earlier in}} the mobile market—branded as Mobile Athlon 4 with the codename [...] "Corvette". It distinctively used a ceramic interposer much like the Thunderbird instead of the organic <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> package used on all later Palomino processors.|$|E
50|$|The MCM has 387 pins, {{of which}} {{approximately}} half {{are arranged in}} a <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (PGA) and half in an interstitial <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (IPGA). The packaging was designed for Socket 8.|$|E
50|$|The CPU used 145 MCAs. These {{were large}} scale {{integration}} devices fabricated by Motorola in their 3 µm MOSAIC bipolar process. They were packaged in 68-pin leadless chip carriers or <b>pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>arrays</b> and were mounted onto the {{printed circuit board}} in sockets or were soldered in place. An additional 1,100 small scale integration (SSI) and medium scale integration (MSI) ECL logic devices were used. These ICs were spread out over 17 modules plugged into a backplane.|$|R
50|$|The BGA is a {{solution}} to the problem of producing a miniature package for an integrated circuit with many hundreds of <b>pins.</b> <b>Pin</b> <b>grid</b> <b>arrays</b> and dual-in-line surface mount (SOIC) packages were being produced with more and more pins, and with decreasing spacing between the pins, but this was causing difficulties for the soldering process. As package pins got closer together, the danger of accidentally bridging adjacent pins with solder grew. BGAs do not have this problem if the solder is factory-applied to the package.|$|R
40|$|A bus based {{parallel}} architectures is practical {{only for}} {{a small number of}} processors. For several thousand processors the bus would need to have a width of tens of thousands, or possibly a few hundred thousand wires (bits). Similarly, {{it is not possible to}} provide complete interconnectivity for highly parallel systems. For N = 10, 000, 100, 000, 000 channels would be required. Not only is the total number of channels unrealistic, but so is also the number of channels per node. One of the major constraints in system design is the packaging. The number of connections between a chip and a printed circuit (PC) board, or between a PC board and a backplane, or between backplanes, are limited by ensuring a sufficient mechanical strength of the connectors, enforcing a minimum width of each connector. <b>Pin</b> <b>Grid</b> <b>Arrays</b> (PGA) offer 200 – 400 pins per chip package, while current state-of-the art so-called Land <b>Grid</b> <b>Arrays</b> (LGA) offers up to 2, 000 connectors with spacings at about 1 mm, requiring an area of close to 2, 500 mm 2. Board connectors may offer about 2 – 3 pins per mm, or about 1, 000 for a standard PC board. Thus, all highly parallel systems use some form of sparse network to interconnect the processors and memory modules. Locality of reference is important for performance at all levels in most systems.
