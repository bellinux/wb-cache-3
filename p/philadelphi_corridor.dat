The {{international}} border along the <b>Philadelphi</b> <b>corridor</b> between Egypt and the Gaza Strip is [...] long. With the Agreement on Movement and Access, known as the Rafah Agreement, in 2005, Israel ended its presence in the Philadelphi Route and transferred responsibility for security arrangements to Egypt and the PA {{under the supervision of}} the EU. The Egyptian army has since destroyed some Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels [...] "in order to fight any element of terrorism", according to an Egyptian security official. The Gaza border crossing into Egypt remains under the full control of Egypt. Egypt has alternately restricted or allowed goods and people to cross that terrestrial border.|$|E
2500|$|Israel's stated {{goals in}} Operation [...] "Summer Rains" [...] were to {{suppress}} the firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza into the western Negev, and to secure the release of Corporal Gilad Shalit, who had been captured by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on June 25. The soldier was captured amid a background of violence between the IDF and Palestinian militant groups since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. According to statistics published by the Israeli government, 757 missiles from Gaza hit Israel between the withdrawal {{and the end of}} June 2006. The IDF had responded with artillery fire and air raids. During the operation, the pace of both rocket fire and shelling increased dramatically, and the IDF mounted numerous ground incursions into the Gaza Strip to target militant groups and their infrastructure, including smuggling tunnels in the <b>Philadelphi</b> <b>Corridor.</b> On {{the first day of the}} conflict, Israel also bombed the only electrical power plant in the Gaza Strip.|$|E
50|$|The Gaza Strip {{smuggling}} tunnels are {{passages that}} have been dug under the <b>Philadelphi</b> <b>Corridor,</b> a narrow strip of land, 14 km (8.699 miles) in length, situated along the border between Gaza Strip and Egypt. After the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty of 1979, the town of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, was split by this Corridor. One part {{is located in the}} southern part of Gaza, and the smaller part of the town is in Egypt. After Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, the <b>Philadelphi</b> <b>Corridor</b> was placed under the control of the Palestine Authority until 2007. When Hamas seized power in 2007, Egypt and Israel closed borders with Gaza.|$|E

50|$|Unlike Netanyahu, Steinitz did support Sharon's 2005 plan to {{withdrawal}} from Gaza. Yet, {{at the same}} time, he led a parliamentary battle against delivering the <b>Philadelphi</b> <b>Corridor</b> to Egypt, claiming that the Egyptians deliberatley ignore Palestinian arms smuggling through the Sinai Peninsula. He also argued that the Israel-Egypt Philadelphi agreement might erode the demilitarization of Sinai.|$|E

Israel {{stated that the}} suicide bomber had infiltrated through the 220 kilometer Israeli-Egyptian border which is fenceless and patrolled by minimal IDF and Border Police forces. The suicide bomber possibly entered Egypt through an underground tunnel across the <b>Philadelphi</b> <b>Corridor,</b> and was then driven to the Egyptian/Israeli border, which he crossed on foot some 30 km from Eilat.|$|E
