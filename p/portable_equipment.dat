5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all <b>portable</b> <b>equipment</b> from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{there are}} three basic formats of USB connectors: the default or {{standard}} format intended for desktop or <b>portable</b> <b>equipment</b> (for example, on USB flash drives), the mini intended for mobile equipment (now deprecated except the Mini-B, which is used on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for low-profile mobile equipment (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E

25|$|Polysomnography is {{performed}} in a sleep laboratory while the patient sleeps, preferably {{at his or her}} usual sleeping time. The polysomnogram (PSG) objectively records sleep stages and respiratory events. It shows multiple channels of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal and oral airflow, abdominal, chest and leg movements and blood oxygen levels. A single part of a polysomnogram is sometimes measured at home with <b>portable</b> <b>equipment,</b> for example oximetry, which records blood oxygen levels throughout the night. Polysomnography is not routinely used in the evaluation of patients with insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, except as needed to rule out other disorders. It will usually be a definitive test for sleep apnea.|$|E
25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. <b>Portable</b> <b>equipment</b> such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles asked {{producer}} Martin {{to come to}} the rescue, so {{he borrowed}} two four-track recorders from EMI, and long-time Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick was given the task of building and setting up a studio with <b>portable</b> <b>equipment.</b> After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least £300,000 (£4.5 million in 2015 pounds). Starr once approved of one of Mardas’ ideas: [...] "He [...] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio – you’d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we thought we could sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren’t interested at all".|$|E

In 1988 there was a move brought by Councillor Bill Brade and backed by the British Film Institute and police to show films at the Hall because the local Cannon Cinema had been closed and to distract local youth from vandalism. In 1991 staff from the Windsor Cinema in Broadstairs brought <b>portable</b> <b>equipment</b> and seating for converting the Hall into a cinema for three evenings per week plus a children's matinee. In 1993 there was a move to manage the Hall via a local trust composed of the building's user groups, including Herne Bay Operatic Society, Theatrecraft, Herne Bay Active Retirement Association and 691 Promotions. From 1996 to 2004 [...] the Hall was run by Eurest, but the business reverted to Council control for a three-year trial from March 2004 after the contractor served up frozen roast potatoes at a dinner dance in November 2002. The Council's manager from 2004 to 2006 was Tony Farrow who put in a new £20,000 sound system.
