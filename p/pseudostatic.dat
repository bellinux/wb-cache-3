The {{fact that the}} earthquake force is modeled as a constant force acting in one direction, represents this model's major limitation. In a Newmark permanent deformation mathematical analysis, movement of a landfill occurs when a driving force on the landfill is greater than its resisting force. A shaking table laboratory test works to explore the strength characteristics at interfaces between different components of the landfill. Of primary concern is the contact between soil and landfill liner, as this is usually {{considered to be a}} weak point in the system. A dynamic centrifuge test works to model the landfill in a scaled-down form. Typically in this approach, a small simplified landfill is constructed in a test box. During this testing, earthquake loading is simulated on the sample landfill. A major application of this type of testing is to observe the behavior of landfill liners during ground shaking.|$|E

To accomplish this purpose, the <b>pseudostatic</b> analysis and the earthquake-induced displacement method were performed on plane and wedge failures of rock slopes, both deterministically and probabilistically. In the deterministic analysis, the <b>pseudostatic</b> factor of safety and earthquake-induced displacement were calculated using fixed values of parameters. For the probabilistic analysis, the uncertainty of rock slopes and of earthquake ground motions were considered using the First-Order Second-Moment method and regression analysis. ^ Regarding earthquake forces acting on the rock slopes, equations for <b>pseudostatic</b> factor of safety in plane and wedge failures were derived using the limit equilibrium method, and these equations were used for parametric studies. ^ Using the <b>pseudostatic</b> method, critical earthquake accelerations were calculated for both plane and wedge failures. The earthquake-induced displacements were determined using double integration of those parts of the accelerograms that lie above the critical earthquake coefficient. ^ In the probabilistic analysis, to estimate the mean and variance of the displacement in rock slopes, 23 corrected accelerograms were obtained from 8 earthquakes ranging from 5. 3 to 7. 0 in magnitude and from 16. 7 to 50. 0 km in epicentral distance. Based on the empirical equation obtained from regression analysis, the probability that displacement exceeds a specific value (10 cm) was calculated for both plane and wedge failures under various conditions. ^ Stability of rock slopes under post-earthquake conditions was evaluated using the residual shear strength of discontinuities. Results obtained from pre- and post-earthquake stability analyses were compared in terms of the factor of safety (deterministic) and the probability of failure. ^ Finally, as a case study, the Madison Canyon rockslide caused by the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959 was evaluated using the methods developed in the current study.

40|$|The {{combined}} pile-raft foundation (CPRF) {{has been}} widely recognized as economic and rational foundation for high-rise buildings when subjected to vertical loading because of its effectiveness in load sharing by both raft and pile components. This results in smaller total and differential settlements with a reduced number of piles as compared with group piles. Until recently, the behavior of CPRF when subjected to lateral and real earthquake loading conditions in addition to vertical loads has not been well understood {{as a result of}} the complexities involved in the interaction of the pile, soil, and raft under such loading considerations. In the present study, an attempt has been made to investigate the behavior of CPRF with the use of centrifuge testing and a numerical model under <b>pseudostatic</b> and dynamic loading conditions carried out with finite-element software. After successful validation of the present CPRF model with both centrifuge and numerical model results, the same model was used for further study under El-Centro 1979, Loma Prieta 1989, Bhuj 2001 and Sikkim 2011 real earthquake <b>pseudostatic</b> loading and real acceleration-time history. The maximum displacement and bending moment were observed at the pile head, which is attributable to the rigid fixity of the piles with the raft. The crossover point in the bending moment profile was observed at shallow depths for all cases of loading. The occurrence of the resonance condition that yielded maximum horizontal displacement of the CPRF as a result of one of the input motions is also highlighted in the present study. The difference in the response of soil just below the raft of the CPRF and at the far field indicated that near-field and far-field ground motions were not in tandem. A case study on an existing CPRF of Messeturm Tower, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, is also presented. The existing CPRF of Messeturm Tower was modeled and analyzed under static and <b>pseudostatic</b> loading conditions. Obtained results show good correlation with the static field-measured results.

40|$|Abstract: A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} for the end-effector trajectory tracking control of flexi-ble robot manipulators. The equations of motion are separated into two parts that represent the <b>pseudostatic</b> equilibrium and the deviations from it. The part of the control input for the <b>pseudostatic</b> equilibrium is determined algebraically, and {{the other part of}} the control input for the stabilization of the deviations is obtained by a state variable feedback law, by using strain, joint variable, and end-effector position measurements. The feedback gain matrix is determined online by continuously updated pole placement. The <b>pseudostatic</b> equilibrium is defined here as a hypothetical state, in which the velocity and acceleration of the end-effector have their desired values whereas the elastic deformations are instantaneously constant. In order to demonstrate the method, a planar two-link robot with a flexible forearm is taken into consideration. The elasticity of the forearm is approximately described by the first two modes, and a controller is designed by using this two-mode model. Furthermore, in order to investigate the effects of mod-elling discrepancies, a ‘submodel controller ’ is designed by using a model with only the first mode and it is applied to the same system with the two-mode model. The performances of these two controllers are compared by means of simulations. The behaviour of the flexible robot is also simulated by using the computed torque method as if the robot is rigid in order to illustrate the importance of including the flexibility effects in the formation of an appropriate control law. The spillover effect that causes the dominant poles to approach towards the imaginary axis is inspected by monitoring the real parts of the dominant poles of the closed-loop system under the effect of the ‘submodel ’ and ‘computed torque ’ controllers...|$|E
40|$|A stress {{plasticity}} {{solution is}} proposed {{for evaluating the}} gravitational and dynamic active earth pressures on cantilever retaining walls with long heel. The solution {{takes into account the}} friction angle of the soil, wall roughness, backfill inclination and horizontal and vertical seismic accelerations. It is validated by means of the comparison with both traditional limit equilibrium methods (e. g. Mononobe–Okabe equations) and static and <b>pseudostatic</b> numerical FLAC analyses. For numerical analyses the soil is modelled as an elasto-plastic non-dilatant medium obeying the Mohr–Coulomb yield criterion, while the wall is elastic. The solutions for the horizontal and vertical seismic coefficients are proposed, which allow one to determine the intensity of the active thrust and its inclination δ with respect to the horizontal. It is demonstrated that the latter also depends on the soil friction angle φ. The inclination in seismic conditions δE is greater than the one in static conditions, δS, usually adopted in both cases. As a matter of fact, since wall stability conditions improve with the increase of inclination δ, the present method gives solutions that are less onerous than traditional ones, producing less conservative wall designs. Finally <b>pseudostatic</b> results are compared with proper dynamic analyses (by FLAC code) performed utilising four Italian accelerometric time-histories as input ground motion...|$|E

The following tests are generally used, in order from most used method to least used method: the static testing method, dynamic testing methods, <b>pseudostatic</b> and statnamic testing methods. During a <b>pseudostatic</b> (or statnamic) test the pile is loaded with a ~ 70 - 150 ms loading pulse. In comparison with the dynamic test this loading regime is about 20 times as long, in comparison with the static test this is very short lasting. The difference in loading regime is influencing the bearing capacity of the pile. In literature two main phenomena for the change in bearing capacity are recognized: the excess pore pressures and the loading rate. In the typical Dutch situation the end bearing piles are situated in the Pleistocene sand layer, so the influence of the loading rate in non-saturated and saturated sand are of interest. From literature is concluded that the effect of the loading rate on the strength and stiffness properties for dry sand are small, but for the rate effect on the shaft friction no conclusive answer could be found. Therefore a series of model scale tests are performed to investigate the influence of the loading rate on the bearing capacity...|$|E

40|$|Leshchinsky, DovThe {{resultant}} force of lateral earth pressures {{is commonly used}} in design of nearly vertical walls while flatter slopes {{are designed to be}} internally stable using a factor of safety approach. An unstable slope is considered to have unsatisfactory factor of safety unless supported by internal and/or external measures. However, from analytical viewpoint, the distinction between walls and unstable slopes is unnecessary. Using limit equilibrium analysis combined with a log spiral surface, a previous formulation is extended to deal with <b>pseudostatic</b> instability of simple, homogenous, cohesionless slopes. Hence, the original approach by Mononobe-Okabe (M-O) is extended to yield the resultant lateral force needed to stabilize an unstable slope. Given the slope angle, the design internal angle of friction, the backslope, the surcharge, the vertical and horizontal seismic acceleration, and the inclination of the {{resultant force}}, one can calculate the magnitude of this resultant. The approach allows for the selection of a rational inclination of the resultant for cases where soil-face interaction is likely to develop along vertical segments only. The approach generalizes the Coulomb (static) and the M-O (<b>pseudostatic)</b> methods as all are in the same framework of limit equilibrium. While all methods yield identical results for vertical slopes, where the critical slip surface defining the active wedge degenerates to the same planar surface, the presented approach becomes more critical for flatter unstable slopes where the active wedge is augmented by a curved surface. Hence, seamless extension of the M-O approach is produced. University of Delaware, Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringM. C. E...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the lateral motion of rigid, soil-engaging {{implements}} hitched to a tractor with a one-point or a three-point hitch, {{as well as}} the vertical motion of seed drill coulters for use in tilled seedbeds are investigated. The motion of most tractor-hitched soil-engaging implements is heavily overdamped, it was therefore described by a first order model, based on a quantitative description of the lateral properties of the implement and a functional description of the hitch. For each hitch-implement combination an effective hitch-point, towards which the implement tends to move, was defined and a method to calculate the effective hitch length was developed. The return of a laterally disturbed implement was shown to be exponential. The disturbance is reduced to 10 % of its initial value when the implement moves forward a distance of 2. 3 times the effective hitch length. The tractional hitch point and the directional hitch point coincide for one-point hitches but not for three-point hitches. This gives the three-point hitches unique properties: The angular {{as well as the}} lateral deflection of a three-point hitched implement will normally be smaller compared to those of a one-point hitched version of the same implement. This is true both when it is used on a hillside and when it is used with an asymmetric load. The three-point hitch is also shown to be versatile enough to enable the construction of a laterally movable and, for both directional and non-directional implements, self-centring front mounted three-point hitch. The horizontal and vertical soil forces on coulters with different rake angles (70 - 135 °) were measured under both <b>pseudostatic</b> (no vertical velocity and no accelerations) and fully dynamic conditions. Most of the measurements were made in a soil bin with dried sand, but some of the <b>pseudostatic</b> measurements were made in a clay field. Empirical models were developed for the soil forces acting on the coulter under both <b>pseudostatic</b> and dynamic conditions. These models were used to simulate coulter equilibrium depth and coulter penetration. The simulations led to the following conclusions: Coulters with a large rake angle (≥ 1 l 0 °) have several advantages when compared to coulters with smaller rake angles; their equilibrium depth is less sensitive both to speed and to soil parameters and their penetration is faster, better damped and less sensitive to suspension parameters (pivot arm length and pivot axis height) and to suspension type (single armed or parallel armed). The coulter penetration was found to improve with decreasing speed, decreasing moment of inertia and increasing depth of operation. No reasons were found for complicating the coulter suspension by using a parallel arm suspension or by using separate pivot axes for front and rear row coulters. The above conclusions apply to well tilled seedbeds without stones or clods. If there are frequent stones or clods in the seedbed the present recommendation of using coulters with rake angles around 90 ° seems valid...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a methodology for seismic design of rigid watferfront-retaining wall and proposes simple design factors for the sliding stability under seismic condition. Conventional <b>pseudostatic</b> {{approach has been}} used for the calculation of the seismic forces, while for the calculation of the hydrodynamic pressure, Westergaard's approach has been used. In addition, the hydrodynamic force has been considered from both the upstream and downstream sides of the waterfront-retaining wall under free water condition of the backfill. Simplified expression for the calculation of the equivalent weight of the wall which would be needed to maintain sliding stability is presented. It has been observed that the presence of water both on the upstream and downstream sides of the wall has serious destabilizing effect on the stability of the wall. It is noticed that as the height of the water inside the backfill increased from 0. 00 to a height equal to the height of the wall itself, i. e., the backfill is fully submerged, the weight of the wall needed for the later case is around 3 times more than what would be needed for the former case. Similar observations were also made by varying other parameters like the horizontal and vertical seismic acceleration coefficients, height of the water on the upstream side of the wall, and soil and wall friction angles. The pore pressure ratio and the inclination of the ground, however, did not have significant effect on the results. Due to nonavailability of the results of similar kind in literature, an exact comparison for the present results could not be made.

The investigation focused particularly on possible modification for load control. <b>Pseudostatic</b> tests were conducted to determine the gear fore-and-aft spring constant, axial friction {{as a function of}} drag load, brake pressure-torque characteristics, and tire force-deflection characteristics. To study dynamic tire response, vertical drops were conducted at impact velocities of 1. 2, 1. 5, and 1. 8 m/s onto a level surface; to determine axial-friction effects, a second series of vertical drops were made at 1. 5 m/s onto surfaces inclined 5 deg and 10 deg to the horizontal. An average dynamic axial-friction coefficient of 0. 15 was obtained by comparing analytical data with inclined surface drop test data. Dynamic strut bending and associated axial friction were found to be severe for the drop tests on the 10 deg surface...|$|E
