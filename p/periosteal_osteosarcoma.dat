40|$|We {{present this}} {{case of an}} unusual {{recurrence}} of a <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> in the distal right tibia 2 years after a successful proximal right tibia primary <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> excision with a successful fibular graft. This recurrence lead to a right below-knee amputation. Case report A 34 -year-old man was referred to clinic in November 1999 with a suspicious lesion in the proximal tibia. On examination, he appeared to have a non-tender fusiform bony-hard swelling of the pre-tibial areas connected to the bone proximally. A simple X-ray of the area was normal but a CT scan of his right lower limb showed the lump being mainly extraosseous, but partially intraosseous. A biopsy of the lesion was performed, with the histological result confirming a <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> diagnosis. CT of his thorax, and a bone scan demonstrated no metastases. MRI scan of the right leg accurately confirmed {{the location of the}} lesion with no abnormality elsewhere in the tibia (Fig. 1). Two treatment options were presented to the patient in clinic in January of 2000 : (1) limb-sparing fibular graft; (2) right below-knee amputation. He was started on chemotherapy and, in April of 2000, a decision was made for excision of the proximal perioteal osteosarcoma with fibular regrafting (resection length 10 – 12 cm). A referral was made to a Consultant Plastic Surgeon, at Frenchay Hospital, and the date of 12 / 13 June 2000 was agreed for the operation. The operation took place and was successful with follow-up in the joint sarcoma clinic and sequential CT scans of the thorax, which all proved to be negative for metastases.

40|$|Surface osteosarcomas are a rare form of osteosarcomas {{accounting}} for around 3 - 6 % of all osteosarcomas. Three major groups of surface <b>osteosarcomas</b> are parosteal, <b>periosteal</b> {{and the high}} grade surface osteosarcomas. Of these, the parosteal osteosarcoma is the most common. Parosteal and <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcomas</b> are distinct clinical entities {{and it is important}} to identify the clinicoradiological differences between the two types. Surface osteosarcomas occur at a later age as compared to conventional osteosarcomas. The classical site is {{the lower end of the}} femur followed by the upper end of the tibia and upper end of humerus, in that order. The periosteal variant affects the tibia more commonly than the parosteal variety. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for high grade surface osteosarcomas. Parosteal osteosarcomas, being low grade lesions, can be treated by upfront wide excision without adjuvant systemic therapy. Controversy prevails over the need for chemotherapy in <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcomas,</b> which are intermediate grade lesions...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> is an {{uncommon}} variant of osteosarcoma which constitutes less than 2 % of all osteosarcomas. Whereas adequate surgical excision remains {{the cornerstone of}} treatment, the role of chemotherapy in this tumor is still unclear. Existing literature contains very few single center studies on the outcomes for periosteal osteosarcomas and any additional information will help in better understanding of these uncommon lesions. This study aims to evaluate the oncologic and functional outcomes of treatment of <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> treated at our institute. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 18 cases of <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> treated between January 2001 and December 2010 was carried out. There were 12 males and 6 females. The mean age at presentation was 16. 3 years (range 5 - 26 years). Tibia and femur were the most common sites (n = 8). 16 of 18 patients received chemotherapy, 16 had limb sparing resection, one had an amputation and one had rotationplasty. Of the 16 patients with limb salvage, conventional wide excision was done in 11 cases. In 5 cases tumor was excised with hemicortical excision. Of the 11 cases treated with wide excisions, 4 patients underwent an osteoarticular resection and in 7 patients a joint preserving segmental intercalary resection was done. Results: All patients were available for followup. Surgical margins were free in all patients. A good response to chemotherapy was seen in 4 / 11 cases and poor in 6 / 11 cases. In one case the histological response was not discernible due to predominant chondromyxoid nature of the tumor. The median followup was 61 months (range: 18 - 130 months). There were two local recurrences (11 %) at 9 and 18 months postsurgery. Pulmonary metastasis subsequently occurred in 4 cases (22 %). Fourteen patients are currently alive and continuously disease free. Disease free survival at 5 years was 77. 8 % and overall survival (OVS) was 83. 3 %. Patients without marrow involvement had a better OVS at 5 years when compared with patients with marrow involvement (90 % vs. 75 %) (P = 0. 23). Conclusion: Surgical excision remains the mainstay of treatment. Intramedullary involvement may suggest aggressive disease biology. The role of chemotherapy is still debatable and multicenter {{studies are needed to}} provide guidelines...|$|E

40|$|Studies on {{osteosarcoma}} {{cell lines}} {{point to the}} potential importance of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) as an autocrine factor which controls the growth of human osteosarcomas. To define further the role of TGF beta isoforms in these neoplasms, a series of 27 osteosarcomas was studied using immunohistochemical, mRNA in situ hybridization, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques. All 14 central high-grade osteosarcomas, two telangiectatic osteosarcomas, and one high-grade surface osteosarcoma showed cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for TGF beta 1, - 2, and - 3. The expression of TGF beta 1 was moderate or diffuse in 14 cases (82. 3 per cent), while low expression was detected in only three cases (17. 7 per cent). For TGF beta 2 and - 3, only moderate or diffuse staining was observed. Low-grade parosteal and <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcomas</b> showed low or undetectable levels of TGF beta 1, while TGF beta 2 and - 3 were moderately or diffusely expressed. Finally, three dedifferentiated parosteal osteosarcomas were diffusely positive for TGF beta 1, - 2, and - 3 in the high-grade component, while in the low-grade component, available for analysis in two of these cases, TGF beta 1 was demonstrated in a few neoplastic cells, and TGF beta 2 and - 3 maintained a diffuse distribution. Statistical analysis of these data showed that high-grade osteosarcomas had a significantly higher expression of TGF beta 1 than low-grade osteosarcomas, while levels of TGF beta 2 and - 3 were comparable {{in the two groups}} (p < 0. 001; p = 0. 3; p = 0. 3, respectively; Fisher's exact test). Similarly, mRNA levels of TGF beta 1 detected by in situ hybridization were significantly higher (p = 0. 04, Fisher's exact test) in high-grade osteosarcoma variants, while no differences were found for TGF beta 2 and - 3 mRNA (p = 1. 0; p = 0. 2, respectively; Fisher's exact test). In addition, mRNA analysis performed by RT-PCR in seven cases (five high-grade and two low-grade osteosarcomas) confirmed the presence of high levels of TGF beta 1 in high-grade osteosarcomas, while low-grade tumours had low or absent mRNA expression. In conclusion, this positive association suggests that TGF beta 1 may be involved in determining the aggressive clinical behaviour of high-grade osteosarcomas...|$|R

40|$|High-grade surface {{osteosarcoma}} is {{the rarest}} {{of the three}} types of surface osteosarcoma. Four cases with high-grade surface osteosarcoma arising from the distal femur and tibia are reported in this study. One patient was previously diagnosed with Turner’s syndrome. Radiologically, three cases presented characteristic appearances suggesting high-grade bone-forming sarcoma arising from the bone surface; however, one case was similar to other juxtacortical lesions such as <b>periosteal</b> and parosteal <b>osteosarcoma,</b> which typically have a better prognosis than high-grade surface osteosarcoma. Therefore, all cases underwent biopsy to determine a definitive diagnosis. Our strategy of treatment for high-grade surface osteosarcoma was a combination of wide resection and pre-/post-operative chemotherapy, equivalent to the treatment for conventional intramedullary osteosarcoma.

40|$|We {{describe}} the clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of 3 primary juxtacortical myoepithelioma/mixed tumor of bone. The patients were 2 males (13 and 23 years of age) and a 15 -year-old female. The juxtacortical lesions were all {{located in the}} femur, and were surgically removed, 2 with wide margins and one with marginal margins. This latter tumor recurred locally 18 months later. The 3 patients were free of disease at 6 to 17 months follow-up. Histologically, all lesions showed a prominent multinodular architecture, and were formed by epithelioid and stellate elements, organized in solid sheets, or embedded in myxoid or chondroid matrix. Areas of osteoid formation were also observed. One tumor had the appearance of classical mixed tumor, showing aspects of duct formation and focal squamous differentiation. Immunohistochemically, all cases were positive for cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, and S 100 protein. The expression of other myoepithelial markers, including p 63, glial fibrillary acid protein and calponin was more limited. No rearrangement of Ewing sarcoma region 1 (EWSR 1) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) genes was observed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of primary myoepitheliomas of bone arising at juxtacortical sites. These lesions must be distinguished from other benign and malignant bone and cartilage-forming surface tumors, including periosteal chondroma and chondrosarcoma, juxtacortical chondromyxoid fibroma, and <b>periosteal</b> and paraosteal <b>osteosarcoma.</b> The clinicoradiologic presentation and their histological and immunohistochemical features are distinctive enough to allow the separation from these entities...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fine needle {{aspiration}} cytology (FNAC) {{is effective}} in the diagnosis of bone lesions when combined with careful radiologic and clinical evaluation. The cytologic features of callus have not been described before in the English-language literature. CASE: An 18 -year-old female presented with {{a pain in the}} right lower leg that had been present for two months. Clinical and radiologic findings suggested either stress fracture or <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma.</b> The aspiration specimen showed individually scattered, oval cells with moderate amounts of pale pink cytoplasm. The cells contained a single eccentrically located nucleus with evenly distributed, fine chromatin. Osteoclastic giant cells were scattered in the smears. A cytologic diagnosis of benign bone-forming lesion, compatible with callus in fracture, was made. The diagnosis of late-stage callus was confirmed by subsequent histologic examination. CONCLUSION: Typical cases of stress fracture do not need histologic examination, but some cases may be confused with benign and malignant bone tumors. The typical and unique cytologic features of late-stage callus combined with clinical and radiologic findings may prevent the use of more invasive diagnostic procedures and can be a choice for management...|$|E
40|$|Background: Nowadays, {{the results}} of the {{management}} of malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors have been dramatically improved because of the advance in imaging, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical techniques. Patients can have longer survival times with limb-salvage surgery. Several techniques of recon-struction have been advocated and gained more popularity following malignant tumor resection by using allograft, tumor prostheses, composite allograft prosthesis, or arthrodesis. Objective: To report the preliminary results of 32 endoprosthetic reconstructions following malignant bone and soft-tissue tumor resection. The oncologic results, functional outcomes, and complications from the sur-gery were assessed in the present study. Material and Method: Since September 1988, the authors have performed 188 limb-salvage surgical opera-tions for the treatment of musculoskeletal tumors at Siriraj Hospital. From March 1994 to July 2006, 32 endoprosthetic reconstructions were performed on 30 patients following malignant bone or soft-tissue tumor removal. There were 16 males and 14 females {{with a mean age of}} 28 years (range 10 - 73).

40|$|Osteosarcoma, a {{bone cancer}} most {{commonly}} seen in {{adolescents and young}} adults, is usually a high-grade malignancy characterized by a very high risk {{for the development of}} pulmonary metastases. High-grade osteosarcomas are usually treated by preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy and surgery, with a very limited number of active agents available. Rarer lower-grade variants such as parosteal and <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> or low-grade central osteosarcoma are treated by surgery only. Imaging to search for possible metastases focuses on the lung. Computed tomography is the most sensitive method but cannot reliably distinguish small metastases from benign lesions. Advances of local imaging and surgical reconstruction now allow the use of limb-salvage in an ever-increasing proportion of patients. While still troubled by complications, non-invasive endoprosthesis-lengthening mechanisms have led to an increased uptake of limb-salvage, even for young, skeletally immature patients. Radiotherapy is employed when osteosarcomas cannot be removed with clear margins, but very high doses are required, and both proton and carbon-ion radiotherapy are under investigation. Unfortunately, the past 30 years have witnessed few, if any, survival improvements. Novel agents have not led to universally accepted changes of treatment standards. In patients with operable high-grade osteosarcomas, the extent of histological response to preoperative chemotherapy is a significant predictive factor for both local and systemic control. Attempts to improve prognosis by adapting postoperative treatment to response, recently tested in a randomized, prospective setting by the European and American Osteosarcoma Study Group, have not been proven to be beneficial. Many agree that only increased knowledge about osteosarcoma biology will lead to novel, effective treatment approaches and will be able to move the field forward...|$|E
40|$|Background Although {{intercalary}} allograft reconstruc-tions {{are commonly}} performed using intramedullary devices, they cannot generate compression across host-allograft junctions. Therefore, they sometimes are associ-ated with gap formation and suboptimal healing conditions. Questions/purposes We describe {{a new technique}} and present preliminary results for intercalary allograft recon-structions for tumors using a compressible intramedullary nail. Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients (19 host-allograft junctions) who underwent intercalary allograft reconstruction using the compression nailing technique. Two patients were excluded as they had additional vascularized fibular autografts, leaving 15 junctions in eight patients for analysis. Three of the inter-calary reconstructions had supplemental plate fixation at one junction. All patients received host bone reamings and cancellous allograft and one had bone marrow aspirate and demineralized bone matrix {{in addition to the}} cancellous allograft. The minimum followup was 3 months (mean, 18 months; range, 3 – 39 months). Results Thirteen of 15 junctions healed without addi-tional surgery. Two diaphyseal-diaphyseal junctions did not unite after allograft arthrodeses. One patient underwent revision for nonunion 8 months after the initial procedure, with subsequent healing. The second patient had no evi-dence of union at 6 months, after which he was lost to followup. There were no allograft fractures or infections in any reconstruction. One patient died of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and one patient had multicentric local soft tis-sue recurrences of a <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> requiring resection. Conclusions Our early observations indicate newer compressible intramedullary nails reliably address junc-tional gap formation, providing for a high rate of union while retaining the long-term benefits of intramedullary stabilization.

40|$|Background: Bone sarcomas are {{extremely}} malignant prone to rapid hematogenic metastasing. Evaluation of biological marker expression by the tumor {{is important not}} only for the search of new potential chemotherapy targets, but for the assessment of the disease prognosis. Aim: A comparative evaluation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) - 2, - 7, - 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 1 (TIMP- 1) in the serum of patients with primary bone tumors and in healthy people to identify their potential association with the histological characteristics of the tumor and the disease prognosis. Materials and methods: A comparative study of serum MMP- 2, - 7, - 9, and TIMP- 1 levels was performed in 54 patients with primary bone tumors (malignant, 45 patients, including central osteosarcoma in 21, <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> in 4, Ewing's sarcoma in 11, primary chondrosarcoma in 6, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in 3, and borderline giant cell tumors in 9) and in 26 healthy individuals {{with the use of the}} immunoenzyme technique (Biosource, USA, for TIMP- 1 and R&D, USA, for MMP- 2, - 7, and - 9). Results: The TIMP- 1 levels in the serum of patients with central and periosteal osteosarcomas were significantly higher than in the serum of healthy controls (р = 0. 038 and p = 0. 007, respectively). The MMP- 9 levels in patients with bone malignancies were significantly lower than that in the normal controls (p 160 ng/ml, the overall 5 -year survival rate was 1. 6 -fold higher than in those with lower MMP- 2 levels, and in those with ММP- 9 levels 377 ng/ml. The worst 5 -year survival (33 %) was found in the patients with serum ММP- 2 levels of less than 160 ng/ml and ММP- 9 of more than 377 ng/ml. Conclusion: The results obtain suggest that the expression of MMP- 2, MMP- 9 and TIMP- 1 could be associated with pathophysiological changes related to growth and metastatic process of bone sarcomas and osteosarcoma, in particular. This area could be an object for further studies on levels of these biomarkers and their prognostic value in bone malignancies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{progress}} in cancer treatment, including bone malignancies, {{is associated with}} advances in molecular biology. Based {{on the results of}} a  number of studies, treatment of bone sarcomas have been expanded with targeted therapy that uses drugs with targeted actions, including anti-angiogenic and bevacizumab, in particular. It inhibits the binding of a key activator of neoangiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), with its receptors type 1 and 2 (Flt- 1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells, which results in a  decrease in vascularization and in inhibition of tumor growth. Beyond VEGF, other activators of neoangiogenesis have been identified, such as interleukin 16 (IL- 16). Aim: To compare baseline serum IL- 16 and VEGF in patients with malignant, borderline and benign bone tumors. Materials and methods: Serum IL- 16 and VEGF levels was compared in 138 patients with primary bone tumors: benign (n= 10); borderline (giant cell bone, n= 22); malignant (n= 106), aged 14 to 50  years, by immunoenzyme assay (Biosource, USA for IL- 16 and R&D, USA for VEGF) before any specific treatment. Bone malignancies were identified as osteosarcoma (n= 45, among them 35   typical, 6 parosteal, and 4 periosteal), chondrosarcoma (n= 24), Ewing sarcoma (n= 27), and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (n= 7) and chordoma (n= 3). Results: The rate of IL- 16 identification in the serum of bone tumors patients was 93 %, with no significant differences depending on the histological structure of the tumor. No association between the size of primary tumors and IL- 16 serum levels was found. Overall 3 and 5 -year survival of patients with malignant bone tumors with IL- 16 serum levels> 33 pg/mL was significantly lower than in those IL- 16 levels of≤ 33 pg/mL. Overall 5 -year survival in osteosarcoma patients with higher IL- 16 serum levels 1. 6 -fold lower, in Ewing sarcoma patients, 1. 7 -fold lower, and in chondrosarcoma patients, 1. 8 -fold lower than that the patients with IL- 16 levels of≤ 33 pg/mL. VEGF levels in bone sarcomas patients were significantly higher than in those with borderline and benign tumors, whereas statistical analysis did not find any significant difference in VEGF levels depending on the histological structure of the primary tumor. Maximal VEGF levels were found in <b>periosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma,</b> minimal ones, in parosteal osteosarcoma. Overall 3 and 5 -year survival of patients with bone malignancies and serum VEGF concentrations above the mean for the group (>  493 pg/mL) was higher than that in the patients with low VEGF levels. Similar results were obtained in osteosarcoma, whereas in Ewing sarcoma and chondrosarcoma higher 3 and 5 -year survival rates were observed in patients with serum VEGF levels below 493  pg/mL. Conclusion: These data suggest that IL- 16 and VEGF expression could be associated with pathophysiological changes related to growth and metastatic process of bone sarcomas, and may be a subject for further studies to determine the levels of these biomarkers and their predictive value in bone malignancies...|$|E
