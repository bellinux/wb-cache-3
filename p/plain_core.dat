40|$|Sandwich {{composites}} {{are generally}} used in marine applications, wind turbines, space and aircraft vehicles {{due to their}} high bending rigidities {{in addition to their}} lighter weights. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of divided foam core and interlayer sheet of glass fabric on the bending performances of sandwich composites which are manufactured with glass fabrics as the facesheets/interlayer sheets and PVC foam as the core material. Sandwich composites with single and divided core are manufactured and compared in terms of flexural behavious via three point bending tests. It is found that the bending performance is enhanced with the use of divided core and using divided core does not affect the behaviour of the sandwich composite against bending deformations. In the case of the <b>plain</b> <b>core</b> sandwich composite, dividing the core is advised for certain applications rather than perforating the core to increase the bending stiffness and strength of the textile reinforced sandwich composites because it is possible to purchase core with any thickness and there is no need for additional process such as perforation. The proposed application could enhance the bending performances without altering the weight and cost of the sandwich composites, which are preferred due to their higher bending rigidities in relation to their lighter weights. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Strickland River is {{the primary}} {{sediment}} source for the Fly River system, a large tropical river that ranks in the global top 20 for both water and sediment discharge. Over the past decade the Strickland sediment discharge has been gauged at many locations. Comprehensive studies are now underway to study the delivery, transport, and storage of sediment throughout this system. A key question regards the timing and rates of sediment accumul-ation on the flood plains. Here we present the first geochronological results from an intensive flood <b>plain</b> <b>coring</b> campaign conducted in 2003, outline our procedure for dating PNG sediment with 210 Pb geochronology, and summarize some early results from 36 <b>cores.</b> Flood <b>plain</b> accumulation rates appear to be highest upstream near the gravel–sand transition, low in the middle portion of the river, and higher again in the lower reaches of the Strickland near to its confluence with the Fly River. Overall patterns of sedimentation seem to be both spatially consistent, for series of cores collected along single flood plain transects, and temporally uniform {{in the sense that}} the nature of accumulation (constant or episodic) has not generally changed over the century of record...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} {{an exponential growth}} of activities {{in the field of}} nanoscience and nanotechnology worldwide, driven both by the excitement of understanding new science and by the potential hope for applications and economic impacts. The largest activity in this field up to date has been in the synthesis and characterization of new materials consisting of particles with dimensions in the order of a few nanometers, so-called nanocrystalline materials. [1 - 8] Semiconductor nanomaterials such as III/V or II/VI compound semiconductors exhibit strong quantum confinement behavior in the size range from 1 to 10 nm. Therefore, preparation of high quality semiconductor nanocrystals has been a challenge for synthetic chemists, leading to the recent rapid progress in delivering a wide variety of semiconducting nanomaterials. Semiconductor nanocrystals, also called quantum dots, possess physical properties distinctly {{different from those of the}} bulk material. Typically, in the size range from 1 to 10 nm, when the particle size is changed, the band gap between the valence and the conduction band will change, too. In a simple approximation a particle in a box model has been used to describe the phenomenon[9]: at nanoscale dimensions the degenerate energy states of a semiconductor separate into discrete states and the system behaves like one big molecule. The size-dependent transformation of the energy levels of the particles is called “quantum size-effect”. Quantum confinement of both the electron and hole in all three dimensions leads to an increase in the effective bandgap of the material with decreasing crystallite size. Consequently, both the optical absorption and emission of semiconductor nanaocrystals shift to the blue (higher energies) as the size of the particles gets smaller. This color tuning is well documented for CdSe nanocrystals whose absorption and emission covers almost the whole visible spectral range. As particle sizes become smaller the ratio of surface atoms to those in the interior increases, which has a strong impact on particle properties, too. Prominent examples are the low melting point [8] and size/shape dependent pressure resistance [10] of semiconductor nanocrystals. Given the size dependence of particle properties, chemists and material scientists now have the unique opportunity to change the electronic and chemical properties of a material by simply controlling the particle size. In particular, CdSe nanocrystals have been widely investigated. Mainly due to their size-dependent optoelectronic properties [11, 12] and flexible chemical processibility [13], they have played a distinguished role for a number of seminal studies [11, 12, 14, 15]. Potential technical applications have been discussed, too. [8, 16 - 27] Improvement of the optoelectronic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals is still a prominent research topic. One of the most important approaches is fabricating composite type-I core-shell structures which exhibit improved properties, making them attractive from both a fundamental and a practical point of view. Overcoating of nanocrystallites with higher band gap inorganic materials has been shown to increase the photoluminescence quantum yields by eliminating surface nonradiative recombination sites. [28] Particles passivated with inorganic shells are more robust than nanocrystals covered by organic ligands only and have greater tolerance to processing conditions necessary for incorporation into solid state structures or for other applications. Some examples of core-shell nanocrystals reported earlier include CdS on CdSe [29], CdSe on CdS, [30], ZnS on CdS, [31] ZnS on CdSe[28, 32], ZnSe on CdSe [33] and CdS/HgS/CdS [34]. The characterization and preparation of a new core-shell structure, CdSe nanocrystals overcoated by different shells (CdS, ZnS), is presented in chapter 4. Type-I core-shell structures as mentioned above greatly improve the photoluminescence quantum yield and chemical and photochemical stability of nanocrystals. The emission wavelengths of type-I core/shell nanocrystals typically only shows a small red-shift when compared to the <b>plain</b> <b>core</b> nanocrystals. [30, 31, 35] In contrast to type-I core-shell nanocrystals, only few studies have been conducted on colloidal type-II core/shell structures [36 - 38] which are characterized by a staggered alignment of conduction and valence bands giving rise to a broad tunability of absorption and emission wavelengths, as was shown for CdTe/CdSe core-shell nanocrystals. [36] The emission of type-II core/shell nanocrystals mainly originates from the radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs across the core-shell interface leading to a long photoluminescence lifetime. Type-II core/shell nanocrystals are promising with respect to photoconduction or photovoltaic applications as has been discussed in the literature. [39] Novel type-II core-shell structures with ZnTe cores are reported in chapter 5. The recent progress in the shape control of semiconductor nanocrystals opens new fields of applications. For instance, rod shaped CdSe nanocrystals can enhance the photo-electro conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cells, [40, 41] and also allow for polarized emission in light emitting diodes. [42, 43] Shape control of anisotropic nanocrystals can be achieved by the use of surfactants, [44, 45] regular or inverse micelles as regulating agents, [46, 47] electrochemical processes, [48] template-assisted [49, 50] and solution-liquid-solution (SLS) growth mechnism. [51 - 53] Recently, formation of various CdSe nanocrystal shapes has been reported by the groups of Alivisatos [54] and Peng, [55] respectively. Furthermore, it has been reported by the group of Prasad [56] that noble metal nanoparticles can induce anisotropic growth of CdSe nanocrystals at lower temperatures than typically used in other methods for preparing anisotropic CdSe structures. Although several approaches for anisotropic crystal growth have been reported by now, developing new synthetic methods for the shape control of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals remains an important goal. Accordingly, we have attempted to utilize a crystal phase control approach for the controllable synthesis of colloidal ZnE/CdSe (E = S, Se, Te) heterostructures in a variety of morphologies. The complex heterostructures obtained are presented in chapter 6. The unique optical properties of nanocrystals make them appealing as in vivo and in vitro fluorophores in a variety of biological and chemical investigations, in which traditional fluorescence labels based on organic molecules fall short of providing long-term stability and simultaneous detection of multiple emission colours [References]. The ability to prepare water soluble nanocrystals with high stability and quantum yield has led to promising applications in cellular labeling, [57, 58] deep-tissue imaging, [59, 60] and assay labeling [61, 62]. Furthermore, appropriately solubilized nanocrystals have been used as donors in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) couples. [63 - 65] Despite recent progress, much work still needs to be done to achieve reproducible and robust surface functionalization and develop flexible (bio-) conjugation techniques. Based on multi-shell CdSe nanocrystals, several new solubilization and ligand exchange protocols have been developed which are presented in chapter 7. The organization of this thesis is as follows: A short overview describing synthesis and properties of CdSe nanocrystals is given in chapter 2. Chapter 3 is the experimental part providing some background information about the optical and analytical methods used in this thesis. The following chapters report the results of this work: synthesis and characterization of type-I multi-shell and type-II core/shell nanocrystals are described in chapter 4 and chapter 5, respectively. In chapter 6, a high–yield synthesis of various CdSe architectures by crystal phase control is reported. Experiments about surface modification of nanocrystals are described in chapter 7. At last, a short summary of the results is given in chapter 8...|$|E

40|$|The spatial genetic {{structure}} of common hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) was investigated using three partial mitochondrial (mt) genes and 11 nuclear microsatellite loci. All marker systems revealed significant population differentiation across Europe. Hamsters {{in central and}} western Europe belong largely to two allopatric mitochondrial lineages south and northwest of the Carpathian and Sudetes. The southern group, 'Pannonia', comprises populations inside the Carpathian basin (Czech Republic, Hungary) while the second group, 'North', includes hamsters from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Germany. Isolation of the lineages is maintained {{by a combination of}} geographical and ecological barriers. Both main phylogeographical groups show signs of further subdivision. North is separated into highly polymorphic central German and less polymorphic western populations, which most likely split during late glacial expansion (15 00010 000 bp). Clock estimates based on haplotype distributions predict a divergence of the two major lineages 85 000147 000 bp. Expansion times fall during the last glaciation (115 00010 000 bp) corroborating fossil data, which identify Cricetus cricetus as characteristic of colder climatic phases. Despite the allopatry of mt haplotypes, there is an overlap of nuclear microsatellite alleles between phylogeographical units. Although there are strong evidence that Pannonian hamsters have persisted inside the Carpathian basin over the last 50 000 years, genetic differentiation among European hamsters has mainly been caused by immigration from different eastern refugia.

The contamination pattern at river mouth is established on the particulate material at different time scales: 1930 - 2000 for floodplain cores, 1980 - 2003 for suspended particulate matter (SPM) and bed-sediments, 1994 - 2003 for atmospheric fallout and annual flood deposits. The Seine {{has been among the}} most contaminated catchments with maximum contents recorded at 130 mg kg(- 1) for Cd, 24 for Hg, 558 for Pb, 1620 for Zn, 347 for Cu, 275 for Cr and 150 for Ni. Today, the average levels for Cd (1. 8 mg kg(- 1)), Hg (1. 08), Pb (108), Zn (370), Cu (99), Cr (123) and Ni (31) are much lower but still in the upper 90 % of the global scale distribution (Cr and Ni excepted) and well above the natural background values determined on pre-historical deposits. All metal contents have decreased at least since 1955 / 65, well before metal emission regulations that started in the mid 1970 's and the metal monitoring in the catchment that started in the early 1980 's. In the last 20 y, major criteria changes for the management of contaminated particulates (treated urban sludge, agricultural soils, dredged sediments) have occurred. In the mid 1990 's, there was a complete shift in the contamination assessment scales, from sediment management and water usage criteria to the good ecological state, now required by the 2000 European Directive. When comparing excess metal outputs, associated to river SPM, to the average metal demand within the catchment from 1950 to 2000, the leakage ratios decrease exponentially from 1950 to 2000 for Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn, meanwhile, a general increase of the demand is observed: the rate of recycling and/or treatment of metals within the anthroposphere has been improved ten-fold. Hg environmental trajectory is very specific: there is a marked decontamination from 1970 to 2000, but the leakage ratio remains very high (10 to 20 %) during this period.

To understand the permeable zones in the boreholes detailed descriptions and measurements of three outcrops in the Snake River <b>Plain,</b> three <b>cores</b> at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) at the INEL, and over fifty borehole TV logs from the INEL were carried out. Based on the observations made on the three outcrops an idealized basalt lava flow model was generated that used a set of nomenclature that would be standard for the basalt lava flows studied. An upper vesicular zone, a sometimes absent columnar zone, central zone, and lower vesicular zone make up the basalt lava flow model. The overall distinction between the different zones {{are based on the}} vesicle shape size, vesicularity, and fractures present. The results of the studies also indicated that the basalt lava flows at the INEL are distal to medial facies pahoehoe lava flows with close fitting contacts. The most permeable zones identified in these basalts are fractured vesiculated portions of the top of the lava flow, the columnar areas, and basalt-flow contacts in order of importance.

Bragg fibers can be classified into two groups: the air-core Bragg fiber and the coaxial Bragg fiber. Whereas the former has a <b>plain</b> air <b>core</b> at the center, the latter contains an additional high-index column in the core. Using a perturbative approach I study and compare the dispersion properties of {{the two types of}} fibers, with special attention to their potential for truly single-mode transmission. As the result a large single-mode frequency window, which also includes a zero-dispersion point, is found for the TM mode in the coaxial fiber, The air-core Bragg fiber is also studied as a potential candidate for dispersion compensation. It is found that Bragg reflections in the fiber are capable of producing negative dispersion values at least as large as - 20, 000 ps/([ [...] . ]), which is a twenty-fold improvement over previous results. The fiber parameters used for this study are somewhat unrealistic however, and further improvement is necessary before a Bragg fiber can be deployed as a Dispersion Compensating Fiber (DCF). Optical filters based on Bragg grating structures also involve Bragg reflections. While continuous Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG's) have long been studied and deployed as practical reflection filters, the possibility of etching a discrete grating in a (planar) waveguide has to my knowledge, never been investigated. In this dissertation I propose a novel scheme for designing such a grating, which is implemented by discretizing its continuous counterpart into a series of air holes.

This dissertation presents findings and recommendations from experimental and analytical investigations of the performance of SC walls subjected to far-field blast loads. ^ Twelve SC panels were tested in the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC) Blast Load Simulator (BLS). These panels varied flexure and shear reinforcement ratios, tie bar spacing, and steel faceplate strength. Results from the physical experiments were used to benchmark numerical models which were then used to expand the experimental database and perform a series of parametric studies investigating the influence of blast load, geometric, material, and analysis parameters. ^ Two benchmarked models were developed: (1) detailed finite element (FE) models using the non-linear FE code LS-DYNA, and (2) idealized single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) models using experimentally validated bilinear strain hardening static resistance functions and exponential decay or triangular load pulse forcing functions. The idealized static resistance functions were developed from static tests of eight configurations of SC walls which were also used to benchmark the FE modeling method. The results from the static experimental tests and benchmarked models are also provided in this dissertation. ^ Results from the physical experiments and analytical parametric studies were used to develop design recommendations. A rational method for designing SC walls to resist specific blast loads is presented along with pressure-impulse diagrams for use as design tools or aids. ...|$|R

Each fuel combination was tested at oxidizer flow rates, ranging from 0. 9 - 3. 3 g/s of gaseous oxygen, in a small scale hybrid test rocket and average regression rates were measured. While large uncertainties were present in the experimental setup, the overall data showed that the regression rate was enhanced as paraffin concentration increased. While further testing would be required at larger scales of interest, the trends are encouraging. Inclusion of paraffin nodules in the HTPB grain may produce a greater advantage than other more noxious additives in current use. In addition, it may lead to safer rocket motors with higher integrated thrust due to the decreased void fraction...|$|R

While the well established UC framework for concurrent security is impossible to achieve in this setting, meaningful relaxed notions of concurrent security have been achieved. The main contribution of our work is a new technique useful for designing protocols in the concurrent setting (in the <b>plain</b> model). The <b>core</b> of our technique is a new rewinding-based extraction procedure which only requires the protocol to have a constant number of rounds. We show two main applications of our technique. We obtain the first concurrently secure computation protocol in the plain model with superpolynomial simulation (SPS) security that uses only a constant number of rounds and requires only standard assumptions. In contrast, the only previously known result (Canetti et al., FOCS’ 10) achieving SPS security based on standard assumptions requires polynomial number of rounds. Our second contribution is a new definition of input indistinguishable computation (IIC) and a constant round protocols satisfying that definition. Our definition of input indistinguishable computation is a simplification and strengthening {{of the definition of}} Micali et al. (FOCS’ 06) in various directions. Most notably, our definition provides meaningful security guarantees even for randomized functionalities. Interestingly, we show that in fact the same protocol satisfies both the SPS and the IIC security notions. This is a preliminary version of our EUROCRYPT’ 12 paper...|$|R

However, natural autocompaction of deltaic sediment and other anthropogenic factors also enhance subsidence, amplifying global sea-level rise and aggravating land loss, flooding, and tidal inundation. Here, we report how we determine the longer-term subsidence rates and paleo-sealevel history of the delta <b>plain</b> using sediment <b>cores.</b> Four sediment cores 3 to 10. 7 m long taken in Bocaue and Malolos, Bulacan and Lubao, Pampanga all display shoaling-upward sequences that consist of, from bottom to top: basal shallow-marine clays comprising nearly half of each core; mangrove peat; beach sand; fluvial sand and mud; and uppermost floodplain clays. Porosities of the deltaic sediments range from 0. 3 to 0. 8. Peat has the highest porosities, from 0. 7 to 0. 8. Calculations indicate about 2 to 6 m of compaction for the whole sediment sequence. Wood fragments at 7 m and 8. 4 m depths in the shallow-marine section of the Pampanga core respectively yielded radiocarbon ages of 1800 ± 40 and 1730 ± 40 years. If around 1, 000 years ago is when the surface 10 m of sediments started compacting, they would have done so at rates of 0. 2 to 0. 6 cm/y. Natural compaction in similar environments such as in Po Delta, Italy and Mississippi Delta are comparable, ranging from 0. 09 to 0. 37 cm/y. The small values acquired in this study imply that large human-induced components may account for as much as 97 percent of the subsidence in Pampanga...|$|R

In living organism, they contain polar head groups (intact polar lipids – IPLs). IPL GDGTs have also been detected in ancient marine sediments and {{it is unclear whether}} or not they are fossil entities or are part of living cells. In order to determine the extent of degradation of IPL GDGTs over geological timescales, we analyzed turbidite deposits, which had been partly reoxidized for several kyr after deposition on the Madeira Abyssal <b>Plain.</b> Analysis of <b>core</b> lipid (CL) and IPL-derived GDGTs showed a reduction in concentration by two orders of magnitude upon post-depositional oxidation, while IPL GDGTs with a mono- or dihexose head group decreased by 2 – 3 orders of magnitude. The BIT index for CL- and IPL-derived GDGTs increased substantially upon oxidation from 0. 1 to up to 0. 5. Together with changing MBT/CBT values, this indicates preferential preservation of soil-derived branched GDGTs over marine isoprenoid GDGTs, combined with in situ production of branched GDGTs in the sediment. The TEX 86 value for IPL-derived GDGTs decreased by 0. 07 upon oxidation, while that of CL GDGTs showed no significant change. Isolation of IPLs revealed that the TEX 86 value for monohexose GDGTs was 0. 55, while the that for dihexose GDGTs was substantially higher, 0. 70. Thus, the decrease in TEX 86 for IPL-derived GDGTs was in agreement with the dominance of monohexose GDGTs in the oxidized turbidite, probably caused by a combination of in situ production as well as selective preservation of terrestrial isoprenoid GDGTs. Due to the low amount of IPL GDGTs vs. CL GDGTs, the impact of IPL degradation on CL-based TEX 86 paleotemperature estimates was negligible...|$|R
40|$|Nonpoint source {{pollution}} (NPS) {{continues to}} be the leading cause of water quality degradation in the United States. On-site wastewater systems (OWS) contribute to NPS; however, due to the range of system designs and complexity of the subsurface, OWS contributions to groundwater pollution are not well understood. As the population of coastal North Carolina continues to increase, better methods to locate and characterize wastewater impacted groundwater are needed. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of non-intrusive geophysical methods to provide high resolution information on various contaminants in different geologic settings. The goals of this study were to evaluate the utility of ground penetrating radar (GPR) and capacitively coupled resistivity (CCR) for detecting OWS components, delineating associated wastewater plumes, and monitoring temporal variations in groundwater quality. Cross-sectional and three dimensional (3 D) geophysical surveys were conducted periodically over a one year period (February 2011 - January 2012) at two schools utilizing OWS in the lower Neuse River Basin (NRB) in the North Carolina Coastal <b>Plain</b> (NCCP). <b>Cores</b> were collected at both study sites; as well as monthly groundwater depth, temperature, and specific conductivity measurements to better constrain the geophysical interpretations. Additionally, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and Cl concentrations were monitored bi-monthly to assess nutrient transport at the sites. The 3 D GPR surveys effectively located the wastewater drainage trenches at both sites, in close agreement with locations described in as-built OWS blueprints. Regression analysis of resistivity versus groundwater specific conductivity revealed an inverse relationship, suggesting resistivity [less than or equal to] 250 ohm. m was indicative of wastewater impacted groundwater at both sites. The 3 D resistivity models identified regions of low resistivity beneath the drainfields relative to background values. Regression analysis of GPR signal absolute peak amplitude (APA) versus groundwater specific conductivity revealed a decrease in APA indicative of radar signal attenuation at locations where groundwater specific conductivity was elevated. The 3 D GPR models identified regions of attenuated radar signal beneath the drainfields relative to background locations. Comparisons of groundwater specific conductivity, GPR, and CCR lateral wastewater plume estimates indicated similar dimensions at both sites. The sensitivity of resistivity measurements tended to decline with increased water-table depth; although, differences in resistivity associated with seasonal water-table depth changes were noticeable. Overall, {{results of this study suggest}} that GPR and CCR surveys combined with sediment, hydrologic, and water quality data may provide reliable information on the location of OWS components and extent of associated wastewater plumes. The GPR surveys successfully located the wastewater drainage trenches and helped image the uppermost surface of the wastewater plumes. The CCR surveys delineated the lateral wastewater plume dimensions and revealed temporal changes in groundwater quality associated with differences in groundwater recharge. M. S...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of prestressed concrete containing steel fibres as secondary reinforcement {{to improve performance}} in shear, flexure and bond is reported. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} use of steel fibres in prestresssed extruded hollow core slabs, since these common precast elements have intrinsic difficulty in incorporating traditional secondary reinforcement due to their unique shape and manufacturing method. Two separate studies were carried out. The first study involved laboratory investigations into the bond between fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) and the prestressing strand, and the shear behaviour of laboratory-cast prestressed fibre reinforced concrete (PFRC) beams. The second part involved the factory production of fibre reinforced hollow core slabs in co-operation with a local manufacturer. The fibre reinforced hollow core slabs were subjected to conventional full-width shear tests, concentrated load shear tests, and to transverse flexure. For all laboratory cast elements, cubes, cylinders and prisms were cast to investigate compressive, tensile and flexural properties, respectively. Two types of steel fibre were investigated: hooked-end steel fibres at fibre volume fractions (Vf) of 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 %; and amorphous metal fibres at Vf‘s of 0. 28 % and 0. 56 %. The trial production of fibre reinforced hollow core slabs necessitated the {{investigation of}} the effect of steel fibres on the extrusion manufacturing process. It was shown that fibre reinforced hollow core slabs could be adequately compacted with only slight increases in mixing water. Fibres were found to distribute randomly throughout the cross-section. However, the rotation of the augers affected the orientation of fibres, with fibres tending to align vertically in the web. It was shown that the addition of steel fibres to prestressed concrete has a negative effect on the bond between matrix and tendon, leading to longer transfer lengths. The effect of the increase in transfer length was to reduce cracking shear strengths by 4 %. Shear tests showed that the incorporation of steel fibres could increase shear strength by as much as 45 % for Vf = 1. 5 %. This increase in shear strength, known as the fibre contribution, was shown to be due to fibres bridging across the crack and an increased compressive resistance due to fibres arresting the propagation of cracks into the compressive zone. A semi-empirical equation for shear strength of PFRC elements is developed. It is given in two forms, one compatible with the present equations for prestressed concrete given in BS 8110 and Eurocode 2, and a second form compatible with that advocated for fibres in reinforced concrete. The equation makes use of equivalent flexural strength which is recognised as the most useful material property for design of FRC. The equation was found to give good correlation with the shear strength of single web beams cast both in the laboratory and under factory conditions. However, a overall strength reduction factor is required for full-width hollow core slabs to account for uneven load distribution and inconsistent web widths. This is consistent with tests on <b>plain</b> hollow <b>core</b> slabs found in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Wells on {{the eastern}} side of the Midland Basin near its Eastern Shelf in Glasscock County, Texas, {{penetrate}} an Upper Leonardian succession of detrital carbonate, deposited in slope and basinal environments. Hydrocarbon production from this interval in Veterans and St. Lawrence Fields is highly variable - some wells produced oil at economic rates following fracture stimulation, whereas the coeval section in other wells failed to produce oil after fracture stimulation. The depositional texture and diagenetic attributes of the Upper Leonardian detrital carbonate succession were described from slabbed <b>cores,</b> <b>plain</b> light and cathodoluminescence (CL) petrography, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, and formation micro-imager (FMI) logs. Depth-by-depth assessment of petrophysical properties were interpreted from conventional wireline logs and laboratory core plug measurements using the multimineral analysis method. Nine main lithofacies were identified on the basis of depositional texture, constituent composition (skeletal and non-skeletal grains, detrital component, and mineralogy) and diagenetic features. The upper and middle slope lithofacies are: mud-lean fusulinid-crinoid packstone and clast-supported polymict conglomerate deposited in channelized settings. The middle and lower slope deposits are: fusulinid-crinoid packstone, fusulinid wackestone, skeletal wackestone and partially silicified skeletal wackestone to mudstone. Occasional intraclasts in these deposits suggest they were deposited by debris flows. The lower slope facies is matrix-supported conglomerate deposited by debris flow at the toe-of-slope. Carbonate mudstone was deposited on the lower slope and on unchannelized parts of the slope. Shale was deposited in the basin. The Upper Leonardian detrital carbonate succession in Veterans and St. Lawrence Fields was deposited in carbonate aprons developed along relatively gentle to steep slopes (1 - 50) that were fed by small submarine canyons that by-passed fine-grained upper slope sediments. The rocks were affected most by burial diagenesis. The effects of burial diagenesis on the formation are mechanical and chemical compaction, resulting in reduced pore sizes and loss of primary interparticle porosity, reduced pore throat diameter, stylolite development, grain penetration, grain deformation, and grain fracturing. The pore system throughout the carbonate units is characterized by intraparticle pores mainly in skeletal grains and interparticle pores which are interconnected solution-enhanced pores between grains created by partial dissolution of skeletal grains. This reservoir characterization indicates that, in Veterans and St. Lawrence Fields, the failure of some wells to produce oil at economic rates could be attributed to the heterogeneities associated with the stratigraphic framework and spatial distribution of depositional facies of the Upper Leonardian detrital carbonate succession. The potential reservoir rocks developed in the channelized portion of the slope whereas non-reservoir rocks accumulated in the lower slope and on interchannel highs on the upper and middle slope...|$|R

It made use of sequence stratigraphy and turbidite facies models to predict the probable location of deepwater reservoirs in the undrilled Southern Outeniqua Basin using data from basin margin Pletmos Basin and the deepwater Southern Outeniqua Basin. Basin margin depositional packages were correlated in time and space with deepwater packages. It was an attempt at bridging the gap between process-related studies of sedimentary rocks and the more traditional economic geology f commercial deposits of petroleum using prevailing state-of-the-art in basin analysis. It enabled the most realistic reconstructions of genetic stratigraphy and offered the greatest application in exploration. Sequence stratigraphic analysis and interpretation of seismics, well logs, cores and biostratigraphic data was carried out providing a chronostratigraphic framework of the study area within which seismic facies analysis done. Nine (9) seismic lines that span the shallow/basin margin Pletmos basin into the undrilled deepwater Southern Outeniqua basin were analysed and interpreted and the relevant seismic geometries were captured. Four (4) turbidite depositional elements were identified from the seismic lines: channel, overbank deposits, haotic deposits and basin plain (basin floor fan) deposits. These were identified from the relevant seismic geometries (geometric attributes) observed on the 2 D seismic lines. Thinning attributes, unconformity attributes and seismic facies attributes were observed from the seismic lines. This was preceded by basic structural analyses and interpretation of the seismic lines. according to the structural analysis and interpretation, deposition trended NW-SE and NNW-SSE as we go deepwater into the Southern Outeniqua basin. Well logs from six (6) of the interpreted wells indicated depositional channel fill as well as basin floor fans. This was identified in well Ga-V 1 and Ga-S 1 respectively. A bell and crescent shape gamma ray log signature was observed in well Ga-V 1 indicating a fining up sequence as the channel was abandoned while an isolated massive mound-shape gamma ray log signature was observed in Ga-S 1 indicating basin <b>plain</b> well-sorted sands. <b>Core</b> analyses and interpretation from two southern-most wells revealed three (3) facies which were derived based on Walker‘s 1978, turbidite facies. The observed facies were: sandstone, sand/shale and shale facies. Sequence stratigraphic characterisation of petroleum reservoirs in block 11 b/ 12 b of the Southern Outeniqua Basin. Cores of well Ga-V 1 displayed fine-grained alternations of thin sandstone beds and shales belonging to the thin-bedded turbidite facies. This is typical of levees of the upper fan channel but could easily be confused with similar facies on the basin plain. According to Walker, 1978 such facies form under conditions of active fan progradation. Ga-S 1 cores displayed not only classic turbidite facies where there was alternating sand and shale sections but showed thick uninterrupted sections of clean sands. This is typical of basin plain deposits. Only one well had biostratigraphic data though being very limited in content. This data revealed particular depth sections and stratigraphic sections as having medium to fast depositional rates. Such rates are characteristic of turbidite deposition from turbidity currents. This study as well as a complementary study by Carvajal et al., 2009 revealed that the Southern Outeniqua basin is a sand-prone basin with many progradational sequences in which tectonics and sediment supply rate have been significant factors (amongst others such as sea level change) in the formation of these deepwater sequences. In conclusion, the Southern Outeniqua basin was hereby seen as having a viable and unexplored petroleum system existing in this sand prone untested world class. South Afric...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} structures {{designed in}} pre- 1970 s are vulnerable under earthquakes {{due to lack}} of seismic detailing to provide adequate ductility. Typical deficiencies of pre- 1970 s reinforced concrete structures are (a) use of plain bars as longitudinal reinforcement, (b) inadequate anchorage of beam longitudinal reinforcement in the column (particularly exterior column), (c) lack of joint transverse reinforcement if any, (d) lapped splices located just above joint, and (e) low concrete strength. Furthermore, the use of infill walls is a controversial issue because it can help to provide additional stiffness to the structure on the positive side and on the negative side it can increase the possibility of soft-storey mechanisms if it is distributed irregularly. Experimental research to investigate the possible seismic behaviour of pre- 1970 s reinforced concrete structures have been carried out in the past. However, there is still an absence of experimental tests on the 3 -D response of existing beam-column joints under bi-directional cyclic loading, such as corner joints. As part of the research work herein presented, a series of experimental tests on beam-column subassemblies with typical detailing of pre- 1970 s buildings has been carried out to investigate the behaviour of existing reinforced concrete structures. Six two-third scale plane frame exterior beam-column joint subassemblies were constructed and tested under quasi-static cyclic loading in the Structural Laboratory of the University of Canterbury. The reinforcement detailing and beam dimension were varied to investigate their effect on the seismic behaviour. Four specimens were conventional deep beam-column joint, with two of them using deformed longitudinal bars and beam bars bent in to the joint and the two others using plain round longitudinal bars and beam bars with end hooks. The other two specimens were shallow beam-column joint, one with deformed longitudinal bars and beam bars bent in to the joint, the other with plain round longitudinal bars and beam bars with end hooks. All units had one transverse reinforcement in the joint. The results of the experimental tests indicated that conventional exterior beam-column joint with typical detailing of pre- 1970 s building would experience serious diagonal tension cracking in the joint panel under earthquake. The use of plain round bars with end hooks for beam longitudinal reinforcement results in more severe damage in the joint core when compared to the use of deformed bars for beam longitudinal reinforcement bent in to the joint, due to the combination of bar slips and concrete crushing. One interesting outcome is that the use of shallow beam in the exterior beam-column joint could avoid the joint cracking due to the beam size although the strength provided lower when compared with the use of deep beam with equal moment capacity. Therefore, taking into account the low strength and stiffness, shallow beam can be reintroduced as an alternative solution in design process. In addition, the presence of single transverse reinforcement in the joint core can provide additional confinement after the first crack occurred, thus delaying the strength degradation of the structure. Three two-third scale space frame corner beam-column joint subassemblies were also constructed to investigate the biaxial loading effect. Two specimens were deep-deep beam-corner column joint specimens and the other one was deep-shallow beam-corner column joint specimen. One deep-deep beam-corner column joint specimen was not using any transverse reinforcement in the joint core while the two other specimens were using one transverse reinforcement in the joint <b>core.</b> <b>Plain</b> round longitudinal bars were used for all units with hook anchorage for the beam bars. Results from the tests confirmed the evidences from earthquake damage observations with the exterior 3 -D (corner) beam-column joint subjected to biaxial loading would have less strength and suffer higher damage in the joint area under earthquake. Furthermore, the joint shear relation in the two directions is calibrated from the results to provide better analysis. An analytical model was used to simulate the seismic behaviour of the joints with the help of Ruaumoko software. Alternative strength degradation curves corresponding to different reinforcement detailing of beam-column joint unit were proposed based on the test results...|$|R
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{study was}} carried out on the Late Quaternary-Holocene subsurface deposits of two Mediterranean coastal areas: Arno coastal plain (Northern Tyrrhenian Sea) and Modern Po Delta (Northern Adriatic Sea). Detailed facies analyses, including sedimentological and micropalaeontological (benthic foraminifers and ostracods) investigations, were performed on nine continuously-cored boreholes of variable depth (ca. from 30 meters to 100 meters). Six cores were located in the Arno coastal <b>plain</b> and three <b>cores</b> in the Modern Po Delta. To provide an accurate chronological framework, twenty-four organic-rich samples were collected along the fossil successions for radiocarbon dating (AMS 14 C). In order to reconstruct the depositional and palaeoenvironmental evolution of the study areas, core data were combined with selected well logs, provided by local companies, along several stratigraphic sections. These sections revealed {{the presence of a}} transgressive-regressive (T-R) sequence, composing of continental, coastal and shallow-marine deposits dated to the Late Pleistocene-Holocene period, beneath the Arno coastal plain and the Modern Po Delta. Above the alluvial deposits attributed to the last glacial period, the post-glacial transgressive succession (TST) consists of back-barrier, transgressive barrier and inner shelf deposits. Peak of transgression (MFS) took place around the Late-Middle Holocene transition and was identified by subtle micropalaeontological indicators within undifferentiated fine-grained deposits. Upward a thick prograding succession (HST) records the turnaround to regressive conditions that led to a rapid delta progradation in both study areas. Particularly, the outbuilding of modern-age Po Delta coincides with mud-belt formation during the late HST (ca. 600 cal yr BP), as evidenced by a fossil microfauna similar to the foraminiferal assemblage observed in the present Northern Adriatic mud-belt. A complex interaction between allocyclic and autocyclic factors controlled facies evolution during the highstand period. The presence of local parameters and the absence of a predominant factor prevent from discerning or quantifying consequences of the complex relationships between climate and deltaic evolution. On the contrary transgressive sedimentation seems to be mainly controlled by two allocyclic key factors, sea-level rise and climate variability, that minimized the effects of local parameters on coastal palaeoenvironments. TST depositional architecture recorded in both study areas reflects a well-known millennial-scale variability of sea-level rising trend and climate during the Late glacial-Holocene period. Repeated phases of backswamp development and infilling by crevasse processes (parasequences) were recorded in the subsurface of Modern Po Delta during the early stages of transgression (ca. 11, 000 - 9, 500 cal yr BP). In the Arno coastal plain the presence of a deep-incised valley system, probably formed at OSI 3 / 2 transition, {{led to the development of}} a thick (ca. 35 - 40 m) transgressive succession composed of coastal plain, bay-head delta and estuarine deposits dated to the Last glacial-Early Holocene period. Within the transgressive valley fill sequence, high-resolution facies analyses allowed the identification and lateral tracing of three parasequences of millennial duration. The parasequences, ca. 8 - 12 meters thick, are bounded by flooding surfaces and show a typical internal shallowing-upward trend evidenced by subtle micropalaeontological investigations. The vertical stacking pattern of parasequences shows a close affinity with the step-like sea-level rising trend occurred between 14, 000 - 8, 000 cal years BP. Episodes of rapid sea-level rise and subsequent stillstand phases were paralleled by changes in climatic conditions, as suggested by pollen analyses performed on a core drilled in the proximal section of the Arno palaeovalley (pollen analyses performed by Dr. Marianna Ricci Lucchi). Rapid shifts to warmer climate conditions accompanied episodes of rapid sea-level rise, in contrast stillstand phases occurred during temporary colder climate conditions. For the first time the palaeoclimatic signature of high frequency depositional cycles is clearly documented. Moreover, two of the three "regressive" pulsations, recorded at the top of parasequences by episodes of partial estuary infilling in the proximal and central portions of Arno palaeovalley, may be correlated with the most important cold events of the post-glacial period: Younger Dryas and 8, 200 cal yr BP event. The stratigraphic and palaeoclimatic data of Arno coastal plain and Po Delta were compared with those reported for the most important deltaic and coastal systems in the worldwide literature. The depositional architecture of transgressive successions reflects the strong influence of millennial-scale eustatic and climatic variability on worldwide coastal sedimentation during the Late glacial-Holocene period (ca. 14, 000 - 7, 000 cal yr BP). The most complete and accurate record of high-frequency eustatic and climatic events are usually found within the transgressive succession of very high accommodation settings, such as incised-valley systems where exceptionally thick packages of Late glacial-Early Holocene deposits are preserved. ...|$|R
