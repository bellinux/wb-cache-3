However, many politicians in Kogane Town were vehemently opposed to the merger, and forced its dissolution on October 15, 1954 with most of former Kogane Town merging with Matsudo city instead. On November 1, 1954, Fuse Village broke away from Tokatsu, eventually joining Abiko Town {{to form the}} city of Abiko. The remaining portion of Tokatsu was renamed Kashiwa on November 15, 1954. On December 25, 1955 a fire of unknown origin destroyed the former Kashiwa City Hall, and burned down most {{of the center of}} the city.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the effectiveness of the Electrochemical Chloride Extraction (ECE) technique on a bridge deck with very high concentrations of chloride. This ECE technique was used during the summer of 2003 to reverse the effects of corrosion, which had occurred in the reinforcing steel embedded in the <b>pedestrian</b> bridge <b>deck</b> over Highway 6, along Iowa Avenue, in Iowa City, Iowa, USA. First, the half cell potential was measured to determine the existing corrosion level in the field. The half-cell potential values were in the indecisive range of corrosion (between - 200 mV and - 350 mV). The ECE technique was then applied to remove the chloride from the bridge deck. The chloride content in the deck was significantly reduced from 25 lb/cy to 4. 96 lb/cy in 8 weeks. Concrete cores obtained from the deck were measured for their compressive strengths and there was no reduction in strength due to the ECE technique. Laboratory tests were also performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ECE process. In order to simulate the corrosion in the bridge deck, two reinforced slabs and 12 reinforced beams were prepared. First, the half-cell potentials were measured from the test specimens and they all ranged below - 200 mV. Upon introduction of 3...|$|R
40|$|Natural flax {{fabric-reinforced}} polymer (FFRP) tube encased coir fibre-reinforced concrete (CFRC) structure (termed as FFRP-CFRC) is steel-free hybrid {{structure that}} has shown its potential as axial, flexural and earthquake-resistant structural members. An FFRP {{plate with a}} CFRC overlay has great potential to be light and environmentally friendly wall panelor <b>pedestrian</b> bridge <b>deck.</b> The overall structural performance of this panel or deck is highly dependent on the bond at the FFRP and CFRC interface. Therefore, this study proposed a novel interlocking at their interface to improve the bond and thus the composite action of the hybrid structures composed of FFRP and CFRC components. This interlocking was generated by creating numbers of perforations on the FFRP component (tube and plate) surface. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} using this interlocking on the bond behaviour between FFRP and CFRC, two stages experimental studies were conducted. In the first stage, 18 FFRP-CFRC cylindrical specimens were constructed and tested under push-out bond, bending and axial compression. In the second stage, 30 FFRP plate and CFRC sandwich block specimens were constructed and tested under push-out bond considering different experimental parameters, i. e. depth, diameter and number of perforations. Additionally, numerical simulation was performed to verify the failure modes of FFRP plate and CFRC sandwich blocks under push-out. This study revealed that the presence of interlocking is an effective way to improve the interfacial bond and composite action between FFRP (either tube or plate) and CFRC components...|$|R
50|$|On 30 June 2014 {{the vehicle}} bridge {{was closed for}} {{extensive}} maintenance projected to take around 12 months. A small closing ceremony saw the last vehicle to cross - a horse and cart - {{as a reminder of}} the first vehicle to cross when it was originally opened. During May and June 2014, access trackways were built to the underside of both ends of the bridges, and extensive steel scaffolding installed below and to both sides of the bridge structure. The scaffolds even incorporated wooden boarded cutwaters to protect the scaffold if the river should flood. Lattice long span 'unit beams' were fitted to all spans except the North and South. Concrete pads were cast below the bridge end spans adjacent to the approach roads so that the spans could be jacked up. Presumably this was to access or modify the area where the steel bridge rests on the stone abutment. The bridge deck including cross beams were due to be completely replaced. The footbridge was also due to be closed and have new <b>decking.</b> <b>Pedestrians</b> were redirected to use the main bridge whilst this was underway.|$|R
50|$|To {{mark the}} end of its site {{redevelopment}} project outside Yokohama Station, on December 16, 2009, the company completed its construction of Yokohama Dia Building, which was among the largest buildings in the area and had a unique appearance of uniform design and glass curtain walls. Yokohama Dia Building is 31 stories high, 2 stories deep and has a 2-story-high penthouse. It measures 157.7 meters in height (which is the third tallest after Landmark Tower and Queens Tower (A) in Yokohama) and has an area size of 69,977 square meters. The 3rd to 6th floors are for commercial uses and are connected to Yokohama Bay Quarter on each floor, while the 7th to 30th floors are designated rental office space. The architecture was a long-awaited, large-scale office building in Yokohama where development of large office buildings remained rather inactive since the 1990s. It was also an office building of high quality that could compete with those constructed one after another in Tokyo during the 2000s. The building is connected directly to Yokohama Station via a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>deck</b> (Bay Quarter Walkway) that was concurrently constructed and allows people to access the station without getting rained on.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of distributed optical fiber strain sensors to civil engineering structures, because no other tool can satisfactorily detect {{the location of the}} unpredictable phenomenon. In fact, the locations of cracks in the concrete structure are unknown a priori; therefore, a fully distributed sensor is necessary to detect them. The Brillouin optical correlation domain analysis (BOCDA), which offers high spatial resolution by using stimulated Brillouin scattering along the whole length of the optical fiber, is used {{in a wide range of}} civil engineering applications, and the same has undergone significant development over the last decade. In this paper, it is demonstrated how a BOCDA-based strain sensor can be employed to monitor cracks in concrete. Crack monitoring on the surface of the concrete member provides useful information for evaluating stiffness and durability of the structure, particularly for early detection of tiny cracks, which is essential for preventing crack growth and dispersion. The crack-induced strain distribution was analytically investigated, and it was proved that BOCDA can identify even a small crack before its visual recognition by a beam test. Moreover, periodical crack monitoring was successfully executed on a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>deck</b> for five years.|$|E
40|$|The Ponte delle Torri {{is a large}} {{historical}} {{construction that}} connects Colle Sant’Elia with Mount Monteluco in Spoleto, Italy. It was probably built in the XIII century, possibly on Etruscan or Roman ruins. The bridge superstructure {{is made up of}} a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>deck,</b> provided with a water canal on one side, supported by lancet arcades and stone piers known as "towers". As testified by recent documentation and on-site inspections, the bridge’s state of damage is rather widespread and extended, urging local and national institutions to start suitable structural monitoring activities, which were included within the RoMA (Resilience enhancement of a Metropolitan Area) project. The project comprises many monitoring techniques (high-resolution photogrammetry, 3 D laser scanning, FBG monitoring, satellite InSAR, etc.) to assess the bridge cracks pattern and its structural health by a multidisciplinary approach that permits mutual validation. In particular, the present paper describes the numerical and operational modal analyses performed {{for the study of the}} structure and the methodology for the validation of the implemented Finite Element Models (FEMs). As a first step for the study of the bridge, the modal analysis of a preliminary FEM was executed in order to have an idea of the dynamic behavior of the structure and to guide the design of the on-site sensors positions. In such positions ambient noise was measured with velocimeters. Then, more refined FEMs were constructed and validated. In particular, mono-, bie tri-dimensional FEMs were generated through different numerical techniques and their resulting modal analyses were compared with the results of Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) techniques applied to the recorded velocimeters data...|$|E

The plan establishes a shared vision for future development that features new open spaces; transportation and <b>pedestrian</b> safety; parking <b>decks</b> built {{on the edge of}} campus; new bike-ways; new circulation systems including pathways with striking views of the Pioneer Valley; improvements to utilities; and a strategy for reuse of historic buildings. The administration held more than 90 events in the past year with key stakeholders, including students, faculty, staff, host communities and regional representatives and that was complemented by web-based surveys and applications to encourage participation. To meet the university’s current academic and research mission, the plan locates more than 1 million gross square feet of facilities. In an effort to position the university for an unknown future, the plan also illustrates approximately 7 million additional gross square feet, creating a compact, environmentally sensitive and efficient campus. The plan adopts an approach that mixes traditional land uses around a core of facilities adjacent to the campus lawns and pond. This new pattern will encourage a creative environment that will support collaboration, co-curricular learning and research, and will help create a vibrant environment all day and throughout the year.

40|$|Owing to the {{construction}} of the new dam on the river Ain. the water of the river level has risen considerably above the earlier level of flow at the suspension bridge in the neighbourhood of Serrieres sur Ain. Hence it became necessary to substitute this structure by a more modern one, suitable to present day traffic demands. This paper summarises the main features of this new bridge. The new bridge spans the river by means of a reinforced concrete arch of 120 m span. The arch is circular, and the deck rests on a palissade supported by the arch. The maximum rise is 30 ms at the crown. The deck carries a roadway 7 ms wide and two sidewalks of 1 m width each, for <b>pedestrians.</b> The <b>deck</b> is supported by by four longitudinal beams, and the arch has a box section and 4 longitudinal stiffners. In the crown zone the stiffners, the deck and the cylindrical surfaces become integrated and enclose three hollow chambers. This structure has great stiffness. The depth of the arch is constant, except at the crown, and is 2. 40 ms. This depth gives the arch a pleasing and slender aspect. The palissade consist of four rows of columns, of 0. 80 x 0. 20 ms section, at intervals of 12. 50 ms. The radius of the arch is 78. 80 ms, and its transversal box section has a total width of 8. 60 ms. The thickness of the inner cylindrical surface is 0. 20 ms. The springers consist of two large reinforced concrete blocks, of approximately 10 ms length and 4. 70 ms height. The construction of the bridge was done {{with the aid of a}} Blondin cable, of 5 tns capacity, spanning 290 ms. The main constructional aid was a. wooden scaffolding, cantilevered from the sides, consisting of 10 trusses. The timber elements were nailed and bolted together. The top part of the framework supports a formwork, made with a double layer of boards, 27 mm in thickness, crossing each other at 45 °. The scaffolding was erected in successive phases and a number of guy cables were employed to stabilise the structure against the deforming effect of the wind. Como consecuencia de la construcción del nuevo embalse sobre el río Ain, las aguas de éste se han elevado considerablemente sobre los niveles asignados a la cota media de desagüe del puente suspendido existente en las inmediaciones de Serrières-sur-Ain. Por ello, se ha tenido que pensar en la sustitución de esta obra por otra moderna y de capacidad suficiente para las exigencias del tráfico actual. En este artículo se reseñan los datos más importantes de esta obra, entre los que, resumiendo, diremos que el nuevo puente salva el río con un arco de hormigón armado, de 120 m de luz, de intradós circular, tablero apoyado sobre una palizada levantada a partir del extradós del arco y con una flecha máxima de 30 m en la clave del arco.

These 10 realization factors show a coincidence and an inevitability of development that came from social, economic, political and spatial aspects. The architectural ideas which were connected with international trends of modern architectures and inspirations from an architect were partly realized by private capital and the Military government. The first plan of the Sewoon complex included modern idealism to change radically old inner area and transform Seoul to a modern city, but it have been functioning reversely to protect inner city from the huge development pressure.
