Various simplified full adders with different numbers of transistors are tested using Pspice simulation. Comparison of these full adders is based on the maximum allowable offset voltages of each node in the full adder configuration. The simplest architecture with a driving output inverter only requires 14 transistors instead of the original 22, as proposed by Zhuang and Wu. Since the simplest architecture is conditional, minimizing the threshold voltage of <b>pass</b> <b>transistors</b> and a design that is more robust are desired in order to increase the fabrication yield. A 16 -transistor full adder is optimized for the trade-off between area and reliability.

50|$|A linear {{regulator}} provides the desired output voltage by dissipating excess power in ohmic losses (e.g., in a resistor {{or in the}} collector-emitter region of a <b>pass</b> <b>transistor</b> in its active mode).

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} (switching-mode power supply, switch-mode power supply, switched power supply, SMPS, or switcher) is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, such as a personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear power supply, the <b>pass</b> <b>transistor</b> of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a {{switched-mode power supply}} dissipates no power. Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the <b>pass</b> <b>transistor.</b> This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode power supply. Switched-mode power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|E
