5|$|The {{source of}} the long {{secondary}} periods is unknown, but they certainly aren't due to radial <b>pulsations.</b> Interferometric observations of Betelgeuse have shown hotspots that {{are thought to be}} created by massive convection cells, a significant fraction of the diameter of the star and each emitting 5–10% of the total light of the star. One theory to explain long secondary periods is that they are caused by the evolution of such cells combined with the rotation of the star.

5|$|Many main {{sequence}} stars of spectral type A {{fall into a}} region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram called the instability strip, which is occupied by pulsating variable stars. In 2003, photometric monitoring of the star revealed variations in brightness of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are <b>pulsations</b> at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 minutes.

40|$|Bubble <b>pulsation</b> {{is known}} to occur {{as a result of}} {{high-voltage}} discharge in water. Due to advantages such as long duration and significant bubble <b>pulsation</b> production, this technique is widely used in industrial production. Bubble <b>pulsation</b> is directly reflected by the <b>pulsation</b> efficiency, which is mainly embodied in the transformation efficiency from the high-voltage discharge energy to the bubble expansion energy, as well as the residual rate of bubble <b>pulsation</b> energy. In this study, high-voltage discharge was used in water to form pulsating bubbles. The vertical displacement of water was restricted by the experimental equipment, so horizontal displacement was mainly generated. Therefore, any influence caused by the ascending motion of the bubbles could be effectively ignored. Consequently, the bubble <b>pulsation</b> process could be measured at stable hydraulic pressure. The pressure, bubble <b>pulsation</b> period and <b>pulsation</b> times generated by bubble expansion were measured in our experiments. The transient voltage and current were also measured. The relationship between bubble <b>pulsation</b> efficiency with discharge voltage and hydrostatic pressure was analyzed by combining the experimental results with results from simulations of bubble <b>pulsation</b> expansion...|$|R

5|$|The <b>pulsations</b> {{result from}} a process called the κ-mechanism. A part of the star's outer {{atmosphere}} becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of certain elements. When these atoms lose an electron, the likelihood that they will absorb energy increases. This results {{in an increase in}} temperature that causes the atmosphere to expand. The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and loses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity.|$|E

Here, we re-examine the observed PL sequences in the Large Magellanic Cloud, including the sequence of long secondary periods (LSPs), and their associated <b>pulsation</b> modes. Firstly, we theoretically model the sequences using linear, radial, non-adiabatic <b>pulsation</b> models and a population synthesis model of the LMC red giants. Then, we use a semi-empirical approach to assign modes to the <b>pulsation</b> sequences by exploiting observed multi-mode pulsators.

The masses of these fundamental mode pulsators are larger at a given luminosity than the mass of the first overtone pulsators. These two sequences B and C^' are separated by a small period interval in which large amplitude <b>pulsation</b> in a long secondary period (sequence D variability) occurs, meaning that the first overtone <b>pulsation</b> is not seen as the primary mode of <b>pulsation.</b> Observationally, this leads to the splitting of the first overtone <b>pulsation</b> sequence into the two observed sequences B and C^'.

40|$|TutorialAlthough wet (oil injected) and dry (oil free) screw {{compressors}} {{are widely used}} in many applications, limited information is available regarding the <b>pulsation,</b> vibration, and noise problems associated with these types of compressors. This tutorial discusses such problems and includes case histories where field testing was performed, and provides design recommendations. Both wet and dry {{screw compressors}} normally generate <b>pulsation</b> at the pocket passing frequency (PPF) and its multiples. The <b>pulsation</b> amplitudes are affected by many variables such as mole weight of the gas, operating pressures, speed, screw profile, {{and shape of the}} discharge port. The <b>pulsation</b> amplitudes are further amplified by acoustical natural frequencies of the compressor/silencer/piping system. Dry screw compressors are generally supplied with suction and discharge silencers which are designed to attenuate the <b>pulsation</b> generated by the compressors. Most of the silencers are reactive type (Helmholtz filters), absorptive type, or a combination of these two. Although the silencers are designed to attenuate <b>pulsation</b> at certain frequencies, they can also amplify <b>pulsation</b> when the excitation frequencies are coincident with the acoustical natural frequencies of the silencer itself. <b>Pulsation</b> in the silencers can also increase the vibration levels of the compressor rotors and can cause electrical problems to be fed into the local bus. Therefore, the silencers should be carefully designed to attenuate the <b>pulsation</b> levels over a wide frequency band. Wet screw compressors typically do not have silencers, since oil separators are used. The oil separators are primarily designed to remove the oil from the gas, but the separators can also attenuate and/or amplify the <b>pulsation</b> generated by the compressor. The shell wall mechanical natural frequencies can also be excited by <b>pulsation</b> at multiples of the PPF, which can result in excessive noise levels and fatigue failures of the shell wall, attached small bore piping, instrumentation, and the oil injection lines...|$|R
5|$|Early {{calculations}} {{suggested that}} there might be white dwarfs whose luminosity varied with a period of around 10 seconds, but searches in the 1960s failed to observe this., § 7.1.1; The first variable white dwarf found was HL Tau 76; in 1965 and 1966, and was observed to vary with a period of approximately 12.5 minutes. The reason for this period being longer than predicted is that the variability of HL Tau 76, like that of the other pulsating variable white dwarfs known, arises from non-radial gravity wave <b>pulsations.,</b> § 7. Known types of pulsating white dwarf include the DAV, or ZZ Ceti, stars, including HL Tau 76, with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DA;, pp.891, 895 DBV, or V777 Her, stars, with helium-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DB;, p.3525 and GW Vir stars (sometimes subdivided into DOV and PNNV stars), with atmospheres dominated by helium, carbon, and oxygen. GW Vir stars are not, strictly speaking, white dwarfs, but are stars which are in a position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram between the asymptotic giant branch and the white dwarf region. They may be called pre-white dwarfs. These variables all exhibit small (1%–30%) variations in light output, arising from a superposition of vibrational modes with periods of hundreds to thousands of seconds. Observation of these variations gives asteroseismological evidence about the interiors of white dwarfs.|$|E
