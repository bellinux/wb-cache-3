High ionic concentrations in tailing impoundments suggest that tailings-pond recharge may {{be a source of}} the contamination. Experiments indicated that sulfate is not significantly produced by inorganic sulfide oxidation in the tailings <b>ponds.</b> <b>Tailings</b> pond water chemistries were compared with historical water quality analyses in the Pima district. The U. S. G. S. computer program PHREEQE modeled saturation indices for anhydrite, calcite, fluorite, and gypsum in water chemistries throughout the study area. Well water downgradient of the mines had lower saturation indices than tailings pond water which discredits the claim that tailings-pond recharge is acquiring salts as it percolates to the aquifer. Evidence supports the opinion that tailings pond seepage is contributing to the sulfate and TDS content in ground water downgradient of the ponds...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSites of monomethylmercury (MMHg) {{production}} in Amazonian regions {{have been identified}} in hydraulic reservoirs, lake sediments and wetlands, but <b>tailings</b> <b>ponds</b> have not yet received sufficient attention for this purpose. This work evidenced high MMHg production within the water column and the interstitial water of two <b>tailings</b> <b>ponds</b> of French Guiana Au mines located; (i) in a small scale exploitation (Combat) where Hg was used for Au amalgamation, and (ii) in an industrial on-going Au mine (Yaoni) processing without Hg. The (MMHg) D maximum (2. 5 ng L− 1) occurred in the oxic water column above the sediment-water interface (SWI) of the most recent <b>tailings</b> <b>pond</b> (Combat), where the substrate was fresh, the redox transition was sharp and the pool of total Hg was large. In the Yaoni pond, the (MMHg) D maximum concentration (1. 4 ng L− 1) was located at the SWI where suboxic conditions prevailed. Using the (MMHg) D concentration as a proxy for Hg methylation rates, the present results show that Hg methylation may occur in various redox conditions in <b>tailings</b> <b>ponds,</b> and are favored in areas where the organic matter regeneration is more active. A 3 -month long laboratory experiment was performed in oxic and anoxic boxes filled with high turbidity waters from the Combat Au mine to simulate <b>tailings</b> <b>ponds.</b> Slaked lime was added in an experimental set (2 mg L− 1) and appeared to be very efficient for the reduction of suspended particulate matter (SPM) to environmentally acceptable concentrations.
