In 2009, net total electrical power production in Croatia reached 12,725GWh and Croatia imported 28.5% of its electric power energy needs. The bulk of Croatian imports are supplied by the Krško Nuclear Power Plant, 50% owned by Hrvatska elektroprivreda, providing 15% of Croatia's electricity.|$|E

The company attributed this loss {{to the expansion of}} rooftop solar generation which reducing the price of electricity during the day; on some days the price (usually AUD$40–50/MWh) was almost zero. The Australian Government and Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecast the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> by rooftop solar to rise sixfold between 2014 and 2024.|$|E
25|$|Conventional hydroelectricity, biomass and {{geothermal}} {{are completely}} dispatchable as {{each has a}} store of potential energy; wind and solar production are typically without storage and can be decreased, but not dispatched, other than when nature provides. Between wind and solar, solar has a more variable daily cycle than wind, but is more predictable in daylight hours than wind. Like solar, tidal energy varies between on and off cycles through each day, unlike solar there is no intermittentcy, tides are available every day without fail. Biofuel and biomass involve multiple steps in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> – growing plants, harvesting, processing, transportation, storage and burning to create heat for electricity, transportation or space heating. In the combined power plant used by the University of Kassel to simulate using 100% renewable energy, wind farms and solar farms were supplemented as needed by hydrostorage and biomass to follow the electricity demand.|$|E

Dick Ahlstrom, writing in the Irish Times, concluded from this that Steorn's technology did not work. Steorn responded by saying that because of difficulties in implementing the technology {{the focus of the}} process had been on providing the jury with test data on magnetic effects for study. Steorn also said that these difficulties had been resolved and disputed its jury's findings.|$|E

500|$|Not until 1904 was a {{documented}} solution offered. Ernest Rutherford {{suggested that}} the Sun's output could be maintained by an internal source of heat, and suggested radioactive decay as the source. However, it would be Albert Einstein who would provide the essential clue {{to the source of}} the Sun's energy output with his mass-energy equivalence relation [...] In 1920, Sir Arthur Eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures {{at the core of the}} Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen (protons) into helium nuclei, resulting in a <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> from the net change in mass. The preponderance of hydrogen in the Sun was confirmed in 1925 by Cecilia Payne using the ionization theory developed by Meghnad Saha, an Indian physicist. The theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe. Hans Bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the Sun. In 1957, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, William Fowler and Fred Hoyle showed that most of the elements in the universe have been synthesized by nuclear reactions inside stars, some like the Sun.|$|E

2500|$|GluDHs are {{ubiquitous}} {{enzymes that}} occupy an important branch-point between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Both {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD) EC 1.4.1.2] and {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADP) dependent GluDH [...] enzymes are present in Plasmodia; the NAD-dependent GluDH is relatively unstable and not useful for diagnostic purposes. Glutamate dehydrogenase provides an oxidizable carbon source used for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> as well as a reduced electron carrier, NADH. Glutamate is a principal amino donor to other amino acids in subsequent transamination reactions. The multiple roles of glutamate in nitrogen balance make it a gateway between free ammonia and the amino groups of most amino acids. Its crystal structure is published. The GluDH activity in P.vivax, P.ovale and P. malariae has never been tested, but given the importance of GluDH as a branch point enzyme, every cell must have a high concentration of GluDH. It is well known that enzymes with a high molecular weight (like GluDH) have many isozymes, which allows strain differentiations (given the right monoclonal antibody). The host produces antibodies against the parasitic enzyme indicating a low sequence identity.|$|E
2500|$|The Natural Stone Council (NSC) has {{commissioned}} some life-cycle inventory {{data for}} use in life cycle assessments.
