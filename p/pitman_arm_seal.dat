40|$|In this study, 2 DOF {{mathematical}} {{models of}} <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering system are derived using Newton’s law of motion and modeled in MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The developed steering model is included with a DC motor model which is directly {{attached to the}} steering column. The <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering model is then validated with actual <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering test rig using various lateral inputs such as double lane change, step steer, and slalom test. Meanwhile, a position tracking control method {{has been used in}} order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the validated model to be implemented in active safety system of a heavy vehicle. The similar method has been used to test the actual <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering mechanism using hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) technique. Additional friction compensation is added in the HILS technique in order to minimize the frictional effects that occur in the mechanical configuration of the DC motor and <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering. The performance of the electronically actuated <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering system can be used to develop a firing-on-the-move actuator (FOMA) for an armored vehicle. The FOMA can be used as an active safety system to reject unwanted yaw motion due to the firing force...|$|R

5000|$|The 'modern' sawmill {{was invented}} or perfected by the Dutchman Cornelis Corneliszoon (1550-1607) who applied a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> onto a wind mill, which {{converted}} a turning motion into an up-an-down sawing motion. Cornelis {{took out a}} patent on his sawmill on December 15, 1593, and on the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> device on December 6, 1597. Early sawmills adapted the [...] to mechanical power, generally driven by a water wheel. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> or rod. A pitman {{is similar to a}} crankshaft, but in reverse (a crankshaft converts back-and-forth motion to circular motion).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{main purpose}} of the paper is using multi-functional sensors to detect the vehicle {{attitude}} (the tilt angle of vehicle), and many other vehicle information. Combining all the information, the adaptive front-lighting system can achieve the real-time control of the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and yaw angle for automobile headlight system. The feasible control methodology could highly enhance the safety of driving and electronic additional value in automobile industry. In the paper, various conditions of HID (High Intensive Discharge) headlight system could be controlled, such as the control of <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and yaw angle, are widely discussed. In the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> angle control, we use G-sensor to detect the unbalanced vehicle caused by load, rugged road, uphill and downhill. Finally, combining the velocity obtained from the ECM (Engine Control Module), the leveling motor control for headlight <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> angle real time and adjust will be realized. On the other hand, we use the potentiometer and micro switch to sense the direction and quantity of steering wheel angle, the swivel motor control for headlight yaw angle real-time adjustment is completed...|$|R

50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four tie rods, one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between the tie rods), an idler arm on the passenger side, and a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> on the driver side. The <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and <b>pitman</b> shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side. The inner tie rods are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the steering arms and outer tie rods. All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|R
50|$|The {{recirculating}} ball steering mechanism contains {{a worm gear}} inside a block with a threaded hole in it; this block has gear teeth cut into the outside to engage the sector shaft (also called a sector gear) which moves the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm.</b> The steering wheel connects to a shaft, which rotates the worm gear inside of the block. Instead of twisting further into the block, the worm gear is fixed so that when it spins, it moves the block, which transmits the motion through the gear to the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm,</b> causing the roadwheels to turn.|$|R

50|$|The {{idler arm}} {{supports}} {{the end of}} the center link on the passenger's side of the vehicle. The idler arm bolts to the vehicle's frame or subframe. Generally, an idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and the vehicle's frame to hold the center link at the proper height. Idler arms are generally more vulnerable to wear than <b>Pitman</b> <b>arms</b> because of the pivot function built into them. If the idler arm is fitted with grease fittings, these should be lubricated with a grease gun at each oil change.|$|R

50|$|Typically, {{one end of}} {{the drag}} link is {{connected}} via the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and steering gearbox to the steering wheel (providing the connection between the driver and the steering system); the other end is attached to the steering linkage, by the steering arm.|$|R
50|$|Early sawmills simply {{adapted the}} whipsaw to {{mechanical}} power, generally {{driven by a}} water wheel {{to speed up the}} process. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by a connecting rod known as a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> (thus introducing a term used in many mechanical applications).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> is a {{steering}} {{component in}} an automobile or truck. As a linkage attached to the steering box (see recirculating ball) sector shaft, it converts the angular motion of the sector shaft into the linear motion needed to steer the wheels. The arm {{is supported by the}} sector shaft and supports the drag link or center link with a ball joint. It transmits the motion it receives from the steering box into the drag (or center) link, causing it to move left or right to turn the wheels in the appropriate direction. The idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> and the vehicle's frame to hold the center or drag link at the proper height. A worn ball joint can cause play in the steering, and may get worse over time.|$|R

5000|$|The term is {{commonly}} used in automotive technology for the link in steering linkage that converts rotation of a <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> to a steering arm and eventually to tie rod links which pivot the wheels to be steered.

50|$|Other {{systems for}} {{steering}} exist, but are uncommon on road vehicles. Children's toys and go-karts often use a very direct linkage {{in the form}} of a bellcrank (also commonly known as a <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm)</b> attached directly between the steering column and the steering arms, and the use of cable-operated steering linkages (e.g. the capstan and bowstring mechanism) is also found on some home-built vehicles such as soapbox cars and recumbent tricycles.|$|R
50|$|Most punch presses {{today are}} {{hydraulically}} powered. Older machines, however, have mechanically driven rams, meaning {{the power to}} the ram is provided by a heavy, constantly rotating flywheel. The flywheel drives the ram using a <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm.</b> In the 19th century, the flywheels were powered by leather drive belts attached to line shafting, which in turn ran to a steam plant. In the modern workplace, the flywheel is powered by an electric motor.|$|R

50|$|Sicamous was a steam-driven sternwheeler, {{consuming}} {{an average}} of fifteen to seventeen tons of coal each day, depending upon weather conditions {{and the number of}} stops made along the lake. Today Sicamous remains the largest steam-powered, steel-hulled sternwheeler in Canada.Twenty-three feet long and made of Carnegie flange steel, the boiler was designed to burn 1720 kilograms of coal each hour. It was important to maintain a large and very hot fire burning within the boiler. Surrounding the fire was a steel chamber containing water pulled from the lake as well as 320 hollow pipes. These pipes would heat rapidly, quickly turning the water to steam. Pressure would build and the temperature would rise. The steam pressure was constantly monitored and maintained at 160 psi by a fireman or an engineer who was responsible for manually releasing steam as needed. This steam would travel from the boiler to the engines via the bulkhead, a large pipe attached to the ceiling of the bilge. Sicamous had two engines, each with a low- and high-pressure cylinder. Steam would travel from cylinder to cylinder, moving pistons which were attached to the ships <b>pitman</b> <b>arms.</b> These <b>pitman</b> <b>arms</b> were connected to the wooden stern wheel and moved completely out of phase with one another, distributing power equally to both sides of the stern wheel.|$|R
50|$|After the sawmill's {{abandonment}} in 1839, {{the original}} sawmill complex buildings rotted and disappeared. However, timbers {{cut by the}} original mill survived in buildings on Mackinac Island (Mission Church and Mission House, built in the 1820s and still there today). Saw marks on these timbers {{could be used to}} reconstruct the mill machinery so as to closely resemble the original. The marks gave restoration experts information on the rake of the saw's teeth and the saw's operating speed. The wood is fed into the blade at 1/3 of an inch per stroke, and the infeed motion is powered by the <b>pitman</b> <b>arm</b> that powers the saw's vertical movement.|$|R

Despite the familiar engine, few Clipper parts were interchangeable with other models. The chassis was entirely new: a double-drop frame allowed a lower floor without reducing road clearance. The engine was mounted well forward and the rear shocks were angled to assist the traditional Packard fifth shock in controlling side-sway. The front suspension was entirely new, since the lower frame eliminated the need for Packard's traditional long torque arms.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents the}} development of an armored vehicle model in lateral and longitudinal directions. A Nine Degree of Freedom (9 -DOF) armored vehicle model was derived mathematically and integrated with an analytical tire dynamics known as Pacejka Magic Tire model. The armored vehicle model is developed using three main inputs of a vehicle system which are <b>Pitman</b> <b>arm</b> steering system, Powertrain system and also hydraulic assisted brake system. Several testings in lateral and longitudinal direction are performed such as double lane change, slalom, step steer and sudden acceleration and sudden braking to verify the vehicle model. The armored vehicle model is verified using validated software, CarSim, using HMMWV vehicle model as a benchmark. The verification responses show that the developed armored vehicle model can be used for both lateral and longitudinal direction analysis...|$|R
