Field guides could not properly identify the shell and therefore it was compared with the collections of the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden and the Zoological Museum of Amsterdam. This comparison resulted in four possible identifications - Ruditapes variegatus, Venerupis aurea, Ruditapes philippinarum and Ruditapes semidecussatus. However, the specific shell colour pattern does not fully correspond with the pattern of these four species, making identification of the shell difficult.

40|$|Protocol for {{hatchery}} {{culture of}} the <b>pullet</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clam Venerupis corrugata spat is currently under development, as the only reliable means of providing spat to replenish natural beds or to support aquaculture activities. Among other variables, the microbiota has been demonstrated to be critical for successful bivalve culture. Shellfish hatcheries are hindered by fatal outbreaks of disease, regardless the bivalve species. These mass mortalities are mainly caused by opportunistic bacteria belonging to genus Vibrio and constitute one bottleneck for this economic activity. Different species, as V. tubiashii, V. pectenicida, V. splendidus, V. neptunius, V. ostreicida and V. bivalvicida, {{have been identified as}} responsible of mortalities in hatchery-reared larvae, affecting a wide range of bivalves. This is the first report of the microbiota associated with larval cultures of the <b>pullet</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clam. We present the results of the microbiological analyses of two larval cultures of <b>pullet</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> reared in the Centro de Investigacións Mariñas (CIMA, Xunta de Galicia) de Ribadeo (Galicia, NW Spain) following the procedures developed in the institution. Each batch, A and B, was obtained from broodstocks collected in natural environment but in different geographical locations, the stock A (SW Galicia) and the stock B (NW Galicia). Previous records of mortalities led us to divide each batch in two. One sub-batch (A 1 and B 1) was cultured following the routine procedures. Antibiotic was experimentally added to the other sub-batch (A 2 and B 2) with the aim of evaluating the effects on the culturable bacterial population (total marine bacteria and presumptive vibrios) and on larval survival. Chloramphenicol, formerly the most commonly used antibiotic in bivalve hatcheries, was supplied with each change of seawater during larval development. Microbiological samples of broodstock, larvae and seawater in culture tanks were taken and processed immediately following Prado et al. (2005, 2014). The bacteriological media used were Marine Agar, for heterotrophic marine bacteria, and Thiosulphate-Citrate-Bile-Sucrose, selective for vibrios. Bacterial counts were determined in all samples and expressed in colony forming unit (cfu) per millilitre or gram. The different types of colony in the samples of larval cultures were isolated, purified and subjected to a basic phenotypic characterization. Further studies were carried out with the isolates that shared the main features of the genus Vibrio, including phenotypic tests and the genetic characterization by sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene, as described by Prado et al. (2014). The counts of marine heterotrophic bacteria associated to broodstock gonad were similar in both groups (≈ 105 cfu/g). However, substantial differences were observed in the counts of presumptive vibrios, with higher values in the stock B (≈ 104 cfu/g) than in the stock A (≈ 102 cfu/g). Interestingly, the larval batch A showed high bacterial counts in the initial samples, including presumptive vibrios, while the batch B began with lower numbers of total marine bacteria and vibrios. The survival rates {{at the end of the}} larval development were higher in batch B (40 % B 1, 32 % B 2) than in batch A (24 % A 1, 27 % A 2). The use of antibiotic did not imply a significant enhancement of the survival. The total counts in the seawater from the culture tanks were similar. The presumptive vibrios were found mainly associated to larvae, regardless the batch or the use of antibiotic. The differences on the composition of bacterial populations will be analysed, focused on the identification of the presumptive vibrios. Preliminary results showed the dominance of species within the Splendidus clade of the genus Vibrio, as expected taking into account that its members have been isolated from marine environments and many of them from bivalves. Due to the high phenotypic diversity within this clade and the difficult to differentiate species, the correlation between phenotypic and genotypic identification will be evaluated...|$|E

40|$|The <b>pullet</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> Venerupis corrugata is an {{economically}} valuable species in several European countries, however, nowadays stocks are under high fishing pressure. Hatchery production of juveniles for release {{is a major}} contributor to strengthen the stock and consequently improve the sustainability of the natural stocks. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of rearing V. corrugata larvae with different larval densities (10, 40 and 200 larvae per mL) in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), compared with the traditional larval rearing methodology (Batch). The mean survival, growth and metamorphic rate of V. corrugata larvae in RAS was higher (11. 1 %; 71. 3  μm; 21. 6 % respectively) than in the Batch system, in all tested densities. The larval growth was not affected by the initial density until 40 larvae per mL, however, 200 larvae per mL decreased the larval growth in length nearly 54  μm. The larval rearing time was shortened in 2  days in the RAS system. The physical, chemical and microbiologic parameters suggested that the tested densities were not excessive to disturb the biofilter stability of RAS. The V. corrugata larval rearing performed at high larval stocking densities in RAS system present a reduction in the operating costs to produce this species. * Marinaqua * Reproseed.

In Portugal, this species was once {{abundant in the}} Ria Formosa (southern Portugal). However, in the early 1980 s, its abundance declined dramatically due to overfishing. In order to reverse this negative trend, the genetic sustainable management of the wild stocks of should be performed by promoting successful restocking actions {{and the development of}} an aquaculture commercial production program of this species. In order to find the best broodstock for aquaculture purposes and therefore minimize the deleterious effects of hatchery practices, we analyzed the genetic diversity of the natural population to be restocked (Ria Formosa) but also of another potential genetically close population (Ria de Aveiro) by RAPD. Similar and substantive percentage of polymorphic, effective number of alleles, Nei's gene diversity, and Shannon's diversity index was found within both populations. This high genetic variability within populations suggests that they might have a gene pool with sufficient genetic plasticity to support changes in the environmental conditions. Analyses of population genetic structure also revealed a small genetic differentiation between the two populations. The high genetic variability of the natural population to be restocked makes it the preferential broodstock for aquaculture purposes. However, the Ria de Aveiro population could also be a viable alternative, due to its genetic plasticity and the genetic similarity of both populations. The results of this study can be useful to the sustainable management of wild stocks as well as in promoting successful restocking actions based on aquaculture production...|$|E

The bacterial strains were identified by morphological and biochemical techniques and also by PCR and sequencing of a conserved region of the 16 S rRNA gene. In both cases bacteria isolated in pure culture were inoculated into spat of <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clams by intravalvar injection and by immersion. The mortality was attributed to the inoculated strains, since the bacteria were obtained in pure culture from the soft tissues of experimentally infected clams. V. alginolyticus TA 15 and V. splendidus biovar II strain TA 2 caused similar histological lesions that affected mainly the mantle, the velum, and the connective tissue of infected organisms.

40|$|Abstract Background The Grooved <b>Carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clam Ruditapes decussatus is the {{autochthonous}} European clam and {{the most}} appreciated from a gastronomic and economic point of view. The production is in decline due to several factors such as Perkinsiosis and habitat invasion and competition by the introduced exotic species, the manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. After we sequenced R. decussatus transcriptome we have designed an oligo microarray capable of contributing to provide some clues on molecular response of the clam to Perkinsiosis. Results A database consisting of 41, 119 unique transcripts was constructed, of which 12, 479 (30. 3 %) were annotated by similarity. An oligo-DNA microarray platform was then designed and applied to profile gene expression in R. decussatus heavily infected by Perkinsus olseni. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes between those two conditionswas performed by gene set enrichment analysis. As expected, microarrays unveil genes related with stress/infectious agents such as hydrolases, proteases and others. The extensive role of innate immune system was also analyzed and effect of parasitosis upon expression of important molecules such as lectins reviewed. Conclusions This study represents a first attempt to characterize Ruditapes decussatus transcriptome, an important marine resource for the European aquaculture. The trancriptome sequencing and consequent annotation will increase the available tools and resources for this specie, introducing the possibility of high throughput experiments such as microarrays analysis. In this specific case microarray approach was used to unveil some important aspects of host-parasite interaction between the <b>Carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clam and Perkinsus, two non-model species, highlighting some genes associated with this interaction.
