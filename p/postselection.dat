40|$|We {{propose a}} robust and {{scalable}} scheme to generate an N-qubit W state among separated quantum nodes (cavity-QED systems) by using linear optics and <b>postselections.</b> The present scheme inherits the robustness of the Barrett-Kok scheme [Phys. Rev. A 71, 060310 (R) (2005) ]. The scalability is also ensured {{in the sense}} that an arbitrarily large N-qubit W state can be generated with a quasi-polynomial overhead ∼ 2 ^O[(_ 2 N) ^ 2]. The process to breed the W states, which we introduce to achieve the scalability, is quite simple and efficient, and can be applied for other physical systems. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|While {{the novel}} {{applications}} of weak values have recently attracted wide attention, weak measurement, {{the usual way}} to extract weak values, suffers from risky approximations and severe quantum noises. In this paper, we show that the weak-value information can be obtained exactly in strong measurement with <b>postselections,</b> via measuring the coupling-deformed pointer observables, i. e., the observables selected according to the coupling strength. With this approach, we keep all the advantages claimed by weak-measurement schemes {{and at the same}} time solve some widely criticized problems thereof, such as the questionable universality, systematical bias, and drastic inefficiency.

40|$|We {{present a}} quantum {{repeater}} {{scheme based on}} the recently proposed qubit amplifier [N. Gisin, S. Pironio and N. Sangouard, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 070501 (2010) ]. It relies on a on-demand entangled-photon pair source which uses on-demand single-photon sources, linear optical elements and atomic ensembles. Interestingly, the imperfections affecting the states created from this source, caused e. g. by detectors with non-unit efficiencies, are systematically purified from an entanglement swapping operation based on a two-photon detection. This allows the distribution of entanglement over very long distances with a high fidelity, i. e. without vacuum components and multiphoton errors. Therefore, the resulting quantum repeater architecture does not necessitate final <b>postselections</b> and thus achieves high entanglement distribution rates. This also provides unique opportunities for device-independent quantum key distribution over long distances with linear optics and atomic ensembles. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
25|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, PostBQP is a complexity class {{consisting of}} all of the computational problems solvable in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine with <b>postselection</b> and bounded error (in the sense that the algorithm is correct at least 2/3 of the time on all inputs).|$|E
25|$|The usual {{definition}} of a PostBQP circuit family is one with two outbit qubits P (<b>postselection)</b> and Q (output) with a single measurement of P and Q at the end such that the probability of measuring P=1 has nonzero probability, the conditional probability Pr≥2/3 if the inputx is in the language, and Pr≥2/3 if the input x {{is not in the}} language. For technical reasons we tweak the {{definition of}} PostBQP as follows: we require that Pr≥2n'c for some constant c depending on the circuit family. Note this choice does not affect the basic properties of PostBQP, and also it can be shown that any computation consisting of typical gates (e.g. Hadamard, Toffoli) has this property whenever Pr>0.|$|E

40|$|So far, all {{experimental}} {{tests of}} Bell inequalities {{which must be}} satisfied by all local realistic hidden-variable theories and are violated by quantum mechanical predictions have left at least one loophole open. We propose a feasible setup allowing for a loophole-free test of the Bell inequalities. Two electron spin qubits of donors 31 P in a nanoscale silicon host in different cavities 300 m apart are entangled through a bright coherent light and <b>postselections</b> using homodyne measurements. The electron spins are then read out randomly and independently by Alice and Bob, respectively, with unity efficiency in less than 0. 7 µs by using optically induced spin to charge transduction detected by radio-frequency single electron transistor. A violation of Bell inequality larger than 37 % and 18 % is achievable provided that the detection accuracy is 0. 99 and 0. 95, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{prediction}} is derived by the Two-State-Vector-Formalism (TSVF) for a particle superposed over three boxes. Under appropriate pre- and <b>postselections,</b> and with tunneling enabled {{between two of}} the boxes, it is possible to derive not only one, but three predictions for three different times within the intermediate interval. These predictions are moreover contradictory. The particle (when looked for using a projective measurement) seems to disappear from the first box where it would have been previously found with certainty, appearing instead within the third box, to which no tunneling is possible, and later re-appearing within the second. It turns out that local measurement (i. e. opening one of the boxes) fails to indicate the particle's presence, but subtler measurements performed on the two boxes together reveal the particle's nonlocal modular momentum spatially separated from its mass. Another advance of this setting is that, unlike other predictions of the TSVF that rely on weak and/or counterfactual measurements, the present one uses actual projective measurements. This outcome is then corroborated by adding weak measurements and the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The results strengthen the recently suggested time-symmetric Heisenberg ontology based on nonlocal deterministic operators. They can be also tested using the newly developed quantum router.
