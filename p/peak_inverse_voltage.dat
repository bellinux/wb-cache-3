40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examines}} {{a boundary}} control for dc–dc buck converters subject to instantaneous constant-power loads. These loads introduce a destabilizing nonlinear {{effect on the}} con-verter through an <b>inverse</b> <b>voltage</b> term that leads to significant os-cillations in the main bus voltage or its collapse. Converter dynam-ics are analyzed in both switching states and the various operating regions of switch interaction with a first-order switching surface (boundary) are identified. Furthermore, sufficient conditions for large-signal stability of the closed-loop system are established. The analysis indicates that a linear switching surface with a negative slope passing through the desired operation point yields a stable operation. It is also shown that instability as well as system-stalling, which we term the invariant-set problem, may still occur in reflec-tive mode. However, a hysteresis band that contains the designed boundary {{may be used to}} prevent system-stalling. This hysteresis band also allows for a practical implementation of the controller by avoiding chattering. Design considerations are included and recommendations are given.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from May 22, 2013 - May 22, 2015 Voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) based ADC is an important class of time-domain ADC that has gained widespread acceptance due to their several desirable properties. VCO-based ADCs behave like an open-loop continuous time ΔΣ modulator and achieve excellent resolution by first order noise shaping the quantization error. However, the SNDR of an open-loop VCO-based ADC is severely distortion limited by the voltage-to-frequency tuning characteristics of the VCO. This work examines various techniques {{that have already been}} proposed to overcome the VCO tuning non-linearity problem. Two new VCO-based ADC architectures, that overcome the limitations of the conventional approaches, are proposed. In the first approach, the ADC is linearized by forcing the VCO to operate at only two operating points using a front-end two level modulator. With this technique, the linearity is improved without using either a multi-bit feedback DAC or calibration. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process, the prototype ADC achieves better than 71 dB SFDR and 59. 1 dB SNDR in 8 MHz signal bandwidth while consuming 4. 3 mW power. The ADC achieves a figure of merit of 366 fJ/conv-step, which is comparable with other state of the art time based ADCs. In the second approach, the need for a front-end two level modulator is obviated using linearizers, which introduce an <b>inverse</b> of VCO’s <b>voltage</b> to frequency characteristics in the signal path. A deterministic digital calibration unit runs continuously in the background and builds the <b>inverse</b> <b>voltage</b> to frequency transfer function.
