25|$|During the 1980s, the French Army were {{interested}} in mounting an airborne battlefield surveillance radar upon the Super Puma. The first prototype Orchidée was assembled at Aerospatiale's Marignane factory and began testing in late 1988; the French Army intended to procure 20 aircraft to equip two squadrons. Orchidée was described as having a pulse-Doppler radar mounted on the fuselage's underside, being capable of 360-degree scanning to detect low flying helicopters and ground vehicles at ranges of up to 150km; gathered data was to be relayed in real time to mobile ground stations via a single-channel data link for <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> before being transmitted to battlefield commanders. The system {{was said to be}} capable of all-weather operation, and would feature protection against counteracting hostile electronic countermeasures. However, development was aborted in mid-1990 during post-Cold War defence spending reductions.|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} of fermium (...) required more material, as the yield {{was expected to}} be at least an order of magnitude lower than that of element99, and so contaminated coral from the Enewetak atoll (where the test had taken place) was shipped to the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, for <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis.</b> About two months after the test, a new component was isolated emitting high-energy α-particles (7.1MeV) with a half-life of about a day. With such a short half-life, it could only arise from the β−decay of an isotope of einsteinium, and so had to be an isotope of the new element100: it was quickly identified as 255Fm (...) [...]|$|E

It was active from 2009 to 2013, and was the largest infrared telescope ever launched, carrying a [...] mirror and instruments sensitive to the far infrared and submillimetre wavebands (55–672µm). Herschel was the fourth and final cornerstone mission in the Horizon 2000 programme, following SOHO/Cluster II, XMM-Newton and Rosetta. NASA {{is a partner in}} the Herschel mission, with US participants contributing to the mission; providing mission-enabling instrument technology and sponsoring the NASA Herschel Science Center (NHSC) at the Infrared <b>Processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Analysis</b> Center and the Herschel Data Search at the Infrared Science Archive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} a brain morphometric study depends on {{multiple}} factors that can be roughly categorized as follows: First, depending on whether ontogenetic, pathological or phylogenetic issues are targeted, the study can be designed as longitudinal (within the same brain, measured at different times), or cross-sectional (across brains). Second, brain image data can be acquired using different neuroimaging [...] modalities. Third, brain properties can be analyzed at different scales (e.g. in the whole brain, regions of interest, cortical or subcortical structures). Fourth, the data can be subjected to different kinds of <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> steps. Brain morphometry as a discipline is mainly concerned {{with the development of}} tools addressing this fourth point and integration with the previous ones.|$|E
