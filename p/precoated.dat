50|$|The {{first step}} in synthesizing nanoshells in this method is by {{creating}} the device for the reaction to take place within. Microfluidic device patterns were fabricated onto silicon wafers by standard photolithography using negative photoresist SU-8 2050. Devices were subsequently molded in poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) using the soft lithography technique.(40) Briefly, PDMS was molded onto the SU-8 masters at 70 °C for 4 h, peeled, cut, and cleaned. Inlet and outlet holes (1/16-in. o.d.) were punched into the device. The microchannels were irreversibly bonded to a glass slide <b>precoated</b> with {{a thin layer of}} PDMS after a brief 35 s air plasma treatment. The microchannels have rectangular cross-section and are 300 μm wide, 155 μm deep, and 0.45 m long.|$|E
50|$|An orotone or gold tone {{is one of}} {{many types}} of {{photographic}} print which can be made from a negative. An orotone photograph is created by printing a positive on a glass plate <b>precoated</b> with a silver gelatin emulsion. Following exposure and development, the back of the plate is coated with banana oil impregnated with gold-colored pigment, to yield a gold-toned image. Alternatively, the developed glass plate can be gold-leafed by hand with 23-karat gold leaf. Being printed on glass, orotone images are extremely fragile and often require specialized frames in order to prevent breakage. Other types of prints can be made with the same negative used to make an orotone. Consequently, silver gelatin prints and platinotypes (platinum and palladium prints) are also made by those who produce orotone prints.|$|E
40|$|Filter {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine the most suitable filter for removing large quantities of aluminum corrosion product (boehmite) from reactor water. Filters tested included the following: wire-wound, sintered filter elements, sintered ceramic fllter elements, cotton stringwound filter elements, felted-cotton filter elements, cation resin, adsorption resin, diatomaceous earth <b>precoat</b> filter, and a wood-cellulose <b>precoat</b> filter. Parameters measured were flow rate, filter-influent and -effluent boehmite concentration, pressure drop, and final filter load. The pressure drop and efficiency of the filters was correlated with boehmite load. Boehmite deposits on filters as a nonporous gelatinous cake, and causes a rapidly increasing pressure drop. Tests indicate that the optimum load with filter elements and <b>precoat</b> filters is achieved at a pressure drop of 25 psi. Very little additional load {{can be obtained by}} operating to a higher pressure drop. Of the filters tested, the <b>precoat</b> filter snd 40 to 60 mesh cation resin were the more effective in removing boehmite. The efficiency of the <b>precoat</b> filter was in excess of 99 %, and the efficiency of the cation resin was for the most part in excess of 95 %. For various reasons, the other filters were eliminated from final consideration. The test program and available literature indicated that an element type <b>precoat</b> filter using wood cellulose as the <b>precoat</b> media would be most suitable for the proposed application.

50|$|Nanofoil is {{frequently}} used for soldering and brazing, as a heat source. When sandwiched between the components to be joined, either with a foil of solder on each side, using solder <b>precoated</b> components, or using solder-coated NanoFoil, it uniformly delivers {{significant amount of}} heat energy across the entire area, melting the solder and only locally heating {{the surface of the}} substrates, lowering the heat load on the component in comparison with soldering/brazing in a furnace. An externally applied even pressure during reaction and cooling serves to ensure a good homogeneous joint without voids. This process is known as NanoBond. Significantly dissimilar materials can be bonded without cracking: semiconductors, metals, ceramics, and polymers. The energy is deposited very locally, without significant heating of the bulk of the substrates, which reduces problems with mismatched thermal expansion coefficients between the materials and allows their joining at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|Although chipseal is an {{effective}} low-cost way to repair road, it has some drawbacks. Loose crushed stone is often left on the surface, owing to underapplication of bitumen or overapplication of stone. If not removed, this can cause safety and environmental problems such as cracked windshields, chipped paint, loss-of-control crashes (especially for motorcyclists, bicyclists and small trucks), and deposition of foreign material into drainage courses. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to sweep the road after the emulsion sets. As mentioned earlier, this problem can be minimized by using chips <b>precoated</b> with bitumen. Overapplication of emulsion can lead to bleeding, a condition where the excess asphalt rises to the surface, creating a very smooth surface that is very slippery when wet and bubbling in the hotter summer months. As cars drive over it the tires kick up this tarry substance on to the side of the car. It can only be cleaned off with a solvent remover or diesel fuel.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of polymer-modified bitumen and emulsion binder has increased chipseal's ability to prevent crack reflection and improve stone retention by improving {{the properties of}} the bitumen binder. Newer techniques use asphalt emulsion (a mixture of liquid asphalt, surfactant, and water) instead of asphalt. This has been shown to help reduce aggregate loss and reduce cost of installation, but can increase stripping. It reduces emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to the lower solvent content. New methods also utilize cross linking styrene acrylic polymers which also provide quality water resistance. Chips <b>precoated</b> with about one percent bitumen have been used successfully to minimize aggregate loss and to give the surface a black look. It can keep good pavement in good condition by sealing out water, but provides no structural strength and will repair only minor cracks. While the small stones used as surface yield a relatively even surface without the edges of patches, it also results in a very rough surface that leads to louder rolling noise from automobile wheels.|$|E

40|$|Release liners {{are used}} in various {{self-adhesive}} applications such as hygiene products (feminine care and diapers), envelopes, labels, etc. The main function of the release liner {{is to protect the}} adhesive layer in the product. Release liner has to stick to the adhesive, but also be easily removed from it. Therefore, the optimal level of release force needed to peel off the release liner is important for the proper performance of the liner. Release liner consists usually of base paper, <b>precoating,</b> and silicone coating. Silicone offers easy release, but it is the most expensive part of the release liner. <b>Precoating</b> makes the paper surface smoother and allows the use of a thinner silicone layer. The properties of the base paper, such as roughness and porosity, as well as the properties of the <b>precoating</b> and silicone coating, such as coating coverage, affect the final performance of the release liner. In addition to the factors directly related to the release liner, the release performance is affected by other factors such as the adhesive, the face stock material and the peel speed and angle. For a release liner manufacturer, {{it is important to know}} well all the factors that affect the performance of the release liner in the final product. In this work, influence of base paper porosity, <b>precoating</b> and silicone amount of the release liner as well as impact of different adhesives on the release force were investigated. In the theoretical part of the work, the phenomenon of adhesion is introduced with the help of general adhesion theories, continued with the concept of practical adhesion, or the practical strength of the adhesive bond, with contributions of fundamental adhesion and energy dissipation in the peeling process. Then, the materials involved in the study are introduced starting from the base paper, <b>precoating</b> and silicone, and continuing with pressure-sensitive adhesives. For the experimental part of the work, release liner samples were prepared with a base paper of 3 different levels of porosity coated with a hand coater using 2 levels of <b>precoating</b> and 3 levels of silicone coating. Air permeance values (closely related to the porosity), coat weights, water contact angles, and surface roughness were determined for the release liner samples. Six commercial adhesives intended for release liner applications were then characterized by their rheological properties. Release tests were then performed for the 18 different release liner samples and 6 different adhesives. It was found that the porosity of the base paper at the porosity level used did not have strong influence, but paper with lower porosity would allow the use of lower level of <b>precoating.</b> The level of <b>precoating</b> and silicone coating expectedly had a significant influence on the release performance with a higher level of <b>precoating</b> allowing less silicone to be used. Unexpectedly, a clear correlation between the rheological properties of the adhesive and the release force was not found.

40|$|The {{coolant supply}} uses in typical {{applications}} of metal cutting manufacturing on average 50 % of the electrical energy. A main optimization option is the retrofit of demandbased control {{strategies in the}} supply system. The study {{of the state of}} the art shows that a high energy saving potential remains in central <b>precoat</b> filter systems for coolant cleaning. The achievable flow rate through the <b>precoat</b> filter with the filter pump is reduced in filter operation due to the rising filter resistance. The <b>precoat</b> filters in the filter system need to be regenerated as soon as the achievable flow rate through the filters falls below a certain level. So far the filter pumps are throttled and operated constantly with maximum speed since this allows triggering the regeneration based on the filter pressure. Thereby the filter systems are operated constantly on an excessive power level, independent on the coolant demand. Within this thesis, an automation procedure for an energy efficient operation of central <b>precoat</b> filter systems is presented. The flow rates through the filters are regulated demand-based with a follow-up control using variable speed pumps. Thereby the energy intake is adapted based on the current coolant demand. The filter pressure is no longer utilizable to trigger the filter regeneration due to the variation of the flow rate. Therefore the filter pressure which would arise in uncontrolled operation is reconstructed in controlled operation with measured variables using a model. The presented procedure was successfully implemented in an existing central <b>precoat</b> filter system. The energy saving potential using the existing pumps and throttle setting is 62 %. Simulation results using filter pumps which allow in addition a reduction of the throttle lead to the conclusion that the energy saving potential is 73 %...|$|R
