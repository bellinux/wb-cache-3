Pearson was a leading English scholar of the time, with a field of interests that coincided with Georgescu's own, namely mathematics, statistics and philosophy of science. Georgescu made arrangements to lodge with the family of a young Englishman he had met in Paris and left for England in 1931. During his stay in London, the hosting family not only accepted Georgescu as their <b>paying</b> <b>guest,</b> they also taught him the basics of the English language, preparing him for his studies in the country.|$|E

2500|$|The San Dimas Hotel, {{also known}} as Walker House, the Carruthers Home, and the San Dimas Mansion, is a {{historic}} structure in San Dimas, California, built by the San Jose Ranch Company in 1887. [...] Originally built as a hotel, the [...] structure had 33 rooms and 14 fireplaces. [...] The hotel was built {{in anticipation of a}} land boom that never happened, and it never had a <b>paying</b> <b>guest.</b> [...] In 1889, the property was sold to James W. and Sue Walker for $25,000. [...] After being occupied by seven generations of Walkers, the property was turned into a restaurant in 1979. [...] The building became vacant in 1997 and was later acquired and renovated by the City of San Dimas. [...] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.|$|E
2500|$|A rapid-fire {{style of}} {{dialogue}} delivery and {{a penchant for}} nodding while speaking became Dev's style in films like House No. 44 (1955), Pocket Maar (1956), Munimji (1955), Funtoosh (1956), C.I.D. (1956) and <b>Paying</b> <b>Guest</b> (1957). [...] In the 1950s his films were of the mystery genre or light comedy love stories or were films with social relevance like Ek Ke Baad Ek (1959) and Funtoosh (1956). His style was lapped up by the audience and was widely imitated. He starred {{in a string of}} box office successes {{for the remainder of the}} 1950s opposite newcomer Waheeda Rehman in [...] C.I.D. (1956), Solva Saal (1958), Kala Bazar (1960) and Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962). Waheeda first became a star when C.I.D became a hit. The pair acted in Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja (1961 film) and Prem Pujari later. In 1955 he also co-starred with Dilip Kumar in Insaniyat. [...] With his acting in Kala Pani (1958), as the son who is willing to go to any lengths to clear his framed father's name, he won his first Filmfare award for Best Actor for the film. He attempted films of tragic genre occasionally like Pocket Maar (1956), [...] Kala Pani (1958), Bombai Ka Baboo (1960) and Sharabi (1964) and tasted success with them. Dev also played a few characters with a negative shade, like in Jaal (1952) where he played a smuggler, then as an absconding gang member in Dushman, and as a black marketer in Kala Bazar. Apart from his pairing with Suraiya and Kalpana Kartik, his pairing with Nutan and Waheeda Rehman was popular among the audiences in the late 50’s and 60’s. His films Rahi (1952) and Aandhiyan (1952), were screened along with Raj Kapoor's Awaara. From the early fifties till mid sixties, the trio of Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand ruled the roost.|$|E

60|$|An unwonted peace {{hung over}} the Villa Elsinore, broken, however, at {{frequent}} intervals, by clamorous lamentations suggestive of bewildered bereavement.

There {{were a number of}} ill-nourished-looking daughters, sensible and economical in their costume, the younger still with long, brown-stockinged legs, and the eldest present--there were, we discovered, one or two hidden away--displaying a large gold cross and other aggressive ecclesiastical symbols; there were two or three fox-terriers, a retrieverish mongrel, and an old, bloody-eyed and very evil-smelling St. Bernard. There was a jackdaw. There was, moreover, an ambiguous, silent lady that my aunt subsequently decided must be a very deaf <b>paying</b> <b>guest.</b> Two or three other people had concealed themselves at our coming and left unfinished teas behind them. Rugs and cushions lay among the chairs, and two of the latter were, I noted, covered with Union Jacks.|$|E

60|$|Curly {{stood for}} a few moments in the narrow, mesquite-paved street. San Antonio puzzled and {{disturbed}} him. Three days he had been a non- <b>paying</b> <b>guest</b> of the town, having dropped off there from a box car of an I. & G.N. freight, because Greaser Johnny had told him in Des Moines that the Alamo City was manna fallen, gathered, cooked, and served free with cream and sugar. Curly had found the tip partly a good one. There was hospitality in plenty of a careless, liberal, irregular sort. But the town itself was a weight upon his spirits after his experience with the rushing, business-like, systematised cities of the North and East. Here he was often flung a dollar, but too frequently a good-natured kick would follow it. Once a band of hilarious cowboys had roped him on Military Plaza and dragged him across the black soil until no respectable rag-bag would have stood sponsor for his clothes. The winding, doubling streets, leading nowhere, bewildered him. And then there was a little river, crooked as a pot-hook, that crawled through the middle of the town, crossed by a hundred little bridges so nearly alike that they got on Curly's nerves. And the last bartender wore a number nine shoe.|$|E

It's a curious little box for a lady to have, well made, of course, but of wood, with a ship painted on the top and the name of 'Tom' cut in it roughly with a knife; but, as she says, leather simply will not last down there, and one has to put up with what one can get; and the great thing is it's full, perfectly full, of gold coins and things. Yes, gold--and diamonds, Mr. Melville. You know Randolph understands something-- Yes, well he says that box--oh! I couldn't tell you how much it isn't worth! And all the gold things with just a sort of faint reddy touch.... But anyhow, she is rich, as well as charming and beautiful.

6000|$|It {{was about}} this time that Heyst became {{associated}} with Morrison on terms about which people were in doubt. Some {{said he was a}} partner, others said he was a sort of <b>paying</b> <b>guest,</b> but the real truth of the matter was more complex. One day Heyst turned up in Timor. Why in Timor, of all places in the world, no one knows. Well, he was mooning about Delli, that highly pestilential place, possibly in search of some undiscovered facts, when he came in the street upon Morrison, who, in his way, was also an [...] "enchanted" [...] man. When you spoke to Morrison of going home--he was from Dorsetshire--he shuddered. He said it was dark and wet there; that it was like living with your head and shoulders in a moist gunny-bag. That was only his exaggerated style of talking. Morrison was [...] "one of us." [...] He was owner and master of the Capricorn, trading brig, and was understood to be doing well with her, except for the drawback of too much altruism. He was the dearly beloved friend of a quantity of God-forsaken villages up dark creeks and obscure bays, where he traded for produce. He would often sail, through awfully dangerous channels up to some miserable settlement, only to find a very hungry population clamorous for rice, and without so much [...] "produce" [...] between them as would have filled Morrison's suitcase. Amid general rejoicings, he would land the rice all the same, explain to the people that it was an advance, that they were in debt to him now; would preach to them energy and industry, and make an elaborate note in a pocket-diary which he always carried; and this {{would be the end of}} that transaction. I don't know if Morrison thought so, but the villagers had no doubt whatever about it. Whenever a coast village sighted the brig it would begin to beat all its gongs and hoist all its streamers, and all its girls would put flowers in their hair and the crowd would line the river bank, and Morrison would beam and glitter at all this excitement through his single eyeglass with an air of intense gratification. He was tall and lantern-jawed, and clean-shaven, and looked like a barrister who had thrown his wig to the dogs.|$|E
