5000|$|Enabling high {{performance}} optoelectronic modules using novel gas-conserving {{resistance welding electrode}} system - Amada Miyachi America developed a new <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> technique that dramatically reduces the amount of Xenon gas needed to backfill a package. Xenon has good thermal properties that aid in transporting reliability-reducing heat away from the electronic device.

However, it is extremely expensive, about $150 a liter and many existing processes waste significant quantities of the costly gas during backfilling. The new cap welding technique uses an innovative electrode vacuum and gas backfill system that enables packages to be evacuated, and then filled with gas before being hermetically sealed using <b>projection</b> <b>welding.</b> This process consumes as little as 5 cubic centimeters of Xenon gas, costing only $0.75 per part.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Projection</b> <b>welding</b> is a {{variation}} of electric resistance welding with the dynamic changes of the flow paths for heat and electrical properties with changing temperature caused by the large plastic deformation with collapse of projection. The common standards of <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> are AWS, IIW and Harris & Riley which have been established and in use for some time. All these standards have the slots located under the projection. However, the standard proposed in this paper researches on is a special one with the slots designed on {{the two sides of}} the projection. A comprehensive thermal-electrical-mechanical analysis was performed to quantitatively simulate the <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> of the special standard by a coupled finite element method. The electrical, thermal and mechanical aspects of the <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> processes such as the projection collapse mechanism, the nugget formation process and the effects of different electrode forces were discussed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In the automated welding technology on three dimensional constructions, the welding tools will be proceed along the components of programmed handling systems in order to weld the components with each other. Tolerances while manufacturing result in the joints {{being able to be}} found at different positions. The deviations from the correct way are registered with the aid of sensors and transformed in control data for regulation of deviation. For this purpose, different models were developed by sensors which are mounted firmly in front of the welding tool and {{in such a way that}} it can recognize the deviations. In this case, the freedom of movement of the handling systems is limited at one degree of freedom. Abrupt direction changes lead to measurement errors so that the sensor leaves the measuring range. For this reason a new optical sensor was developed in this that is able to detect all necessary work parameters while welding. The sensor is based on the purposeful evaluation of structured illuminated <b>projections</b> around the <b>welding</b> point. The structured light occurs with a holographic projection system. An adapted preprocessing of data as well as a optimised rule-based recognition of the joint direction make also possible to detect complex welding joints in real time. The seam tracking system determines the position of the joint to be welded in the working area, the deviation of the welding head from the normal at the surface as well as the width of the gap between the components with a solution of 50 !Jm. The optical, mechanical, electronical and data processing components were developed for the high orders while welding with the laser. The use of this new seam tracking sensor allows the use of handling systems with only five axes at three dimensional joint geometries...|$|R

40|$|The aim is {{to analyze}} the {{possibility}} for using the 08 YUT steel separator tape to manufacture separators, which are to be further applied to the bearing assembly via <b>projection</b> <b>welding.</b> Reliability of rolling bearings is determined by many factors such as surface quality of balls and rings and assembly precision, including the seal strength of hemiseparators. The technology based on the double-pulsed condenser <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> belongs {{to one of the}} most efficient technologies to provide the assembly of bearing, for it allows welding of separator simultaneously in all currents. The paper shows that the required condition to assure high reliability of the bearing is induastial development and implementation of an effective and positive quality control system, which will reduce the probability of damages occurring both when welding and in the course of operation. The work used the static tensile test methods, as well as metallographic analysis. The experimental study used the 08 YUT steel hemiseparators. A tape thickness of the hemiseparators was of 1. 5 mm. The number of simultaneously welded points were 8. The experimental studies of the metal damage of welding joints of the the 08 YUT steel separator have shown that with a wide range of the changing welding current and compressed electrode force the quality assurance of welding points at the parent metal level could not be retrieved. The metallographic analysis of the metal damage nature of a welded joint revealed that between the atoms on the surfaces of hemiseparators there are no strong bonds – a bond was formed in the contact zone.

40|$|Resistance welding is used very {{extensively}} in industry {{for a wide}} range of applications. Knowledge and measurement of the dynamic characteristics of resistance welding equipment is important in the design of the equipment and in optimization of welding procedures using finite element software. This is especially true for <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> where accurate measurements of effective lumped mass and damping of the welding head as well as its maximal acceleration and velocity are required for accurate modelling. This thesis describes a new concept where a mechanical model of the welding head is used together with the imposition of a mechanical load step function with simultaneous measurement of resulting head motion to calculate effective lumped mass and damping factor. Two test systems were devised to implement the step function. In the “free fracture test”, a metal or ceramic bar is loaded to its breaking point and resulting welding head velocity is measured. This data allows accurate calculation of machine parameters. The second test uses the explosion of a small metallic element to impose a step function, when the welding current causes the metallic element to explode. The final version of this test “the exploding button test” uses a small cylindrical element fabricated from welding filler wire, with the advantage that both button geometry and material can be controlled. The exploding button test has proved to be very effective, can easily be used for in-situ measurements and avoids the vibrations associated with the free fracture test. These test were applied to evaluate a range of resistance welding machines. Finally, an innovative projection geometry was developed to significantly increase projection weld quality and this design has now been used {{extensively in}} industry. The techniques developed in this thesis have been shown to be practical and effective and have enabled much better understanding of machine kinematics.

Empirical research has been performed to offer new approaches for improved joint strength and to increase knowledge on cracking mechanisms in resistance <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> and resistance spot welding of UHSS. By optimising the current build-up phase and peak current during the first milliseconds of weld time, it was shown that the strength could be improved by up to two-fold for projection welded joints. An approach to improve the ductility and strength of resistance spotwelds in UHSS using reduced cooling time was unsuccessful. The reduced cooling rate after weld metal solidification did not fully create the desired softened microstructure. The study on the surface cracking mechanism in resistance spot welded dual-phase UHSS showed that cracking is linked to the galvanization method.

40|$|Machine {{dynamics}} of {{resistance spot welding}} (RSW) machines significantly influence process capability and performance. Integrated mechanical, electrical and thermal models of the RSW process also require accurate specification of machine dynamics. The influence of specific machine configurations {{is extremely difficult to}} predict starting from individual component specifications, and it has also been difficult in the past to accurately measure dynamic performance under typical operating conditions. This paper presents a reliable and very straightforward new method for the characterization of machine performance. This method has the advantage that {{it can be used to}} characterize the performance of RSW machines under realistic operating conditions. The test, the “Exploding Wire Test", uses a small diameter wire placed between the welding electrodes. The machines’ performance can subsequently be measured at the required operating load as the wire disintegrates when welding current is applied. This paper also describes the negative influence of the welding current itself on the machines’ mechanical behavior. The welding machines’ performance characteristics can be used directly, in order to optimize process operation towards a specific and demanding application, or serve as an input into an integrated mechanical / electrical / thermal model of the RSW process. The test method is relatively simple (although sophisticated instrumentation is required to accurately measure dynamic behaviour) and it can be used over a wide range, from micro-joining to heavy duty applications, and can be applied to <b>projection</b> <b>welding</b> as well as resistance spot welding. status: publishe...|$|E
