40|$|A {{multi-agent system}} manages {{emergent}} business processes. The agents {{in this system}} {{all have the same}} generic architecture. The generic agent architecture is a three-layer BDI, hybrid, multi-agent architecture. The architecture copes with plans whose goals develop and mutate. The agents in the system choose their course of action on the basis of estimates of the likelihood of a choice leading to success, and on estimates of the time, cost and value of making a choice. 1 Introduction Emergent processes are business processes; they are distinct from <b>production</b> <b>workflows</b> [1]. Emergent processes are opportunistic in nature whereas <b>production</b> <b>workflows</b> are routine. Emergent processes are inherently distributed and involve asynchronous parallel work. What amounts to a "satisfactory conclusion" of an emergent process is not generally known until the process is well advanced. Further, the tasks involved in an emergent process are typically not predefined and emerge as the process deve [...] ...|$|R

40|$|New {{methods for}} specifying and {{producing}} printed products are emerging as print service providers seek to streamline order management, reduce costs, and improve efficiencies in print supply-chain management. These emerging print production models rely on system architectures that use Web applications {{to interface with}} highly automated print <b>production</b> <b>workflows.</b> The application of the Internet in print supply-chain management {{is not a new}} concept and has been previously investigated. However, little scholarly research has been published on Web-to-print or Web-enabled print production system architectures. The purpose of this research is to analyze the current state of Web-enabled print within the printing industry. The research examined a number of print service providers utilizing Web-enabled print systems. This examination {{led to the development of}} an instrument for looking at Web-enabled print service providers. The instrument provides a list of system-independent attribute descriptions for comparing various Web-enabled printing system architectures. The instrument was then used to analyze a number of print service providers. This analysis provides insight into various approaches to developing the Web application processes of a Web-enabled printing system. Lastly, the print <b>production</b> <b>workflows</b> of two Web-enabled print service providers were observed. The observations provided case studies on the strategy behind the development of a Web-enabled printing system and how customer information collected during product specification and order submission can be used to facilitate the production of printed products...|$|R
