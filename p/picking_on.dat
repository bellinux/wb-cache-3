5|$|With Piper's departure, Paul McDermott, who {{performed}} {{at one of}} DAAS's regular clubs, was invited to join. He accepted, {{although he did not}} like their material, which he considered too sweet. Fidler says McDermott changed the group's dynamic; he wrote the majority of their songs and prompted a darker tone. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, where they based themselves with a regular gig at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, in an effort to save enough money to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe. Initially DAAS found that Melbourne audiences did not respond to their act and to provoke a reaction they became more aggressive, with McDermott and Ferguson adopting more abusive personas and often <b>picking</b> <b>on</b> Fidler's naturally happy but stupid character. They made their first overseas performance at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1987, to sold out crowds.|$|E

Lü Yi abused his powers by <b>picking</b> <b>on</b> trivialities and framing numerous officials under his watch for committing serious offences. He also freely abused his powers to investigate and prosecute officials, {{some of whom were}} arrested, imprisoned and tortured. Even officials like Zhu Ju, a high-ranking general, and Gu Yong, the Imperial Chancellor, fell victim to Lü Yi's malice.|$|E

25|$|Raymond {{typically}} {{falls in}} the middle of family arguments, incapable of taking any decisive stand, especially if it might invoke his mother's disapproval. Robert, a miserable gentle giant, jealous of his younger sibling's position as favorite son and also of the success his brother has achieved both professionally and personally, is Ray's biggest rival. Robert and Raymond frequently argue like overgrown children, focusing much of their energy on <b>picking</b> <b>on</b> or one upping each other, although deep down they love each other dearly.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007, The Vachons {{were back in the}} US. At a February 17 show for Grapple Masters Wrestling in Bristol, Vermont, The Vachons were supposed to appear for the show's opening promo. When the team was introduced, however, their rivals The Hellraisers come out instead. The Hellraisers began <b>picking</b> <b>on</b> a fan in the crowd, Albert, but then invited him to join them in the ring. They continued talking to Albert until the young man said he was a fan of The Vachons causing The Hellraisers to attack him. The Vachons then ran to the ring to chase off The Hellraisers setting up two singles matches between the four wrestlers later that night. The match series ended in a tie with Hellraiser Misery defeating Damien Vachon in a Tables match and Pierre Vachon winning a Thumbtacks match against Hellraiser Pain. Both teams were scheduled to meet in a Dog Collar match for the GMW Tag Team Championship on March 10.|$|E
25|$|On Friday episodes {{which ran}} short, {{during the first}} season, a game was played with {{audience}} members for a small cash prize, usually $50. The game was played with regular panelist Brett Somers first. A word or phrase with a blank would be asked of Somers, and she would write it down on her card. Rayburn would then circulate amongst audience members who raised their hands to play, and if the audience member matched the answer Somers had written down, then they would win $50. Rayburn would continue <b>picking</b> <b>on</b> audience members until someone matched the answer. If there was more time left, the same game would be played with Charles Nelson Reilly responding to and writing down an answer for another audience member to guess. Rayburn sometimes seemed frustrated by {{this part of the}} show and with the answers given by some of the audience members; {{at the end of one}} episode, he was shown collapsed in one of the audience seats, seemingly exhausted.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg {{drew the}} story of the film from his parents' divorce; Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it [...] "essentially a spiritual autobiography, a {{portrait}} of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent, mystical imagination". References to his childhood occur throughout: Elliott fakes illness by holding a thermometer to the bulb in his lamp while covering his face with a heating pad, a trick frequently employed by the young Spielberg. Michael <b>picking</b> <b>on</b> Elliott echoes Spielberg's teasing of his younger sisters, and Michael's evolution from tormentor to protector reflects how Spielberg {{had to take care of}} his sisters after their father left.|$|E
500|$|In a 1998 Presbyterian Record review, Canadian Christian writer Phil Callaway {{writes that}} What's So Amazing About Grace? made him [...] "thankful afresh for God's grace and {{challenged}} {{to live a}} life reflecting it". Callaway was haunted by Yancey's question, [...] "If grace is so amazing, why don't Christians show more of it?" [...] and expressed his appreciation to the author at the 1998 Christian Booksellers Association convention. When he asked Yancey why he wrote the book, the author answered: [...] "I long for the church to become a culture of grace... A graceful church knows how to welcome failure and rewards vulnerability so that a person automatically thinks of the church when needing help." [...] Yancey asked Callaway if he thought the book would generate controversy, and Callaway said it would. Callaway asked Yancey why his book was so harsh in its description of Christians, and Yancey responded, [...] "I'm <b>picking</b> <b>on</b> Christians because I am one". Yancey said that he knew many gracious Christians and that secular culture was filled with examples of ungrace, including media manipulation of body image and the belief that [...] "there ain't {{no such thing as a}} free lunch", which contradicts the concept of undeserved grace from God as taught in Christianity.|$|E
