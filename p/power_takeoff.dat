25|$|Series models feature leaf-sprung {{suspension}} with selectable two or {{four-wheel drive}} (4WD); though the Stage 1 V8 {{version of the}} Series III featured permanent 4WD.

25|$|At Murray's request, BMW {{designed}} a special version of their M12 inline four engine. Differences {{from the standard}} upright unit were few, mainly concerning the oil scavenging system and the cradle in which the unit was mounted. Like the upright version the unit was not a stressed component. Mounting the engine on its side meant that the <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> from the unit, previously at the bottom, was offset to one side. A special 7-speed 3-shaft gearbox from American gearbox specialists Weismann was produced to deal with this.|$|E
25|$|The BMP-3 has a {{range of}} 600km, an {{altitude}} of operation of up to 3,000m and it is transportable by train, truck, sea, and air. The BMP-3 engine is a diesel four-stroke, liquid-cooled design. The transmission is a four-speed hydromechanical power unit, with <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> to its water jets. The suspension is independent, with a torsion bar and six hydraulic shock absorbers. Steering is by gear differential with hydrostatic drive. The track adjusting mechanism is remotely controlled from the driver's station, with tension force indication. The water-jet propulsion unit is single-stage, axial, auger-type.|$|E
25|$|The first officially {{authenticated}} regularly feasible take-off {{and landing}} of a human-powered aircraft (one capable of <b>powered</b> <b>takeoffs,</b> unlike a glider) {{was made on}} 9 November 1961 by Derek Piggott in Southampton University's Man Powered Aircraft (SUMPAC).|$|R
50|$|Watt {{never ceased}} {{improving}} his designs. This further improved the operating cycle speed, introduced governors, automatic valves, double-acting pistons, {{a variety of}} rotary <b>power</b> <b>takeoffs</b> and many other improvements. Watt's technology enabled the widespread commercial use of stationary steam engines.|$|R
5000|$|Special {{variants}} called aircraft catapults {{are used}} to launch planes from land bases and sea carriers when the takeoff runway is too short for a <b>powered</b> <b>takeoff</b> or simply impractical to extend. Ships also use them to launch torpedoes and deploy bombs against submarines. Small catapults, referred to as [...] "traps", are still widely used to launch clay targets into {{the air in the}} sport of clay pigeon shooting.|$|R

2500|$|On 9 July 1991, Lockheed F-117A, 84-0824, c/n A.4038, {{was flown}} to Eglin for climatic testing. [...] The {{aircraft}} was prepped and then {{installed in the}} chamber using special fixtures and tooling designed to allow simulation of conditions in flight. Testing began under cold weather conditions (−40°F ambient) on 15 July 1991, and continued through conditions of snow loading, blowing snow, hail, freezing rain, ice and fog, hot weather (140°F ambient), water intrusion testing, and concluded in January 1992 with tropical rain and human factors evaluations. Cold soaks to −60°F and 160°F were also included. A typical mission [...] "flown" [...] included pre-flight, pilot ingress, APU and engine start, full <b>power</b> <b>takeoff,</b> cruise, systems operation and weapon delivery, landing, pilot egress, and post flight inspection. Aircraft maintenance was performed and evaluated throughout the testing sequence.|$|E

5000|$|The {{suction unit}} is roughly rectangular-block-shaped, about 2.5 metres wide and 3.6 metres high, {{and is usually}} mounted and used {{on the back of}} a truck, which must have <b>power</b> <b>takeoffs</b> to run the suction unit's air {{impeller}} and hydraulics. When it is emptying its load out, the spoil tank lid (with the hose connection) hinges off to the right, then the spoil tank (with the filters) tips about 90° over to the left to tip its load out.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 June 1965, USAF KC-135A, 63-0842, lost {{electrical}} <b>power</b> on <b>takeoff</b> {{and crashed}} at Walker Air Force Base, killing all five on board.|$|R

50|$|Most {{cordwood}} saws {{consist of}} a frame, blade, mandrel, cradle, and power source. The cradle is a tilting or sliding guide that holds logs during the cutting process. Some cordwood saws are run from a belt from a farm tractor <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> pulley. Others, mounted on a tractor's three-point hitch, connect to the rear <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> shaft. Self-powered models are equipped with small gasoline engines or even large electric motors as power sources. The mandrel is a shaft and set of bearings that support and transfer power to the blade. The frame is a structure that supports the cradle and blade at a convenient working height.|$|E
50|$|A power {{take-off}} or <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> (PTO) is any of several methods for taking power from a power source, {{such as a}} running engine, and transmitting it to an application such as an attached implement or separate machines.|$|E
50|$|Series models feature leaf-sprung {{suspension}} with selectable two or {{four-wheel drive}} (4WD); though the Stage 1 V8 {{version of the}} Series III featured permanent 4WD.

50|$|The power {{produced}} by the engine must be transmitted to the implement or equipment to do the actual work intended for the equipment. This may be accomplished via a drawbar or hitch system if the implement is to be towed or otherwise pulled through the tractive power of the engine, or via a pulley or <b>power</b> <b>takeoff</b> system if the implement is stationary, {{or a combination of}} the two.|$|E

25|$|A {{quick-release}} hook (controlled by the pilots) was provided, {{which enabled}} the captain to start, warm up and (when required) run all four engines up to full <b>power</b> for <b>takeoff</b> while the aircraft was {{still attached to}} the mooring buoy.|$|R
50|$|After Lockheed was {{requested}} on 27 June 1980, {{to begin}} preliminary engineering studies on an STOL Hercules, {{the use of}} JATO units was explored, since these had previously been used to <b>power</b> <b>takeoffs.</b> Lockheed reported on 16 July that 58 JATO bottles (more than seven times greater than normal) would be required and that arresting gear would be insufficient to stop the C-130 in the required space. The U.S. Navy's Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake organization was then brought into the project to provide expertise on existing rocket motor power. Lockheed proceeded with work to structurally reinforce the C-130 airframe to withstand rocket forces {{and to develop a}} passenger restraint system for 150 persons.|$|R
50|$|An example {{with some}} {{features}} of an M&T application is the ASU Campus Metabolism, which provides real-time and historic energy use and generation data for facilities of Arizona State University {{on a public}} web site.

5000|$|For 2017 the 6.2 L V8 in the Super Duty {{received}} new tuning {{and modified}} camshafts to bump torque to 430 lb-ft, while horsepower remained at 385hp.
