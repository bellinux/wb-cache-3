40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{research}} {{as a whole is}} dedicated to studies of the work load of navigation officers and, consequently, is related to the current international research on the quality of working life. Issues of seafarers' working time are very topical because in recent years the load of navigation officers has significantly increased, either due to increase in shipping intensity, or {{in the context of the}} new international maritime law, for example, compliance with the requirements of the ISM CODE (International Management safety Code), THE ISPS (The International Ship and Port Facility Security Code). Irregularities are observed in practice of the seafarers' working hours and rest hours, and even the mismatch, as presented in the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> materials. This article is intended to assess the 2 nd and 3 rd Officer's load compliance with the regulatory enactments for the work and rest regime to develop proposals to load optimization. Load analysis of Navigation officers is based on international maritime regulations that determine the work and rest regime on ships STCW (The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers), MLC (Maritime Labour Convention). In the article, concrete data is used from the research, which was conducted 18 months on the Handy type of tanker from July, 2012 till December, 2013 in the real time mode. In the article is also concrete data used from 340 survey respondents, which reflects the views of the navigation officers on violations of the work and rest regime on the ship and the fatigue issue...|$|E

50|$|With the {{advantage}} of being located near the Arabian peninsula, Somali traders have increasingly begun to challenge Australia's traditional dominance over the Gulf Arab livestock and meat market, offering quality animals at very low prices. In response, Gulf Arab states have started to make strategic investments in the country, with Saudi Arabia building livestock export infrastructure and the United Arab Emirates purchasing large farmlands. Most livestock is exported through the northern <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Bosaso and <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Berbera. In March 2013, livestock traders also resumed exports from the southern <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Mogadishu. After <b>inspection</b> at a newly constructed animal quarantine facility in Mogadishu, 13,000 goats and 2,435 camels were sent to markets in Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.A ten-year-old manufacturing, distributing, wholesale and import/export company, the Bosaso Tannery processes wet salted, dry salted, wet blue, limed, pickled, and air/frame dried sheep and goat hides and skin. It has some of the highest quality natural skins on the continent. The firm exports a little over 90,000 tonnes of hides and skins every year from Bosaso to Ethiopia, Turkey, Pakistan, India, China and Italy. Raw camel hides and sheep and goat skin are also dispatched to the United Arab Emirates. The wet blue type is exported to the Middle East and various parts of Europe. As of 2012, the company is moving toward ready-made leather production for eventual exportation to consumer markets in the Middle East and other areas.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2001 summer season, Galaxy was {{replaced}} by the brand-new [...] in the Alaskan service. As a result, Galaxy was relocated into European waters, cruising the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. On 2 June 2001, while departing Amsterdam in the Netherlands for a two-week cruise the Galaxy touched bottom on an outskirt of Forteiland at IJmuiden due to heavy northwesterly squalls, resulting in major damage to the port side propeller. The ship returned to the <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Amsterdam for <b>inspection</b> and disembarkation <b>of</b> the passengers. The cruise had to be cancelled as the Galaxy went into drydock at Blohm + Voss in Hamburg, Germany. There it was discovered that all four blades <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> side propeller would have to be replaced; however the ship only carried two spare blades on board. To solve the problem two extra propeller blades carried on board Galaxys sister ship MV Mercury were flown from the Caribbean to Hamburg and installed on the Galaxy. Following repairs the ship re-entered service on 16 June 2001.|$|R
25|$|Already in 1708, the Danish Politi- och Kommercekollegium {{proposed}} shielding the Danish islands with {{a marine}} cordon sanitaire, with dedicated <b>ports</b> for <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> incoming ships from the Baltic Sea and a quarantine station on Saltholm, {{a small island}} in the Sound between Copenhagen on Zealand (Sjælland) and Malmö in Scania. These measures were not implemented immediately, as the plague had not yet reached the Baltic coast. On 16 and 19 August 1709, however, the king ordered {{the implementation of a}} revised plan, and a quarantine station was built on Saltholm for goods and crews of ships coming to Denmark from the infected <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> Danzig and Königsberg, while their ships were meanwhile cleansed in Christianshavn; Dutch traders sailing from infected ports to the North Sea were to pay the Sound Dues on a special boat off the coast at Helsingør. When the plague did not arrive in Denmark, though, Saltholm effectively fell out of use by 3 July 1710, when only three people were left in the station. The main problem then was rather the lost Battle of Helsingborg and the aggressive type of typhus that the retreating Danish soldiers carried to Zealand from Scania.|$|R

This research applies lean thinking to ship safety <b>inspection</b> at <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Surabaya to investigate the existing procedure and to identify the wastes and non-value-add (NVA) activity. It used a combination of literature review, examination on the data <b>of</b> 520 <b>inspections</b> that {{have been carried out}} to 201 ships {{in the last two years}} (2009 - 2011), investigation on related regulations and guidelines, observation on the actual conduct <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> and interview with 59 marine inspectors and ship officers. Analysis is conducted using Value Stream Mapping (VSM). It is found that the existing procedure lacks significant impact in terms of imposing a reduction in the total number of detected deficiency between the earlier and subsequent inspections. Only 37 % of the ships experience a reduction, indicating that the performance <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> is currently at the level of 37 on a 100 -point scale. It was mainly due to severe violation of the regulations, which is demonstrated by the issuance of ship certificate regardless of corrective action undertaken relating to the detected deficiency.
