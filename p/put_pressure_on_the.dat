5|$|Competition from {{road traffic}} {{starting}} {{in the early twentieth}} century <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railway, and it was later a victim of the Beeching cuts.

5|$|In the 2nd centuryBC, the Iazyges {{began to}} migrate {{west to the}} steppe near the Lower Dniester. One {{possible}} explanation of this was that the Roxolani, who were the Iazyges' eastern neighbors, were also migrating west, due to pressure from the Aorsi, which <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Iazyges and forced them to migrate west as well.|$|E

5|$|During {{his rise}} to power, Richard Nixon {{became known as}} a leading anti-communist. After he became {{president}} in 1969, Nixon saw advantages in improving relations with China and the Soviet Union; he hoped that détente would <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese to end the Vietnam War, and {{he might be able}} to manipulate the two main communist powers to the benefit of the United States.|$|E
5|$|This breed, {{along with}} other brachycephalic dogs (e.g., boxers, bulldogs), are also prone to hemivertebrae. The curled tail of a British bulldog {{is an example of}} a hemivertebrae, but when it occurs not in the {{coccygeal}} vertebrae but in other areas of the spine, it can cause paralysis. The condition occurs when two parts of a spinal vertebra do not fuse properly while a young Pug is still growing, resulting in an irregularly shaped spinal cavity which can <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord.|$|E

In 1962, he told senior U.S. Embassy official Joseph Mendenhall that Diệm's military subordinates invented arbitrary and falsely inflated figures of Viet Cong fighters.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{demographic}} trends will <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian {{population will}} result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing {{will result in}} slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As {{a result of these}} trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s {{the rise}} in motor traffic had <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ferry's capacity. A {{proposed}} bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected as it would be too obvious a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. Because of the lack of a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.|$|E

5|$|Despite the series' {{success on}} Fox Kids, Animaniacs on Kids' WB was only {{successful}} in an unintended way, bringing in adult viewers and viewers outside the Kids' WB target demographic of young children. This unintended result of adult viewers {{and not enough}} young viewers <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> WB network from advertisers and caused dissatisfaction from the WB network towards Animaniacs. Slowly, orders from the WB for more Animaniacs episodes dwindled and Animaniacs had a couple more short seasons, relying on leftover scripts and storyboards. The fourth season had eight episodes, which was reduced from 18 because of Warner Bros.' dissatisfaction with Animaniacs. The 99th and final Animaniacs episode was aired on November 14, 1998.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} {{stages of the}} Second World War, the bailey was {{levelled}} and used to hold a set of temporary Nissen huts that formed a hospital for United States Army personnel. In 1945, the site was leased by the Air Ministry for use as offices. The Ministry of Works took over the guardianship of the castle in 1951. The ministry <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Air Ministry to leave the site, which occurred in 1956; the bailey was then grassed over again. Archaeological excavations were {{carried out in the}} bailey between 1961 and 1982, uncovering many of the medieval buildings.|$|E
5|$|Now {{with the}} city under Gorgopas' command the {{defenders}} became reinvigorated. The siege was proving more difficult until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 Roman soldiers. With {{the arrival of the}} new soldiers, the allied soldiers were encouraged and began bombarding the city again with their siege engines while the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet continued to <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Spartans from the sea. The Spartans knew {{that they did not have}} much of a chance of withstanding the renewed allied assault and Gorgopas decided to surrender the city to the Romans under the condition that the garrison was allowed to leave the city unharmed.|$|E

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most commonly reported nerve entrapment syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome {{is often associated with}} repetitive motions of the wrist and fingers; jobs like typists, pianists, and meat cutters are at particularly high risk. The tough flexor retinaculum {{along with the rest of}} the carpal tunnel cannot expand, <b>putting</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> median nerve running through the carpal tunnel with the flexor tendons of the wrist. This results in the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|R
5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|The crossing's {{development}} {{started in}} the late 1930s, but was interrupted due to the Second World War and resumed in the 1950s. The original tunnel catered for a single lane of traffic in each direction, but rising traffic levels required the second tunnel to be built. The M25 connected to the tunnels at both ends when completed in 1986, and this increased traffic <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tunnels' capacity. A Private Finance Initiative scheme was started in 1988 to build the bridge. The combined crossing now handles four lanes of traffic in each direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} war {{drastically}} reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas, Nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gaming industry on the island. Finally in 1957, Texas Attorney General Will Wilson and the Texas Rangers began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted gambling and prostitution in the city. As these vice industries crashed, so did tourism, taking the rest of the Galveston economy with it. Neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward.|$|E

5|$|This set {{the pattern}} for the six-year {{conflict}} between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to starve it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their diplomatic efforts, the Venetians tried to <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sultan, by stirring up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman Crusade, and sending their fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their own on Venetian possessions in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until early}} 1705, Peter's efforts {{were focused on}} Livonia and Ingria, and there were few direct {{confrontations}} against the Swedish main army in Poland.

5|$|Contador {{continued}} to be troubled by his injury during stage 8, which finished on the climb of the Campitello Matese. The stage was won by Beñat Intxausti (Movistar), {{who was in the}} day's early breakaway and attacked on the final climb. Astana again rode hard to <b>put</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other riders; eventually a group formed of Contador, Aru, Porte and Landa. Landa then attacked and finished second on the stage, 15 seconds ahead of the other three riders. He therefore moved up into fifth place overall, while Contador increased his lead over Aru by winning bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint. Stage 9 was also won by a rider from a breakaway: Paolo Tiralongo (Astana) took a solo victory. Aru, Contador, Porte and Landa were again alone in a group {{towards the end of the}} stage; although they came to the finish together, Aru took a second out of the others in the sprint. This moved him to three seconds behind Contador. The following day was the first rest day of the race.|$|E
