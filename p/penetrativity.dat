40|$|Technology {{assessments}} {{in the areas}} of aerodynamics, propulsion, and structures and materials for cruise missile systems are discussed. The cruise missiles considered cover the full speed, altitude, and target range. The <b>penetrativity,</b> range, and maneuverability of the cruise missiles are examined and evaluated for performance improvements...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{construct}} the fusion gene expression vector of penetrating peptide(PDT) and the glucocorticoid receptor lack of ligand binding domain(GR-ΔLBD),and evaluate the prokaryotic expression,purification and cell <b>penetrativity</b> of fusion protein PDT/GR-ΔLBD. Methods The target gene fragment GR-ΔLBD {{was obtained from}} plasmid pEGFP-GR-ΔLBD by double digestion,and sub-cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-PDT to {{construct the}} fusion gene expression vector pGEX-PDT/GR-ΔLBD. PDT/GR-ΔLBD fusion protein was obtained after the expression vector was transformed into E. coli,followed by sequential induction with IPTG,treatment with glutathione-agarose resin and elution with glutathione. SDS-PAGE was performed to determine the expression of PDT/GR-ΔLBD fusion protein,and it which was diluted into a final concentration of 0, 500 and 1000 nmol/L,labeled with fluorescein FITC and co-cultivated with TC- 1 cells for 2 hours,and the <b>penetrativity</b> was observed by fluorescence microscopy. Results The successfully constructed prokaryotic expression vector pPDT/GR-ΔLBD had the capacity of expressing protein,and it was 78. 6 kD in molecular weight,which {{was consistent with the}} theoretical value(80 kD) of the fusion protein PDT/GR-ΔLBD. PDT-GR-ΔLBD,penetrating the nuclear membrane in a concentration-dependent manner,was concentrated within nuclei. Conclusion PDT/GR-ΔLBD fusion protein,with good solubility and cell penetrativity,paves the way for further research on its anti-inflammatory effects...|$|E
