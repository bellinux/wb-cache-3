40|$|Hermeneutics as {{discipline}} {{finds itself}} in troubled waters. This has been caused, inter alia, by a postmodernistic mindset that has exchanged the truth of a retraceable conclusion for the individual’s subjective perception of truth and reality.

25|$|The {{historic}} {{decline in}} union membership over the <b>past</b> <b>half</b> <b>century</b> {{has been accompanied}} by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the AFL-CIO and Change to Win labor federations, as well as the National Education Association, a large, unaffiliated teachers' union. Both the AFL-CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the Employee Free Choice Act. Other important issues for labor unions include supporting industrial policy (including protectionism) that sustains unionized manufacturing jobs, raising the minimum wage and promoting broad social programs such as Social Security and universal health care.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{of general}} {{intelligence}} also remain controversial.

However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the achievement gap in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Numerous recent {{publications}} {{have provided}} {{evidence suggesting that}} increased aerobic exercise for children suffering with ataxic cerebral palsy can improve physiological outcomes. More research is being conducted {{to better understand the}} specific mechanisms that may be responsible for this observation. Over the <b>past</b> <b>half</b> <b>century,</b> a significant amount of research has been focused on the use of stereotaxically placed lesions as a potential treatment method for ataxic cerebral palsy (the method had shown significant improvements in treating Parkinson's disease). Many studies suggested that lesions of the dentate nucleus produced an apparent reduction of symptoms, however the success of these studies did not attain the same level of success that was found when using the method to treat Parkinson’s disease. With the improvement of brain imaging techniques in recent time, it may be possible in the future to utilize these techniques to identify specific sites of imbalance within the brain which could be treated with stereotaxically placed electrodes.|$|E
25|$|During {{their years}} of residence, the Mosers {{collected}} extensive lexical and cultural information, {{much of which}} would be published later in various books and articles. Recorded legends and history were published in the Seri language, and some appear in later collections in English and Spanish. A Seri-Spanish vocabulary book was published in 1961, an ethnobotany (with botanist Richard S. Felger) in 1985 (which has been hailed as a modern classic), and a major dictionary in 2005, thirty years after Edward’s death, but based largely on work that he and Roberto Herrera Marcos (a.k.a. Roberto Herrera Thomson) had done. What is known today about Seri history and culture, including the so-called “band” structure of this group, is the result of work that the Mosers and Herrera did. Even work that does not bear either of their names as authors, such as the article in the journal Science about hibernating sea turtles, the book about the San Esteban people, and the 2005 dictionary, as well as most work on the Seri language and culture during the <b>past</b> <b>half</b> <b>century)</b> is part of their legacy.|$|E
