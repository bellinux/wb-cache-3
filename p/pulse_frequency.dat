25|$|A {{majority}} of women with PCOS have insulin resistance and/or are obese. Their elevated insulin levels contribute to or cause the abnormalities seen in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis that lead to PCOS. Hyperinsulinemia increases GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>frequency,</b> LH over FSH dominance, increased ovarian androgen production, decreased follicular maturation, and decreased SHBG binding. Furthermore, excessive insulin, acting through its cognate receptor {{in the presence of}} component cAMP signalling, upregulates 17α-hydroxylase activity via PI3K, 17α-hydroxylase activity being responsible for synthesising androgen precursors. The combined effects of hyperinsulinemia contribute to an increased risk of PCOS. Insulin resistance is a common finding among women with a normal weight as well as overweight women.|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{investigation into}} a fully pulsed jet has been performed {{with a single}} wire hotwire anemometer operated in a constant temperature mode to study the influences of varying mean exit velocity of the jet and <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> on the velocity field and turbulence quantities. The results of radial profile test across the jet show that the pulsed jet is axisymmetric. The test of jet centerline location demonstrates that the jet follows a straight line trajectory to propagate downstream. From the axial measurements, it is shown that the pulsed jet behaves like a steady jet after the pulsation effects have diminished towards furthest downstream locations, hence the existence of two distinct regions namely the pulsed dominated region and the high turbulence steady jet region is proved. However, {{the existence of the}} two distinct regions is strongly dependent on the mean exit velocity and <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency.</b> At a high mean exit velocity and a low <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency,</b> the high turbulence steady jet region can not be identified displaying no transition region. Moreover, at high mean exit velocities with a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency,</b> the aggregate turbulence intensity decreases more slowly along the downstream positions. Amplifications of the root-mean-square level of centerline-aggregate turbulence associated with an increasing mean exit velocity contribute to this case. At higher <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequencies</b> with a constant mean exit velocity, the aggregate turbulence intensity decreases more rapidly along the downstream positions {{as a result of the}} attenuations of the root-mean-square level of centerline-aggregate turbulence. Skewness and flatness along the downstream positions depart from the symmetry value of 0 and Gaussian value of 3, respectively as the mean exit velocity increases with a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency.</b> At higher <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequencies</b> with a constant mean exit velocity, skewness and flatness become lower in which approach the symmetry value of 0 and Gaussian value of 3, respectively. From the radial measurements, at an increasing <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> with a constant mean exit velocity the radial profile of mean axial velocity becomes narrower. As the mean exit velocity is increased at a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency,</b> narrower radial profiles result. Also, the radial distribution of aggregate turbulence intensity has smaller levels as the <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> is increased at a constant mean exit velocity. As the jet propagates downstream the levels of radial distribution of the aggregate turbulence intensity across the jet reduce gradually. At a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency,</b> amplification of the root-mean-square level of aggregate turbulence occurs as the mean exit velocity is increased which leads to the higher levels of radial distribution of aggregate turbulence intensity. Moreover, the radial profile of relative turbulence energy becomes broader as the <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> is increased at a constant mean exit velocity. However, there is some evidence demonstrating the narrower radial profiles as the <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> increases. As the mean exit velocity is increased at a constant mean exit velocity, a broader radial profile is produced. The levels of triple-products across the jet reduce as the <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> is increased at a constant mean exit velocity but the levels increase as a result of an increasing mean exit velocity at a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency.</b> Skewness and flatness in the radial direction are relatively lower at an increasing <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> with a constant mean exit velocity whereas at an increasing mean exit velocity with a constant <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> their values become higher. Furthermore, the jet volume flow rate relative to that at the jet exit significantly reduces as the Reynolds number increases. The jet growth and normalized volume flow rates are found to be higher than that of steady jets even up to further downstream position associated with the broadening radial profiles of mean axial velocity. At the low mean exit velocity of 13. 7 m/s, the jet growth and jet volume flow rate at the low <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> of 10 Hz are higher than those at the high <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> of 25 Hz. However, as compared with the jet growth and volume flow rate phenomena at the low mean exit velocity of 13. 7 m/s, a striking issue appears at the high mean exit velocity of 34. 4 m/s demonstrating that the jet growth and jet volume flow rate at the low <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> are lower than those at the high <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency...</b>|$|R

The molecular mechanisms by which various patterns of pulsatile GnRH regulate gonadotrope responsiveness remain poorly understood. In contrast to the α and LHβ subunit genes, FSHβ subunit transcription is preferentially stimulated at low rather than high frequencies of pulsatile GnRH. In this study, mutation of a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) within the FSHβ promoter resulted in the loss of preferential GnRH stimulation at low <b>pulse</b> <b>frequencies.</b> We hypothesized that high GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>frequencies</b> might stimulate a transcriptional repressor(s) to attenuate the action of CRE binding protein (CREB) and show that inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) fulfills such a role. ICER was not detected under basal conditions, but pulsatile GnRH stimulated ICER to a greater extent at high than at low <b>pulse</b> <b>frequencies.</b> ICER binds to the FSHβ CRE site to reduce CREB occupation and abrogates both maximal GnRH stimulation and GnRH pulse frequency-dependent effects on FSHβ transcription.

40|$|Quantum dots in GaAs/InGaAs {{structures}} {{have been}} proposed as a candidate system for realizing quantum computing. The short coherence time of the electronic quantum state that arises from coupling to the nuclei of the substrate is dramatically increased if the system is subjected to a magnetic field and to repeated optical pulsing. This enhancement is due to mode locking: Oscillation frequencies resonant with the <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequencies</b> are enhanced, while off-resonant oscillations eventually die out. Because the resonant frequencies {{are determined by the}} <b>pulsing</b> <b>frequency</b> only, the system becomes immune to frequency shifts caused by the nuclear coupling and by slight variations between individual quantum dots.
