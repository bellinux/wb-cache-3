40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationships among cognition, physiological arousal, and subjective anxiety in the ongoing experience of phobic anxiety in panic disorder. Twenty subjects with panic disorder and some degree of agoraphobic avoidance were monitored during exposure to fear-provoking situations. Extent of negativity in reported <b>thoughts</b> (<b>percent</b> negative <b>thoughts)</b> was significantly correlated to mean heart rate and peak subjective anxiety. Reporting of individual negative thoughts was associated {{with high levels of}} subjective anxiety but not heart rate. Data were also analysed in terms of thought sequences. Results indicate that heart rate increased with longer negative thought sequences and that this was in the context of elevated subjective anxiety. Longer sequences of positive thoughts were associated with increasing heart rate but also declining subjective anxiety. The findings were interpreted as providing some support for Barlow 2 ̆ 7 s model of anxiety; however, the data indicate that relationships among cognition, subjective anxiety, and physiological arousal in phobic anxiety are both complex and dynamic...|$|R

Johnson's anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to Vietnam and its effect on him politically was exhibited in a statement to Robert F. Kennedy, who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election. Johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer, and warned Kennedy, [...] "I'll destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months", he shouted. [...] "You'll be dead politically in six months". McNamara offered Johnson a way out of Vietnam in May; the administration could declare its objective in the war—South Vietnam's self-determination—was being achieved and upcoming September elections in South Vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government. The United States could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome. But Johnson was reluctant, in light of some optimistic reports, again of questionable reliability, which matched the negative assessments about the conflict and provided hope of improvement. The CIA was reporting wide food shortages in Hanoi and an unstable power grid, as well as military manpower reductions.|$|E

The report indicated that there was a low risk of service disruptions due to repealing the ban, provided time was provided for proper implementation and training. It included the results of a survey of 115,000 active-duty and reserve service members. Across all service branches, 30 <b>percent</b> <b>thought</b> that integrating gays into the military would have negative consequences. In the Marine Corps and combat specialties, the percentage with that negative assessment ranged from 40 to 60 percent. The CRWG also said that 69 percent of all those surveyed believed they had already worked with a gay or lesbian and of those, 92 percent reported that the impact of that person's presence was positive or neutral. The same day, in response to the CRWG, 30 professors and scholars, most from military institutions, issued a joint statement saying that the CRWG [...] "echoes more than 20 studies, including studies by military researchers, all of which reach the same conclusion: allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly will not harm the military .... We hope that our collective statement underscores that the debate about the evidence is now officially over...."

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} {{knowledge of}} {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) risks factors and coronary intervention in adult students of Karachi East. To calculate the mean knowledge score about CAD risk factors among them. METHODS: A multi center crossectional {{study was conducted in}} Universities and colleges of Karachi East from April-September 2005. Questionnaires were distributed to 200 adult students of different non-medical universities and colleges. The questionnaire contained assessment of knowledge of risk factors on CAD and awareness about coronary angiography. Those belonging to medical colleges and universities were excluded from the study. Knowledge was assessed as a continuous variable. Risk factors for CAD were taken as categorical variables. RESULTS: The mean age of students was 20 yrs +/- 2. 2 years and 62 % were females. The mean score of knowledge about risk factors of CAD was 11. 47 +/- 2. 37. Sixty <b>percent</b> students <b>thought</b> that heart diseases are the number one cause of death in our population. Twenty five percent students graded smoking as the top most risk factor for CAD. Twenty five percent students refused to quit smoking for CAD prevention. Forty eight percent students correctly defined coronary angiography. Eighty five <b>percent</b> students <b>thought</b> that cost is the major hindrance in getting timely treatment. Knowledge of fifty percent students was based on personal and family experience of heart disease. CONCLUSION: Students graded smoking as the topmost risk factor for CAD and cost as the major hindrance in getting timely treatment for heart disease.
