5|$|<b>Pam</b> asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, <b>Pam</b> learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. <b>Pam</b> assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. <b>Pam</b> later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. <b>Pam</b> returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves <b>Pam,</b> and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. <b>Pam</b> comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and <b>Pam.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the party, the {{employees}} vent their hatred of Nellie onto <b>Pam</b> to avoid admitting the truth, making <b>Pam</b> uncomfortable. The magician that was hired (Brett Gelman) arrives, much to Nellie's dismay.

40|$|Porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection in young piglets is frequently associated with secondary infection due to various pathogens, {{especially those of}} the respiratory tract. One {{of the most important}} mechanisms in respiratory diseases is related to the alteration of function of porcine alveolar macrophages (<b>PAMs).</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} determine how PRRS virus infection affects the capabilities of <b>PAMs</b> in the phagocytosis and destruction of Haemophilus parasuis. Phagocytosis percentages were determined in vitro and ex vivo, after collected <b>PAMs</b> were directly exposed to the virus of if <b>PAMs</b> were collected from piglets previously infected with PRRSV. In vitro experiments demonstrated that H. parasuis uptake by <b>PAMs</b> is only increased in the early stages of PRRSV infection (2 h post-infection). In contrast, in the ex vivo experiments it was shown that <b>PAMs</b> from PRRSV-infected piglets do not seem to change in their phagocytic rate until the later stages of infection. Together with a decrease in the phagocytic rate, a marked decrease in the functional ability of <b>PAMs</b> to kill bacteria was observed 7 d post-infection. It is hypothesized that when animals are exposed to PRRSV, there is a marked decrease in the functional ability of <b>PAMs</b> to kill bacteria through the release of superoxide anion, indicating a possible negative effect of the virus, at least at the macrophage level...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} role of {{pulmonary}} alveolar macrophages (<b>PAMs)</b> in phagocytizing Pasteurella hemolytica, we developed an in vitro cultivation method for preparing them. This procedure provided an adherent monolayer of <b>PAMs</b> which were nonspecific esterase-positive and phagocytized latex beads. The phagocytosis and fate of P. hemolytica (biotype A, serotype 1) by <b>PAMs</b> in suspension were studied. The kinetics of phagocytosis were determined by quantitatively measuring the uptake of 24 -h [3 H]thymidine-labeled bacteria by the <b>PAMs</b> {{in the presence of}} opsonins. Results showed that the uptake of P. hemolytica was enhanced in the presence of normal serum or antiserum. A total of 90 % of the bacteria were phagocytized in the presence of normal adult bovine serum, and up to 95 % were phagocytized in the presence of an antiserum. These studies also showed that normal serum, but not fetal calf serum, contained heat-stable natural antibodies which readily initiated the opsonization of P. hemolytica. The heat-labile complement system was also involved in the opsonization. The fate of P. hemolytica inside the <b>PAMs</b> was investigated by transmission electron microscopy and by the viable plate count method. Approximately 90 % of the normal serum- or antiserum-opsonized P. hemolytica were phagocytized by <b>PAMs</b> at a bacteria/PAM ratio of 20 : 1 and were completely degraded after 60 min of exposure. Prolonged incubation of this mixture of bacteria and <b>PAMs</b> resulted in cytotoxic changes and destruction of <b>PAMs.</b> At a low bacteria/PAM ratio (10 : 1 or less), there was phagocytosis and killing of bacteria but no cytotoxic changes on the <b>PAMs.</b> The exact mechanism which initiated this phenomenon was not demonstrated. Perhaps toxic substance(s) released by the excess unphagocytized bacteria caused the cytotoxic changes to the <b>PAMs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Rationale Engraftment and {{survival}} of transplanted stem or stromal {{cells in the}} microenvironment of host tissues may be improved by combining such cells with scaffolds to delay apoptosis and enhance regenerative properties. Aims We examined whether poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) pharmacologically active microcarriers (<b>PAMs)</b> releasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) enhance survival, differentiation, and angiogenesis of adipose tissue-mesenchymal stromal cells (AT-MSCs). We analysed the efficacy of transplanted AT-MSCs conjugated with <b>PAMs</b> in a murine model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods and results We used fibronectin-coated (empty) <b>PAMs</b> or VEGF-releasing <b>PAMs</b> covered with murine AT-MSCs. Twelve-month-old C 57 mice underwent coronary artery ligation to induce AMI, and were randomized into five treatment groups: AMI control (saline 20 μL, n = 7), AMI followed by intramyocardial injection with AT-MSCs (2. 5 × 105 cells/ 20 μL, n = 5), or concentrated medium (CM) from AT-MSCs (20 μL, n = 8), or AT-MSCs (2. 5 × 105 cells/ 20 μL) conjugated with empty <b>PAMs</b> (n = 7), or VEGF-releasing <b>PAMs</b> (n = 8). Sham-operated mice (n = 7) were used as controls. VEGF-releasing <b>PAMs</b> increased proliferation and angiogenic potential of AT-MSCs, but did not impact their osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation. AT-MSCs conjugated with VEGF-releasing <b>PAMs</b> inhibited apoptosis, decreased fibrosis, increased arteriogenesis {{and the number of}} cardiac-resident Ki- 67 positive cells, and improved myocardial fractional shortening compared with AT-MSCs alone when transplanted into the infarcted hearts of C 57 mice. With the exception of fractional shortening, all such effects of AT-MSCs conjugated with VEGF-PAMs were paralleled by the injection of CM. Conclusions AT-MSCs conjugated with VEGF-releasing <b>PAMs</b> exert paracrine effects that may have therapeutic applications...|$|R

50|$|Pneumatic {{artificial}} muscles (<b>PAMs)</b> operate {{by filling}} a pneumatic bladder with pressurized air. Upon applying gas {{pressure to the}} bladder, isotropic volume expansion occurs, but is confined by braided wires that encircle the bladder, translating the volume expansion to a linear contraction along the axis of the actuator. <b>PAMs</b> can be classified by their operation and design; namely, <b>PAMs</b> feature pneumatic or hydraulic operation, overpressure or underpressure operation, braided/netted or embedded membranes and stretching membranes or rearranging membranes. Among {{the most commonly used}} <b>PAMs</b> today is a cylindrically braided muscle known as the McKibben Muscle, which was first developed by J. L. McKibben in the 1950s.|$|R

40|$|Porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome virus (PRRSV) infects mainly the porcine alveolar macrophages (<b>PAMs)</b> and causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). Previous studies have analyzed the global gene expression profiles of lung tissue in vivo and <b>PAMs</b> in vitro following infection with PRRSV, however, transcriptome-wide {{understanding of the}} interaction between highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) and <b>PAMs</b> in vivo has not yet been established. In this study, we employed Affymetrix microarrays to investigate the gene expression patterns of <b>PAMs</b> isolated from Tongcheng piglets (a Chinese indigenous breed) after infection with HP-PRRSV. During the infection, Tongcheng piglets exhibited typical clinical signs, e. g. fever, asthma, coughing, anorexia, lethargy and convulsion, but displayed mild regional lung damage at 5 and 7 dpi. Microarray analysis revealed that HP-PRRSV infection has affected <b>PAMs</b> in expression of the important genes involved in cytoskeleton and exocytosis organization, protein degradation and folding, intracellular calcium and zinc homeostasis. Several potential antiviral strategies might be employed in <b>PAMs,</b> including upregulating IFN-induced genes and increasing intracellular zinc ion concentration. And inhibition of the complement system likely attenuated the lung damage during HP-PRRSV infection. Transcriptomic analysis of <b>PAMs</b> in vivo could lead {{to a better understanding of}} the HP-PRRSV-host interaction, and to the identification of novel antiviral therapies and genetic components of swine tolerance/susceptibility to HP-PRRS. </p...|$|R
