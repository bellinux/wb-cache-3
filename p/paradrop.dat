5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by <b>paradrop).</b> 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E
25|$|The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, who {{had landed}} nearby on Juno Beach, {{isolated}} the station but the Germans defended it for twelve days, awaiting a counter-attack by 21st Panzer Division; {{on one occasion}} it was supplied with food by a nocturnal <b>paradrop</b> mission from Mont-de-Marsan.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of the Bulge, the Luftwaffe {{undertook}} night bombing {{attacks against}} Bastogne. A <b>paradrop</b> and aerial re-supply of German spearheads failed completely. On 1 January 1945 the Luftwaffe undertook a final attack operation known as Operation Baseplate (Unternehmen Bodenplatte) against Allied airfields in the Netherlands and Belgium {{in a bid}} to establish air superiority and eliminate air attacks on the German forces in the Ardennes area.|$|E

5000|$|During World War II he was {{a member}} of Kompani Linge. He led Operation Lapwing, a group of commandos who were <b>paradropped</b> in the {{mountains}} of Haltdalen in 1943 and operated within occupied territory.|$|R
2500|$|Whilst the K-car {{was looking}} for or {{engaging}} the enemy, the operations commander also had to designate a drop zone to drop the Para-stops and direct any strikes by the Lynx. The Drop Zone position was dictated by the enemy's position and the terrain. In the event {{that there was no}} suitable drop zone nearby, Para-stops were dropped {{as close as possible to}} the combat zone and redeployed by the G-cars. <b>Paradrop</b> altitudes normally varied between [...] to 600 feet. Usually the Para-stops dropped as close as possible, which resulted on occasions in the Paratroopers taking fire while in the air, usually to little effect. There was also a great variation on the dropping patterns of these stops, [...] as sometimes they were all dropped at once, sometimes individually, or any combination thereof.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, Milorg {{used this}} hill {{as a site}} for {{parachute}} drops. On 4 October 1942, Milorg's District 13 received its first <b>paradrop</b> here. In the <b>paradrop</b> were four people: Tor Helliesen, Jan Allan, Ruben Larsen and Johannes S. Andersen.|$|E
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of the war, the Soviet Army strongly emphasized the development of airborne forces and their use behind enemy lines. Paradrops were often conducted in multi-regimental strengths, the most notable of these being the Vyaz'ma <b>paradrop</b> in 1942 and the Dnieper-Bukrinsk <b>paradrop</b> in 1943.|$|E
50|$|A combat {{mission was}} planned {{as part of}} the Allied entry in the Netherlands {{in the case of a}} German attack, but the plan was cancelled, and {{eventually}} no combat <b>paradrops</b> took place in 1939-1940.|$|R
50|$|On 15 December 1941, to {{the west}} of Klin one {{battalion}} of the 214th Airborne Brigade (415 personnel) was <b>paradropped</b> to cut the only road at Teryaevo Sloboda and prevent a German retreat to Volokolamsk.|$|R

50|$|He {{participated in}} the Operation Grebe, where six SOE {{soldiers}} were <b>paradropped</b> in Eastern Norway in October 1943. Three of the six men were killed immediately, drowning after landing in a lightly frozen lake. The other three {{made their way to}} Sweden.

If the enemy helicopter can successfully execute a <b>paradrop</b> on it, it will be captured and you will lose your funding, and be unable to purchase military assets {{for a period of}} time. Likewise you can capture the enemy end bunker by <b>paradrop</b> (or a tank followed by infantry) and collect their funds and stop their deployment of military assets for a period of time. Like the pillbox, a successful <b>paradrop</b> must be made directly above the door.|$|E

At Évreux, its mission was changed to support fighter weapons training at Wheelus Air Base Libya with the transport of maintenance personnel, aircraft support equipment, spare parts, tools, test sets and other equipment needed to support the squadrons at the deployed site.|$|R
50|$|The Turkish {{commander}} Mj. Gen. Demirel, {{after leaving}} {{about half the}} Turkish force in Kyrenia to clear the town of Greek forces, ordered {{the rest of the}} force southwards to the direction of Bogaz, in order to unite the beachhead with Gönyeli enclave. At about 17.30 the armoured elements of Bora force united with the Turkish Cypriots and the Turkish paratroopers at Bogaz. At 18.00 Demirel met with 6th Corps' commander, Lt. General Nurettin Ersin, who had been <b>paradropped</b> into Gönyeli enclave.|$|R
50|$|The Potez 650 only {{received}} {{relatively minor}} modifications: Hispano-Suiza 12X liquid-cooled inline engines {{instead of the}} Gnome-Rhône 14K radials, a less sophisticated cabin with accommodation for 14 paratroopers and their equipment (one squad) or 10 wounded (for the medevac role), and a larger door system for bulky loading (transport role). The first <b>paradrop</b> from a Potez 650 occurred on May 1937.|$|E
50|$|The {{seventh and}} final <b>paradrop,</b> {{conducted}} on July 8, was unsuccessful. The parachute {{separated from the}} payload {{at an altitude of}} 1000 feet.

50|$|During the 1920s and 30s, despite {{efforts of}} Soviet Union to pacify the mountainous peoples via {{different}} programmes, such as Korenizatsiya, {{there was still}} low-level criminal secession movements in the highlands. Nazi Germany decided to use this friction in creating a fifth column out of them. In the central Caucasus, these were the Karachay and Balkars who carried out low-level insurgency. Further east, these were the Vainakhs and an existing insurgency by a Khasan Israilov was fuelled by supplies via Nazi <b>paradrops.</b> By autumn 1942, the insurgency diverted significant Red Army resources, including aviation.|$|R
50|$|Poulsson {{returned}} to Norway in 1944, participating in Operation Sunshine led by major Leif Tronstad. Nine SOE agents, among them several from the heavy water sabotage team, were <b>paradropped</b> over Ugleflott in Øvre Telemark 5 October 1944. Their {{mission was to}} establish fighting groups at Rjukan, Notodden and Nore. Poulsson, along with Claus Helberg as wireless operator, {{was responsible for the}} Rjukan section. In the mountains surrounding Rjukan a military force consisting of 300 soldiers was built up, and the troops were supplied with provisions and weapons from allied aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Łupaszko's unit {{fought against}} the German army and SS units {{in the area of}} {{southern}} Wilno Voivodeship, but was also frequently attacked by the Soviet Partisans <b>paradropped</b> in the area by the Red Army. In April 1944, Zygmunt Szendzielarz was arrested by the Lithuanian police and handed over to the Gestapo. Łupaszko was free in the same month under circumstances that remain unclear. In reprisal actions his brigade captured several dozen German officials and sent several threatening letters to Gestapo but it remains unknown if and how these contributed to his release.|$|R
