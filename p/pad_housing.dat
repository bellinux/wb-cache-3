50|$|The Carlsbad High School Campus {{was opened}} in 1962, with the {{conversion}} of the previous high school into what is present-day Carlsbad Intermediate School. Carlsbad High School consists of nine buildings scattered across a large campus. The Main Building is a three-story building with an interior atrium opening to the northeast. Also on campus are the Freshman Academy (where classes for most freshmen are held), the Science Building, the <b>PAD</b> (<b>housing</b> the History and Math departments), the cafeteria (also housing the theatre department), the Gym Complex (including a public-access natatorium), the Performing Arts Center (containing the band, choir, dance, and cheerleading programs), the Arts and Crafts building, and the Building Trades Center. CHS is the largest high school campus in the state of New Mexico, and {{one of the largest in}} the country.|$|E
5000|$|The scheming {{hermit crab}} of the strip. He is rude, abrasive, insulting, stingy, and a {{borderline}} criminal. Hawthorne, unlike other hermit crabs, prefers a beer can {{rather than a}} seashell. His interests include scamming {{the other members of}} the strip out of money or resources, cracking jokes and insults, and pinching hairless beach apes (and Sherman). A recurring storyline is Hawthorne's many get-rich-quick schemes and business ventures, usually tailored to rip his friends off. Some of his businesses have included a general store, a photo lab, an airline, a bank, a nuclear power plant, and a casino. His businesses usually flop, either due to bankruptcy, his own incompetence, or his losing interest in his own scheme. His ownership of the local newspaper, the Lagoon Tribune, appears to be the only business he has been able to manage through the course of the strip. He is also the Lagoon's mayor from time to time. More recent strips imply that he's been in jail. Other ventures of his included using steroids on an oyster to get him to produce a pearl a day (eventually, Megan, not knowing that the oyster was Hawthorne's, took it to make a Martha Stewart-style oyster provencalê for dinner). In earlier strips, Hawthorne would shed his shell once a year and simply strut around naked (nothing but his rear-end is seen). He also enjoyed mooning scuba divers and his friends and running around singing [...] "I feel pretty! Oh, so pretty!" [...] However, recently it seems that he has removed his can for good and walks around in the buff, and his friends don't show the disgust they did in earlier comics. His crab hole has been portrayed several different ways. Early on in the strip it was shown as a posh cave mansion with chandeliers, rugs, china cabinets, and luxurious furniture. Recently, it has been portrayed as the typical bachelor <b>pad,</b> <b>housing</b> a beat-up couch and socks and pizza crusts that move on their own. Although little is known about his past, he once revealed to Thornton that he was born in Las Vegas. He hates Windows computers, and therefore Bill Gates as well, once taking great pleasure in pinching his toes.|$|E

It is observed that first five mode shapes of the individual draft pad are dominating the behaviour of each draft pad in the draft gear for all 15 mode shapes of the draft gear. This is because the draft <b>pads</b> <b>housed</b> in the draft gear have their own individual behaviour which cumulatively results in different mode shapes of the draft gear.

40|$|Concerns about nitrates {{in private}} {{drinking}} water supplies {{in the older}} poultry growing areas of Arkansas prompted soil and water testing in the early 19902 ̆ 7 s. Exposed poultry <b>house</b> <b>pads</b> were recognized as a potential source of nitrates in the groundwater. Soils beneath nine different poultry <b>house</b> <b>pads</b> in five counties were sampled in 10 - 30 cm increments to bedrock or to a maximum sampling depth of 90 cm. The nine sites {{had been exposed to}} natural weathering conditions ranging from never to for more than 20 years. Routine soil tests were conducted by the University of Arkansas Soil Testing Lab at Marianna according to standard methods (Mehlich III extractant). The relatively immobile elements P, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn were mainly concentrated in {{the upper part of the}} soil profiles (0 - 30 cm). The more leachable NO 3 -N, K, and SO 4 -S were generally found throughout the soil profile. Sodium was found in high concentrations throughout the soil profile at two sites.

However, there are few evaluations of these programs, especially following natural disasters. Methods: Data provided by Samaritan’s Purse Canada’s WASH program were examined. The data set included a household (N= 1198) and a latrine (N= 167) survey that recorded household use of laundry <b>pads,</b> bath <b>houses,</b> hand-pumped drilled wells, health and hygiene education sessions, and latrines as well as demographic data. Data analysis was conducted in IBM SPSS Version 20. 0. Descriptive statistics were computed, and statistical relationships were analyzed for 1.)

Household diarrheal disease and program interventions Results: This study found that households attending any of four health and hygiene sessions {{were significantly more likely}} to use program-provided bath houses and hand-pumped wells (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Attendance was also significantly associated with increased knowledge of diarrheal disease prevention and hand washing technique.

40|$|LecturePg. 85 - 96 The {{objective}} of this work is to minimize the maximum bearing temperatures under severe operating conditions in speed increasing and reduction gearboxes, and to present experimental data to validate the theoretical assumptions. The test machine, the experimental results, and the comparison between theoretical thermoelastohydrodynamic results and experimental data are presented. The test bearings are located in two speed increasing and reduction gearboxes (back-to-hack test bed). The high speed shaft bearings are five shoe tilting-pad journal bearings. They are 160 mm in diameter and the bearing ratio (L/D) is equal to 1. 0. The rotational speed varies from 2700 rpm (22 m/s) to 11, 880 rpm (100 m/s). The applied load is up to 88 kN. Three types of bearings permit analyzing {{the influence of the}} bearing design and the pivot position on the pad. The low speed rotor bearings are offset-halves journal bearings. They are 230 mm in diameter and the bearing ratio is equal to 0. 75. The rotational speed varies from 765 rpm (9. 0 m/s) to 3366 rpm (40 m/s). The applied load is up to 100 kN. The influence of the load direction and of the oil feeding temperature is studied. For each test, bearings, temperatures (film/pad interface, oil, <b>pad</b> and <b>housing),</b> power losses and oil flow are measured. Shifting the pivot from the central position to at least the 55 percent position leads to a decrease of the maximum temperature.
