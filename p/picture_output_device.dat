For these purposes, a special format for the transfer of raster pictures has been developed which is independent of differences in pixel resolution, color resolution, color primaries, number of color per device and scan direction. For its use in the networks and on tapes, the file format has to initially have a character encoding to prevent any collision of pixel or image data with control sequences of terminal servers, network controllers and other hardware devices. Binary encodings are still to be developed; the format is open for different data compressions and other data encodings according to different application profiles. FTCRP means File for the Transfer of Colored Raster Pictures. FTCRP has been coined by several previous documents, implementation experiences and workshops during the past two years. The file format FTCRP meets the lack of a file concept of very high functionality and integrative power in the computer graphics, especially in the so-called "electronic imaging" community. The authors of FTCRP are concerned about different image storage and interchange formats in both the electronic imaging and the printing industry...|$|R

The format is called FTCRP - File for the Transfer of Colored Raster Pictures. Historically, a Version 0 of FTCRP was first developed. Several insights were gained in the implementation of FTCRP driver programs and in the acceptance of the new format. Here, we present the conception of Version 1 of FTCRP, which is an extension and an enchancement of the former version. Unfortunately, the syntax of FTCRP Version 1 was not definitivly determined before the submission of this text. Therefore we concentrate on conceptual considerations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As {{color gamut}} of digital <b>output</b> <b>device</b> greatly affects image appearance, {{accurate}} and effective gamut description for <b>output</b> <b>device</b> is intensively required for developing high-quality image reproduction technique based on gamut mapping. In this paper, {{we present a}} novel method to determine color gamut of <b>output</b> <b>device</b> by using a specific 3 D reconstruction technology and device ICC profile. First, we populate the device color space by uniform sampling in the RGB 3 -Dimensional space, and convert these sampling points to CMYK color space. Then, we work out the CIE LAB value of these points according to the ICC profile of <b>output</b> <b>device.</b> At last, in CIE LAB color space the boundary of these points is determined by using a gamut boundary descriptor based on Ball-Pivoting Algorithm (BPA) proposed by Bernardini. Compared with the results generated by ICC 3 D, our proposed method can compute device gamut more efficiently {{and at the same}} time give a more accurate gamut description of the <b>output</b> <b>device.</b> It will be help to develop effective gamut mapping algorithms for color reproduction...|$|R

50|$|Impedance {{variations}} of the load with frequency translate into variation in the phase relationship between the amplifier's voltage and current outputs. For a resistive load, usually (but not always) the voltage across the amplifier's <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> is maximum when the load current is minimum (and the voltage is minimum across the load) and vice versa, {{and as a result}} the power dissipation in those devices is least. But due to the complex and variable nature of the driver/crossover load and its effect on the phase relationship between the voltage and current, the current will not necessarily be at its minimum when the voltage across the <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> is maximum - this results in increased power dissipation in the amplifier output stage which manifests as heating in the <b>output</b> <b>devices.</b> The phase angle varies most near resonance in moving coil loudspeakers. If this point is not taken into consideration during the amplifier design, the amplifier may overheat causing it to shut down, or cause failure of the <b>output</b> <b>devices.</b> See Power factor for more detail.|$|R
50|$|The {{final stage}} of amplification, after preamplifiers, is the output stage, where the highest demands are placed on the {{transistors}} or tubes. For this reason, the design choices made around the <b>output</b> <b>device</b> (for single-ended <b>output</b> stages, such as in single-ended triode amplifiers) or <b>devices</b> (for push-pull <b>output</b> stages), such as the Class of operation of the <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> is often taken as {{the description of the}} whole power amplifier. For example, a Class B amplifier will probably have just the high power <b>output</b> <b>devices</b> operating cut off for half of each cycle, while the other devices (such as differential amplifier, voltage amplifier and possibly even driver transistors) operate in Class A. In a transformerless <b>output</b> stage, the <b>devices</b> are essentially in series with the power supply and output load (such as a loudspeaker), possibly via some large capacitor and/or small resistances.|$|R
