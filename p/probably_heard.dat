25|$|There is {{a report}} that Ives also won the admiration of Gustav Mahler, {{who said that he}} was a true musical revolutionary. Reportedly, Mahler talked of premiering Ives' Third Symphony with the New York Philharmonic, but he soon died (in 1911) thus {{preventing}} the premiere. However, the source of this story is Ives himself; since Mahler died, {{there was no way to}} verify whether he had seen the score of the symphony or decided to perform it in the 1911–12 season. Nonetheless, it is known that Ives regularly attended New York Philharmonic concerts and <b>probably</b> <b>heard</b> Mahler conduct the Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
