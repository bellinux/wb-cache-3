Through analyzing the features of the logging data in low-resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones,</b> a fast model for identification of low-resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones</b> was developed in this paper.

30|$|In {{conventional}} formations, the resistivity {{ratio of}} oil layer to water layer is usually higher than 3. While in some unconventional formations, this ratio {{can be less}} than 2; such formations are usually defined as low-resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones.</b> With the development in exploration of subtle reservoirs, low-resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones</b> with considerable reserves {{have been found in}} various oil fields all over the world (Oyang 2009; Boyd et al. 1995). A great deal of attention is attached to such reserves. However, the capability in identifying low-resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones</b> is still very limited due to the unconventional characteristics of logging response in such zones (Poerboyo and Suharya 2014). Therefore, quick and accurate identification of low-resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones</b> using advanced mathematics method is significantly important.|$|R

Due to the variation of these factors, not all wells {{could be a good}} choice for separate layer fracturing. Hence, it is necessary to study the fracture configuration under different geological circumstances so that the simulation results can provide theoretical guidance for selecting candidate wells.|$|R

30|$|The {{conductivity}} of formation {{water is}} much higher than that of hydrocarbons. By analyzing the resistivity, conventional hydrocarbon zones can be accurately identified and quantitatively evaluated using existing theoretical and/or empirical models (Yong and Zhang 2002). However, the electrical characteristics of low-resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones</b> are far less apparent compared with conventional formations. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the causes of low-resistivity response and its associated logging characteristics is necessary for identifying low-resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones.</b> It {{should be pointed out that}} although some new techniques, e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, can accurately recognize low-resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones</b> (Guru et al. 2005; Murphy and Owens 1972), the main objective of the model presented in this paper is to improve utilization of the commonly available traditional logging data. The most common logging data include spontaneous potential (SP), gamma ray (GR), dual lateral resistivity (LLD and LLS), compensated neutron porosity (CNL), compensated formation density (FDC) and acoustic log (AC). Causes of low-resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones</b> and their associated logging characteristics will be discussed in the following.|$|R

In the present study, the wavelet transformation technique was applied to the well-log data of three wells in the Bombay High oil field, India, in order to identify depths to the tops of oil and/or gas formation <b>zones</b> (<b>pay</b> <b>zones).</b> Continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) was performed on gamma-ray, resistivity, neutron porosity and velocity log data sets {{in order to determine the}} space-localization of the oil and/or gas formation zones. The choice of a mother wavelet is important and largely depends on the data under investigation. We have applied a variety of wavelets to the different log data sets to not only identify the depths to the tops of formation zones, but also to determine the optimum wavelet that best characterizes the <b>pay</b> <b>zones.</b> On examination of scalogram plots of each log corresponding to each wavelet for their better resolution in identifying the formation boundaries, we have found that the scalograms corresponding to the Gaus 1 wavelet appeared to give the best resolution in identifying the depths of <b>pay</b> <b>zones</b> in all the well-log data sets of all three wells. To further validate the above observation, a histogram analysis of CWT coefficients is made.

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons for low {{resistivity}} <b>pay</b> <b>zones.</b> It is of crucial importance to know {{the origin of this}} phenomenon. The problem with these zones is that the resistivity data interpretation indicates high water saturation, but oil or even dry oil will be produced. This paper discusses the different reasons sandstone reservoirs can have low resistivity. Clean bearing sandstone has high resistivity, but when this rock contains shale, or heavy minerals such as pyrite, the resistivity can become low. This resistivity change depends on the nature, the volume of clay and heavy minerals. Pyrite shows a good electrical conductivity, that is usually comparable to or even higher than the conductivity of formation water, and can therefore have a larger effect than shale. Low resistivity <b>pay</b> <b>zones</b> are not necessarily shaly sand problems. In this study, different shaly sand models will be discussed, to propose a suitable shale sand model. Field examples were analysed using different shaly sand models. It has been found that the modified total shale sand model gives good results. In the case of low shale volumes, the normal saturation equation might give acceptable water saturation values. King Saud Universit...|$|R

NPY values using stipulated Oil price, CAPE) (, OPEX, tax rate, royalty and production rates were estimated, which was used afterwards to produce the Proxy model in ED and this developed correlation was used to analyse the effect of time changes. NPY computed from the Proxy Model was reasonable; however, a higher level D-Optimal design as against the 2 -level design used in this study may be required for a reasonable match ofNPY with respect to sidetrack (recompletion) time. In conclusion, the incorporation of time was successful and gives way to studying the impact of not only reservoir uncertainties but the uncertainty that arises from a success or failure of the sidetrack that further gives way to the application of decision analysis and the evaluation ofNPY by Proxy Models for each possible outcome...|$|R
