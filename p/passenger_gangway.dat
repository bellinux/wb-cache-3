60|$|Fortune favored {{them during}} the next week, for Bethune secured a post as hotel clerk, and Moran went inland to assist in {{repairing}} a railroad track which a snowslide had wrecked. Soon afterward Jimmy shipped as deck-hand on a Sound steamboat and was lucky in attracting the attention {{of one of the}} directors who was on board by the cool promptness with which he prevented an accident when a <b>passenger</b> <b>gangway</b> broke. The director had a talk with him, and, learning that he was a steamship officer, placed him in charge of a gasolene launch which picked up passengers at unimportant landings and took them off to the boats. The work was easy, and paid fairly well; and Jimmy had held his post for a month with some satisfaction when he went off to meet a north-bound steamer at dusk one evening.|$|E
50|$|On March 5, 2009, {{high winds}} snapped the forward mooring lines of MSC Fantasia {{while she was}} docked in Spain. The bow drifted away from the dock side and caused a <b>passenger</b> <b>gangway</b> to {{collapse}} into the water. One passenger and three crew members had to be rescued from the sea. One passenger was taken to hospital with head injuries, while the other three were treated for hypothermia.When she was sailing into Naples on April 5, 2012, she hit {{the wall of the}} dock, nobody was hurt, but she had a small dent on her stern area where she hit.|$|E
50|$|Chicora {{went missing}} on Lake Michigan January 1895 with a cargo of flour. Portions of {{wreckage}} of the missing vessel-consisting of the Port side and forward upper bulwarks 5 ft wide and 12 ft long along with the <b>passenger</b> <b>gangway</b> were found a mile on the ice near South Haven, Michigan. Pieces of wreckage are also reported to have been found. In April 1895 it was reported wreckage was coming ashore at New Buffalo, Michigan. On 19 April 1895 a witness claimed to have seen the Chicora stern down and bow up in the lake between South Haven and Saugatuck, Michigan, on 23 January 1895.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} lanes to port and two to {{starboard}} {{of the central}} casing. A hydraulically operated mezzanine deck along each side can be raised or lowered according to traffic requirements. Two stairways from the car deck bring passengers out in the entrance square on deck 4, where the <b>passenger</b> <b>gangways</b> enter.|$|R
50|$|The pier was {{constructed}} between 1912 and 1915 by the Melbourne Harbour Trust {{to supplement the}} adjacent Station Pier (originally the 'Railway Pier'). From completion in 1915 until 1969 {{it was also a}} major arrival point for new migrants, particularly during the post-war period. In addition to a pier, there was a gatehouse and barriers, terminal building, amenities rooms, goods lockers, ablution blocks, railway sidings and <b>passenger</b> <b>gangways.</b>|$|R
50|$|Access to the Zeppelin was {{achieved}} {{in a number}} of ways. The Graf Zeppelin's gondola was accessed while the vessel was on the ground, via gangways. The Hindenburg also had <b>passenger</b> <b>gangways</b> that led from the ground directly into its hull and which could then be withdrawn entirely as well as ground access to the gondola and an exterior access hatch via its electrical room which was intended for crew use only.|$|R
50|$|To start with, all but tall drivers {{liked the}} Lowlander, {{because it was}} more {{powerful}} than the buses it replaced and unlike the vacuum-braked Titan, stopping within a safe distance was a certainty rather than a hope. For conductors, although it was better than a side-gangway design, it was worse than the contemporary flat-floor Lodekka as the <b>passenger</b> <b>gangway</b> on the lower deck was narrow and deeply sunken, with odd excrescences to catch unpractised feet: also unlike the Eastern Coach Works body designed to integrate with the FLF there was not an easy refuge area to stand-in to allow passengers on and off at stops.|$|E
50|$|The {{point of}} its design and {{introduction}} was {{to end the}} uncomfortable and inconvenient Lowbridge double-deck bus layout, replacing it by lowering the chassis frame and integrating it with the body, and fitting a drop-centre rear axle, so {{that there were no}} steps from the rear entrance platform {{to the front of the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>gangway,</b> itself sunk about 10 cm (6 inches) below the seating platforms on the LDX, LD and first five LDLs. A full flat floor was developed on the last LDL, then used on the LDS and the F series Lodekkas. Bristol Commercial Vehicles, Eastern Coach Works and some of their employees obtained a number of patents relating to the design.|$|E
5000|$|The {{frame was}} {{slightly}} wider {{than that of}} the longest MR7L Claymore but the wheelbase was identical and the radiator was mounted in an inclined position above the front axle, to obviate intrusion into the <b>passenger</b> <b>gangway.</b> Wider and longer springs were fitted and the axles were of wider tack, suitable for 8 ft wide bodies. Like the MR 5 and 7 Claymore the 3.83-litre EN219 developing [...] at 2200 rpm drove through an Albion single-plate hydraulically assisted clutch and Albion four-speed constant-mesh gearbox, with synchromesh on third and top, to an Albion overhead worm rear axle, the Nimbus rear axle was heavier-duty {{than that of the}} heaviest Claymore and had larger brakes. Braking was provided by two-leading-shoe drum brakes all round, hydraulically actuated with vacuum assistance from an Albion-patented engine bypass valve. The engine had an oil-bath air-cleaner and a centrifugal oil filter. Automatic chassis lubrication was standard.|$|E
5000|$|The {{specifications}} in {{the franchise}} agreement required a train [...] "similar in type to the Class 175/180 or Class 220", {{but with a}} 1/3-2/3 door arrangement, and top speed of 100 mph. Also specified was air conditioning, two toilets per vehicle with one suitable for reduced mobility <b>passengers,</b> <b>gangways</b> between individual carriages, luggage and bicycle storage space, passenger compartment CCTV, provision for wheelchair passengers, and first-class seating. Additionally the train's acceleration was to be an improvement on the Class 158 and comparable to the Class 180. The agreement specified 168 carriages, with an initial option to reduce the carriage order by 18.|$|R
60|$|The convicts {{who were}} on deck looked over the bulwarks, and cracked coarse jokes among themselves, as the <b>passengers</b> ascended the <b>gangway.</b> Reuben found that only one-third of the number were allowed on deck at once. Two {{soldiers}} paced {{up and down the}} deck, on guard of the hatchway leading below, and two sentries were posted at other points.|$|R
60|$|The Bisse of Leysin is one {{of those}} {{artificial}} water-courses which bring water from some distant source to pastures that have an insufficient or uncertain supply. It is a little better known than most because of a certain exceptional boldness in its construction; for a distance of a few score yards it runs supported by iron staples across the front of a sheer precipice, and for perhaps half a mile it hangs like an eyebrow over nearly or quite vertical walls of pine-set rock. Beside it, on the outer side of it, runs a path, which becomes an offhand gangway of planking at the overhanging places. At one corner, which gives the favourite picture postcard from Montana, the rocks project so sharply above the water that the <b>passenger</b> on the <b>gangway</b> must crouch down upon the bending plank as he walks. There is no hand-hold at all.|$|R
5000|$|The units {{incorporate}} {{a number of}} innovations, including a walk-in shop {{in place of the}} traditional buffet/restaurant car, and extensive passenger visual information systems {{on the inside of the}} car ends and on the outside of the doors. Following criticisms of the pressure- operated automatic gangway doors of the older Mark 3 and Mark 4 carriages (which could easily be held open by items of luggage resting on the floor sensor, allowing draughts into the <b>passenger</b> saloon) the <b>gangway</b> doors on the 390 sets are of the push-button [...] "open on demand" [...] type. All seats originally had an on-board entertainment system with a number of pre-recorded music channels. This feature was disabled in March 2010 to make way for new on-board WiFi provided by T-Mobile. Each seating row has a dot-matrix LCD display to indicate the reservation status of each seat, removing the need for conventional printed labels inserted manually by train crew.|$|R
6000|$|Happily, {{the party}} {{collected}} in the Montauk {{had the good fortune}} to abridge the usual probation in courtesies, by the stirring events of the night on which they sailed. Two hours had scarcely elapsed since the last <b>passenger</b> crossed the <b>gangway,</b> and yet the respective circles of the quarter-deck and steerage felt more sympathy with each other than the boasted human charities ordinarily quicken in days of common-place intercourse. They had already found out each other's names, thanks to the assiduity of Captain Truck, who had stolen time, in the midst of all his activity, to make half-a-dozen more introductions, and the Americans of the less trained class were already using them as freely as if they were old acquaintances. We say Americans, for the cabins of these ships usually contain a congress of nations, though the people of England, and of her ci-devant colonies, of course predominate in those of the London lines. On the present occasion, the last two were nearly balanced in numbers, so far as national character could be made out; opinion (which, as might be expected, had been busy the while,) being suspended in reference to Mr. Blunt, and one or two others whom the captain called [...] "foreigners," [...] to distinguish them from the Anglo-Saxon stock.|$|R
