40|$|Throughout history faith based organisations (FBOs) {{have played}} an {{important}} role in delivering welfare provision. They were often the original founders of much of the welfare we see now, however, the establishment of the Welfare State in 1945 encouraged centralised delivery of welfare provision and FBOs were seen to withdraw. A re-emergence of delivery of welfare by FBOs has been observed in the last three decades since the most recent British Government’s austerity measures prompted ‘Big Society’, encouraging a shift of responsibility from central government back to local communities. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of FBOs in delivering voluntary and community sector (VCS) activities in Cornwall, seeking to understand the value FBOs bring to their communities and the benefits they present. It is then possible to identify the distinctiveness of FBOs, and furthermore, to draw implications to develop a clear understanding of their activity and motivation. The research was conducted using a mixed methods approach consisting of a county-wide survey of FBOs, the first of its kind, and semi-structured interviews with key individuals associated with the work of FBOs from four different perspectives; faith group leaders, volunteer project coordinators, service users and VCS consultants. This study focussing on Cornwall in South West England provides important new insights from service providers and service users demonstrating that FBOs make a significant economic contribution to the county through the average value of volunteer hours, which can be estimated to be in excess of £ 20 million. The average volunteer profile was found to be 50 - 69 years old, volunteers up to 2 hours per week and is a member of a FBO. Furthermore, it is estimated that 19 % of the population in Cornwall use activities delivered by FBOs weekly. To extend the research further, a national mapping exercise to include all faiths would provide further insights on a larger scale for comparison. Finally, studies into barriers to sustainability of FBOs and how to address them would be encouraged. Combined Universities in Cornwall Research <b>Programme,</b> <b>Transformation</b> Cornwal...|$|E

This article uses a realist evaluation of financial incentives in English hospital discharge policy to illustrate how previous evaluations of the same programme theory were inspected for evidence to construct context, mechanisms and outcomes.

This identified other mechanisms contemporaneous to the fines which are more or as likely to reduce delays.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} quality of {{financial}} reporting in Government Linked Companies (GLCs) {{and the effect of}} GLC’s <b>transformation</b> <b>programme</b> on the timeliness of accounting earnings in the Malaysian Market. This paper also compares the timeliness of earnings between the GLCs and Non-GLCs. This paper follows the model of Ball (2003) and estimates a linear pooled regression of accounting income on change in market value of equity during the period of 2004 to 2009. The method facilitates the determination of the timeliness of the accounting record to reflect economic gains or losses. The analysis shows that {{the quality of}} income in GLCs is higher than Non-GLCs. The results reveal that incremental economic losses sensitivity is more before the <b>transformation</b> <b>programme</b> compared to periods after the <b>transformation</b> <b>programme</b> and that economic gains recognition improves post year 2006 in GLCs. While there is an overall decline in the timeliness of losses recognition (in both GLC and Non-GLC groups), there is some improvement in the recognition of economic gains post year 2006. The results presented may be attributed to some <b>transformation</b> <b>programmes</b> implemented in GLCs and Non-GLCs. It is also acknowledged that the results could also be affected by the new IFRS implementation in year 2006. Yearly analysis reveals that there is no consistency in the effect of incremental economic losses sensitivity, which requires specific investigation into the incentives and specific forms of decisions in the future. While prior studies look at the timeliness of economic gains or losses recognition across countries, this paperattempts to investigate the issue of quality financial reporting in GLCs and how the implementation of the government <b>transformation</b> <b>programme</b> is able to {{have a significant impact on}} financial reporting in GLCs...|$|R

50|$|Development of the PIPC is an {{important}} component of Malaysia's Economic <b>Transformation</b> <b>Programme</b> (ETP). The ETP was launched on 25 September 2010, formulated as part of Malaysia's National <b>Transformation</b> <b>Programme.</b> Its goal is to elevate the country to developed nation status by 2020, targeting GNI per capita of US$15,000. This will be achieved by attracting US$444 billion in investments which will, in turn, create 3.3 million new jobs. The focus on oil and gas projects, arising from the Economic <b>Transformation</b> <b>Programme,</b> will create a more dynamic and progressive oil and gas industry in Malaysia. Malaysian companies will be able to work with local and foreign investors to invest in new technologies, new products, as well as create countless job opportunities as several of these petrochemical projects take off in the near future.The ETP's targets for the year 2020 will be achieved through the implementation of 12 National Key Economic Areas (NKEAs), representing economic sectors which account for significant contributions to GNI. The programme is also centred on raising Malaysia's competitiveness through the implementation of six Strategic Reform Initiatives (SRIs). The SRIs comprise policies which strengthen the country's commercial environment to ensure Malaysian companies are globally competitive.|$|R
40|$|Voluntary {{turnover}} for IT professionals {{continues to}} be a key issue for industry locally and globally. The information technology industry is experiencing a diminishing pool of IT professionals, which is mainly due to the fast growing technology markets, which have resulted in a growing gap between the demand and availability of IT professionals. Major organizations continue to invest in new technologies therefore require skilled resources to implement these application solution in the form of IT <b>Transformation</b> <b>Programmes.</b> The IT professionals are important to the successful implementation of these programmes. The high turnover in IT skills tends to have a huge impact on these particular projects. This research seeks to establish the factors which lead to premature turnover of IT professionals on IT <b>Transformation</b> <b>programmes,</b> with a specific focus on the impact of pull and push factors. Further to this, the study seeks to understand and explore the influence of shocks on scripted turnover decisions of IT professionals in IT <b>Transformation</b> <b>programmes.</b> The study found vast differences in factors that lead to turnover intention for IT professionals in IT <b>Transformation</b> <b>Programmes.</b> The differences could be explained by different dynamics of the requirements or characteristics of the career itself, labour market and demographic factors of the individuals involved. This usually leads to IT professionals leaving projects prematurely. The results showed that none of the shows that none of the respondents left the programme after it ended. Pull factors accounted for more turnover decisions as opposed to Push factors for IT professionals.
