The process {{capable of a}} simultaneous fabrication of up to 64 pieces has been developed and successfully tested as a necessary step towards a planned production capacity of several <b>thousand</b> <b>pieces</b> a <b>year.</b> Diameters of the levitation disks varied from 14 mm to 56 mm. Main {{attention was paid to}} levitation disks of 28 mm in diameter. This dimension occurs to be the best compromise from various points of view: the material homogeneity, pellet quality, production loss, processing time etc. Properties of the disks, such as levitation force, critical current density at different temperatures, trapped magnetic field, etc. are shown and discussed...|$|R

It was established that the first planting period (June 10) of test tubes and seedlings was optimal. The overall survival rate averaged 82. 0 %. The early planting period promoted an increase in the reproduction rate to 4. 8 tubers from the bush. The yield of minitubers was 326. 5 <b>thousand</b> <b>pieces</b> / ha.

The number of minitubers increased to 347. 1 <b>thousand</b> <b>pieces</b> / ha. The use of agrotechnological methods that allow rooting of plants before planting into the soil allowed to increase the plant survival rate up to 71. 2 %, the density of plants standing up to 73. 2 <b>thousand</b> <b>pieces</b> / ha, the breeding multiplication factor increased to 4. 9 pieces. club. / bush.
