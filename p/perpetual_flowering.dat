40|$|International audienceThe {{genetic control}} of the switch between {{seasonal}} and <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> has been deciphered in various perennial species. However, {{little is known about}} the genetic {{control of the}} dynamics of <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering,</b> which changes abruptly at well-defined time instants during the growing season. Here, we characterize the <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> pattern and identify new genetic controls of this pattern in the cultivated strawberry. Twenty-one <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> strawberry genotypes were phenotyped at the macroscopic scale for their course of emergence of inflorescences and stolons during the growing season. A longitudinal analysis based on the segmentation of flowering rate profiles using multiple change-point models was conducted. The flowering pattern of <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> genotypes takes the form of three or four successive phases: an autumn-initiated flowering phase, a flowering pause, and a single stationary <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> phase or two <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> phases, the second one being more intense. The genetic control of flowering was analysed by quantitative trait locus mapping of flowering traits based on these flowering phases. We showed that the occurrence of a fourth phase of intense flowering is controlled by a newly identified locus, different from the locus FaPFRU, controlling the switch between seasonal and <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> behaviour. The role of this locus was validated by the analysis of data obtained previously during six consecutive years...|$|E

40|$|Photoperiodic {{flowering}} {{has been}} extensively studied in the annual short-day and long-day plants rice and Arabidopsis while less {{is known about the}} control of flowering in perennials. In the perennial wild strawberry, Fragaria vesca L. (Rosaceae), short-day and <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> long-day accessions occur. Genetic analyses showed that differences in their flowering responses are caused by a single gene, the SEASONAL FLOWERING LOCUS which may encode the F. vesca homolog of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (FvTFL 1). We show through high-resolution mapping and transgenic approaches that FvTFL 1 is the basis of this change in flowering behavior and demonstrate that FvTFL 1 acts as a photoperiodically regulated repressor. In short-day F. vesca, long photoperiods activate FvTFL 1 mRNA expression and short days suppress it, promoting flower induction. These seasonal cycles in FvTFL 1 mRNA level confer seasonal cycling of vegetative and reproductive development. Mutations in FvTFL 1 prevent LD suppression of flowering, and the early flowering that then occurs under LD is dependent on the F. vesca homolog of FLOWERING LOCUS T. This photoperiodic response mechanism differs from those described in model annual plants. We suggest that this mechanism controls flowering within the perennial growth cycle in F. vesca, and demonstrate that a change in a single gene reverses the photoperiodic requirements for flowering...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} daylength and {{temperature}} on flowering of the cultivated octoploid strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) {{have been studied}} extensively at the physiological level, but information on the molecular pathways controlling flowering in the species is scarce. The flowering pathway has been studied {{at the molecular level}} in the diploid short-day woodland strawberry (F. vesca L.), in which the FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (FvFT 1) –SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (FvSOC 1) –TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (FvTFL 1) pathway is essential for the correct timing of flowering. In this work, we show by transgenic approach that the silencing of the floral repressor FaTFL 1 in the octoploid short-day cultivar ‘Elsanta’ is sufficient to induce <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> under long days without direct changes in vegetative reproduction. We also demonstrate that although the genes FaFT 1 and FaSOC 1 show similar expression patterns in different cultivars, the regulation of FaTFL 1 varies widely from cultivar to cultivar and is correlated with floral induction, indicating that the transcription of FaTFL 1 occurs at least partially independently of the FaFT 1 –FaSOC 1 module. Our results indicate that changing the expression patterns of FaTFL 1 through biotechnological or conventional breeding approaches could result in strawberries with specific flowering and runnering characteristics including new types of everbearing cultivars...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Strawberry is {{economically}} {{the most}} important berry crop grown worldwide and breeders are continuously striving to develop improved cultivars. So far, marker assisted breeding (MAB) in strawberry has been limited to the private sector. However, loci controlling some traits of economic importance such as <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> (PF) and soluble solids content (SSC) associated with fruit sweetness were recently mapped in the cultivated strawberry, a prerequisite to enabling MAB. The first objective {{of this research was}} to investigate usefulness of markers linked to the FaPFRU locus controlling PF in 'Capitola' and strawberry germplasm containing the same F. virginiana subsp. glauca source collected by Bringhurst in Utah’s Wasatch Mountains through 'Tribute' and 'Seascape', and from other sources such as 'Pan American' through 'Fort-Laramie', and an unknown source through 'Sarian'. The second objective was to assess the ability of an SSC-associated simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker for predicting high soluble solids content in different environments in strawberry. Five SSR markers (EMFvi 136, Bx 89, Bx 215, Bx 56 and Bx 63) that are linked to PF on linkage group IVb were used to genotype 893 strawberry individuals. Based on Mendel's Law of Inheritance, parentage was confirmed for most seedlings.

40|$|Higher plants {{exhibit a}} variety of {{different}} life histories. Annual plants live for less than a year and after flowering produce seeds and senesce. By contrast perennials live for many years, dividing their life cycle into episodes of vegetative growth and flowering. Environmental cues control key check points in both life histories. Genes controlling responses to these cues exhibit natural genetic variation that has been studied most in short-lived annuals. We characterize natural genetic variation conferring differences in the perennial life cycle of Arabis alpina. Previously the accession Pajares was shown to flower after prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization) and only for a limited period before returning to vegetative growth. We describe five accessions of A. alpina that do not require vernalization to flower and flower continuously. Genetic complementation showed that these accessions carry mutant alleles at <b>PERPETUAL</b> <b>FLOWERING</b> 1 (PEP 1), which encodes a MADS box transcription factor orthologous to FLOWERING LOCUS C in the annual Arabidopsis thaliana. Each accession carries a different mutation at PEP 1, suggesting that such variation has arisen independently many times. Characterization of these alleles demonstrated that in most accessions, including Pajares, the PEP 1 locus contains a tandem arrangement of a full length and a partial PEP 1 copy, which give rise to two full-length transcripts that are differentially expressed. This complexity contrasts with the single gene present in A. thaliana and might contribute to the more complex expression pattern of PEP 1 that is associated with the perennial life-cycle. Our work demonstrates that natural accessions of A. alpina exhibit distinct lif...|$|E
40|$|The garden {{strawberry}} (Fragaria x ananassa) is a fruit species {{that was developed}} through human intervention less than 300 years ago. Currently, {{it is the most}} important soft fruit in both production as well as value and renowned for its deliciousness. There are many challenges in growing such a delicate fruit, many of which have been overcome through improved cultivation techniques and breeding. The perishability of the product is, however, not the only challenge faced by strawberry breeders. In terms of genome composition, strawberry appears to have accumulated a wonderful array of obstacles to genetic studies. It is a vegetatively propagated allo-octoploid outbreeder, and only few crop species are worse of in this respect. Many of the molecular genetic ground work is therefore performed in its diploid ancestor, the woodland strawberry Fragaria vesca, which was sequenced in 2011. However, since nearly all strawberries that are eaten are octoploid, genetic research can’t linger at the wild diploids forever. In this thesis we developed new tools and analysis methods for genetic studies in the allo-octoploid strawberry and subsequently applied these methods in the detection of marker-trait associations. The purpose of Chapter 2 was to develop a method to interpret the complex peak patterns generated by microsatellites in octoploid strawberry {{in such a way that}} we ended up with as much information as one would expect to retrieve from a microsatellite in a diploid system. This information could then be used to generate high quality linkage maps for the different sub-genomes and allow for easy alignment and comparison. We named the method MADCE, which stands for Microsatellite Allele Dose & Configuration Establishment. In the MADCE methodology, we first need to determine the dose of each allele present in an individual. For this we used the signal of fluorescent microsatellite peaks in relation to the total fluorescent signal generated by all peaks for that microsatellite. We then used the disomic inheritance of strawberry to establish the allelic configuration of each different homoeologue (subgenome). The repulsion of alleles from the same subgenome in offspring allowed us to form subgenomic pairs of alleles. We found that in single cross mapping populations, the deployment of our method was fairly easy due to the high number of offspring that can be used to establish repulsion between alleles. However, for pedigreed breeding germplasm this was another matter, as generally only few offspring were available. For this we added some additional tricks to the MADCE method, although some uncertainty about the configuration would remain for problematic lines and alleles. In Chapter 3 we used the MADCE method from Chapter 2 to generate a genome wide linkage map for the Holiday x Korona (HxK) mapping population. This linkage map was to be used in subsequent experiments for QTL discovery as well as provide the strawberry community with a highly detailed map consisting not only of marker distances, but allele and haplotype configuration of the parents Holiday and Korona as well. The haplotype information revealed that inbreeding (homozygosity) levels in Holiday were similar to the levels expected from its pedigree, but that inbreeding levels of Korona were more than three times higher than expected, which could be resultant from selection pressure enacted by breeders. Selection pressure could also be causal to our discovery that the kinship between the two cultivars was twice as high as expected from their shared ancestry. Another discovery was a large inversion on one of the subgenomes of linkage group 2 (D). Up until the publication of our linkage map this inversion had not been reported in other linkage maps. Another innovation was our attempt at giving a biological or evolutionary meaning to the denomination of the linkage groups by arranging them according to similarity to the diploid ancestor F. vesca, based on F. vesca derived primer amplification efficiencies. The HxK map has been used in several (ongoing) research projects outside of our research group and has contributed to the development of the 90 k Axiom SNP array for cultivated strawberry. In Chapter 4 we performed a QTL mapping study for disease resistance against the problematic pathogen Phytophthora cactorum, which causes crown rot in strawberry plants. In this study we used two different mapping populations: the Holiday x Korona (HxK) population from the previous chapter as well as E 1998 - 142 x Elsanta (ExEls), developed more specifically for the purpose of finding resistance against P. cactorum. The HxK and ExEls populations were phenotyped over three years (2008, 2010 and 2011) under different seasons and conditions. The correlation between years for was quite low for both populations (ranging from 0. 18 to 0. 47), indicating a large environmental effect on disease pressure. Results from the QTL analysis showed that most QTLs were small in effect and only just above the statistical significance threshold. Only for ExEls we uncovered two QTLs with relatively high significance levels, but none were significant in all three years. Because of the high environmental influence, and the desire to have QTLs that are robust over environments, we used the average of all three years (AOTY) as an additional phenotype. When we used the AOTY trait, the QTL on LG 7 D became stronger than for any of the individual years. Whereas for the LG 7 C QTL the significance dropped to just below threshold levels. These results indicated that removing environmental noise through averaging over experiments is a good way to uncover the most reliable and therefore more valuable to a breeding program. In Chapter 5 we investigated the genetics behind two different flowering habits that are grown commercially worldwide: seasonal flowering habit (SF) and <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> (PF) These varieties initiate flowering under long days, and can therefore produce fruit for a much longer period: throughout the summer and early fall. Evidence from literature and practical breeding suggested that PF is under dominant control. We decided to treat PF as a qualitative trait and divided two small mapping populations into PF and SF individuals. After screening several microsatellites, we found one locus that completely cosegregated with the PF trait at the bottom of LG 4 D. At the moment of mapping, a paper was published which mapped the same trait to the same location. We found that there were two very clear candidate genes within our QTL interval, FaCDF 2 and FaFT 2, which were homologous to genes that are major factors in the flowering pathway of Arabidopsis and many other plant species. We then sequenced the FaCDF 2 gene from a number of distinct PF and SF cultivars. This resulted in the discovery of two quite distinct allelic variants, one of which was present in all PF cultivars. However this variant was also present in some of the SF cultivars, indicating that either FaCDF 2 is not the causal gene, or that other loci can have a qualitative effect on the switch from SF to PF. We then performed microsatellite haplotyping on hundreds of cultivars and this revealed that all PF varieties of all origins carry the same haplotype in the PF QTL region, and that there weren’t any recombinations between the candidate genes FaCDF 2 and FaFT 2, which are 250 kb apart on the physical genome. This makes it still undecided which of these two candidate genes are causal to the PF trait. Another interesting result from the haplotyping was that the complete PF haplotype was present with moderate frequency in SF varieties as well. Not only does this suggest a common origin, it also complicates the establishment of a theory for the mechanisms behind <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> in cultivated strawberry. So far we have not been able to establish whether the PF haplotype that is present in SF cultivars is functionally distinct from the PF haplotype in PF cultivars. All we know is that it does not confer <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> in these SF cultivars, and further experiments would be needed to find out the exact mechanism behind <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering.</b> In the general discussion (Chapter 6), the results of this thesis were placed in the broader context of science in general and plant breeding in particular...|$|E

Woodland Strawberry (wild F. vesca) is the most widely distributed natural species in the northern hemisphere and a new promising model plant {{for the study of}} flowering in perennial plants. Classified as a seasonal flowering short day (SD) plant, wild F. vesca initiates flowering in the autumn, flowers in spring and forms fruits in summer followed by a vegetative growth phase until the next autumn. The <b>perpetual</b> <b>flowering</b> genotype Hawaii- 4 flowers continuously throughout the season. Flowering is regulated by ambient signals such as photoperiod and temperature. The photoperiod x temperature interaction was found to {{play a vital role in}} flowering initiation in Fragaria. SD F. vesca can behave as a day-neutral, short day plant or non-flowering plant depending on different ambient temperature. Flower initiation takes place regardless of photoperiod when F. vesca is put at 9 °C, but only flower under SD at 15 °C and no flowering is observed when the ambient temperature is higher than 21 °C. The experiment was designed to observe flower induction and explore the role of few flowering genes in the temperature regulation of flowering at long day (LD) condition. The expression of key flowering genes FT, SOC 1 and TFL 1 were analyzed in wild F. vesca and transgenic lines in F. vesca background. The results showed low temperature (11 °C) promotes flowering in SD F. vesca. FT was down-regulated by 11 °C and negatively correlated with flowering in F. vesca, in contrast to findings in other SD plants. SOC 1 may act downstream of FT, it represses flowering in SD F. vesc and may affect vegetative growth by interacting with GA pathway. Although FT functions as an integrator gene in flowering, there may be an FT-independent pathway in SD F. vesca. SOC 1 integrates signals from different pathways; it might be the candidate gene mediating signals from the thermosensary pathway.
