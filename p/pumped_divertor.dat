Plasmas 6, 1843 (1999) ], {{a stable}} high-density plasma develops {{in the core}} region when a series of pellets is injected. A core region with ~ 5 × 10 ^ 20 m^? 3 and temperature of 0. 85 keV is maintained by an internal diffusion barrier (IDB). The density gradient at the IDB (r/a~ 0. 6) is very high, and the particle confinement time in the core region is ~ 0. 4 s. Because {{of the increase in}} the central pressure, a large Shafranov shift up to ~ 0. 3 m is observed. The critical ingredients for IDB formation are a strongly <b>pumped</b> <b>divertor</b> to reduce edge recycling, and multiple pellet injection to ensure efficient central fueling.

40|$|The overall {{vision for}} FIRE [Fusion Ignition Research Experiment] {{is to develop}} and test the fusion plasma physics and plasma {{technologies}} needed to realize capabilities of the ARIES-RS/AT power plant designs. The mission of FIRE is to attain, explore, understand and optimize a fusion dominated plasma which would be satisfied by producing D-T [deuterium-tritium] fusion plasmas with nominal fusion gains {approx} 10, self-driven currents of {approx} 80 %, fusion power {approx} 150 - 300 MW, and pulse lengths up to 40 s. Achieving these goals will require the deployment of several key fusion technologies under conditions approaching those of ARIES-RS/AT. The FIRE plasma configuration with strong plasma shaping, a double null <b>pumped</b> <b>divertor</b> and all metal plasma-facing components is a 40 % scale model of the ARIES-RS/AT plasma configuration. ''Steady-state'' advanced tokamak modes in FIRE with high beta, high bootstrap fraction, and 100 % noninductive current drive are suitable for testing the physics of the ARIES-RS/A T operating modes. The development of techniques to handle power plant relevant exhaust power while maintaining low tritium inventory is a major objective for a burning plasma experiment. The FIRE high-confinement modes and AT-modes result in fusion power densities from 3 - 10 MWm{sup - 3 } and neutron wall loading from 2 - 4 MWm{sup - 2 } which are at the levels expected from the ARIES-RS/AT design studies...|$|E
40|$|Particle {{control is}} playing an {{increasingly}} important role in tokamak plasma performance. The present paper discusses particle control of hydrogen/deuterium by wall pumping on graphite or carbonized surfaces, {{as well as by}} external exhaust with pumped limiters and <b>pumped</b> <b>divertors.</b> Wall <b>pumping</b> is ultimately a transient effect and by itself not suitable for steady state particle exhaust. Therefore, external exhaust techniques with <b>pumped</b> <b>divertors</b> and limiters are being developed. How wall pumping phenomena interact and correlate with these inherently steady state, external exhaust techniques, is not well known to date. In the present paper, the processes involved in wall pumping and in external pumping are investigated in an attempt to evaluate the effect of external exhaust on wall pumping. Some of the key elements of this analysis are: (1) charge-exchange fluxes to the wall {{play a crucial role in}} the core-wall particle dynamics, (2) the recycling fluxes of thermal molecules have a high probability of ionization in the scrape-off layer, (3) thermal particles originating from the wall, which are ionized within the scrape-off layer, can be directly exhausted, thus providing a direct path between wall and exhaust which can be used to control the wall inventory. This way, the wall can be kept in a continuous pumping state in the sense that it continuously absorbs energetic particles and releases thermal molecules which are then removed by the external exhaust mechanism. While most of the ingredients of this analysis have been observed individually before, the present evaluation is an attempt to correlate effects of wall recycling and external exhaust...|$|R

The Fusion Ignition Research Experiment (FIRE) Design Study has been undertaken to define the lowest cost facility to attain, explore, understand, and optimize magnetically confined fusion-dominated plasmas. The FIRE is envisioned {{as an extension of}} the existing Advanced Tokamak Program that could lead to an attractive magnetic fusion reactor.

Up to the present time, three <b>pumped</b> <b>divertors</b> (Mark I, Mark IIA/AP and Mark IIGB) have been installed and exploited under reactor relevant conditions. With increased divertor closure, it is found that the particle exhaust rate has increased and neutral compression factors of> 100 are obtained with the Mark IIGB divertor. Helium enrich-ment factors of> 0. 2 are measured under a wide range of conditions and satisfy the minimum requirements for ITER. Fast infra-red camera measurements show broad deposition profiles during type I ELMs and energy densi-ties of ~ 0. 12 MJm- 2. During the recent D-T experiments, the codeposition of tritium on cold shadowed surfaces in the inner divertor has been identified as an important form of long-term tritium retention. This has serious implica-tions for the divertor design and tritium inventory in a next-step tokamak. Core plasma purity has not improved with enhanced divertor closure or decreased main chamber neutral pressure. Studies of the chemical sputtering yield have shown a dependence on surface temperature and hydrogen isotope. This accounts for the observation of increased impurity production and lower disruptive density limits in Mark II (at 500 K) compared to Mark I (at 300 K). Significant {{progress has been made in}} the study of divertor detachment, and volume recombination has been spectroscopically identified. With increasing isotope mass, detachment and the disruptive density limit occur at lower main plasma density as predicted by the EDGE 2 D/NIMBUS codes.

Small variations in the magnetic balance near-DN have large effects on both the power- and particle loadings at the divertor targets.

Monte-Carlo modelling with the ERO transport code reproduces the dependence of material deposition at the QMB on the plasma configuration. A further enhanced carbon flux to the QMB is detected if the strike point is moved for the first time to a location where a carbon layer was built up in former shots.

The torus in out asymmetry was observed in the neutral pressure distribution, {{and the degree of}} the asymmetry depends on the divertor particle flux distribution, and thus, on the operational magnetic configuration. This asymmetry was well reproduced by the fully three-dimensional neutral transport code, EIRENE. Degradation of the plasma confinement with increasing of the neutral pressure was observed, and that suggests the effective particle control is necessary for the sustaining of long discharge with high performance plasma and the further improvement of the confinement. The modification of the open helical divertor to the closed one is planned for the particle control using helical divertor. It has been investigated using EIRENE code. Results of the calculation show that proper rearrangement of divertor plates and additional components, such as dome structure make the neutral particles to be compressed well in the divertor region, and effective <b>divertor</b> <b>pumping</b> to be possible.

In lower q discharges, including discharges at the ITER value of q, edge second stability requires significant edge current density.

40|$|The {{formation}} of re-deposited layers consisting of hydrocarbon compounds is of major {{concern for the}} development of next-step devices, because the hydrogen bound in these layers contributes to tritium retention in a future fusion reactor.

For the understanding of film formation in such a liner the knowledge of sticking coefficients of the growth precursors is mandatory. Therefore, experiments based on the cavity technique were performed to measure surface loss probabilities of hydrocarbon radicals. In addition sticking coefficients of methyl radicals were measured directly applying well-characterized quantified radical beams. To simulate film formation in a liner, a test experiment was performed consisting of a stainless steel tube, which was exposed to a low-temperature plasma from acetylene. The variation of the film thickness along the inner surface of this tube after plasma exposure can be described by a flux comprising of different neutral hydrocarbon radical species using the previously determined sticking coefficients.

In the present study, a new three-dimensional (3 -D) neutronics calculation system has been developed for the helical-type reactor to enhance quick feedback between neutronics evaluation and design modification. Using this new calculation system, advanced Flibe-cooled and Li-cooled liquid blanket systems proposed for FFHR 2 have been evaluated to make clear design issues to enhance neutronics performance. Based on calculated results, modification of the blanket dimensions and configuration have been attempted to achieve the adequate tritium breeding ability and neutron shielding performance in the helical reactor. The total tritium breeding ratios (TBRs) obtained after modifying the blanket dimensions indicated that all the advanced blanket systems proposed for FFHR 2 would achieve adequate tritium self-sufficiency by dimension adjustment and optimization of structures in the breeder layers. Issues in neutron shielding performance have been investigated quantitatively using 3 -D geometry of the helical blanket system, support structures, poroidal coils etc. Shielding performance of the helical coils against direct neutrons from core plasma would achieve design target by further optimization of shielding materials. However, suppression of the neutron streaming and reflection through the <b>divertor</b> <b>pumping</b> areas in the original design is important issue to protect the poroidal coils and helical coils, respectively.

For single-null (SN) configurations, argon accumulation was 2 – 3 times lower in the main plasma when the ion B ��B drift was directed away from the divertor. The puff-and-pump approach was much less effective in screening argon from the main plasma of double-null (DN) discharges than of SN discharges, such that argon impurities accumulated in the main plasma of DNs at a rate ~ 2 – 3 times higher than in corresponding SNs. Regardless of which divertor in DN had argon injection, argon accumulated in the divertor that was opposite the B ��B drift direction. The argon density in the main plasma during puff-andpump operation fell by a factor of three for dRsep � + 0. 4 cm when the ion B ��B drift was directed away from the dominant divertor, and this represents the transition from DN to SN behavior during puff-and-pump application.

These results provide important inputs {{to the design of}} next generation divertor systems including the upgrade of the DIII-D divertor. The use of graphite for the plasma facing components and careful wall preparation has enabled the routine achievement of regimes of enhanced energy confinement. In elongated discharges, triangularity {{has been found to be}} important in attaining good discharge performance as measured by the product of the normalized plasma pressure and the energy confinement time, {beta}{tau}{sub E} This constrains the design of the divertor configuration (X-point location). Active <b>pumping</b> of the <b>divertor</b> region using an in-situ toroidal cryogenic pump has demonstrated control of the plasma density in H-mode discharges and allowed the dependence of confinement on plasma density and current to be separately determined. Helium removal from the plasma edge sufficient to achieve effective ash removal in reactor discharges has also been demonstrated using this pumping configuration. The reduction of the heat flux to the divertor plates has been demonstrated using two different techniques to increase the radiation in the boundary regions of the plasma and thus reduce the heat flux to the divertor plates; deuterium gas injection has been used to create a strongly radiating localized zone near the X-point, and impurity (neon) injection to enhance the radiation from the plasma mantle. Precise shaping of the plasma current profile has been found to be important in achieving enhanced tokamak performance. Transiently shaped current profiles have been used to demonstrate regimes of plasmas with high beta and good confinement.

40|$|Puff and pump' {{radiating}} divertor scenarios [1, 2] {{were applied}} to upper SN and DN H-mode plasmas. Under similar operating conditions, argon (Ar) accumulated in the main plasma of single-null (SN) plasmas more rapidly and reached a higher steady-state concentration when the B x {del}B ion drift direction was toward the divertor than when the B x {del}B ion drift direction {{was out of the}} divertor. The initial rate that Ar accumulated inside double-null (DN) plasmas was more than twice that of comparably-prepared SNs with the same B x {del}B direction. One way to reduce power loading at the divertor targets is to 'seed' the divertor plasma with impurities that radiatively reduce the conducted power. Studies have shown that the concentration of impurities in the divertor are increased by raising the flow of deuterium ions (D{sup +}) into the divertor by a combination of upstream deuterium gas puffing and active particle exhaust at the divertor targets, i. e., puff-and-pump. An enhanced D{sup +} particle flow toward the divertor targets exerts a frictional drag on impurities, and inhibits their escape from the divertor. A puff-and-pump approach using Ar as the impurity was successfully applied in recent DIII-D experiments to SN plasmas [3] while maintaining good H-mode performance. Studies on DIII-D and other tokamaks have shown that both the direction of the toroidal magnetic field B{sub T} and the degree of magnetic balance between divertors [i. e., {{the degree to which the}} plasma shape is considered SN or DN] are important factors in determining recycling and particle pumping [4, 5]. It is unclear whether the favorable results of Ref. [3] can be extended to cases with different magnetic balance and/or B{sub T} direction. We show in this paper that reversing the direction of B{sub T} or altering the divertor magnetic balance does have an impact on how plasmas behave under puff-and-pump conditions. Our study takes advantage of DIII-D's capabilities to actively pump SN and DN shapes with high-triangularity.

40|$|Developing a reactor {{compatible}} divertor {{has been}} identified as a particularly challenging technology problem for magnetic confinement fusion. While tungsten {{has been identified}} as the most attractive solid divertor material, the NSTX/NSTX-U lithium (Li) program is investigating the viability of liquid lithium (LL) as a potential reactor compatible divertor plasma facing component (PFC). In the near term, operation in NSTX-U is projected to provide reactor-like divertor heat loads < 40 MW/m^ 2 for 5 s. During the most recent NSTX campaign, ~ 0. 85 kg of Li was evaporated onto the NSTX PFCs where a ~ 50 % reduction in heat load on the Liquid Lithium Divertor (LLD) was observed, attributable to enhanced divertor bolometric radiation. This reduced divertor heat flux through radiation observed in the NSTX LLD experiment is consistent with the results from other lithium experiments and calculations. These results motivate an LL-based closed radiative divertor concept proposed here for NSTX-U and fusion reactors. With an LL coating, the Li is evaporated from the divertor strike point surface due to the intense heat. The evaporated Li is readily ionized by the plasma due to its low ionization energies, and the ionized Li ions can radiate strongly, resulting in a significant reduction in the divertor heat flux. Due to the rapid plasma transport in divertor plasma, the radiation values can be significantly enhanced up to ~ 11 MJ/cc of LL. This radiative process has the desired function of spreading the focused divertor heat load to the entire divertor chamber facilitating the divertor heat removal. The LL divertor surface can also provide a "sacrificial" surface to protect the substrate solid material from transient high heat flux such as the ones caused by the ELMs. The closed radiative LLD concept has the advantages of providing some degree of partition in terms of plasma disruption forces on the LL, Li particle divertor retention, and strong <b>divertor</b> <b>pumping</b> action from the Li-coated divertor chamber wall. By operating at a lower temperature than the first wall, the LLD can serve to purify the entire reactor chamber, as impurities generally migrate toward lower temperature Li-condensed surfaces. To maintain the LL purity, a closed LL loop system with a modest capacity (e. g., ~ 1 Liter/sec for ~ 1 % level "impurities") is envisioned for a steady-state 1 GW-electric class fusion power plant...|$|R
