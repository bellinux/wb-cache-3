50|$|Two {{types of}} ammunition, smoke or chemical, and high-explosive are known. Likewise, {{there are two}} weights of shells-7.2 pounds and 14.3 pounds. The {{complete}} 7.2-pound round consists of a percussion fuze, the shell body, the fin assembly, the <b>primer</b> <b>cartridge,</b> and the propelling charge. The propelling charge {{is made up of}} increments, each increment consisting of a lacquered silk envelope containing a ballistite-type propellant. The <b>primer</b> <b>cartridge,</b> enclosed at one end by a lacquered brass head, resembles a 12-gauge shotgun shell. The body of the high-explosive shell is painted black, inside and out, and contains an explosive charge of about 1 pound of TNT. A white band is painted {{around the base of the}} body of the shell, a yellow band at the junction of the shell and the fin assembly, and a red band around the nose, on the fuze adapter. The 7.2-pound shell is 11.6 inches long unfuzed.|$|E
50|$|The M98 action {{features}} {{two large}} oval shaped gas relief holes {{on the bottom}} of the bolt, which when catastrophic failures like a <b>primer,</b> <b>cartridge</b> rupture or detonation occur relieve high pressure gases into the magazine, and a gas shield on the bolt sleeve. Military M98 systems feature a secondary gas relieve where gas is routed down the locking lug raceway to a thumb hole cutout exit on left side of receiver. Civilian M98 systems often lack the thumb hole cut out, as the ammunition feeding is generally simplified to single round feeding only. These safety features are designed to route escaping gas out of the bolt and eventual debris away from the operator's face.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} for a European country, handloading in Germany {{requires}} a course, terminated in an exam, in handloading and handling of explosive propellants; often, this is offered in combination with a course and exam in muzzle-loading and black powder-shooting. The State's Ministry of the Interior conducts the exam. When passed and the reloader can provide a reason for his will to reload ("Bedürfnisprüfung"), he can apply for a permit to a quota of propellant for five years (after which time he has to extend the permit). Every propellant is recorded into the permit. <b>Primers,</b> <b>cartridges,</b> bullets and reloading equipment are available without permit.|$|R
5|$|Mercury(II) {{fulminate}} is {{a primary}} explosive which is mainly used as a <b>primer</b> of a <b>cartridge</b> in firearms.|$|R
50|$|The action {{features}} a large gas relief {{hole at the}} bolt body {{designed to protect the}} user's head in case of a <b>primer</b> or <b>cartridge</b> rupture or detonation. When the action suffers a catastrophic failure it is designed to deflect the debris away from the operator's face.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1880s the Benet (inside) <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> was retired {{and the modern}} Boxer type (externally visible) primer was adopted for all future {{military}} production of revolver ammunition.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1970s, Cheddite is the {{commercial}} name for an explosive compound {{used as an}} explosive <b>primer</b> for shotgun <b>cartridges.</b> It contains 90% potassium chlorate, 7% paraffin, 3% petroleum jelly, and traces of carbon black.|$|R
5000|$|Lead {{thiocyanate}} {{is used in}} explosives, specifically {{an ingredient}} in <b>primers</b> for small-arms <b>cartridges,</b> safety matches, and to reverse aniline black dyeing (Gideon). It {{can also be used}} as a precursor for preparing perovskite solar cells ...|$|R
5000|$|The MG4 is an air-cooled, belt-fed gas-operated weapon with a {{positively}} locked rotary bolt and {{is somewhat}} similar in concept to the Belgian Minimi light machine gun. Firing in fully automatic. Safety mechanisms on the MG4 includes a manual safety incorporated into fire mode selector toggle; setting the fire selector lever on the [...] "safe" [...] position blocks the trigger mechanically and locks the bolt in the cocked position. When the bolt is not pulled back completely, accidental firing is prevented by an integral, automatic mechanism that prevents the bolt from traveling forward. In addition, {{the firing pin}} cannot reach the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> until the <b>cartridge</b> has been fully chambered.|$|R
50|$|Many picrates are explosives, {{for example}} {{ammonium}} picrate (known as Dunnite). Some {{are used as}} primary explosives, namely lead picrate or potassium picrate which find their use as <b>primers</b> for <b>cartridge</b> ammunition. Picrates of some metals tend to be significantly more sensitive to impact, friction and shock than picric acid itself. As a result, storage of picric acid (or mixtures containing it) in metal containers is strongly discouraged due to the high risk of accidental explosion.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, pistol dueling became popular as a sport in France. The duelists were armed with {{conventional}} pistols, but the cartridges had wax bullets and were without any powder charge; the bullet was propelled {{only by the}} explosion of the <b>cartridge's</b> <b>primer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Rimfire {{cartridges}} {{are limited}} to low pressures because they require a thin case so that the firing pin can crush the rim and ignite the <b>primer.</b> Rimfire <b>cartridges</b> of [...]44 caliber (actually [...]45 caliber) up to [...]56 caliber were once common when black powder {{was used as a}} propellant. However, modern rimfire cartridges use smokeless powder which generates much higher pressures and tend to be of [...]22 caliber (5.5 mm) or smaller. The low pressures necessitated by the rimfire design mean that rimfire firearms can be very light and inexpensive, which has helped lead to the continuing popularity of these small-caliber cartridges.|$|R
50|$|Bang/Go - aiming {{and firing}} the firearm again. If the firearm again doesn't fire or fails {{to extract the}} spent round, it may {{indicate}} a more serious problem with the firearm requiring maintenance. For instance, if the firing pin is too lightly striking the <b>primer</b> on a <b>cartridge,</b> it may indicate a worn out spring or firing pin.|$|R
50|$|The company {{developed}} the innovative LEVERevolution ammunition, {{which uses a}} spitzer bullet with a soft elastomer tip to give better aerodynamic performance than flatter bullets, while eliminating {{the risk of a}} shock driving the pointed polymer tip of a bullet in a lever action rifle's tube magazine into the <b>primer</b> of the <b>cartridge</b> in front, causing an explosion.|$|R
50|$|UK shells weighed 12.5 lb (5.67 kg) {{filled and}} fuzed.The cordite {{propellant}} charge was normally ignited by an electrically-activated primer (in {{the base of}} the cartridge case), with power provided by a battery. The electric <b>primer</b> in the <b>cartridge</b> could be replaced by an adaptor which allowed the use of electric or percussion tube to be inserted to provide ignition.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{bought a}} paper {{manufacturer}} (the Ecusta Paper Company in Pisgah Forest, North Carolina), a lead shot facility, an explosive <b>primer</b> facility, a <b>cartridge</b> brass manufacturing facility, and a fiber wad facility. The company also started its own brass mill. Together, these companies became the Western Cartridge Company. Through it, the Olins {{made a fortune}} supplying ammunition during World War I.|$|R
50|$|When {{the trigger}} is pressed, the hammer falls. The trigger is {{affixed to the}} rear end of the trigger springs from below. When {{pressing}} the trigger rests its ledges in the receiver and move down the release spring high neck than releases the trigger, which, along with hammer, moves forward {{under the influence of}} spring and drives the firing pin into the <b>primer,</b> igniting the <b>cartridge</b> and firing the shot.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the firing}} pin has its own safety, which makes sure that the pin will not move forward. That is, until the trigger is pulled, at which time the safety is removed and the pin is pushed forward to meet the <b>cartridge's</b> <b>primer.</b> This third safety is also the gun's drop safety. Even when dropped from a {{reasonable}} height, with a round in the chamber, the gun will not fire.|$|R
25|$|Until the 1970s, when older-design revolvers such as Colt Single Action Armys and Ruger Blackhawks were {{re-engineered}} with drop safeties (such as {{firing pin}} blocks, hammer blocks, or transfer bars) that prevent {{the firing pin}} from contacting the <b>cartridge's</b> <b>primer</b> unless the trigger is pulled, safe carry required the hammer being positioned over an empty chamber, reducing the available cartridges from six to five, or, on some models, in between chambers on either a pin or in a groove for that purpose, thus keeping the full six rounds available. This kept the uncocked hammer from resting directly on the <b>primer</b> of a <b>cartridge.</b> If not used in this manner, the hammer rests directly on a primer and unintentional firing may occur if the gun is dropped or the hammer is struck. Some holster makers provided a thick leather thong to place underneath the hammer that both allowed the carry of a gun fully loaded with all six rounds and secured the {{gun in the holster}} to help prevent its accidental loss.|$|R
50|$|A hammer {{block is}} similar to a firing pin block. It is a latch, block or other {{obstruction}} built into the action and normally positioned to prevent the hammer contacting the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> or firing pin when at rest. Similar to the firing pin block, the obstruction to the hammer's travel is removed as a consequence of pulling the trigger. This allows the hammer to contact the primer or firing pin only when the trigger is pulled.|$|R
50|$|When the gun {{was ready}} to fire, a round {{would be in the}} chamber and the bolt and barrel group would be locked together, with the locking block {{at the rear of the}} bolt. When the rear of the trigger was pivoted upwards by the operator, the front of the trigger tipped downward, pulling the sear out of {{engagement}} with the spring-loaded firing pin, allowing it to move forward and strike the <b>primer</b> of the <b>cartridge.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{rotating}} magazine design {{allowed the}} rifle {{to be one}} of the first lever-action rifles to use spitzer bullets. Previous lever-action rifles used tubular magazines, which placed cartridges of ammunition end to end. The pointed tips of a spitzer bullet would touch the <b>primer</b> of the <b>cartridge</b> in front of it, possibly causing an accidental discharge. Another novel safety feature was that, upon cocking the rifle, a small pin would protrude above the top receiver to indicate the rifle was cocked and ready to fire.|$|R
50|$|Some {{very early}} {{blowback}} pistols used ammunition with no rim or extractor groove on the cartridge cases (e.g., 5mm Bergmann), and such pistols therefore lacked extractors. The spent case {{was forced out}} of the chamber by recoil, and was subsequently ejected. As this system did not provide for easy clearance of misfires, it was not very successful, especially for self-defense handguns needing to be cleared quickly and reloaded {{in the event of a}} <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> malfunction. Nonetheless, there are examples of contemporary modern semi-automatic pistols that do not have extractors even to this day, such as the Beretta Bobcat, Beretta Model 21A, and clones of the Beretta designs such as the Taurus PT22 that are successful. These modern pistols typically have flip-up barrels, to permit easy loading without necessarily cycling a slide against a strong recoil spring, making these pistols suitable for use by the elderly and others with less hand strength. The trade made is that in the event of a <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> malfunction, the gun is rendered useless until the action can be cycled by someone with full hand strength. Still, for someone without the hand strength to handle a semi-automatic firearm with a slide against a strong recoil spring, the trade is often made.|$|R
25|$|More {{advanced}} improvised guns {{can make}} use of parts from other gun-like products. One example is the cap gun. A cap gun can be disassembled, and a barrel added, turning the toy gun into a real one; a firing pin can then {{be added to the}} hammer, to concentrate the force onto the <b>primer</b> of the <b>cartridge.</b> If the cap gun has a strong enough hammer spring, the existing trigger mechanism can be used as-is; otherwise, rubber bands may be added to increase the power of the hammer.|$|R
50|$|A {{firing pin}} or striker {{is part of}} the firing {{mechanism}} used in a firearm or explosive device e.g. an M14 landmine or bomb fuze. Firing pins may take many forms, though the types used in fuzes for single-use devices (such as landmines, artillery shells, cluster munitions and grenades etc.) generally have a sharpened point. In contrast, firing pins used in firearms usually have a small, rounded portion designed to strike the <b>primer</b> of a <b>cartridge,</b> detonating the priming compound, which then ignites the propellant (inside) or fires the detonator and booster.|$|R
50|$|Factory {{ammunition}} {{was produced}} by the Super Cartridge Company, Riverbrand, IMI and Sportco, some using new Boxer primed cases (single flash hole and primer has anvil), others using military Berdan primed cases (double flash hole <b>cartridge</b> and <b>primer</b> has no anvil). Factory cartridges are far easier to reload once fired in comparison to military cartridges, because military cartridges have a crimped in Berdan <b>primer.</b> Berden primed <b>cartridges</b> also have a double flash hole, making their removal difficult because the standard decapping die only has a single decapping pin.|$|R

5000|$|The {{identifying}} {{feature of}} centerfire ammunition is the primer {{which is a}} metal cup containing a primary explosive inserted into a recess {{in the center of}} the base of the cartridge. The firearm firing pin crushes this explosive between the cup and an anvil to produce hot gas and a shower of incandescent particles to ignite the powder charge. [...] Berdan and Boxer <b>cartridge</b> <b>primers</b> are both considered [...] "centerfire" [...] and are not interchangeable at the primer level; however, the same weapon can fire either Berdan- or Boxer-primed cartridges if the overall dimensions are the same.|$|R
5000|$|Although most {{commercial}} powerheads use standard handgun ammunition, such as [...]357 Magnum or [...]44 Magnum, {{many users}} {{choose to use}} larger caliber ammunition to do maximum damage to the intended target. [...] A common misconception of how powerheads function is that the muzzle blast does the damage, as much high-pressure gas is forced into {{the flesh of the}} target. While the gas does do minimal damage, it is ultimately the penetration of the slug that causes the damage to the target. Most powerheads function just as traditional firearms do, instead it is the spear which acts as the firing hammer. One commercially produced version used a modified [...]30-30 Winchester cartridge case, loaded backwards, with a primed [...]38 Special case loaded in its mouth holding the <b>primer.</b> The <b>cartridge</b> was loaded with the [...]30-30 case facing outwards, so that the [...]30-30 case full of burning powder was propelled into the target upon firing.This system is fast to reload {{and one of the most}} effective despite the fact that it does not use a bullet.|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} of microstamped identifiers to the <b>primers</b> of fired <b>cartridges</b> was examined using a stereomicroscope and {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). The identifiers {{were placed on the}} firing pins of three different 9 mm handguns, namely, a Sig Sauer, a Taurus, and a Hi-Point. Ten different brands of ammunition were fired from each handgun, 100 rounds being fired using each brand for a total of 1000 rounds fired per handgun. The quality of the markings was evaluated using a simple observation rubric. These results were compared to Vickers hardness values obtained from the ammunition primers and are discussed in light of the types of actions of firearms used...|$|R
5000|$|A {{transfer}} bar {{is also used}} in revolvers and some exposed hammer rifles, but works the opposite way from a hammer block. The {{transfer bar}} has the spur {{that would otherwise be}} on the hammer, or encloses a firing pin similar to autoloading designs. The hammer itself cannot contact a loaded cartridge, but must instead strike the transfer bar, which then contacts the <b>cartridge</b> <b>primer</b> with the spur or pin. The transfer bar is normally positioned out of line with the hammer's travel, but is moved into place by the normal action of the trigger, providing similar [...] "drop safety" [...] to a firing pin block.|$|R
50|$|The Model 14's design {{incorporated}} several innovative concepts. Among {{them was}} a spiral magazine tube to prevent bullet tips from contacting the <b>primer</b> of the <b>cartridge</b> in front of them. This magazine moved with the fore-end when pumping the action. Loading was through {{an opening in the}} magazine itself located between the fore-end and the receiver. The bolt unlocked via a button pressed through the ejection port though firing the gun automatically unlocked the bolt. The Model 14 was a takedown rifle that featured a single knurled screw {{on the left side of}} the receiver that was withdrawn allowing the trigger group and buttstock to be removed from the bottom of the gun.|$|R
5000|$|Because the {{majority}} of rifles chambered in [...]30-30 are lever-action rifles with tubular magazines, most [...]30-30 cartridges are loaded with round-nose or flat-nose bullets for safety. This is to prevent a spitzer-point bullet (the shape seen on the [...]308 Winchester above) from setting off the <b>primer</b> of the <b>cartridge</b> ahead {{of it in the}} magazine during recoil, resulting in potentially catastrophic damage to both firearm and shooter. The Savage Model 99 was introduced in 1899 with a rotary magazine, in part to avoid that issue. When used in single-shot rifles or handguns, such as the Thompson Center Arms Contender or Encore series, it is common for shooters to hand load the cartridge with spire-point bullets for improved ballistics.|$|R
5000|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1911 the GP 11 cartridge featured some technical development. The projectile seating in the cartridge case neck was improved {{by adding a}} cannelure on the bullet and crimping the case neck over time, resulting in [...] (1911), [...] (1929 modification), [...] (1942 modification) extraction force. In 1942 the square flake shaped double-base propellant was replaced by tubular shaped double-base propellant. Further there were minor developments regarding the projectiles, sealing and <b>primers.</b> GP 11 <b>cartridges</b> were mass-produced for the Swiss military in the ammunition factories in Altdorf and in Thun until 1994. The last 1994 produced ammunition had Lot No. 349-94. Previously GP 11 was also produced Rotenburg and Solothurn as other municipalities in Switzerland.|$|R
40|$|The firing pins {{of three}} {{different}} handguns were modified to stamp a six-digit alpha-numeric code and a circumferential digital code known as a gear code into the <b>primer</b> of a <b>cartridge</b> when fired. In this paper the transfer of gear codes from firing pin to primers was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Only those cartridges that received poor clarity marks optically as regarding the alpha-numeric code were chosen for evaluation in the SEM. Photo editing software was employed to clearly outline and decipher the gear code around the circumference of the microstamped primer. Results show that the better imaging of the SEM allows more of the alpha-numeric identifiers to be distinguished {{as well as more}} of the gear code structure, however complete recognition is still not possible in all cases...|$|R
5000|$|The [...]30-'06 Garand rifle (essentially an {{enlarged}} T3E2) was quickly built and, under the confusing designation T1E1, was tested {{along with the}} T3E2 and the Pedersen T1E3 during the remainder of 1931. The Semiautomatic Rifle Board now exhibited a notably critical attitude toward the T1E3. The Board found fault with the requirement for lubricated cartridge cases (seemingly regardless of the technical merits of Mr. Pedersen’s case treatment concept), poor trigger pull, and the upward break of the breech mechanism. A more substantive complaint {{had to do with}} the complete exposure of the breech mechanism when held open—the Board correctly cited the vulnerability of the rifle to mud and dust while in this condition. The Board also reported slamfires (the Garand T3E2 was reported to dimple <b>cartridge</b> <b>primers</b> with its firing pin, but did not slamfire).|$|R
