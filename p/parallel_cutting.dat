5000|$|For example, {{imagine an}} action scene where a villain is chasing {{the hero of}} the film. To spend the entire chase scene trying to keep both the hero and the villain in the frame at the same time will become very {{difficult}} and un-engaging after a while. A better way to approach this problem is through the use of <b>parallel</b> <b>cutting.</b> In this example, the scene would consist of several shots of the hero running in one direction, and some shots of the villain running in the same direction. Perhaps the hero looks back, out of frame, at his pursuer. At this point, the editor would insert a shot of the villain. Neither character occupies the same screen space, yet the audience still understands that one is chasing the other. [...] This technique is parodied in the film [...] "Naked Gun 2½" [...] where the editing swaps between showing the hero and the villain firing at each other, then finally in a long shot we realize they are in fact only about four feet away from each other.|$|E

[...] The use of three editors (Douglas, Pearson, and Rouse) on United 93 was dictated by its short post-production period; {{less than six months}} passed between the start of filming and release of the film. Greengrass and Douglas had worked together quite successfully on the film Bloody Sunday (2002); Greengrass, Pearson, and Rouse had recently finished The Bourne Supremacy (2004). Despite the accelerated post-production schedule for United 93, the editing was very successful. Ellen Feldman has written an analysis of the film's editing; she notes that, [...] "United 93 represents a complex editing feat, with a structure based on <b>parallel</b> <b>cutting</b> combined with an edgy, hyper-cranked [...] "Cinema Verité” style, a style that disorients us but doesn't prevent us from grasping lots of necessary exposition and identifying with many characters."

Shortly following the 1955 renumbering, a series of right-angle turns were smoothed out, most notably between Redich and Basile in Acadia Parish.

We also discuss several enhancements and heuristics which help speed up our implementation of this new <b>parallel</b> <b>cutting</b> plane framework for solving the SEP.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an integrated method to determine optimal cutting parameters for milling pocket based on minimum cutting time.

40|$|The {{distinct}} {{characteristics of}} juvenile and mature woods, which are observed particularly in softwoods, {{have an influence}} on processing due to their different mechanical resistance properties in relation to cutting operations. In the past, {{when most of the}} wood used industrially came from adult trees of natural forests, little importance was given to a distinction between different zones of the tree stem. At present, however, as the supply of mature trees with large diameters from native forests is constantly decreasing, the use of short-cycle trees has become a common practice, through the adoption of species that grow relatively fast, such as pines and eucalyptus. In both softwoods and hardwoods, juvenile wood cells are generally smaller and thinner than in mature wood, and this reflects on their density and mechanical resistance, which should {{have an effect on the}} cutting forces developed during processing. The main object of this research was to evaluate orthogonal cutting forces in juvenile and mature Pinus taeda woods.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} aspects of the process and one that future efforts should be focused on is the identification of the corresponding z-axis levels between the 2 D histology and the 3 D imaging data. When parallel consecutive slices are used, the slice thicknesses are accurately known and the identification of the z-axis can be performed by simple counting [27]. However, not all pathology departments have access to the equipment required, and the processing of these specimens would have to deviate from the local pathology laboratory routine. Contrary to previous attempts where the pathology routine had to be changed to introduce either whole-mount tissue sections or parallel consecutive slicing [27], the method outlined in this study affects the routine pathology workflow with the addition of one extra step, the insertion of the fiducial markers. This step, however, does not require extra personnel as it is not technically challenging and it can be performed easily {{by a member of the}} pathology team handling the specimen. In addition, it extends a procedure that has a total duration of many hours (from specimen removal after surgery to generation of tumour blocks for histopathology analysis) by few extra minutes only.

Three-dimensional MCE data were acquired sequentially in a rotational scanning format during triggered harmonic imaging with an intravenous contrast agent. Reconstructed short-axis views of the LV were aligned in a bulls-eye format with the apex as the inner most ring. The total LV was divided into 120 sectors. The number of sectors with lack of contrast enhancement was used to derive the percent of the LV (%LV) with perfusion defect and was compared with the extent of MI calculated from postmortem triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The perfusion defect regions shown on bulls-eye images corresponded correctly with the territories of the occluded coronary arteries. Three-dimensional MCE perfusion defect mass (19. 2 +/- 6. 0 %LV) correlated well with anatomic MI mass (19. 3 +/- 5. 6 %LV; r = 0. 92, SEE = 2. 3 %, mean differential = 0. 1 +/- 2. 4 %).

As características distintas dos lenhos juvenil e adulto, existentes principalmente na formação das coníferas, influenciam na usinagem devido às diferentes propriedades de resistência mecânica ao corte. No passado, quando a maior parte da madeira utilizada industrialmente era proveniente de árvores adultas de florestas naturais, pouca importância era dada à diferenciação de zonas no tronco. Atualmente, no entanto, com o decréscimo constante do suprimento de árvores adultas de grandes diâmetros, provenientes de florestas nativas, tornou-se comum o aproveitamento da madeira de ciclos curtos, através da adoção de espécies de crescimento relativamente rápido, como exemplo os Pinus e os eucaliptos.
