40|$|Introduction. Developmental {{dysplasia}} {{of the hip}} (DDH) {{represents one}} of common diseases of the locomotor system. Late discovery and inadequate healing of this defect leads to serious disability in {{the best years of}} human life. Objective. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the quality of functional and anatomic restitution of the diseased hip, depending on the age of the patient at the time of surgery. Methods. Our retrospective study was developed on 78 children surgically treated for DDH. The examiners were distributed in three groups according to age in which they had been operated. The data were produced on the basis of full-scale medical documents for each patient. Results. We analyzed and compared anatomic and functional results of surgeries treating DDH in the group of examiners. On examination, we got data that the most prevalent were distorted gait, inequality of the legs and positive Trendelendburg’s sign in the group of children who had been operated in the oldest age. The patients who were surgically treated in older age had worse postoperative results in aspect value angle of flexion and abduction in treated hip, higher frequency in manifesting pain and asymmetric gait. Better corrective results on aspect of dimension of the colodiaphyseal and Hilgenrainer’s angle will be obtained if DDH treatment is conducted in younger age of patients. In 94. 95 %, the patients were treated with Salter innominate osteotomy of pelvis with osteotomy of the femur involving its shortening and reverse rotation. Preoperative treatment with <b>Pavliks</b> <b>harness</b> was provided in 44. 02 % children, with abduction of Hilgenrainer’s apparatus in 2. 6 %, with abductions “Niva” slips in 2. 6 % and preoperative extension in 28. 2 %. Conclusion. The surgical treatment of DDH in the observed patients done at the earlier age of growth resulted in the evidently better anatomical and functional results at postoperative observation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There is {{some debate}} about {{the pros and cons}} of {{selective}} screening of DDH in neonates as opposed to general screening. General screening puts a lot of stress on the resources available, especially in the modern day NHS, but the advocates state that this minimises the cost incurred in treating a missed DDH (by selective screening) with surgery later on. Aim: The aim of this retrospective study was to find out the effectiveness of the Southampton selective screening of babies with risk factors for DDH by finding out the number of patients presenting late with an established DDH. Materials And Methods: 6116 babies out of 26, 932 live births (22. 7 %) in Southampton were screened between 1998 and 2003. The details of the individual outcomes and the reasons for the late presentation were obtained from the patient notes and the records of the screening program which are maintained in the clinics and by the senior author. Results: 248 new patients had <b>Pavlik’s</b> <b>harness</b> fitted for the treatment of DDH which presents a treatment rate of 0. 92 %. 8 patients (0. 03 %) presented late because they did not undergo ultrasound scanning as they did not have the risk factors as required by this selective program. 10 (0. 036 %) failed Pavlik’s and needed late surgery to have their DDH treated. The total operation rate was 0. 066 %. Discussion: The late presentation of patients in this screening program is very low and comparable to the other papers from this department and from around the world. The cost implications of treating these 8 late presenting patients was found to be a lot cheaper than carrying out a general screening program which would mean, in this case 4 times more than the cost of the present screening program...|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} ways {{in order to}} address this condition. One treatment that can be used on newborns or infants is called a <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness.</b> The <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> is a soft harness-like device that has straps that hold the legs apart and bent at the knee, in an attempt to keep the femur (ball) in the acetabulum (socket) in the correct position. Another treatment method {{that can be used to}} fix the condition is closed reduction in which the hip is positioned under anesthesia. This particular procedure can be done on children from the ages of six months to two years old. If the closed reduction treatment does not work, then open reduction (surgery) is another option to use. After the closed or open surgery is performed, the child may use a cast or brace in order to keep the hip bone in the socket while it is healing. By using one of these treatment methods the child can have normal hip joint function.|$|E
30|$|When used {{appropriately}} the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> is an effective, {{non-invasive method}} {{used to treat}} DDH [5, 8].

40|$|Introduction. Successful {{treatment}} of developmental {{displacement of the}} hip (DDH) depends on early diagnosis. Clinical screening of all newborns is a useful tool and should be encouraged in everyday practice, because DDH has a high prevalence and significant morbidity. Clinical exam {{is an important part}} of early diagnosis, but insufficient. Ultrasound exam is more sensitive in early diagnosis of DDH. Objective. Systematic struggle against DDH by means of early detection and treatment begins in neonatology units, and continues in primary healthcare centres. Methods. Methodology consists of personal history, clinical exam, ultrasonography and radiography. After these procedures, treatment is advised if necessary. Basically, DDH treatment is atraumatic involving abduction pillow, Von Rosen abduction device, <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harnesses.</b> Results. During 2007 and 2008, screening examination was performed in 769 boys (51. 47 %) and 725 girls (58. 52 %), born at the Medical Center “Veljko Vlahovic” in Vrbas. A total of 1, 494 neonates or 2, 988 hips were examined. Ultrasonographically, a normal type Ia was found in 406 hips (13. 60 %), intermediate type Ib in 2, 014 hips (67. 40 %), immature type IIa+ in 374 hips (12. 50 %), unstable type IIg in 39 hips (1. 30 %), decentering IId in 52 hips (1. 70 %), and eccentric types III and IV in 35 hips (1. 20 %). Of 2988 examined hips, normal finding was detected in 2794 (93. 50 %) and pathological finding (DDH) was found in 194 (6. 50 %). Ultrasonographical findings were determined according to Graph classification. Conclusion. The frequency of DDH in the regions of Vrbas and Kula above 5 % (6. 50 %) presents a social and medical problem in children of these locations. Eradication, early detection and treatment involve systematic examinations (clinical, sonographical and radiographical) in the first year of life. Treatment has to be initiated in a neonatal unit by atraumatic means. The team work including a gynaecologist, neonatologist and paediatric orthopaedic surgeon is crucial...|$|R
40|$|Introduction A {{clinical}} examination of a newborn infant is indispensable, but certainly insufficient for {{a diagnosis of}} developmental deformity of the hip (DDH) to be made. The use of the ultrasound in the diagnostics of DDH, beside the visualization and making the respective clinical findings objective, made possible verification (still without a distinction of the tissues) of the two basic categories of the primary condition of a newborn baby hips. Objective The {{purpose of this study}} was to find out the optimal methodological procedure for the early detection of DDH in newborn infants and suckling. Method During 2002 and 2003, at the Neonatal Department of the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics, Novi Sad, as well as at the Institute for Orthopedic Surgery "Banjica" Belgrade, there were 4016 newborn infants examined, i. e. 8032 hips clinically and by ultrasound. The standard Graf’s methodological procedure was applied completely, supplemented by the dynamic examination by pushing back and stretching femora along, that is by the techniques of Couture and Harcke. Results In order to categorize the condition of the hip of a newborn infant, the sonographic classification of R. Graaf, Th. Harcke and D. Pajić was used. The ultrasound analysis demonstrated a frequency of the sonotype Ia in 552 (13. 08 %) of the newborn infants, the sonotype Ib in 2934 (73. 00 %), the sonotype IIa+ in 481 (11. 97 %) and the pathological cases with sonotypes IIg 42 (1. 04 %), IId 17 (0. 42 %), IIIa 15 (0. 37 %) and IV 5 (0. 12 %). The total number of unstable critical, discentering and discentered cases of DDH was 79 (1. 95 %). The incidence of DDH was three times more frequent in girls, mostly bilateral; when unilateral, it was more frequent in the left one. The results of the early treatment were uniformly excellent, but in two cases there was established osteochondritis of the first degree (<b>Pavlik’s</b> <b>harness</b> 1, Von Rosen’s splint 1). Conclusion It has been proven that the {{clinical examination}} was inevitable, but insufficient for diagnosis of DDH. The standard sonographic examination should be supplemented by provocative dynamic diagnostic procedures in all immature, at risk and discentering hips. By doing so, it is possible to differentiate prognostically the hips evolving to a spontaneous normalization from those striving to a progredient decentralization. For a sonographic diagnosis, the first three weeks are essential, but for therapy, the crucial is the sixth week...|$|R

30|$|The {{majority}} of hips {{in this study}} were treated preoperatively in a <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> while only a few were treated in traction. However, treatment prior to MOR was not found {{to be associated with the}} development of AVN.

There are several theories as to the cause of AVN following MOR. Iatrogenic injury to the medial femoral circumflex artery is frequently postulated, although several authors have reported no correlation from cases that required ligation of the artery [9, 32, 33, 34].|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Debate {{currently}} exists {{regarding the}} economic viability for screening for developmental dysplasia {{of the hip}} in infants. METHODS: A prospective study of infant hip dysplasia over the period of 1998 - 2008 (36, 960 live births) was performed to determine treatment complexity and associated costs of disease detection and hospital treatment, related to the age at presentation and treatment modality. The involved screening programme utilised universal clinical screening of all infants and selective ultrasound screening of at-risk infants. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-nine infants (4. 8 / 1, 000) presented with hip dysplasia. Thirty-four infants presented late (> 3 months of age) and required closed or open reduction. One hundred and forty-five infants presented at < 3 months of age, 14 of whom failed early <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> treatment. A detailed cost analysis revealed: 131 early presenters with successful management in a <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> {{at a cost of}} pound 601 /child; 34 late presenters who required surgery (36 hips, 19 closed/ 17 open reductions, one revision procedure) at a cost of pound 4, 352 /child; and 14 early presenters with failed management in a <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> requiring more protracted surgery (18 hips, four closed/ 14 open reductions, seven revision procedures) at a cost of pound 7, 052 /child.

30|$|Improved {{strategies}} {{are needed for}} the 10  % of early presenting infants who fail <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> treatment and require the most complex and costly interventions.|$|E
30|$|Through {{international}} expert consensus, 25 essential steps {{have been}} identified in a validated objective structured assessment of technical skill (OSATS) for <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> application [16]. These steps were utilized {{for the creation of a}} simulated learning module that includes an infant doll model, an instructional video and a checklist of essential steps. While it has been shown to improve the ability of residents and allied health professionals to apply a <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> to the level of expert clinicians, it had not yet been tested on parents [14].|$|E
30|$|At our {{institution}} we systematically {{perform a}} hip arthrogram {{when there is}} a failure of the harness. We observed arthographic obstacles for reduction in all failures, which were confirmed intraoperatively [19, 20]. In our opinion, these findings suggest that Ortolani-positive hips that fail to reduce and stabilize within a <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> present a more severe distortion of hip joint anatomy. We believe that a more ‘teratological’ than mechanical hip dislocation could be the reason for the failure of the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> in these cases.|$|E
30|$|Comprehensive cost {{analysis}} revealed an {{annual cost of}} £ 104, 000 to screen 3, 360 neonates, identifying and treating early 13 patients, “missing” and treating late three patients. Late detection of DDH caused increased treatment complexity and a sevenfold increase in the short-term costs of treatment, compared to early detection and successful management in a <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness.</b> However improved strategies are needed for the 10  % of early presenting infants who fail <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> treatment and require the most complex and costly interventions (twelvefold increase in cost).|$|E
30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} the successful application of a universal clinical and selective USS screening programme for DDH over an 11 -year period. This required inter-trust coordination over a large geographical area and a skilled dysplasia clinic team. Successful <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> management of patients presenting early (< 3  months) was 90  %, irrespective of initial Graf classification of dysplasia. This {{is higher than the}} majority of the published literature [16, 17, 18], with only Uçar et al. [19] publishing equivocal success rates for both Graf III and IV hips. A relatively large proportion of Graf IV hips (33 / 206) was observed in our study compared to that expected from other DDH series [16, 17, 18]. All 10  % of children presenting early but failing <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> management had Graf IV hips. In these children, harness treatment was discontinued at an early stage (to avoid iatrogenic induced <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> disease).|$|E

30|$|The {{average amount}} of time that the test parents took to apply the harness {{increased}} post-intervention from 5 : 04 to 7 : 29  min. The mean {{amount of time}} for the expert group was 5 : 19  min. A post-intervention survey completed by the parents in the test group revealed that parents felt that their ability to apply a <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> had improved, with none rating themselves as very weak but none reported being very good either. All, however, reported being more confident about using the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> at home.|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound {{was used}} to observe the entire course of {{spontaneous}} reduction of CDH in the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> in nine infants. In six infants with Suzuki type-A dislocations, the femoral head settled slowly {{into the bottom of}} the acetabulum by gliding on its posterior wall. In type-B dislocations, passive abduction of the legs during sleep caused it to approach the entrance to the socket and then suddenly to slip in. Reduction with the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> is due to passive mechanical factors, and occurs only during muscle relaxation in deep sleep: no active movement is involved...|$|E
30|$|The {{regional}} dysplasia clinic {{consists of}} a consultant paediatric orthopaedic surgeon, a sonographer and a senior physiotherapist, all with a specialist interest and relevant training in DDH. All neonates undergo clinical examination and USS scanning with Graf assessment of DDH pathology on static US images and additional dynamic USS. <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> management is used for infants with confirmed DDH who are subsequently followed up at bi-monthly clinics for USS assessment of hip reduction within harness, with escalation of treatment to surgical intervention if reduction within a <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> fails.|$|E
30|$|Despite {{the safety}} of the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> when {{properly}} used, there may be some complications derived from its inappropriate use [7]. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVN), the most serious complication, usually occurs secondary to forced abduction or persistent use of the harness despite a failure to reduce the hip [7, 8, 9]. When treating a patient in whom the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> is not achieving reduction and stabilization of the hip, the treating surgeon has to decide when to move to a more aggressive modality of treatment (arthrography followed by closed or open reduction), which has also been related to AVN [10, 11]. Although most clinicians agree in discontinuing the harness when failure to stabilize the hip is observed after 3 – 4  weeks of treatment [2, 4, 12, 13], it is still unclear as to the best moment to abandon the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> or even if another modality of treatment should be the first choice in some cases.|$|E
30|$|In our series, the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> {{succeeded in}} 80  % of the Ortolani-positive hips. These results are {{consistent}} with previous studies [4, 5] and better than other published series [2, 3, 6]. Swaroop et al. [4] described an 85  % success rate of the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> in 52 Ortolani-positive hips (39 patients) when a protocol similar to ours was used. These authors described an increase in the success rate from 85  % to 93  % when patients with hips that remained unstable at 3  weeks of treatment in the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> were transitioned to a semi-rigid hip abduction brace [4]. Although they do not report any cases of AVN of the femoral head, we are concerned about the possibility of developing AVN of the femoral head if we force abduction with a rigid device. Thus, we prefer to perform a hip arthrogram followed by closed or open reduction if the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> fails to reduce and stabilize the hip. Arthrography is a proven method for identifying structures where {{it may be difficult to}} attain reduction and helps us to decide when to perform a closed or open reduction [15, 16]. Whether Swaroop’s protocol with a semi-rigid device or a closed/open reduction under general anesthesia leads to a higher incidence of AVN of the femoral head remains debatable.|$|E
40|$|Real-time {{ultrasonography}} {{has been}} used for diagnosis and screening of developmental dysplasia of the hip for several years. If diagnostic criteria are well established, the use of sonography in follow-up of treated infants remains extremely variable. The aims of this study were (a) to describe the normal sonographic anatomy of the infant abducted hip on an anterior axial view, and (b) to define the role of this approach in the follow-up of developmental dysplasia treated by <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness.</b> Thirty-eight patients with <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> had anterior axial sonograms in addition to their usual clinical and sonographic follow-up. Normal anatomy was inferred from the examination of 25 clinically proven normal hips in the same population. The best criterion of a normal positioning of the femoral head appears to be the alignment of the pubic bone and the femoral metaphysis. <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> was the only treatment in 32 patients. It was directly efficient in 22, after readjustment in 10 patients. Reduction was shown by anterior sonography in all of them. In 6 children, sonography showed no reduction and subsequent treatment by closed or open reduction was carried out. Anterior axial sonogram can show reduction of a dislocated hip in children with <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness,</b> but it does not evaluate its stability. It helps optimize the settings of the harness, and may predict a poor outcome, but it does not identify the cause of non-reducibility. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate success and complication rates of the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> in late-diagnosed hip dislocation (developmental dysplasia of the hip, DDH). We also set out to assess the additional value of an abduction brace for three to six months, when successful reduction using the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> was achieved. Methods We included 31 patients (31 hips, 28 female, right/ left 04 / 27) with late-diagnosed hip dislocation treated with a <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> between 1995 and 2008. The average age at the start treatment was 27 weeks (21 - 57). None were lost to follow-up; the mean follow-up was 4. 2 years (two- 10). Of these patients, 61 % were classified as Tönnis type 2, 32 % as type 3 and 7 % as type 4. Results Of 31 hips, 20 (65 %) were successfully reduced after the use of the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness.</b> The average duration of Pavlik treatment was seven weeks (three- 12). The mean time to stable reduction was six weeks (three- 11), after which the patients were weaned off the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness.</b> The mean age at final treatment was 19 months (12 - 28). Five patients (15. 0 %) developed radiological signs of osteonecrosis (Kalamchi and MacEwen classification; two group I, one group II and two group IV). When we com-pared the different Tönnis types a significant difference in successful reduction was found. Seventeen (81 %) of Tönnis type 2 dislocated hips were successfully reduced, while only two (25 %) of Tönnis type 3 - 4 hips were (odds ratio 25, p 0 0. 001). Clinical examination (e. g. limited abduction, posi-tive Ortolani, Barlow or Galeazzi) at the time of diagnosis was not significantly related to the success rate of the Pavlik treatment. The mean acetabular index (AI) significantly improved from 36. 5 to 30. 5 ° after initial Pavlik treatment to 22. 3 ° at final follow-up (4. 1 years). Conclusions Prolonged use of the <b>Pavlik</b> <b>harness</b> in late-diagnosed hip dislocation (DDH) Tönnis type < 3 is a safe and successful treatment option in the older infant. Although the AI was significantly reduced after the abduction brace, its additional use remains debatable, as no control group was evaluated...|$|E
