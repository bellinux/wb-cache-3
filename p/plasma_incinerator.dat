50|$|Skolkovo is {{an energy}} {{efficient}} city with minimal or zero emissions of environmentally harmful substances that ensures the total recycling of household and municipal waste. At least 50% {{of the energy}} consumed by the city will come from renewable sources. The well-developed water system uses significantly less water by Russian standards without compromising comfort or hygiene. The transport system prioritizes walking and cycling. The use of vehicles with internal combustion engines is prohibited in the city. Energy passive and active buildings {{that do not require}} energy from the outside and even produce more energy than they consume will be built at Skolkovo. Household and municipal waste will be disposed of in the most environmentally friendly way possible - leveraging the use of <b>plasma</b> <b>incinerator</b> technology.|$|E

In this paper, some {{discarded}} {{circuit boards}} in the <b>plasma</b> <b>incinerator</b> were incinerated by the converging - extended anode channel plasma torch, whose work principle and composition was described, and two experimental results were described, finally, {{the percentage of}} four major exhaust gas (CO, NO, SO 2, O 2) was reported, showing a good prospect on treating electronic waste with using the plasma torch.

This paper {{estimates}} the electrical energy loss on high-temperature plasma processing waste {{printed circuit boards}}. Using three plasma torch powers in big output power (60 W) and a plasma torch power in relatively small output power (30 W), after 4. 5 hours of high-temperature plasma incineration, 43 kilograms of waste printed circuit boards was successively fused at high temperature <b>plasma</b> <b>incinerator.</b> After calculating, the total electrical energy loss for four powers was about 1, 070 kilowatts &bull hours during sample incineration. ?

Time:December 22, 2012 - December 23, 2012. University of Wollongong, Australia; Northeastern University, China; University of Science and Technology Beijing; Hong Kong Industrial Technology Research CentreThis study {{aimed to}} that waste circuit boards in batches were incinerated by thermal plasma. Firstly, the working {{principle}} of <b>plasma</b> <b>incinerator</b> and the exhaust gas treatment main process were introduced, then, the experimental results was analyzed and discussed. Due to the thermal plasma processing waste incineration furnace has high temperature (1200 0 C above), all the organic ingredients in waste circuit boards, including dioxin, can be decomposed completely {{in a few}} milliseconds, no showing the secondary pollution and no producing furans and other carcinogens. In addition, after main exhaust gas (CO, NO) concentration change with time was carefully tracked, {{it was found that}} a large amount of CO gas was produced and NO gas concentration was within national safety limits during experiment. Although 44. 4 kg sample was incinerated, more than 1 kg of small pieces of metal like Copper was obtained from the cooling molten slag. Finally, it was obvious that the volume and weight of molten slag was far less than the ones of sample. The experimental result has important practical significance for protecting the environment, obtaining more CO gas resource and retrieving a variety of rare metals (such as Gold, Copper, Silver, Platinum, etc.). ?
