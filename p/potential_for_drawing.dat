50|$|Skillicorne's unique {{contribution}} to the town {{was to provide a}} broad vision for developing a potential attraction into a real one, and for engaging others in this enterprise without special regard for himself. His new wife was the heir to a number of land holdings in Cheltenham, including a field at Bayshill, rising ground to the south of the main street where in 1716 a mineral spring had been discovered. Initial exploitation of the Cheltenham waters by the Mason family had been on only a modest scale, and Skillicorne, familiar with the thriving Hotwells in Bristol, saw clearly the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> in more visitors to the town. In 1738 he and Elizabeth moved up from Bristol to Cheltenham, and he soon began adding more facilities to the original well. He enclosed the well itself, and built an elaborate well-house, a square brick building on four arches with a dome over it, and erected a pump on the east side {{in the form of an}} obelisk. He laid out attractive walks both near the well itself, and on a new axis (in due course known as the 'Old Well Walk') leading to the parish church at the heart of the town. He planted these walks with a variety of shrubs and trees. In this, he had the support and contributions of many local traders and gentry. A Bristol acquaintance, Norborne Berkeley MP, assisted in the landscape design. The reputation of the spa flourished, with Skillicorne presiding 'with esteem' over its growth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Soft errors {{arising from}} {{particle}} strikes to combinational logic circuits can be masked logically (by dominant inputs), electrically (the pulse is {{too weak to}} flip a node), or by opportune timing (the transient pulse arrives at a downstream latch when the latch is opaque). The latter effect—timing-window masking—is commonly approximated analytically by computing {{the ratio of the}} length of the latching window to the cycle time. This paper identifies the shortcomings of this analytical approach, and highlights the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> an intuitively attractive but incorrect conclusion from such a model: that deeplypipelined, high-frequency circuits are increasingly vulnerable to logic soft errors. We show empirically {{that this is not the}} case, and advocate the use of mean work to failure, or MWTF, instead of MTTF, to accurately describe the vulnerability of pipelined circuits. Furthermore, we identify a second-order effect—SET fanout—which increases the error-resilience of deep pipelines over their shallower counterparts, in effect reversing the previously-held intuition.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{global and}} {{regional}} climate modeling {{studies have demonstrated}} {{the importance of the}} initial soil water condition in their simulations of regional rainfall distribution. However, none of these modeling studies has been tested against directly observed data. This study tests the hypothesis that soil saturation is positively correlated with subsequent precipitation by analyzing a 14 -year soil moisture data set from the state of Illinois. The linear correlation between an initial soil saturation condition and subsequent rainfall is significant during the summer months, reaching a peak of r 2 � 0. 4 in mid-June. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that knowledge of late spring/ early summer soil moisture conditions can aid in the prediction of drought or flood years, but it does not necessarily prove that feedback from anomalous soil moisture reservoirs is the cause of anomalous summer conditions. Further analyses indicate that from early June to mid-August, persistence in rainfall cannot fully account for the observed correlations, suggesting the likelihood of a physical feedback mechanism linking early summer soil saturation with subsequent precipitation. However, spatial and temporal data limitations restrict the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> strong new conclusions from the Illinois study. 1...|$|E

40|$|Many landscapes are {{severely}} depleted of ecosystem services, especially industrial ones. Yet, abandoned and, in some cases, regenerating areas are often situated within a wider cultural landscape. With minimal further disturbance these ‘novel ecosystems’ {{have the potential}} for recovering some of the ecosystem services that were removed or impeded during and after human management activities, especially cultural services. Novel ecosystems are anthropogenic landscapes that cannot be returned to their original ecological status. However, some novel ecosystems may provide ecosystem services that were minimal or perhaps absent from their original form. This presents a dilemma for policy makers and planners, who now strive to meet societal expectations to restore ecosystems and recapture lost services. It is especially poignant when seeking to develop policy prescriptions that operationalise cultural ecosystem services into planning and design.

Drawing on research into post-industrial peatlands, this paper identifies a timeline for the recovery of some ecosystem services in novel ecosystems, including some that were absent from their original state...|$|E

40|$|This study blends {{critical}} {{discourse analysis}} with ethnographic {{inquiry into the}} nature of discursive constructions of subaltern identities in postcolonial contexts of news production by mainstream news organisations in colonial and post-independence Zimbabwe. The main thrust {{of the study was to}} establish continuities and disjunctures in newsroom cultures of production in colonial and in post-independence situations in which marginalized former colonial subject populations are caught up. It employs a multidimensional synchronic and diachronic case study approach where one newspaper organization specifically The Heraldâ€™s coverage of episodic forced removals of subject populations is studied across different historical moments. The paperâ€™s coverage is then critically compared and contrasted with that of other newspapers then in existence and contemporaneously operating at that time. The selected historical moments of forced removals were only heuristically chosen to the extent that they demonstrated the greatest <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> media attention and thus present an opportunity for the ordinary subaltern populations to appear in the news. The content analysis generally tended to demonstrate that the same canibalesque evident in the newsification of subjects of colonial domination was pretty much evident in the way news in the post-independence period constructed the subalternity of marginalized groups. The institutionalization of the so called universal news values tend towards symbolic annihilation of subaltern ways of knowing.

40|$|Although {{organizational}} births now attract considerable scholarly attention, {{virtually no}} {{effort has been}} made to distinguish conceptually among different kinds of births and to explore the theoretical and empirical implications of these distinctions. I develop two general perspectives in order to examine the causes of two key types of birth — organizational start-ups and entries — in the nineteenth-century life insurance industry of New York. Though the strategic niche perspective is strongly supported by the start-ups model, the market location framework is well supported by the entries equation. Hence, I show that the determinants of these forms of birth vary systematically, indicating that start-ups and entries (and other birth types) must be distinguished in future research. More generally, I discuss the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> on the core assumptions of the strategic niche and market location perspectives in order to develop a unified theory of organizational birth types. New organizations recently have been championed as seedbeds of technological innovation, creators of significant employment opportunities and economic growth, and the root cause of organizational diversity in modern societies.

In this paper we present the results obtained from trialling the GENTLE/S neurorehabilitation system assessed using the upper limb section of the Fugl-Meyer (FM) outcome measure. Methods We demonstrate the design of our clinical trial and its results analysed using a novel statistical approach based on a multivariate analytical model. This paper provides the rational for using multivariate models in robot-mediated clinical trials and draws conclusions from the clinical data gathered during the GENTLE/S study. Results The FM outcome measures recorded during the baseline (8 sessions), robot-mediated therapy (9 sessions) and sling-suspension (9 sessions) was analysed using a multiple regression model. The results indicate positive but modest recovery trends favouring both interventions used in GENTLE/S clinical trial. The modest recovery shown occurred at a time late after stroke when changes are not clinically anticipated. Conclusion This study has applied a new method for analysing clinical data obtained from rehabilitation robotics studies. While the data obtained during the clinical trial is of multivariate nature, having multipoint and progressive nature, the multiple regression model used showed great <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> conclusions from this study. An important conclusion to draw from this paper is that {{this study has shown}} that the intervention and control phase both caused changes over a period of 9 sessions in comparison to the baseline. This might indicate that use of new challenging and motivational therapies can influence the outcome of therapies at a point when clinical changes are not expected. Further work is required to investigate the effects arising from early intervention, longer exposure and intensity of the therapies. Finally, more function-oriented robot-mediated therapies or sling-suspension therapies are needed to clarify the effects resulting from each intervention for stroke recovery. </p...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} years a couple of {{emergencies}} have affected the Swedish municipality Ljungby and its inhabitants and forced the municipality to initiate emergency responses. Some examples are a flooding that happened {{during the summer of}} 2004, the storm Gudrun that occurred in January 2005 and the storm Per that occurred in January 2007. These emergencies, as well as other incidents, are situations with a great potential for learning. Constructive use of principles or rules gained during one experience (in this case an emergency response) in another situation is sometimes referred to as ‘positive transfer’. There are several methods available for evaluating responses to incidents and emergencies. However, such methods do not always use the full <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>drawing</b> lessons (i. e. positive transfer) from the occurred emergency situations. For example, when trying to learn from experiences organisations often tend to “prepare to fight the last war” instead of planning for the future. The problem is that history is not known to repeat itself in perfect detail. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose an approach to improving learning from evaluations of specific response experiences. This is done through adopting suitable theories from the field of learning. In the literature one prominent principle to facilitate the transfer process is to design the learning process so that the dimensions of variation become visible to the learners. Successful transfer for strengthening future capability demands that critical dimensions of possible variation specific for the domain of interest are considered. To demonstrate the proposed approach to improving learning from experience we apply it on the municipality of Ljungby’s responses to the consequences of the storm Gudrun and their managing of the flooding in 2004...|$|E
40|$|In 2013 the Cape Town {{municipality}} initiated {{planning for}} {{the second phase of}} its MyCiTi bus system. The first phase, on which preparations commenced in 2007, relied on incorporating existing road-based operators in a bus rapid transit (BRT) system. The municipality under-estimated the cost and level of effort involved in the wholesale corporatisation of paratransit operators while concurrently equipping them to become BRT operators. Learning from this experience, it developed a more incremental transition approach in the second phase, the first fruit of which was a pilot express bus service launched in mid- 2014. The pilot service contract also provided for a training programme for paratransit operators in the affected parts of the city to build their managerial and technical capacity. It was envisaged that programme participants would ultimately manage and run the long-term operating companies and contracts that would be established {{by the end of the}} three-year interim period. This article provides a critical review of the programme’s context, content and participant experiences after the conclusion of its first year.

Employing an analysis of semistructured, in-depth interviews with forensic and legal experts as well as representatives from the ECCC and the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam), the article explores the value of forensic science for the ECCC, including its impact on humanitarian issues in Cambodia...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how parents and their young {{children}} attended to mathematical concepts as they engaged in shared book reading. Thirty-nine parents and their 4 -year-old children from a culturally diverse metropolitan area were videotaped as they read Mr. McMouse (Lionni, 1992) and Swimmy (Lionni, 1963). Shared reading episodes were transcribed in their entirety and the data were coded according to a scheme developed by the authors (Anderson, Anderson, & Shapiro, 2004). All families except one engaged in mathematical talk although there was considerable diversity in terms of the amount of talk and the ways in which mathematical concepts were shared. The concept of size arose most frequently, next was different aspects of number, while shape occurred relatively infrequently. Results suggest that shared book reading holds considerable <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> parents to <b>draw</b> attention to mathematical vocabulary and concepts. In this article, we explore how parents and young children attended to mathematical concepts as they engaged in shared book reading. Over the past couple of decades, educators have promoted the use of children’s books to support children’s mathematical learning; there is a burgeoning literature on how to do this. (e. g., Evans, Leija, & Falkner, 2001; Griffiths & Clyne...|$|R
