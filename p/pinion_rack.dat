5000|$|In 1979, Tandon {{introduced}} the TM-100 diskette drive, a 5.25" [...] unit with 40 track support {{as opposed to}} the Shugart SA-400's 35 tracks. When Tandy {{introduced the}} TRS-80 Model III in 1980, they equipped the computer with TM-100s. The following year, Tandon obtained an even more lucrative contract when IBM released its Personal Computer. Until 1985, Tandon were the sole supplier of floppy drives for IBM PCs, initially the same single-sided unit used in the TRS-80, then the newer double-sided TM-100-2. Tandon would become the world's largest independent producer of disk drives for personal computers and word processors. In the mid-1980s, Tandon introduced a line of hard disk drives, making several models of the same basic design with a P shaped top cover and a <b>pinion</b> <b>rack</b> stepper motor off to the side. They also introduced portable hard disk drives that could be easily removed from personal computers. A major decline in North American computer sales during 1984-85 as well as competition from Japanese and Taiwanese manufacturers proved difficult for the company. Tandon sold its original data-storage business to Western Digital for nearly $80 million in 1988, and brought in former IBM and other computer industry executives in an attempt to remake the company as a leading producer of personal computers. By 1989, nearly all (90 percent) of its personal computer sales were in Europe, and its stock price had fallen from a 1983 peak of $34.25 to $0.50.|$|E

40|$|The work {{addresses}} the optimization {{of the steering}} and roll systems of an innovative four-wheeled tilting vehicle, which is currently being built at the University of Padova. The vehicle {{is a combination of}} traditional two and four-wheeled forms, with the driver operating a bike handlebar to steer, and throttle and brake inputs to control speed. Two pedals control the roll movement, while the gearshifts are made automatically. The steering system consists of a handlebar, column, <b>pinion,</b> <b>rack</b> and track-rods to the wheels.

40|$|The {{misalignment}} of the gears {{is one of}} the main causes of premature failure in gear transmissions. This misalignment can be caused by different phenomena where the deformation of the elastic elements of the transmission usually has a major importance. In this paper, a <b>pinion</b> and <b>rack</b> transmission is used to investigate the {{misalignment of}} the pinion produced by the deflection of both shaft and bearings, focusing in the contribution of the bearings to this misalignment. For this task, a design space with 261 different cases of <b>pinion</b> and <b>rack</b> transmission has been explored. For each case, a realistic 3 D FEM model (including gears, shaft and roller bearings) has been created and the coupled structural and contact problem has been solved. From the results of the FEM models, the different parameters of misalignment of the pinion have been computed and analyzed through five studies. These studies revealed the high importance of the elasticity of the bearings in the misalignment of the pinion and, in general, the important error that can be assumed when the bearings are not included in the structural models of gear transmissions.

40|$|There {{are some}} {{disadvantages}} for existing heave compensation systems of drill string {{used for the}} Floating Drilling Platform (FDP), including high energy consumption, large and complex structure, and expensive manufacturing and maintenance costs. In view of the above, we present a streamlined mechanical semi-active heave compensation system (MSAHC) in this study. This system consists of active compensation part with the <b>pinion</b> and <b>rack</b> and passive compensation part. In order to evaluate system performance of the MSAHC, we establish its simulation model with AMEsim software. In the process of simulation, displacement of rotary hook and energy consumption is regarded as performance parameters of the system. And the change rule of two performance parameters are analyzed by changing these design parameters including gear radius of the <b>pinion</b> and <b>rack,</b> scale coefficient of PID, rotary hook load, heave height and heave period of the FDP, and accumulator volume. Then, based on the simulation results of the MSAHC system performance, we have selected out a best set of design parameters from them. Moreover, the feasibility of the design scheme of the MSAHC is effectively verified by comparison with the existing three heave compensation system. The result shows that the energy consumption of the MSAHC {{is lower than the}} active heave compensation system (AHC) and the semi-active heave compensation system (SAHC) when achieving a same compensation effect as well as the accumulator volume of MSAHC is half of the passive heave compensation system (PHC). Therefore, the new designed MSAHC not only ensure compensation effect but also lower energy consumption, and its structure is simplified by adopting the simple mechanical structure to decrease manufacturing cost, maintenance cost and floor space...|$|R

50|$|A rack is a toothed bar or rod {{that can}} be thought of as a sector gear with an {{infinitely}} large radius of curvature. Torque can be converted to linear force by meshing a rack with a pinion: the <b>pinion</b> turns; the <b>rack</b> moves in a straight line. Such a mechanism is used in automobiles to convert the rotation of the steering wheel into the left-to-right motion of the tie rod(s). Racks also feature in the theory of gear geometry, where, for instance, the tooth shape of an interchangeable set of gears may be specified for the rack, (infinite radius), and the tooth shapes for gears of particular actual radii are then derived from that. The <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> gear type is employed in a rack railway.|$|R

5000|$|... ==How It Works == The {{steering}} wheel {{is connected to}} the hydraulic control unit, which contains a slide valve, the control gears and linkage, and the centring piston and cam. The steering <b>rack</b> <b>pinion</b> {{is connected to the}} hydraulic control unit through an adjuster, to allow setting of the centre point of the steering. This then drives one of the control gears, the other being driven by the {{steering wheel}}. The control linkage consists of two gears coupled with rods through ball-joints. When the gears are turned relative to each other, the rods move the slide valve, allowing fluid in or out of the rack. This moves the rack, which in turn moves its pinion, turning the control gears back to their centre position. Compare this with a conventional power steering system, which relies on the flexing of a strong spring to control the valve.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAmong the {{techniques}} used in surface finish machining of gears, the honing {{process has been}} highlighted due to high efficiency in the finishing of hardened gears and ease of adjusting the involutes profile and incident angle in the counter-part. The gear honing process is used to eliminate errors that appears after the heat treatment on the tooth surface and. Although the material and cutting speed of the tool {{are similar to the}} grinding process, honing the process simulates true cinematic movement of the mesh gear, which provides a better surface roughness compared to the Hobbing process. Consequently, it is hard to correct anomalies in the gear teeth. This process has been used to improve the mechanisḿs hydraulic steering <b>pinion</b> / <b>rack</b> system. For the experiments, it were compared two processes, namely honing and hard Hobbing in order to assess the adequate strength in the direction of clockwise rotation and counter clockwise, which represents the actual effort exerted by the driver of the vehicle. The honing process was lead using a 400 Fassler HMX machine tool. In order to assess the significant difference between the experiments, it was used ANOVA and Tukey test. The results obtained from the experiments using the honing process were satisfactory as compared the results obtained from hard hobbing process. Thus, it can be concluded that this process provides an excellent surface finish of the sprockets having a direct impact on the returned vehicle steering syste...|$|R

(The wheels are not capable of providing useful adhesion on such a gradient, so this is not the disadvantage it might seem.) The two driving axle pinions on a locomotive are mounted with a half a pitch difference between them. Combined with the half pitch difference in the two rack bars, this feature aims to make the transfer of power more continuous, and thus smooth the hauling of the train. In spite of this, the vehicles still suffer from very high levels of vibration.|$|R

The mesh stiffness of the mated gears, <b>rack,</b> and <b>pinion</b> is achieved via finite element method.

50|$|A <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> {{with two}} <b>racks</b> and one <b>pinion</b> {{is used in}} actuators. An example is {{pneumatic}} <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> actuators {{that can be used}} to control valves in pipeline transport. The actuators in the picture on the right are used to control the valves of large water pipeline.

The solenoid valve controls the air pressure coming from the input air line (the small green tube). The output air from the solenoid valve is fed to the chamber in the middle of the actuator, increasing the pressure. The pressure in the actuator's chamber pushes the pistons away. While the pistons are moving apart from each other, the attached racks are also moved along the pistons in the opposite directions of the two racks. The two racks are meshed to a pinion at the direct opposite teeth of the pinion.

40|$|Purpose. During {{operation}} of cold-pilgering mills {{rotation of the}} shafts is carried out by means of pinion gears being in meshing with stationary gear racks, which is accompanied by various tribological defects, that can be avoided during the detailed investigation and justification of selection and evaluation of kinematic and tribological characteristics of the system "pinion - gear rack".

To assess the runout of tribological pair cogs "pinion - gear rack" of the cold-pilgering mills we will use a system of differential equations of the first order. Using the solution of this system under the given conditions, it is possible to obtain relations for kinematic and tribological parameters. Findings. Relations for the durability, runout, sliding speed, and length of the line of the tribological pair "pinion - gear rack" contact are obtained. They provide high indicators of runout and durability of the system with minimum weight and overall dimensions of the design, which is an important factor to increase efficiency of cold-pilgering mills.

The analysis of the relations, which was obtained to identify durability, wear, sliding speed, and the length of the line of the tribological pair "pinion - gear rack" contact allows you to choose for cold-pilgering mills special pinions with the design parameters, which optimally satisfy the technological conditions of rolling.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to design and build a {{tabletop}} robot that could move {{the arm of a}} patient with limited motor function around on a table in any given trajectory to aid the patient in regaining function. The design that resulted from bench level experiments was that of an arm brace mounted to a moving base. The base needed to be omni directional to accommodate all possible trajectories of motion, the arm brace needed {{to be able to move}} vertically as well as be flexible enough to accommodate yaw, pitch and roll of the forearm. After choosing a three-wheeled design using TransWheelsTM, the base of the robot was built and programmed by Adam Kraft. The arm brace, which I designed and built, had a <b>rack</b> and <b>pinion</b> setup with a variable voltage regulator to control its vertical motion and a foam and linear spring combination to allow for yaw, pitch and roll while still providing for support. Testing of the prototype proved extremely valuable in refining the requirements of the robot as well as the design. Issues that were discovered during testing of the robot included drift of the robot, the inability to orient the robot the same each time, the slipping of the <b>pinion</b> on the <b>rack</b> if too much downward force is applied to the arm brace and the stiffness of the arm brace during yaw, pitch and roll. (cont.) Several suggestions were made for possible solutions to the issues, all which seem very feasible to implement. As it is the robot can only move the patient's arm, the patient cannot move the robot since the motors are not back-drivable. This is an impediment in allowing the patient to initiate movement, which is a critical part of therapy. Solutions were proposed that are worth further examination to determine their feasibility. In addition, with a few changes, the robot act as a guide to move a patient's passive arm along a preprogrammed trajectory to aid the patient in performing tasks such as reaching. Even if the robot is unable to match its initial goal, it has great potential to become a valuable asset to stroke patients with limited arm motor function. by Yuan Shu. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|This thesis {{reports about}} a {{six degrees of}} freedom (DOF) {{precision}} manipulator in MEMS, concerning concept generation for the manipulator followed by design and fabrication (of parts) of the proposed manipulation concept in MEMS. Researching the abilities of 6 DOF precision manipulation in MEMS is part of the Multi Axes Micro Stage (MAMS) project in which the disciplines of precision engineering, control engineering and micro mechanical engineering are represented. Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, or MEMS technology is generally based on lithographic, deposition and etching techniques also applied in the integrated circuits (IC) industry. The basis for these microsystems is a thin polished substrate usually consisting of very pure single crystal silicon, called a wafer. Roughly, since the 1980 ’s a lot of mechanical devices on the micrometer scale have been developed in MEMS technology. Some strikingly resemble machines that are very common in the large world, consisting of down-scaled gears, ratchets, <b>racks,</b> <b>pinions,</b> sliders and hinge mechanisms. Others are based on flexure mechanisms resembling large scale systems used for precision position adjusting and manipulation. There are also large differences between MEMS systems and macroscopic mechatronical systems. Where actuation in macroscopic systems is dominated by electromagnetic transduction, the preferred principle of actuation in MEMS systems is far less pronounced. Efficient electromagnetic transducers are difficult to realize in MEMS while actuators based on electrostatic attraction are more simple to fabricate and generally show better performance. On the micrometer scale, large electrical fields can be obtained at relatively low voltages and the breakdown fields scales favorable due to Paschen’s law. Other actuation principles often encountered in MEMS are electrothermal and piezo-electric actuation. Another aspect in which MEMS differ from macroscopic systems is the fabrication method, characterized by a ��? 2. 5 dimensional��? design freedom. This largely complicates the design of 3 dimensional geometries, especially regarding structuring of devices in the direction normal to the wafer-plane. This {{is one of the main}} reasons, the design of a 6 degrees of freedom stage for precision manipulation is a large challenge. However, the potential improvements obtained by downscaling a manipulation system encourage to research the feasibility of a 6 DOF precision MEMS manipulator. A miniaturized precision system does not only benefit because of reduction in size, but thermal drift is substantially reduced as well and the primary resonance frequency increases considerably. To put the development of a 6 DOF precision MEMS stage in a practical perspective, specifications are defined for a sample manipulator in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), capable of imaging resolutions in the A° -range. This application requires a highly stable system capable of strokes of § 10 mm and nanometer resolution positioning. In this thesis a concept for 6 DOF manipulation is presented, based on stacking of two 3 DOF parallel kinematic manipulators. One is used for the three planar DOFs and stacked on top of the other, manipulating the three out-of-plane DOFs. The design of the flexure based mechanisms is largely based on exact kinematic constraining of the DOFs. Limitations to fabrication of the desired mechanism rising form MEMS technology are identified and solutions are proposed. The planar 3 DOF manipulator actuated by electrostatic comb-drives is successfully fabricated in bulk SCS. Characterization shows largely linear mechanical behavior on the sub-micron scale. For actuation of the out-of-plane stage, a vertical comb-drive suspended by torsion beams is designed. To increase stability with respect to electrostatic side pull-in, the torsion beam consists of vertical and horizontal parts. A process is developed to enable fabrication of the required geometry for the torsion beams and the vertical comb-drive teeth in SCS. This process is compatible with the fabrication of the planar 3 DOF stage. Fabrication of the special 3 dimensional geometry still requires improvement and many out-of-plane devices show short circuits. However, out-of-plane actuation with a stroke of 10 mm has been observed. Increased stability with respect to side pull-in might also be obtained by a different kind of electrostatic transduction. In this case a dielectric plate or a floating conduction plate is partially inserted between to parallel electrodes. A voltage over the electrodes will result in a force pulling the plate inwards. In a first order approximation no forces in lateral (pull-in) direction are found. Finite element simulations (FEM) reveal forces in lateral direction do occur, however these are much smaller compared to the case of a comb-drive. Additionally, in case of charging, the lateral forces on a charge sheet between two parallel electrodes are modelled. The dependance of the lateral force on the lateral position of the charge sheet is found not to be highly non-linear like in the case of a comb-drive. This encourages the expectation that the alternative electrostatic actuators are far less sensitive to side pull-in than comb-drives. However, a proof of principle has not yet been realized...|$|R
