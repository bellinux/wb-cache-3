25|$|Witt's last {{appearance}} before Congress came in 1955. Harvey Matusow, former CPUSA member, had previously testified before Congress against his former comrades. However, in 1954, Matusow published a book, False Witness, {{in which he}} recanted his anti-communist testimony. In April 1955, the Subcommittee on Internal Security learned that Witt had obtained a cash donation from the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union to help Matusow get his book published.

50|$|As {{with all}} {{journals}} of the Public Library of Science, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases is financed by charging authors a <b>publication</b> <b>fee,</b> while advertising from companies that sell drugs or medical devices are not accepted. As of July 2008 the journal charges authors US$2,200 to publish an article. It will waive the fee for authors {{who do not}} have the funds.

50|$|Some universities, {{research}} centers, foundations, {{and government}} agencies have funds designed to pay <b>publication</b> <b>fees</b> (APCs) of fee-based open access journals. Of these, some will pay <b>publication</b> <b>fees</b> of hybrid open access journals. However, policies about such payments differ. The Open Access Directory provides a list of funds that support open access journals, and provides information about which funds will pay fees of hybrid open access journals. A substantial number of funds (40%) will not reimburse APCs in hybrid journals, including Harvard University, CERN, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Columbia University and the Norwegian Research Council.|$|R
5000|$|As an {{open access}} publisher, Dove charges a <b>publication</b> <b>fee</b> to authors or their {{institutions}} or funders. This charge allows Dove to recover its editorial and production costs {{and to create}} a pool of funds {{that can be used to}} provide fee waivers for authors from lesser developed countries. Articles published are available via an interface following the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting, a set of uniform standards promulgated by the Open Archives Initiative allowing metadata on archive holdings.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} by Jeffrey Beall that the journal offered to waive their article processing charge for authors whose articles would be cited more than 6 times (apparently including self-citations) {{in the first two}} years after publication. This practice is known as coercive citation. In a reaction, the editorial office stated that this episode [...] "was totally due to the inappropriate English expression of our newly joined editor" [...] and that [...] "the <b>publication</b> <b>fee</b> waiver based on the citations has been eliminated." ...|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, as {{the results}} of the AP {{examinations}} conducted by the administration were released, Jose Gabriel Mabutas was chosen as the new Chief Editor. During that time, two APs existed - the AP Inc. and the AP that was recently formed and was led by Mabutas. The former tagged the latter as the [...] "AP Bogus", which was able to publish only one issue. A few months later, PLM President Benjamin G. Tayabas suspended the collection of the <b>publication</b> <b>fee</b> because of internal problems.|$|E
5000|$|PeerJ is an open-access journal {{launched}} in 2012 that charges <b>publication</b> <b>fees</b> per researcher, not per article, resulting {{in what has}} been called [...] "a flat fee for 'all you can publish'".|$|R
50|$|However, {{the author}} must still find the money. Many funding {{agencies}} {{are ready to}} let authors use grant funds, or apply for supplementary funds, to pay <b>publication</b> <b>fees</b> at open-access journals. (Only a minority of open-access journals charge such fees, but nearly all hybrid open access journals do so.) So far, the funding agencies {{that are willing to}} pay these fees do not distinguish between full and hybrid open-access journals. On October 19, 2009, one such funding agency, the Wellcome Trust, expressed concerns about hybrid open-access fees being paid twice, through subscriptions and through <b>publication</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{editorial}} {{discusses the}} Ambiente & Agua journal’s efforts {{to adjust to}} new criteria {{in order to remain}} in the SciELO Brazil collection. Special emphasis is given to efforts intended to meet the anticipated levels of internationalization, professionalization, and sustainable funding models {{in order to maintain the}} journal’s high quality and increasing impact. The Editorial Board identified the need to raise <b>publication</b> <b>fees</b> beginning on July 15, 2015. However, since we have a hybrid approach that includes public support and <b>publication</b> <b>fees</b> to cover article processing charges (APC), the new rates will be much lower than the average international APC...|$|R
50|$|An article {{processing}} charge (APC), {{also known}} as a <b>publication</b> <b>fee,</b> is a fee which is sometimes charged to authors to make a work available open access in either an open access journal or hybrid journal. This fee is usually paid by an author's institution or research funder rather than by the author themselves. Some publishers waive the fee in cases of hardship. An article processing charge does not guarantee that the author retains copyright to the work, or that it will be made available under a Creative Commons license.|$|E

5000|$|OMICS {{operates}} {{on an open}} access model, wherein the author pays for publication and the publisher makes the articles available for free. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, some open access journals are legitimate, while others are vanity publications [...] "that accept virtually any article to collect fees from the authors." [...] There {{is not always a}} clear distinction between the two. The <b>publication</b> <b>fee</b> for OMICS journals vary from the low hundreds up to $2,700. OMICS also charges a withdrawal fee (stated as 30% of the article processing charge) should a paper be withdrawn more than a week after submission.|$|E
30|$|The {{authors who}} publish in AMSES remain {{the owners of}} their works and no {{transfer}} of copyright is required. Of course, this new publishing scheme requires that authors pay for the diffusion of their work, which is freely available for all readers worldwide, contrary to traditional schemes in which publication is free for the authors but readers must pay. In the case of AMSES, the <b>publication</b> <b>fees</b> charged to the authors are symbolic because CSMA, the French Association of Computational Mechanics, has decided to contribute three-fourths of each paper’s <b>publication</b> <b>fees</b> {{in order to ensure}} the best conditions for both the authors and the readers in our community.|$|R
25|$|Because PNAS is {{self-sustaining}} {{and receives}} no direct {{funding from the}} U.S.government or the National Academy of Sciences, the journal charges authors <b>publication</b> <b>fees</b> and subscription fees to offset {{the cost of the}} editorial and publication process.|$|R
2500|$|ResearchGate {{has also}} been criticized for failing to provide {{safeguards}} against [...] "the dark side of academic writing", including such phenomena as fake publishers, [...] "ghost journals", publishers with [...] "predatory" [...] <b>publication</b> <b>fees,</b> and fake impact ratings.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, {{the request}} for the {{increase}} in the <b>publication</b> <b>fee</b> was approved by the PLM Board of Regents. From P17 it became P30. During this time, AP then led by its Editor- in-Chief Isagani V. Abunda II established an 'open communication' with the university administration. According to Abunda, this is just a strategy designed to maximize whatever little opportunities the administration can offer to the publication and the students. Abunda called this move 'confidence-building strategy'. Despite of this, AP remained critical on several issues, particularly anomalies involving the previous administration and the plan during that time to increase the tuition fee for paying students of PLM.|$|E
5000|$|In {{part because}} of the low barrier to entry into this market, as well as the fast and {{potentially}} large return on investment, many so-called [...] "predatory publishers" [...] have created low-quality journals that provide little to no peer review or editorial control, essentially publishing every submitted article as long as the <b>publication</b> <b>fee</b> is paid. Some of these publishers additionally deceive authors about publication fees, use the names of scientists as editors and reviewers without their knowledge, and/or obfuscate the true location and identity of the publishers. The prevalence of these deceptive publishers, and what the scientific community should do about them, has been hotly debated.|$|E
5000|$|PLOS {{journals}} use {{a business}} model whereby expenses are recovered {{in part by}} charging a <b>publication</b> <b>fee</b> to authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. This enables the articles to be freely accessible upon publication, according to the CC BY license under which all PLOS content is published. PLOS Genetics normally charges $2,250 per article; however, fees are determined using a country-based pricing model [...] based on the country that provides at least 50% of the primary funding for the submitted manuscript. Editors and reviewers {{have no access to}} information regarding author payment for submissions {{in order to ensure that}} decisions to publish are based only on editorial criteria.|$|E
5000|$|Works of {{the winners}} and finalists of the Debut Prize are {{published}} annually in collections and individual books. The winners in all categories receive <b>publication</b> <b>fees,</b> {{and those on}} the [...] "short list" [...] get 20 author copies.|$|R
40|$|<b>Publication</b> <b>fees</b> as a revenue {{source for}} open access {{publishing}} hold {{a prominent place}} on the agendas of researchers, policy makers, and academic publishers. This study contributes to the evolving empirical basis for funding these charges and examines how much German universities and research organisations spent on open access <b>publication</b> <b>fees.</b> Using self-reported cost data from the Open APC initiative, the analysis focused on the amount that was being spent on <b>publication</b> <b>fees,</b> and compared these expenditure with data from related Austrian (FWF) and UK (Wellcome Trust, Jisc) initiatives, {{in terms of both}} size and the proportion of articles being published in fully and hybrid open access journals. We also investigated how thoroughly self-reported articles were indexed in Crossref, a DOI minting agency for scholarly literature, and analysed how the institutional spending was distributed across publishers and journal titles. According to self-reported data from 30 German universities and research organisations between 2005 and 2015, expenditures on open access <b>publication</b> <b>fees</b> increased over the years in Germany and amounted to € 9, 627, 537 for 7, 417 open access journal articles. The average payment was € 1, 298, and the median was € 1, 231. A total of 94 % of the total article volume included in the study was supported in accordance with the price cap of € 2, 000, a limit imposed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as part of its funding activities for open access funding at German universities. Expenditures varied considerably at the institutional level. There were also differences in how much the institutions spent per journal and publisher. These differences reflect, at least in part, the varying pricing schemes in place including discounted <b>publication</b> <b>fees.</b> With an indexing coverage of 99 %, Crossref thoroughly indexed the open access journals articles included in the study. A comparison with the related openly available cost data from Austria and the UK revealed that German universities and research organisations primarily funded articles in fully open access journals. By contrast, articles in hybrid journal accounted for the largest share of spending according to the Austrian and UK data. Fees paid for hybrid journals were on average more expensive than those paid for fully open access journals...|$|R
