50|$|Telmex {{started selling}} <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections</b> under the Prodigy Turbo brand {{name in the}} mid '90s. The service was then {{replaced}} {{for a few years}} with ADSL connections sold under the Prodigy Infinitum brand name. ADSL is now being offered under the Telmex brand name directly.|$|R
50|$|Inverse {{multiplexers}} are used, for example, {{to combine}} {{a number of}} ISDN channels together into one high rate circuit, where a higher rate connection than is available from a single <b>ISDN</b> <b>connection</b> is needed. This is typically useful in areas where higher rate circuits are not available.|$|R
50|$|Where {{an analog}} {{connection}} requires a modem, an <b>ISDN</b> <b>connection</b> requires a terminal adapter (TA). The function of an ISDN terminal adapter is often {{delivered in the}} form of a PC card with an S/T interface, and single-chip solutions seem to exist, considering the plethora of combined ISDN- and ADSL-routers.|$|R
50|$|A UNI cell {{reserves}} the GFC {{field for}} a local flow control/submultiplexing system between users. This was intended to allow several terminals to share a single network connection, {{in the same way}} that two Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) phones can share a single basic rate <b>ISDN</b> <b>connection.</b> All four GFC bits must be zero by default.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the Internet and {{widespread}} availability of high speed Internet connections, GIP could be redesigned to make use of Internet instead of <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections.</b> However, the industry has gone in the direction of using GAN/UMA, which substitutes an 802.11 or Bluetooth air interface for GSM/UMTS's and as such can use unmodified commodity infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} SNMP-based MIB for storing and {{updating}} management {{information in a}} Narrow-Band ISDN computer interface (ISDN controller). The ISDN Controller MIB has two major parts, the telecommunications part, which enables the manager to control and monitor the <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections,</b> and the data communications part, oriented to the monitoring {{and control of the}} data exchange over the ISDN network...|$|R
50|$|Two-way {{communication}} with AAC-LD is possible on usual analog telephone lines and via <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections.</b> It {{can use a}} bit rate of 32 - 64kbit/s or higher. Compared to known speech coders, the codec is capable of coding both music and speech signals with good quality. Unlike speech coders, however, the achieved coding quality scales up with bitrate. Transparent quality can be achieved.|$|R
50|$|Most probably, {{the fact}} that the system {{requires}} an <b>ISDN</b> <b>connection,</b> which in most countries where ISDN is popular is priced by time used, has made GIP a difficult sell. In practice, the system appears to be oriented towards carriers instead of individuals, and carriers can more easily create microcells using their own spectrum, running ordinary GSM and not requiring the use of special handsets.|$|R
5000|$|ITU-T Recommendation Q.931 is the ITU {{standard}} <b>ISDN</b> <b>connection</b> control signalling protocol, forming part of Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 1. [...] Unlike connectionless {{systems like}} UDP, <b>ISDN</b> is <b>connection</b> oriented and uses explicit signalling to manage call state: Q.931. Q.931 typically does not carry user data. Q.931 {{does not have}} a direct equivalent in the Internet Protocol stack, but can be compared to SIP. Q.931 does not provide flow control or perform retransmission, since the underlying layers are assumed to be reliable and the circuit-oriented nature of ISDN allocates bandwidth in fixed increments of 64 kbit/s. Amongst other things, Q.931 manages connection setup and breakdown. Like TCP, Q.931 documents both the protocol itself and a protocol state machine.|$|R
50|$|Some codecs can be {{configured}} to use ISDN, POTS or IP {{rather than}} requiring a different device for each network, {{while others are}} exclusively designed for POTS operation. <b>ISDN</b> and IP <b>connections</b> implement algorithms like G.722, MPEG, AAC, aacPlus, Apt-X and AAC-LD (low-delay), while POTS connections almost always use proprietary low bit rate algorithms. Consequently, while <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections</b> can usually be established between codecs from different manufacturers, POTS connections (and usually IP connections) can only be established between codecs from the same family. Some codecs can use GSM networks, and some have variable bitrate to compensate for poor connections. It is sometimes possible to bond two POTS lines together for redundancy and fault tolerance, and improved bandwidth.|$|R
50|$|DDR can be {{used both}} as a primary and as a backup connection. Today, DDR is mainly used for backup {{connections}} which go live when the primary connection fails. DDR connections are inherently slow and service fees are charged like phone calls depending on the uptime. DDR {{can be used}} with modems or Integrated Services Digital Network (<b>ISDN)</b> <b>connections,</b> which allow it to achieve a maximum connection speed of only 1.544 Mbit/s in the US and 2.048 Mbit/s in Europe and Australia.|$|R
50|$|ISDN is {{commonly}} used in radio broadcasting. Since ISDN provides a high quality connection this assists in delivering good quality audio for transmission in radio. Most radio studios are equipped with ISDN lines as their main form of communication with other studios or standard phone lines. Equipment made by companies such as Telos/Omnia (the popular Zephyr codec), Comrex, Tieline and others are used regularly by radio broadcasters. Almost all live sports broadcasts on radio are backhauled to their main studios via <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|R
50|$|In September 1996, {{the show}} experimented with local syndication, sending the show out via <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections</b> {{to a group}} of {{stations}} around New England. The local experiment was such a success that, in January 1998, ABC Radio Today started syndicating the show nationally. The show did not sustain a large nationwide following and syndication was handed over to SupeRadio. In 2005, Entercom Communications, the owner of WRKO, took over syndication and the show was only offered to New England stations.|$|R
50|$|Released in August 2000, Smoothwall GPL was {{developed}} by Lawrence Manning and Richard Morrell to provide a quick and easy-to-use {{solution to the problem}} of sharing their <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections</b> with the rest of their LAN. Created using Red Hat Linux, Smoothwall GPL originally had two simple functions: control the modem to dial and hang up, and to route TCP/IP packets from the LAN to the Internet connection, and back again. The LAN was hidden from the public network by NAT, applied using ipchains.|$|R
50|$|While the S0-bus {{allows for}} several <b>ISDN</b> device <b>connections</b> (up to 8), the Up0-bus can connect only two devices, one {{at each end}} of the cable.|$|R
50|$|ISDN Digital Subscriber Line (IDSL) uses ISDN-based digital {{subscriber}} line technology to provide a data communication channel across existing copper telephone lines {{at a rate of}} 144 kbit/s, slightly higher than a bonded dual channel <b>ISDN</b> <b>connection</b> at 128kbit/s. The digital transmission bypasses the telephone company's central office equipment that handles analogue signals. IDSL uses the ISDN grade loop without Basic Rate Interface in ISDN transmission mode. The benefits of IDSL over ISDN are that IDSL provides always-on connections and transmits data via a data network rather than the carrier's voice network.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a huge demand for faster Internet {{connections}} in Yemen, and that pushed the two ISPs, TeleYemen, operators of the service YNET, and YemenNet, through the state's powerful Ministry of Telecommunications, to introduce ADSL and <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections.</b> Also, the E-government project that started to give the citizens the ability to access web services and finalize G2C transactions in 2000 increased the number of Internet users dramatically. But still the quality of speed is not that up to the mark. There were 84,000 fixed broadband subscriptions in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Interoperability testing aims at verifying the {{possibility}} for two or more components to communicate correctly while providing the foreseen services. In this paper, we describe a new method for gener-ating interoperability test cases. This method is equivalent to classical methods in terms of non-interoperability detection. Contrary to classi-cal approaches, this method avoids the well-known state-space explosion problem. It has been implemented in the CADP Toolbox and applied to a simpli ed version of the <b>ISDN</b> <b>connection</b> protocol. The obtained results con rm the real contribution of this method: test cases has been derived while classical approaches face the state-space explosion problem. ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{surveillance}} context, an IP video server converts analog video signals into IP video streams. The IP video server can stream digitized video over IP {{networks in the}} same way that an IP Camera can. Because an IP Video server uses IP protocols, it can stream video over any network that IP can use, including via a modem for access over a phone or <b>ISDN</b> <b>connection.</b> With the use of a video server attached to an analog camera, the video from an existing surveillance system can be converted and networked into a new IP surveillance system.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Bell {{announced}} he would be leaving his longtime homestead in Nevada and relocating to the Philippines, near Makati, Metro Manila, intending to continue hosting Coast to Coast AM weekend editions via an <b>ISDN</b> <b>connection.</b> He departed the United States on April 29, 2006, stating an intention to remain abroad {{for at least a}} year, while maintaining ownership of his property in Nevada and of the radio station KNYE. Bell resumed hosting on June 18, 2006, but then encountered technical problems that kept him off air until July 23, 2006, when the ISDN line was finally installed.|$|R
50|$|X.25 is an ITU-T {{standard}} {{protocol suite}} for packet switched {{wide area network}} (WAN) communication. An X.25 WAN consists of packet-switching exchange (PSE) nodes as the networking hardware, and leased lines, {{plain old telephone service}} <b>connections,</b> or <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections</b> as physical links. X.25 is a family of protocols that was popular during the 1980s with telecommunications companies and in financial transaction systems such as automated teller machines. X.25 was originally defined by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and finalized in a publication known as The Orange Book in 1976.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995 Deutsche Telekom {{renamed the}} BTX service as [...] "T-Online". In Spring 2000, T-Online {{becomes the first}} major ISP in Germany to offer a {{flat-rate}} dialup plan for consumers. This was important because local telephone calls in Germany, including dialup access to ISPs, were not offered on a flat price per call (i.e., unlimited) basis. The flat-rate service was also offered to customers with <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections</b> at the same price as for analog service. In Spring 2001, T-Online announced {{the demise of the}} flat-rate dialup plan but offered a flat-rate DSL plan in its place.|$|R

40|$|We {{established}} a telehealth link between two inner-city health services about 10 km apart. The video-link between the sites {{was based on}} IP videoconferencing; <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections</b> were maintained {{as a form of}} system redundancy and to connect to sites beyond the local area network. The cost of a conventional consultation, in which the patient travelled to an outpatient appointment, was A$ 170. Because existing equipment and telecommunications could be used, the cost of a telehealth consultation was only A$ 74. During the study approximately 15 teleconsultations were completed and a number of patient transfers were cancelled because they were deemed clinically unnecessary. The preliminary results suggest that the cost-savings from telehealth can be substantial. In addition there were major benefits to continuity of patient care and clinical communication within the organization...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an X Window System {{protocol}} compression scheme called Fast Higher Bandwidth X (FHBX). Previous X protocol compression schemes {{were either}} much slower (Higher Bandwidth X) or much less effective (Xremote).

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{an accident}} and emergency teleconsultation service provided to 14 community hospitals in north-east Scotland. Each community hospital was equipped with a videoconferencing system and a document camera to allow transmission of radiographs. The network used 384 kbit/s <b>ISDN</b> <b>connections.</b> A total of 1392 teleconsultations were recorded during a 12 -month study period. Seventy-seven per cent of patients (n= 1072) were managed locally and 23 % (n= 320) were transferred to Aberdeen. The majority (95 %) of teleconsultations were conducted on weekdays, and 90 % of these occurred between the hours of 09 : 00 and 16 : 00. The mean delay in contacting a doctor was 9 min and the mean consultation time was 10 min. The majority of patients were suffering from fractures or suspected fractures of the limbs. Radiograph transmission was used in 75 % of all teleconsultations. A high degree of satisfaction was recorded by all users of the service...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{knowledge}} transfer for {{the determination of}} the suitability of stroke patients for a specialist surgical procedure (split anterior tibial tendon transfer). Gait analysis data from patients at a general hospital were discussed with an expert in another country using personal computers, an <b>ISDN</b> <b>connection</b> (128 kbit/s) and TCP/IP-based communication tools. The key issue was whether the staff in the general hospital became better able to determine suitability for surgery. Twelve patients were studied. In three of the first four cases the advice of the remote expert changed the plan for surgery. After that the treatment plans did not change after consultation. After eight cases the local clinicians did not need to ask for further advice. There was a rapid increase in skill in determining suitability for surgery. The experience and skills of the local clinicians were thought to increase more rapidly than would have been the case without the consultations with a remote expert...|$|R
5000|$|Terminal {{manufactures}} are Thrane & Thrane, Hughes Network Systems, and Addvalue. Terminal cost {{is between}} US$1800 and US$5000 varying based on class and {{capabilities of the}} various systems.
