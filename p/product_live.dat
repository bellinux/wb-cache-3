40|$|The {{abundant}} {{growth of}} molds and thermophilic actinomycetes in stored hay decreases its quality {{and can be}} hazardous for the producer who inhales these contaminants when the moldy hay is fed in closed barns. These microbes are responsible for a respiratory disease called farmer's lung. Products, including bacterial cultures that can be inoculated in hay, are available to prevent hay deterioration by molds and bacteria. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the effectiveness of Pediococcus pentosaceus (a bacterial inoculant) in preventing hay deterioration at different humidity levels in a laboratory experiment. Mixtures of grasses (mostly alfalfa, timothy, and clover) placed in plastic bags were treated with the commercially available <b>product</b> (<b>live</b> culture of P. pentosaceus) at 500, 000 and 5, 000, 000 CFU/g of hay and humidified at different levels (20, 25, 30, and 35 %). Control batches of hay (untreated) were prepared at the same humidity levels. The growth of inoculated bacteria in hay, pH level, and hay deterioration were evaluated. Under these experimental conditions, the growth of P. pentosaceus was abundant only when it was inoculated in very moist hay (35 % moisture), resulting in bacterium levels of 6. 3 x 10 (sup 8) CFU/g after 30 days. This abundant growth did not prevent the pH from increasing (final pH of about 9. 0), nor did it prevent molding. At lower humidity levels (20, 25, and 30 %), the bacterial inoculant used did not grow and did not prevent hay deterioration...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{elucidate}} the role that visual measures of attention to product and information and price display signage have on purchase intention. The authors assessed the effect of visual attention to the product, information or price sign on purchase intention, as measured by likelihood to buy. Design/methodology/approach – The authors used eye–tracking technology to collect data from Australian and US garden centre customers, who viewed eight plant displays in which the signs had been altered to show either price or supplemental information (16 images total). The authors compared the role of visual attention to price and information sign, and the role of visual attention to the product when either sign was present on likelihood to buy. Findings – Overall, providing product information on a sign without price elicited higher likelihood to buy than providing a sign with price. The authors found a positive relationship between visual attention to price on the display sign and likelihood to buy, but an inverse relationship between visual attention to information and likelihood to buy. Research limitations/implications – An understanding of the attention–capturing power of merchandise display elements, especially signs, has practical significance. The findings will assist retailers in creating more effective and efficient display signage content, for example, featuring the product information more prominently than the price. The study was conducted on a minimally packaged <b>product,</b> <b>live</b> plants, which may reduce the ability to generalize findings to other product types. Practical implications – The findings will assist retailers in creating more effective and efficient display signage content. The study used only one product category (plants) which may reduce the ability to generalize findings to other product types. Originality/value – The study is one of the first to use eye–tracking in a macro–level, holistic investigation of the attention–capturing value of display signage information and its relationship to likelihood to buy. Researchers, for the first time, now have the ability to empirically test the degree to which attention and decision–making are linked...|$|E

40|$|As a {{reaction}} to resource scarcity and a growing conscience for environmental justice, closing product loops and thus eliminating land-filling or other product-dead ends where possible becomes a task that many disciplines work on solving today.
