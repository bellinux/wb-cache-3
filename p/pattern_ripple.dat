40|$|Backscattering from {{electrically}} large low-absorption spheres {{cannot be}} fully {{explained in the}} framework of geometrical optics. This paper studies the role of the so-called horizontal branch of poles of the spectra and shows that the residues at these poles can be interpreted as creeping waves propagating on the concave side of the spherical boundary. In contrast to the well-known creeping waves propagating on the convex side of the spherical boundary, which are associated with the vertical branch of poles and rapidly decay with growing electrical size of the sphere, these new waves are much weaker attenuated and may dominate backscattering from electrically large low-absorption spheres. Analytical formulas for the contributions from the poles of the horizontal branch are obtained, and their relation to the irregular <b>pattern</b> (<b>ripple)</b> in scattering cross sections of electrically large low-absorption spheres is suggested...|$|E

A roughly omnidirectional phi-plane pattern was desired. The 1. 4 -wavelength diameter of the satellite and the various ports and structures on its surface presented strong constraints on the antenna array design. Eight antennas, each one a quarter-wavelength panel with one radiating and one shorted edge, were chosen. A phi-plane <b>pattern</b> <b>ripple</b> of 4. 4 dB and a gain of at least 0. 1 dB relative to a half-wavelength dipole were realized.

40|$|Abstract â€” This paper proposes an {{omni-directional}} UWB {{antenna pattern}} in azimuth cut, low voltage {{standing wave ratio}} (VSWR), and easy to construct antenna for ultra wideband (UWB) systems. The designed antenna uses the multi circular blade configuration with a radiating element and on two different ground planes (square and circular ground shape). The multi-circular blades UWB antenna suitable for IEEE 802. 15. 3 a and IEEE 802. 16 UWB communication applications at 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz and 2 - 11 GHz bands is presented and in specification. This paper discusses the phenomenon of dispersal in UWB antennas and presents a simple design to evaluate the radiated fields from antennas structures. About the characteristics of UWB antenna of antenna bandwidth, antenna efficiency, co-polarization, cross-polarization and pattern integrity are discussed and measured and compared.

Lenticular bedding can be subdivided according {{to whether or not}} they have connected lenses and the type of lenses they feature. Lenticular bedding with connected lenses can have up to 75% of discontinuous lenses. Lenticular bedding with single lenses has to have more than 75% discontinuous lenses. Lens thickness is based on a length to height ratio. Thick lenses have a length/height ratio that is <20 and flat lens ratio is >20. So the possible types of lenticular bedding are lenticular bedding with connected flat or thick lenses and lenticular bedding with single flat or thick lenses.|$|R

Using this efficient approach difficult, unanswered questions of surface growth and its scaling can be studied. The mapping onto binary variables facilitates effective simulations and enables one to consider very large system sizes. We have confirmed that the fundamental Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class is stable against a competing roughening diffusion,while a strong smoothing diffusion leads to logarithmic growth, a mean-field type behavior in two dimensions. The model can also describe anisotropic surface diffusion processes effectively. By analyzing the time-dependent structure factor we give numerical estimates for the wavelength coarsening behavior.

In this article, we extend continuum theoretical calculations based on the nonlinear Cuerno-Barabasi theory to regions yet unexplored in the continuum theory literature but recently shown, in Monte Carlo simulations, to be devoid of <b>ripple</b> <b>patterns.</b> We obtained results of weighted ion penetrations and for different impingement angles. Our results show that the balance of sputtering coefficients required for <b>ripple</b> <b>patterns</b> was never attained in this region, which confirmed that <b>ripple</b> <b>patterns</b> are indeed absent and that the continuum theory does not fail as previous studies indicated. In particular our results show a remarkable agreement between the continuum and the discrete (solid-on-solid) models; by calculations based on the continuum theory cascade parameters alone, we obtained the same topographic phase diagram predicted in the recent Monte Carlo simulation studies.

50|$|A {{regular and}} {{distinct}} <b>ripple</b> <b>pattern</b> on a sand, mud or gravel bottom {{is an indication}} that it has been affected by wave action. The surge of the wave at depth causes the particles to be moved backwards and forwards in the direction the waves are travelling. This movement produces a <b>ripple</b> <b>pattern</b> on the bottom which is an indication of the wave direction on the surface. The ripple crests will be approximately parallel to the crests of the waves that formed them. It is however possible for the surface waves to change direction, and due to shorter wavelength, not reach the bottom to change the <b>ripple</b> <b>pattern.</b> When this is the case there will be no surge at the bottom. If there is a surge at the bottom, and the ripple crests are perpendicular the direction of the surge, then the wave crests will be parallel to the ripple crests.

Rippled noises had a fixed delay of 4 ms, and spectral depth was varied by attenuating the delayed {{version of the}} noise. Temporal discharge patterns were analyzed using neural autocorrelograms, and {{responses to}} rippled noises were compared to wideband noise responses. Chopper units with best frequencies {{in the range of}} the first to second harmonics of the rippled noise showed large differences in discharge <b>patterns</b> between <b>rippled</b> noise and wideband noise responses, but chopper units with best frequencies centered at higher harmonics did not show large differences. Consequently, the Chopper group of units showed no evidence of a neural representation of the dominance region.

For Primarylike units with best frequencies around the third to fifth harmonics of the rippled noise, large differences in discharge <b>patterns</b> between <b>rippled</b> noise and wideband noise responses were observed.
