5000|$|As the {{particles}} grow, other molecules in the solution diffuse and {{attach to the}} surface. This process stabilizes the surface energy of the particle and blocks new silver ions from reaching the surface.

Percoll consists of colloidal silica particles of 15-30 nm diameter (23% w/w in water) which have been coated with <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> (PVP).Percoll is well suited for density gradient experiments because it possesses a low viscosity compared to alternatives, a low osmolarity and no toxicity towards cells and their constituents.|$|E
50|$|Burnish Gold or Best Gold {{is applied}} to the ware as a {{suspension}} of gold powder in essential oils mixed with lead borosilicate or a bismuth-based flux. This type of gold decoration is dull as taken from the kiln and requires burnishing, usually with agate, to bring out the colour. As the name suggests it is considered the highest quality of gold decoration. One solvent-free burnish gold composition was reported to consist of 10 to 40% gold powder, 2 to 20% <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone,</b> 3 to 30% an aqueous acrylate resin and 5 to 50% water.|$|E

Due to the instability of the radical, attempts to control the polymerization via most 'living/controlled' radical processes have proved problematic. However, RAFT (or more specifically MADIX) polymerization offers a convenient method of controlling the synthesis of PVA by the addition of a xanthate or a dithiocarbamate chain transfer agent.|$|E

It is made from <b>Polyvinylpyrrolidone,</b> a water-soluble polymer, and Carrageenan, a seaweed polysaccharide by the means of Radiation Processing to effect cross-linking and to sterilize the product into a final form. Through the process of Radiation Processing, Radiation-Sterilized Honey Alginate Wound Dressing was also developed; which is for exudating burns and wounds. It is made from local honey and Sodium Alginate.|$|E
50|$|In this method, <b>polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> (PVP) is {{dissolved}} in water by sonication and mixed with silver colloid particles. Active stirring ensures the PVP has adsorbed to the nanoparticle surface. Centrifuging separates the PVP coated nanoparticles {{which are then}} transferred to a solution of ethanol to be centrifuged further {{and placed in a}} solution of ammonia, ethanol and Si(OEt4) (TES). Stirring for twelve hours results in the silica shell being formed consisting of a surrounding layer of silicon oxide with an ether linkage available to add functionality. Varying the amount of TES allows for different thicknesses of shells formed. This technique is popular due to the ability to add a variety of functionality to the exposed silica surface.|$|E
50|$|Zinc acetate Zn(CH3COO)2 {{solution}} is prepared in ethanol under vigorous stirring until zinc acetate is dissolved in ethanol in temperature around 50 °C. Then ethanol is added and continuously stirred under temperature around 80 °C {{for half an}} hour. After that, the {{solution is}} cooled under room temperature. NaOH in ethanol solution is prepared by vigorous stirring with 50 °C, and then added to prepared zinc acetate in ethanol at room temperature. After that ZnO seeds are put in hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) solution, commonly called hexamine, for growth process. Hexamine is water-soluble chemical and the growth process {{can be done in}} the temperature range 55-95 °C. After ZnO nanopatilces are grown to desired shape, then the particles will be coated with silica particles by using Stoeber method. The process is carried out in ammonia-catalyzed reaction of TEOS in ethanol-water solution. <b>Polyvinylpyrrolidone</b> (PVP) can be added optionally for stabilization purpose. Hydrolysis reaction is initiated to form silica nanoparticles coated on ZnO nanoparticles.|$|E
5000|$|ZIFs are {{prepared}} by solvothermal or hydrothermal techniques. Crystals slowly grow from a heated solution of a hydrated metal salt, an ImH (imidazole with acidic proton), a solvent, and base. [...] Functionalized ImH linkers allow {{for control of}} ZIF structure. [...] This process is ideal for generating monocrystalline materials for single-crystal X-ray diffraction. [...] A wide range of solvents, bases, and conditions have been explored, with an eye towards improving crystal functionality, morphology, and dispersity. Prototypically, an amide solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is used. The heat applied decomposes the amide solvent to generate amines, which in turn generate the imidazolate from the imidazole species. Methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and water have also been explored as alternative solvents for ZIF formation but require bases such as pyridine, TEA, sodium formate, and NaOH.
