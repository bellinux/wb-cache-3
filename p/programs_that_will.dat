25|$|Some hobbyists have {{developed}} computer <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm, {{which is a}} type of brute force search. Backtracking is a depth-first search (in contrast to a breadth-first search), because it will completely explore one branch to a possible solution before moving to another branch. Although it has been established that approximately 6.67 x 1021 final grids exist, a brute force algorithm can be a practical method to solve Sudoku puzzles.|$|E

2500|$|Eric Rofes {{author of}} the book, A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer?, argues that the {{inclusion}} of teachings on homosexuality in public schools will {{play an important role}} in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals. [...] As a former teacher in the public school system, Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay. As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take radical approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality. According to Rofes, radical approaches are grounded in the belief that [...] "something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur."The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from anti-gay rights activists such as John Briggs. Former California senator, John Briggs proposed Proposition 6, a ballot initiative that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors, along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be [...] " [...] the corruption of the children's minds". The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum, in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools, has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> help them come to terms with their sexual orientation. Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs, such as Out There and Committee for Gay Youth, stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation.|$|E
