40|$|Impact by debris is a {{major cause}} of damage to {{buildings}} in hailstorms, windstorms and rockfalls. The effects of the impact need to be quantified so that <b>protective</b> <b>installations</b> including building facades, roof coverings and other forms of built installations that are exposed to the hazard, can be designed or retrofitted to withstand projected hazards in a rational and economical manner. This research covers this type of hazards in order to address the lack of information on physical properties of common debris materials, lack of guidelines on how to obtain reliable predictions of the impact, and the poor understanding of the fundamentals. The new knowledge and methodology to be developed in this poorly informed and understood area of technology should instill a new perspective to every engineer in their daily practices. Ultimately, a better understanding and quantification of impact forces would enable the development of innovative protective systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} in fire {{protection}} is the design of <b>protective</b> <b>installations</b> for single-storey warehouses of more than 6 m (20 ft) in height. The need to make maximum use of available floor area {{has led to the}} introduction of many such high stacked storages with differing degrees of automation and of heights up to 30 m (100 ft). These present a high fire hazard in both their configuration, which assists rapid fire growth, and in the high value of goods stored. This note describes an investigation of the effectiveness of high expansion foam, combined with different types of fire detection e~uipment, in controlling fires developing in a palletized storage of height 7. 3 m (24 ft), consisting of two rows of back-to-back pallets at four levels. The high expansion foam was found to be effective in controlling the fires with the range of fill rates and application times employed. It was found that early application of the foam was necessary to prevent the fire from reaching ceiling level and. that the foam cover might need to be maintained for some hours to ensure complete extinction of the fire.

40|$|Typical {{methods have}} been {{characterized}} of determination of the corrosion hazard caused by stray currents to metal structures transporting or storing aggressive media (e. g. fuel pipelines, tanks). Monitoring of the hazard allows determination of its extent, facilitates choice of the most appropriate anticorrosion protection method individually for each structure, and also enables evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} a functioning <b>protective</b> <b>installation.</b> This paper assesses the practicability of the above-mentioned methods. Application of methods leading to erroneous conclusions regarding the corrosion hazard of electrolytic corrosion in relation to real electrode processes occurring on the metallic surface of the structure can lead to dangerous consequences. The effect of corrosion processes is the corrosive perforation of metal leading to leakage to the ground of aggressive media, contaminating the natural environment. Seeking new un-equivocal methods regarding electrolytic corrosion processes proceeding on structures is a fundamental issue...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} fifteen years the Sacramento River {{has become one of the}} most popular fishing streams in California for steelhead rainbow trout, Salmo gairdnerii gairdnerii Richardson. Each fall, {{fishermen}} in ever increasing numbers travel from all parts of California, as well as from neighboring states, to participate in the harvest of this prized western game fish. The increase in the numbers of anglers has been brought about by an accumulation of events, foremost of which has been an explosive growth in California's population and in the numbers of people seeking outdoor recreation. Construction of Shasta Dam, with its stabilizing and cooling effect upon the upper Sacramento, has produced an environment better suited for steelhead. The Sacramento is also a favorite steelhead stream of many anglers because the best fishing is enjoyed during balmy days in the fall, rather than during the cold periods so typical of most winter-run steelhead fishing areas. This expanding popularity made it essential that the Sacramento River steelhead management program be evaluated to determine whether or not it is adequate to insure continued good fishing in the face of these mounting demands upon the resource. Provision of good steelhead fishing despite the inroads by man is a problem which faces conservation agencies along the Pacific Coast. The State of Washington has attempted to offset this increase in fishing pressure principally by a long-range management program consisting of releases of migrant-sized steelhead (yearling fish averaging 6 to 8 inches in length) to supplement depleted and heavily fished runs, coupled with <b>protective</b> regulations and <b>installation</b> of fishways and fish screens to protect the runs. The stocking of migrant-sized steelhead during their normal period of seaward migration has definitely built up the runs of sea-run fish in Washington streams. In California it had been the policy for many years prior to 1940 to stock coastal streams with fingerling steelhead in the summer months. The results of this program shed considerable doubt on the effectiveness of this type of artificial stocking. An experimental program at California's Waddell and Scott creeks from 1932 through 1942 revealed that only extremely small returns of sea-run fish may be expected from releases of fingerling steelhead, but that on the average approximately 2 to 5 percent may be expected to return as adults when allowed to descend to sea as yearlings at their normal migration time. Until the start in 1952 of the study described herein, the management program for Sacramento River steelhead had consisted primarily of <b>protective</b> regulations and <b>installation</b> of fish <b>protective</b> devices such as fish screens and fish ways. There had been no artificial stocking of steelhead. The only previous significant investigation of Sacramento River steelhead was included in a study of the sport fishery, which was made between 1947 and 1949. Prior to 1952 considerable knowledge had been gained through the years about steelhead in the smaller coastal streams of California, but relatively little was known concerning the life history of Sacramento steelhead or the merits of planting migrant-sized steelhead in the Sacramento River. Therefore, it was decided to examine this important resource more thoroughly and to find out if artificial stocking of large numbers of migrant-sized steelhead in the Sacramento was a feasible method of maintaining or improving fishing for adult steelhead. In 1952 the California Department of Fish and Game's Bureau of Fish Conservation (now Inland Fisheries Branch) initiated a project to determine the effectiveness and economics of supplementing natural steelhead production in the Sacramento River with yearling, hatchery-reared fish. Secondary objectives were to study the fishery and the life history of Sacramento steelhead. It was originally planned to have the field work continue until 1960 but was found possible to complete it by 1958. The study was carried out as a cooperative program between the California Department of Fish and Game and several other organizations which recognized the need for an evaluation of steelhead stocking in the Sacramento River. Two sportsmen's organizations, California Kamloops, Inc. and Steelhead Unlimited, volunteered to pay for the food fed to the fish at the hatchery and awarded one thousand dollars over a five-year period to fishermen who returned tags to the Department of Fish and Game. Three thousand dollars in merchandise rewards for tag returns were donated by several sporting goods stores and fishing resorts along the Sacramento River between Redding and Meridian. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service trapped and spawned adult steelhead in Battle Creek and reared the resulting young to yearling size at Coleman National Fish Hatchery on the same stream. The Department of Fish and Game paid a small part of the food costs for rearing the fish, marked the yearlings, released them, and evaluated the returns...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presents}} the inter-disciplinary multi-year project {{focused on the}} permanent seismic monitoring of a historical structure, the Basilica S. Maria di Collemaggio, {{by means of an}} advanced wireless sensor network. Considered among the architectural masterpieces of the Italian Romanesque, the structural behaviour of the monumental masonry church is strongly debated after the heavy damages and the partial collapse that occurred during the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake. From the perspective of information technology, critical issues in the wireless data acquisition and communication are analysed. The sensor network design, deployment and performance are discussed with respect to the high-demanding service requirements — as well as the non-negligible management costs — specifically related to the long-term monitoring of a monumental masonry structure in a seismic area. From the perspective of experimental signal analysis, the acceleration data collected during a 3 -year period of seismic monitoring are analysed in the frequency and time domains. The results allow the clear detection of complex interactions between the masonry structures and some of the temporary <b>protective</b> <b>installations.</b> Stochastic subspace identification procedures are applied, with critical analysis of their effectiveness in the assessment of reliable modal models from the building response to real seismic events. Finally, the robustness of the modal identification obtained from the structural responses to different near- and far-field micro-earthquakes is discussed, with the aid of numerical models of the damaged and protected church configuration...|$|E
40|$|The author {{departs from}} the {{assumption}} {{that there is no}} clear cut borderline between a human constitution and a natural environment, as these two consist the interrelated system, interacting in the respect of conditioning. Analysing the state of natural environment in Poland, the author is searching for the explication of the ecological crisis not only in the sphere of industrialization and urbanization processes in the country and applying no <b>protective</b> <b>installations,</b> but he is also offering reasons for it, of a social nature: the lack of tripartite division of powers (according to the Montesqueiean theory), and the lack of equilibrium of social powers which is practically manifested by the domination of a techno-bureaucratic lobby over other socio-professional structures as well the supremacy of the planning and executive power over the other ones. The traditional ecology and neo-ecology of a man are not relevant to the existing situation. New ideas and concepts have appeared (ecoarchitecture, eco- -pedagogics, eco-economics), as well as the desire, and sometimes the necessity to shape the environment directly (sociospatial planning) with the respect to problems of natural environment protection (sozo-ecology, or sozo-physiotactics; a Gr. word „sozo-" protect, keep alive) to save a man and his civilization. It is the author's suggestion to supplement the ecology of man by introducing a planning to the cultural order, to prevent degrading of nature by means of regulating economic competition in the biotic order (on a local level). Activity of man aiding the nature would be an ideal solution, or at least the activity not destructing it. The author precises the differences between the old ecology and new-ecology of man and social sozo-ecology, mentioning the following in the new concept: a wider understanding of the natural environment (also woods, waters wasteland, and monuments of the material culture independently of their economic use); space has a „continous" value irrespective of its economic use, evaluating it according to sozo-ecological or (sociological criteria (as an element of the non-spatial system of values- F. Znaniecki); particular importance is attributed here to rural and protected areas (e. g. national parks, wasteland) as to the „supplier" of ecological resources to the areas exhibiting their deficit, and as a condition of the ecological balance of a region or country. A notion of „subsocial relations" is reintroduced in sozo-ecology, to define solely interactions between men and nature.
