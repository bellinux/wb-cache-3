5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before running out of time. These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as <b>push</b> <b>buttons</b> and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; this room acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off.|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting <b>push</b> <b>buttons,</b> switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E
25|$|Various {{means of}} {{keeping track of}} traffic on the Ho Chi Minh trail were tried by the teams. In early 1967, the CIA's Technical Services Division {{forwarded}} a magnetic traffic sensor {{to be placed on}} the trail; however, it failed to keep accurate count or quit entirely. Finally, the CIA altered a U.S. Air Force survival radio into the Hark-1 radio, which had pictures of enemy troops and trucks next to <b>push</b> <b>buttons.</b> A road watch agent who could neither read nor write clicked a button for every soldier or truck counted; the tallies could be then be radioed to a relay aircraft overhead by the touch of another button.|$|E

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} the new design was the {{extensive}} use of electrically powered equipment instead of the hydraulic systems used by most aircraft manufacturers of the time. On the first two prototypes, the main landing gear was hydraulic. Starting with the third prototype, the undercarriage was operated by <b>push</b> <b>buttons</b> controlling electric motors in the wings, and was kept in position by electric up and down-locks. The armament was also loaded and fired electrically. Tank believed that service use would prove that electrically powered systems were more reliable and more rugged than hydraulics, electric lines being much less prone to damage from enemy fire.|$|E
2500|$|Factory {{electrification}} brought simple electrical controls such as ladder logic, whereby <b>push</b> <b>buttons</b> {{could be}} used to activate relays to engage motor starters. [...] Other controls such as interlocks, timers and limit switches could be added to the circuit.|$|E
2500|$|Tours can {{be taken}} where all stages of minting are explained, along with {{displays}} of past equipment. [...] This takes place via an enclosed catwalk above the minting facility itself. [...] Various video stations are placed along the tour route, where visitors can <b>push</b> <b>buttons</b> to watch videos about various stages of the minting process. [...] Most of those videos were narrated by Baseball Hall of Fame announcer for the Philadelphia Phillies (and voice of NFL Films), Harry Kalas.|$|E

He is {{one half of}} Ko-Wreck Technique along with DJ Craze. <b>Push</b> <b>Button</b> Objects has released recordings for labels such as Chocolate Industries, Skam Records and Schematic Records.|$|R
2500|$|The {{station has}} a control tower {{at the eastern}} end of the {{southbound}} platform, which monitors trains between Broadway Junction and the station, and controls the interlockings east of Euclid Avenue. The tower was the first in the subway system to use the [...] "NX" [...] or [...] "Entrance-Exit" [...] system. In this system, the tower utilizes a [...] wide, [...] tall electric light signal board which features a diagram of the nearby stations and track layout. It operates on direct current and consists of simple knobs and <b>push</b> <b>buttons</b> to control track switches, as opposed to the previous system which ran on alternating current and required a complicated series of levers.|$|E
2500|$|The US Army Bombe was {{physically}} {{very different from}} the British and US Navy bombes. A contract was signed with Bell Labs on 30 September 1942. The machine was designed to analyse 3-rotor, not 4-rotor traffic. It was known as [...] "003" [...] or [...] "Madame X". It did not use drums to represent the Enigma rotors, using instead telephone-type relays. It could, however, handle one problem that the bombes with drums could not. The set of ten bombes consisted of a total of 144 Enigma-equivalents, each mounted on a rack approximately [...] long [...] high and [...] wide. There were 12 control stations which could allocate any of the Enigma-equivalents into the desired configuration by means of plugboards. Rotor order changes did not require the mechanical process of changing drums, but was achieved in about half a minute by means of <b>push</b> <b>buttons.</b> A 3-rotor run took about 10 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The NFTA has a {{fleet of}} 27 (originally 29) rigid-bodied (non-articulated) LRVs for the Metro Rail system, {{numbered}} sequentially from 101-127. They were built by Tokyu Car Corporation of Japan in 1983. The cars' body shell design is notably {{similar to that of}} the earlier articulated US Standard Light Rail Vehicle, whose shells were also fabricated by Tokyu Car Corp. for Boeing Vertol. The cars have a maximum service speed of , but trains run at [...] in the above-ground section of the line. There are three sliding doors on each side of each LRV; these doors can be opened by passengers by <b>push</b> <b>buttons</b> on the outside wall of the train when trains are stopped at stations on the above-ground section of the line. However, in practice, train operators typically open all doors and extend all the retractable staircases at all above-stations. The NFTA acquired twelve PCC streetcars from the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority in 1990 for service on the never-built Tonawandas branch. They were later sold to the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association in 2003.|$|E
50|$|Some wall switch modules offer {{a feature}} called local dimming. Ordinarily, the local <b>push</b> <b>button</b> {{of a wall}} switch module simply offers on/off control with no {{possibility}} of locally dimming the controlled lamp. If local dimming is offered, holding down the <b>push</b> <b>button</b> will cause the lamp to cycle through its brightness range.|$|R

2500|$|In summer 2006, Brown started hosting The Contrarians, a 30-minute weekly show on CBC Radio One {{devoted to}} {{discussion}} of unpopular {{ideas in the}} Canadian context [...] "that just might be right". It consisted of Brown championing a controversial argument each episode {{to see if it}} had merit. The topics covered included a thesis that [...] "multiculturalism doesn't work, we just eat each other's sandwiches", a claim that feminism had basically achieved all its goals, a rejection of the widely held view that Canada is a 'good guy' on the global scene, etc. It aired Tuesdays at 9:30a.m. with a repeat the following day at 7:30p.m. The show ended once the new season began in the fall. According to Brown, the CBC brass didn't cancel the show due to being unhappy with its content, but because of catching wind of how difficult its production process was. Brown described his experience on the show as [...] "very difficult" [...] because the management wanted the show to be edgy and really <b>push</b> <b>buttons</b> while the different producers he was being paired with were uncomfortable with the subject matter because it often contradicted their personal convictions. He talked of the show's executive producer Lynda Shorten who simultaneously ran The Sunday Edition facing a near mutiny from her colleagues over the feminism episode and {{the relationship between the two}} souring as a result as he no longer enjoyed her support within the building.|$|E
