40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} <b>project</b> <b>and</b> <b>programme</b> reference models in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) system development. The trend towards AEC projects becoming more globalized, with multiple <b>projects</b> <b>and</b> processes being conducted concurrently, requires information systems to be widely implemented in the industry. However, current information systems tend to be specific and individually-centred offerings. Also, the existing knowledge {{for the implementation of}} information system integration is not helpful because different organizations have different characteristics regarding work, information, processes, culture, and ideas. To address these issues, research was conducted to review the existing information system models which can be apply to construction <b>project</b> <b>and</b> <b>programme</b> management <b>and</b> their effects on developing an information reference model for an AEC information system. The reference model can be used as guidelines for developing a standardized information system for enterprise project management with information integration practice for various organizations. The model {{can also be used to}} outline software requirements in the process of selecting a <b>project</b> <b>and</b> <b>programme</b> management software system in the market. Thus, adoption of this reference model as an essential foundation will affect the data management, knowledge management, information analysis and sustainability aspects in AEC system development...|$|R
