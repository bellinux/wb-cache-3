As pigment, lead(II) chromate (PbCrO4, [...] "chrome yellow"), Lead(II,IV) oxide, (Pb3O4, [...] "red lead"), and lead(II) carbonate (PbCO3, [...] "white lead") {{are the most}} common forms. Lead is added to paint to speed up drying, increase durability, maintain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion.

In some countries, lead continues to be added to paint intended for domestic use, whereas countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. have regulations prohibiting this, although lead paint may still be found in older properties painted prior to the introduction of such regulations. Although lead has been banned from household paints in the United States since 1978, paint used in road markings may still contain it.

5000|$|In 1972 a {{short grain}} crop in the USSR {{resulted}} in the Soviet Union quietly concluding grain <b>purchasing</b> <b>contracts</b> from {{a relatively small number}} of the secretive private multinational grain traders who dominated world trade in cereals. Because crop surveys in mid-spring had given the impression of a normal crop, FAS's agricultural attaché in Moscow chose not to follow up with additional crop observation travel, and thus missed a severe drought that set in after the last trip. As a result of this lapse, international grain traders and exporting nations were unaware of the Soviets' dire need for massive grain imports. By the time the scope of Soviet purchases became known, the USSR had locked in supplies at low, subsidized prices, leaving other importers and consumers scrambling for what was left at significantly higher prices. This event, known as the [...] "Great Grain Robbery", led to creation in the Foreign Agricultural Service of a satellite imagery unit for remote sensing of foreign crop conditions, negotiation of a long-term grain agreement (LTA) with the Soviet Union, and imposition of an export sales reporting requirement for U.S. grain exporters. It also impressed on FAS the need for [...] "boots-on-the-ground" [...] observation of crop conditions in critical countries.|$|E

40|$|RESUME This work is {{concentrated}} on issue of purchase of medical practices {{which in this}} market period gains the importence. Even though today there is bigger and bigger demand for this transaction, legislation is not very well adapted to that. Medical practice can be perceived as undertaking pursuant to § 502 civil code. Because of that, {{it is possible to}} sell it (besides other ways) based on legal title business <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> pursuant to § 2175 civil code. Legal title business <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> is in practice used often, nevertheless whole process of purchase of medical practice based on legal title business <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> is not smooth. I would like to highlight the problems which can emerge. It is possible to divide this work into two parts. The first part deals with legal definitions and legal analysis of basic legal terms as undertaking, medical practice, provider of medical assistance services. We can find here also justification why it is possible to perceive medical practice as undertaking. The second part is focused on business <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> in general with specifics, which can arise in case of purchase of medical practice based on legal title business <b>purchase</b> <b>contract.</b> In second chapter (after the introduction), I define in general the concept of undertaking and I also [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Some {{research}} {{have revealed that}} crop diversification and livelihood diversity can reduce the market risk, and embody the bounded rationality of farmer households’ decision-making (Chen et al. 2012 a; Li et al. 2013). Crop diversification is an important livelihood strategy among farmers in the study area. To avoid market risk, Farmer group I retains {{a certain number of}} parcels to plant other crops although planting scallion yields the most profit, and this practice {{is similar to that of}} other farmer groups and indicates that the strategy of maximizing benefits is not the optimal choice. Most farmers choose bounded rationality as their land-use strategy because of unclear market information on crop prices and uncertain supporting measures (e.g., supervising and managing the <b>purchasing</b> <b>contracts</b> by the local government).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-component assembly system that makes {{different types of}} <b>purchasing</b> <b>contracts</b> by component type and studies the issue of coordinating those contracts.

We identify the structural properties of the optimal short-term contract and investigate how the changes in system parameters affect the optimal performance. To provide managerial insights, we compare the short-term and long-term contracts for type 2 component and discuss the conditions that make the short-term contract preferable to the long-term contract. We also present a result which shows that coordinating the contracts of type 1 and type 2 components can be significantly profitable over uncoordinating them. 1...|$|E

Decisions {{in each of}} these markets are not mutually exclusive, {{and in the case of}} imperfectly competitive scenarios generating companies can use their market power to influence spot and contract prices. A model of oligopolistic market equilibrium is presented where the relationship between physical and financial markets is based on the impact spot prices and the variance of spot prices have on contract demand. Risk averse consumers are assumed to maximise a mean-variance utility in <b>purchasing</b> <b>contracts,</b> while risk neutral generators face uncertain input costs and compete with Cournot conjectures in the physical market. Results are presented that show incentives exist for generators to amplify cost variations/uncertainties in their quantity bids, in order to extract higher contract prices out of consumers. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{differences}} between the three scenarios mentioned in the section of data sources {{are related to the}} parties responsible for pest and disease control, with the local government usually supplying the control techniques through regular training. However, the scallion farmer cooperatives often offer face-to-face field training. Obviously, the efficiency of the latter is higher, and it is more easily accepted by farmers. A simple analysis of the effects of teaching techniques assumes that if the technique is taught by the scallion farmer cooperatives, then the entire farmer group can master the technique. If the training is supplied by the government, farmers whose agriculture practices are generally limited to subsistence farming cannot address their production problems. In addition, to further simplify the analysis, we assume that if there were <b>purchasing</b> <b>contracts</b> between scallion farmer cooperatives and farmers before 2010, these contracts will extend to 2015.|$|E
30|$|Land use {{in these}} two sampled villages was {{classified}} into eleven types: potato cropland, scallion cropland, residential land (for settlements), woodland, orchard, river, corn cropland, grassland, millet cropland, bean cropland and road (Fig.  1). The Gaoqu Commune {{has been a member}} of the third Batch Demonstrated Commune (an honorary title conferred by the government) of Shaanxi Province since 2010. To promote scallion planting, the local government in Gaoqu subsequently began implementing the “ 12 th Five Year Plan,” which includes three improvements compared with previous measures: (1) the government’s responsibility to respect farmers’ willingness to implement land-use policies was made explicit; (2) specific assistance measures, such as techniques of breeding, planting and pest control, provided by the government were made explicit; (3) government supervision and management of the behavior of scallion farmer cooperatives were made explicit and include the methods by which <b>purchasing</b> <b>contracts</b> are negotiated between farmers and the scallion farmer cooperative. Thus, the changes in local government measures, emergence of future standardization of scallion farmer cooperatives, and influence of the GFG project and market coupled with heterogeneous farmer households provides a dynamic platform for analyzing the formation of farmer land-use behaviors and further clarifying the mechanisms of interaction between farmers and agricultural policy.|$|E
