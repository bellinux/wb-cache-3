5|$|During the Second World War, Scotland was {{targeted}} by Nazi Germany {{largely due to}} its factories, ship yards and coal mines.http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/world_war2/scotlands_blitz/ Cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh were targeted by German bombers, as were smaller towns mostly located in the central belt of the country. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> air-raid in Scotland was the Clydebank Blitz of March 1941, which intended to destroy naval shipbuilding in the area. 528 {{people were killed and}} 4,000 homes totally destroyed.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that of 92 potentially possible modes of life – combinations of feeding style, tiering and motility — no more than a dozen are occupied {{by the end of the}} Ediacaran. Just four are represented in the Avalon assemblage. The lack of large-scale predation and vertical burrowing are <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> factors limiting the ecological diversity; the emergence of these during the Early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30.|$|E
5|$|The series also {{gained a}} new true/false {{guessing}} game called False Or True however <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> was L Castaway which saw two teams (boys against girls) {{spend a week}} on a small island in Loch Lomond with Tammy Huff and Toby Waterman from Castaway 2000 as their team captains. Each week would see different teams and the overall winners {{at the end of}} the series would win a holiday.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> court's {{creation}} <b>perhaps</b> constitutes <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> {{reform of}} international law since 1945. It gives authority to the two bodies {{of international law}} that deal with treatment of individuals: human rights and humanitarian law.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that pesticide exposure is associated with long-term respiratory problems. Summaries of peer-reviewed research have examined the link between pesticide exposure and neurologic outcomes and cancer, <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> things resulting in organophosphate-exposed workers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> single <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> {{moment of}} his career was his debut with the Indians. His first at bat {{as a member of}} the Tribe was a double off the wall in the 8th inning to break up a no-hit bid.|$|R
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's renown comes {{largely from}} his {{treatment}} {{at some length}} by Bede, writing from an uncompromisingly English and Christian perspective, and rests on his belated conversion to Christianity. His united kingdom in the north did not outlast him, and his conversion to Christianity was renounced by his successors. When his kingship is compared with his pagan brother-in-law Æthelfrith, or to Æthelfrith's sons Oswald and Oswiu, or to the resolutely pagan Penda of Mercia, Edwin appears to be something less than {{a key figure in}} Britain {{during the first half of}} the 7th century. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> legacies of Edwin's reign lay in his failures: the rise of Penda and of Mercia, and the return from Irish exile of the sons of Æthelfrith, which tied the kingdom of Northumbria into the Irish sea world for generations.|$|E
5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to be}} a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of computers is <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> single <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> technological breakthrough in this century. It is natural {{that it has}} not left untouched closely related branches of science like mathematics and its education. It is also natural that whichever fields have come into contact with it, heated debates have started and very different views...|$|R
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> {{driving forces}} behind {{adoption}} of bumper canards {{as a common}} modification to road-going vehicles is their widespread uptake in Japanese and US street racing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Jets <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> offseason {{acquisition}} was {{veteran and}} former Green Bay Packers quarterback, Brett Favre. Favre, the NFL's all-time leader in touchdown passes, completions, passing yards, interceptions, wins and consecutive starts by a quarterback, {{was picked up}} in a trade during training camp. Favre finished the 2007 season second in MVP voting and was named starter of the NFC Pro Bowl team.|$|R
5|$|In the Browns' biggest {{trade of}} the offseason, Brown sent end John Harrington to the Chicago Rockets for Bill Boedeker, a halfback. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> signing, however, was punter Horace Gillom, {{who had played}} for Brown at Massillon Washington High School and who Brown had {{recruited}} to Ohio State before World War II. Gillom could kick the ball further than most punters of his era. He changed the way teams approached punting by lining up 15 yards behind the center instead of the customary 10 yards to give himself more space and time to make his kicks. Gillom was also the third black player to sign with the Browns {{at a time when}} many teams did not employ African-Americans. Cleveland chose fullback Dick Hoerner in the AAFC draft, but he signed instead with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|Access to Scottish {{universities}} {{was probably}} more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was {{less expensive and}} the student body more representative of society as a whole. In the eighteenth century Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution the European Enlightenment. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment who had made their mark before the mid-eighteenth century included Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. He was an important link between the ideas of Shaftesbury and the later school of Scottish Common Sense Realism, developing Utilitarianism and Consequentialist thinking. Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746), appointed to a chair of mathematics {{by the age of}} 19 at Marischal College, was the leading British mathematician of his era. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> intellectual figure of early modern Scotland was David Hume (1711–76) whose Treatise on Human Nature (1738) and Essays, Moral and Political (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical Empiricism and Scepticism. He would be a major influence of later Enlightenment figures including Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham.|$|E
5|$|After the {{religious}} and political upheavals of the seventeenth century, the universities recovered with a lecture-based curriculum that embraced economics and science, offering a high quality liberal education to {{the sons of the}} nobility and gentry. It helped them to become major centres of medical education and to put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment thinking. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment who had made their mark before the mid-eighteenth century included Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow. He was an important link between the ideas of Shaftesbury and the later school of Scottish Common Sense Realism. Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746) was chair of mathematics by the age of 19 at Marischal College, University of Aberdeen and the leading British mathematician of his era. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> intellectual figure of this era in Scotland was David Hume (1711–76) whose Treatise on Human Nature (1738) and Essays, Moral and Political (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical empiricism and scepticism. and he would be a major influence of later Enlightenment figures including Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{university}} and government computer centers that use UNIX use Berkeley UNIX, rather than System V. There {{are several reasons}} for this, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> are that Berkeley UNIX provides networking capabilities that until recently (Release 3.0) were completely unavailable in System V, and that Berkeley UNIX is much more suited to a research environment, which requires a faster file system, better virtual memory handling, and a larger variety of programming languages.|$|R
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Gleeson court's <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> {{case was}} among its later ones. In the WorkChoices case (2006), the court finally {{explicitly}} accepted a wide {{reading of the}} corporations power, after years of gradual expansion following the Concrete Pipes case(1971).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Perhaps</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> {{turning point}} in Magdangal's career was her team-up with love team partner Marvin Agustin. The Marvin-Jolina (or MarJo in this social network generation), was the [...] "most admired, most {{followed}} and most loved team ups of their generation".|$|R
5|$|At Dürenstein a {{combined}} force of Russian and Austrian troops trapped a French division commanded by Théodore Maxime Gazan. The French division {{was part of}} the newly created VIII Corps, the so-called Corps Mortier, under command of Édouard Mortier. In pursuing the Austrian retreat from Bavaria, Mortier had over-extended his three divisions along the north bank of the Danube. Mikhail Kutuzov, commander of the Coalition force, enticed Mortier to send Gazan's division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns. They were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division, under command of Pierre Dupont de l'Étang. The battle extended well into the night, after which both sides claimed victory. The French lost {{more than a third of}} their participants, and Gazan's division experienced over 40percent losses. The Austrians and Russians also had heavy losses—close to 16percent—but <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> was the death in action of Johann Heinrich von Schmitt, one of Austria's most capable chiefs of staff.|$|E
5|$|The {{etymology}} of the term, “gandingan,” {{is unknown}} {{but it appears}} in many Maguindanao folk tales and epics. For instance, one folk tale states the Malailai Gandingan is a place known for a powerful sultan and his beautiful daughter while in another epic, Raja sa Madaya, Gandingan is the proper name of a place where hostile datus (who attempted to abduct a princess from the prince of Madaya) live. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> mention of the gandingan in an epic tale is in the Maguindanao epic Diwatakasalipan, where word “gandingan” actually refers to the instrument itself. In the epic, a young princess, Tintingan na Bulawan, uses the gandingan to inform her sister, Initulon na Gambal, about a hero prince, Diwatakasalipan, who {{was looking for a}} wife. Thanks to that message, Initulon na Gambal was able to entertain the hero prince using a kulintang into her heart. This use of the gandingan in this epic exemplifies that its use as a form of communication was pre-Islamic in origin.|$|E
25|$|In the past, Alneda.com and Jehad.net were <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> al-Qaeda websites. Alneda was {{initially}} taken down by American Jon Messner, but the operators resisted by shifting {{the site to}} various servers and strategically shifting content.|$|E
50|$|At its première, Robin Hood was {{accompanied}} by an orchestral score especially commissioned by Fairbanks and composed by Victor Schertzinger. That score has also been adapted and conducted live by US composer Gillian Anderson. Though the film has received many live and recorded scores since its first release, <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> are further orchestral scores written in 2007 by US composer and conductor John Scott, and 2016 by the eminent British silent film musician, Neil Brand.|$|R
40|$|It is {{remarkable}} that {{in less than}} two years so many significant developments have taken place that concern the United States and the struggle against transnational terrorism. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> three <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> are as follows: (1) the Obama administration’s failure to reject wholesale the Bush-Cheney administration’s counterterrorism policies and practices; (2) the popular revolts sweeping the Arab world, often referred to as the “Arab spring”; and (3) the US Navy Seals killing Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan...|$|R
50|$|Poetic realism was a film {{movement}} in France of the 1930s. More a tendency than a movement, poetic realism is not strongly unified like Soviet Montage or French Impressionism but were individuals who created this lyrical style. Its leading filmmakers were Pierre Chenal, Jean Vigo, Julien Duvivier, Marcel Carné, and, <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> movement's <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> director, Jean Renoir. Renoir made {{a wide variety}} of films some influenced by the leftist Popular Front group and even a lyrical short feature film. Frequent stars of these films were Jean Gabin, Michel Simon, Simone Signoret, and Michèle Morgan.|$|R
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> {{contribution}} the School provides to {{the community}} is care to area residents who are under- or uninsured. Along with the Detroit Medical Center, WSU faculty physicians provide an average of $150 million in uncompensated care annually.|$|E
25|$|The year 1797/8 was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> in Owen's {{career as}} a painter; in 1797 he painted the then Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger which he {{exhibited}} the following year along with {{a portrait of the}} Lord Chancellor Alexander Wedderburn.|$|E
25|$|The {{third of}} her Beloved trilogy, Paradise, about {{citizens}} of an all-black town, {{came out in}} 1997. The next year, Morrison was {{on the cover of}} Time magazine, only the second female and second black writer of fiction to appear on what was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> U.S. magazine cover of the era.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{culturally}} <b>significant</b> {{homes in}} town {{were built in}} Ivoryton during the 1890 to 1920 era. The factory was {{in desperate need of}} low-cost labor, and as a result, many immigrants from Italy and Poland came to work for Comstock, Cheney & Co. {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. The firm constructed many factory homesteads for these people. The great majority of these homes remain today, although most have been substantially altered. A journey through Blake, Oak, Walnut, and Chestnut Streets as well as Comstock Avenue is most revealing, as these factory homes give a glimpse into the past.|$|R
50|$|Marie Baptiste née Dumont, {{also known}} as Mademoiselle le Prévost (or Prevot) (born in Bordeaux, France - died after 1786), was a French actress and singer. She spent {{a large part of}} her career in Sweden, where she was <b>the</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> female star of the French Theatre during the Age of Liberty.|$|R
5000|$|Himmler {{intended}} for the SS to be a hierarchical system of [...] "ideological fighters" [...] from the organization's inception. The SS proved to be that and more, becoming <b>the</b> instrument <b>most</b> responsible for <b>the</b> actualization of Nazi beliefs. SS ideology comprised <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> single <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> philosophical dimension of Nazism, employing in the process, ontological, anthropological, and ethical elements to their methods {{under the guise of}} science, shaping the Nazi state's doctrine and crystallizing ideals (no matter how callous) into dogmatic truths. SS principles and thinking provided pseudo-scientific rationales for the devaluation of humanity, and ideological justification for Nazi violence and genocide.|$|R
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> rivalry game {{ever played}} against the Hokies was on March 1, 2007. The two teams played a men's college {{basketball}} {{game in which}} the winner would clinch at least {{a share of the}} ACC regular season title. UVA won the game 69–56 and took their fifth (of seven) such ACC titles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> {{time for}} Yorkshire {{music in the}} modern era was the local post-punk scene of the 1980s, where the county {{produced}} several significant bands who went on to achieve success, including The Sisters of Mercy, The Cult, Gang of Four, The Human League, Heaven 17, New Model Army, Soft Cell, Chumbawamba, The Wedding Present, The Mission, The Housemartins. and The Beautiful South.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} {{thirty years of}} their formation, Park played MCC at Lords, Surrey at the Oval and Cambridge and Oxford Universities as well as touring Ireland and Scotland. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> game of that era was when they played Lancashire in 1864. Staged in Warrington, it was the Red Rose's first ever fixture and ended in a close draw. A return game was later played back in Birkenhead.|$|E
50|$|Gone is a {{story about}} love and loss in small town America. Critic Rich Moreland stated, “Angie Rowntree and Sssh.com deserve {{congratulations}} for <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> thoughtful and <b>significant</b> porn film this reviewer has ever seen. It stands alone in defining adult film as art.” Madeline Blue was nominated for XBIZ’s “Best Actress - Couples Release” for her role in the film.|$|R
50|$|Shepherd's {{approach}} to racial reconciliation is <b>perhaps</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> contributions he made for Musaazi and his Federation of Partnerships of Uganda African Famers (FPUAF) union, and indeed for Uganda as a whole. Shepherd was in Uganda {{for only two}} years but {{with the help of}} his FPUAF colleagues left a significant mark on the political landscape of the country.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> of all <b>the</b> town's history {{took place}} in 1083, when the Count Albert, son of Arduin III, allowed the serfs to own homes, lands and any kind of good. This event, {{reported}} by official documents, he anticipated by almost seven centuries the democratic achievements towards the slaves, occurred in Europe only since the eighteenth century.|$|R
