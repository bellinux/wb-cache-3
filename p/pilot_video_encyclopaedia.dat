50|$|Vision Systems International (VSI; the Elbit Systems/Rockwell Collins joint venture) {{along with}} Helmet Integrated Systems, Ltd. {{developed}} the Helmet-Mounted Display System (HMDS) for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. In addition to standard HMD capabilities offered by other systems, HMDS fully utilizes the advanced avionics {{architecture of the}} F-35 and provides the <b>pilot</b> <b>video</b> with imagery in day or night conditions. Consequently, the F-35 is the first tactical fighter jet in 50 years to fly without a HUD. A BAE Systems helmet was considered when HMDS development was experiencing significant problems, but these issues were eventually worked out. The Helmet-Mounted Display System was fully operational and ready for delivery in July 2014.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{style of}} the CVP {{followed}} a strict direct cinema filmmaking approach because of a mistake that happened during the <b>pilot</b> <b>video</b> segment. The story was about a farm-to-table relationship between Harvest Moon Grille in Charlotte and Grateful Growers Farm in Denver, North Carolina. The video featured executive chef of Harvest Moon Grille Cassie Parsons and Natalie Veres, owner of Grateful Growers Farm. The audio from the interview that Lazes and Beaty recorded with Parsons and Veres was unusable, so they edited the video without an interview. The result was a voyeuristic, visually rich narrative that played in what some considered an avant-garde fashion. Lazes and Beaty, though, enjoyed the outcome and continued with a direct-cinema approach for the first trimester of the project.|$|R

Few published research papers concern the study of communication and language development among children with congenital deafblindness. The aim of this study is to explore and discuss linguistic features of what may be considered as tactile languages. By analysing one <b>pilot</b> <b>video</b> observation of a five year old congenital deafblind child communicating with his mother about a slide experience tactile linguistic features of phonology, morphology, semantics and syntax were explored. The linguistic features of tactile language were found to involve a potential unique and complex structure based on direction, speed and acceleration of movements, pressure, and body position. It is discussed how tactile languages, if they exist, can be studied from its unique bodily-tactile nature and not as a modification of visual sign languages...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} characteristic {{for an individual}} to actively participate in a society is to be literate (Martin, 2008). Consequently, digital literacy is an essential quality in our era. The European Commission (2013 b) reported that by 2030 90 % of jobs will require digital skills. In September 2013 the European Commission announced the launch of ‘Open Up Education’ initiative (European Commission, 2013 b) to improve the digital literacy in Europe through Open Educational Resources (OER). The overall aim of this change project was to introduce video-based educational resources in not-for-profit, third level educational institution. Literature review was conducted to identify the benefits and challenges of OER and the methods and mediums of delivering OER. Senior and Swailes’ change model was used as framework for the change. Different environmental tools were used to diagnose the situation and change champions were approached to do a <b>pilot</b> <b>video</b> to gain commitments for the vision. Gantt chart was used when developing an action plan to implement the change. Mixed methods approaches of qualitative and quantitative analysis {{were used to assess}} and evaluate the change by using Jacob’s change model. Overall the change agent is confident that the overall aim and objectives for the project has been achieved successfully with the biggest organisational impact {{is the fact that the}} college now has official contribution to the international OER movement...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the quality of oral {{interaction}} between a grade 5 class and their teacher when either English or isiXhosa was used as medium ofinstruction in two different lessons and of their writing which arose out of the lessons. The research was carried out within the interpretive paradigm and took the form of a casestudy. The researcher took the stance of being a non-participant observer. A variety oftechniques were used to collect data, namely, <b>piloting,</b> <b>video</b> recording and transcribing lessons, observing and making field notes, questionnaires and an interview. The interview was recorded and transcribed by the researcher. The two lessons were transcribed and analysed. Also the learners’ writing was analysed. The findings of this study showed that learners have little competence in English compared to isiXhosa. As a result most of them used short and vague sentences when responding to and discussing pictures in English. They also used short and simple sentences when writing in English compared toisiXhosa. Although this is a small-scale study it is recommended that the school’s language policy is revised and teachers are equipped with necessary skills, which would help them teach English to second language learners effectively. It is also recommended that the learners’ first language continue to be well taught even if it is no longer the classroom language. ...|$|R

40|$|Videotaped {{instruction}} {{has been}} an effective delivery tool for deaf online learners for many years, but it may soon be replaced by video streaming. Video streamed instruction delivered via the web has not become a stand alone viable option today for instruction of the deaf, {{but it is a}} valuable tool when used in conjunction with other instructional Internet tools. Video streaming is becoming more popular because more students are connected to the Web at higher access speeds at home, work or school. In order to achieve this success, a number of problems {{associated with the use of}} streaming video with deaf learners had to be overcome. These include the following: the speed at which some learners are connected; size of streamed video files vs. the clarity of the video which is to be streamed; readability of sign language if the video also includes a white board or projection from a computer monitor; cost and complexity of producing, digitizing, compressing and posting streamed video; size of the server where digitized streaming video files will be stored; captioning requirements of streamed video; and the necessity to interface with other software such as Flash for readable instructional modules.
