50|$|Bunion is an {{abnormal}} bony mass that forms on the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> and points outwards. This deformity is unsightly and <b>painful.</b> When the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> enlarges at the base, it can force the other toes to crowd against each other. Over time, the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> pushes outwards and alters the normal {{outline of the}} foot. Bunions occur for many reasons but the most common is not wearing proper shoes, arthritis and different inherited structural defects.|$|R
40|$|A 62 {{year old}} black woman {{presented}} with a chief complaint of very <b>painful</b> right <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> of one dayâ€™s duration. She denied trauma, fever or prior history of a similar event. Her past medical history includes hepatitis C, and depression. Social history revealed {{that she does not}} smoke or drink alcohol and she is a widow. Her current medications include Zoloft and Tylenol for occasional pain. On physical exam she appeared to be in pain while walking. There was an effusion in the right first MTP joint. Skin was warm and exquisitely tender to touch and movement. On lab evaluation, white blood cell count was 6. 5 mg per dl with normal differential. The uric acid level was 8. 1 mg per dl (reference 2. 0 to 7. 0 mg per dl). The ESR was 30 mm per hour. Other blood tests including electrolytes, BUN, Creatinine and liver function tests was all normal. Results of foot radiography are shown in the accompanying figures...|$|R

40|$|Background: Withdrawal {{response}} {{was used to}} explain extensor plantar response in population without pyramidal dysfunction but there is lack of data characterizing this response in normal population. Objective: To characterize withdrawal response from pain and tickle sensation in population without any neurological deficit. Methods: The study was carried out using four different stimuli, namely heat-induced pain, cold-induced pain, electric-induced pain using electromyography stimulator and ticklish sensation using superworm (Zophobas morio), applied to normal subjects in University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur. Results: Heat-induced pain resulted in flexion of the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> (61. 1 %), other toes (62. 3 %), ankle dorsiflexion (82. 6 %), knee flexion (83. 9 %) and hip flexion (83. 9 %). Electric-induced pain showed flexion of the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> (27. 7 %), other toes (28. 3 %), ankle dorsiflexion (51. 0 %), knee flexion (76. 0 %) and hip flexion (76. 0 %). Ticklish sensation showed flexion of the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> (14. 8 %), other toes (14. 8 %), ankle dorsiflexion (22. 7 %), knee flexion (21. 9 %), and hip flexion (21. 9 %). There was significant correlation between fear and ticklish sensation induced withdrawal responses and extension of <b>big</b> <b>toe.</b> Cold induced pain resulting in <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> flexion (6. 4 %), other toes (6. 9 %), dorsiflexion of ankle (7. 1 %), flexion of knee (6. 9 %), and hip flexion (6. 9 %). Females were more responsive to heat, males to electrical stimulation. The prevalence of <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> extension ranged from 11. 0 % (electrical), 6. 3 % (ticklish), 4. 8 (heat), to 0 % (cold), a mean of 5. 2 % overall. Conclusion: Withdrawal response caused by nociceptive and ticklish sensation consists mostly of <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> flexion and of other toes, ankle dorsiflexion and flexion of the knee and hip. Extension of the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> is seen in about 5 % of all the stimulation...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveHyperextension of the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> is {{described}} {{here as a}} simple and reliable sign to predict undercorrection of cavus deformity of clubfoot in the Ponseti Method. Materials & MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted on children with clubfoot who were treated successfully by Ponseti Method in the King Fahad Hospital, Saudi Arabia, and Emam Reza Hospital, Mashad, Iran, from 2003 through 2008. The total number of the patients in our study was 191, with 306 affected feet. Of them, 115 children had bilateral clubfeet (230 feet) and 76 had unilateral clubfoot. There were 119 males and 72 females. Hyperextension of the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> at MTPJ was present in five cases of clubfoot. The average follow-up period was 20 months (range: 8 - 38 months). ResultsThe authors observed that hyperextension of <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> at MTPJ had a linear relationship with the severity of cavus deformity of clubfoot. On the other hand, the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> had a normal relationship with other toes after satisfactory treatment of the initial or relapsed cavus deformity by Ponseti Method. ConclusionHyperextension of the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> at MTPJ {{can be regarded as}} a reliable prognostic sign for detecting the severity, correction, and the number of castings needed for cavus deformity correction in clubfoot treatment in the Ponseti Method...|$|R
40|$|Large {{forces are}} {{generated}} under the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> in the push-off phase of walking. The largest flexor muscle of the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> is the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), which likely contributes substantially to these forces. This study examined FHL function {{at different levels}} of isometric plantarflexion torque and in the push-off phase at different speeds of walking. FHL and calf muscle activity were measured with surface EMG and plantar pressure was recorded with pressure insoles. FHL activity was compared to the activity of the calf muscles. Force and impulse values were calculated under the <b>big</b> <b>toe,</b> and were compared to the entire pressed area of the insole to determine the relative contribution of <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> flexion forces to the ground reaction force. FHL activity increased with increasing plantarflexion torque level (F= 2. 8, P= 0. 024) and with increasing walking speed (F= 11. 608, P< 0. 001). No differences were observed in the relative contribution of the force under the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> to the entire sole between different plantarflexion torque levels (F= 0. 836, P= 0. 529). On the contrary, in the push-off phase of walking, peak force under the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> increased at a higher rate than force under the other areas of the plantar surface (F= 3. 801, P= 0. 018), implying a greater relative contribution to total force at faster speeds. Moreover, substantial differences were found between isometric plantarflexion and walking concerning FHL activity relative to that of the calf muscles, highlighting the task-dependant behaviour of FHL...|$|R
