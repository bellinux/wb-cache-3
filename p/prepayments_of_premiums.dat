40|$|We use data on life {{insurance}} contracts {{to study the}} properties of long-term contracts {{in a world where}} buyers cannot commit to a contract. The data are especially suited to test a theory of dynamic contracting since they include information on the entire profile <b>of</b> future <b>premiums.</b> All the patterns in the data fit the theoretical predictions of a model with symmetric learning and one-sided commitment à la Harris and Holmstom. The lack of commitment by consumers shapes contracts in the way predicted by the theory: all contracts involve front-loading (<b>prepayment)</b> <b>of</b> <b>premiums.</b> Front-loading generates a partial lock-in of consumers; more front-loading is associated with lower lapsation. Moreover, contracts that are more front-loaded have a lower present value <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> over the period of coverage. This is consistent with the idea that front-loading enhances consumer commitment and that more front-loaded contracts retain better risk pools. © 2001 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R
40|$|Contact author. 1 Although {{extensive}} {{studies have}} been done to examine the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> primary mortgages, not much has been done to analyze the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. This paper studies the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> fixed-rate home equity loans using a large loan-level sample for the period 1995 to 1998. We find that <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans is sensitive to changes in market interest rates, indicating that borrowers refinance their loans when market interest rates are lower than coupon interest rates. We also find that trends in interest rate changes {{play an important role in}} borrower prepayment decisions. When borrowers expect market interest rates to decrease further, they will wait for better opportunities to prepay their home equity loans even when the loans are already “in the money. ” Loan size and borrower creditworthiness also affect the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. However, the loan-to-value ratio, an important factor in primary mortgage prepayment, has little effect on the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. This paper also documents the effect of payment delinquencies on prepayment behavior. Borrowers with either minor or major delinquencies in making monthly payments are less likely to prepay their home equity loans. ...|$|R

Using {{data from the}} period 1985 - 1992, the analysis indicates that the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> thirty year FRMs was determined primarily by house price appreciation and personal income growth and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> fifteen year FRMs was determined primarily by interest rate changes. ARMs were prepaid less frequently than FRMs, {{were less likely to}} be prepaid when interest rates declined and defaulted more often than FRMs. The analysis provides evidence that ARM holders are less mobile than FRM holders.

40|$|In this paper, it {{is shown}} {{that with a}} certain {{definition}} of risk-based discounted loss reserves and a certain method of surplus allocation, there is an amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> for a contract which has the following properties: (1.) It is the amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> required for the contract to neither help nor hurt the insurer's risk-return relation. (2.) It produces an {{internal rate of return}} equal to the insurer's target return. If the insurer gets more than this amount <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> then the insurer can get more return with the same risk by increasing the percentage <b>of</b> the <b>premium</b> for the overall book which is in the segment. Conversely, if the insurer gets less than this amount <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> the insurer can increase its return by decreasing the percentage <b>of</b> the overall <b>premium</b> which is in the segment. The amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> is equal to the risk-based premium in "Pricing to Optimize an Insurer's Risk-Return Relation, " (PCAS 1996).
