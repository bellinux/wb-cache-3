40|$|In {{stratified}} geophysical flows, the energetically optimal {{exchange of}} dense fluid across a topographic barrier generally {{takes place at}} the deepest unblocked connection, which is typically a saddle <b>point</b> (<b>sill).</b> The flow at or near a sill is often hydraulically controlled, in which case the sill is called a controlling sill. Oceanographic examples include overflows of newly formed dense water at high latitudes as well as sills in channels connecting major ocean basins, such as the Strait of Gibraltar. Controlling sills are usually associated with strong flows, making them ideal sites for monitoring transport and hydrographic variability. The locations and depths of controlling sills also provide strong constraints for the downstream hydrographic properties below sill depth. Here, two algorithms for finding sills in digital topographic maps are presented. The first approximates the sill height to arbitrary precision in steps, where k is the number of data points in the map. The second algorithm, which requires steps, additionally returns the sill location. Several tests carried out with realistic problems from physical oceanography reveal that the second algorithm runs faster in practice, even though its worst case behavior is worse...|$|R

40|$|A geoarchaeological {{investigation}} was north of Highway 11 / 17, 34 km east of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Five archaeological sites (Mackenzie 1, Mackenzie 2, RLF, Woodpecker 1, and Woodpecker 2) and seven additional sediment exposures were examined for stratigraphic analysis {{to accompany the}} archaeological excavations. River-mouth sediments at 268 m asl {{and a series of}} deltas indicate that the study area was subaqueous while placement of the Superior lobe prevented drainage to the Superior basin. This elevation is consistent with Lake Beaver Bay, an ice-contact lake that received glacial meltwater from the north (the Hudson Bay lobe) as well as the south (the Superior lobe). This is demonstrated by southward and northward prograding deltaic sequences within the study area. As the Superior lobe made its final retreat, Lake Beaver Bay dissipated into the Superior basin marking the beginning of the Minong phase, likely around 9, 900 14 C yrs BP. Additional sequences representing river-mouth, beach shoreface, and deltaic depositional environments indicate that a series of shorelines within the study area represent subsequent Minong lake levels. The highest, and likely oldest of these strandlines is an erosional feature at 256 m asl, consistent with wave-cut terraces previously identified in the Thunder Bay region. Relative lake level drops occurred, likely due to a combination of gradual erosion of the Nadoway <b>Point</b> <b>sill</b> and isostatic rebound of the recently deglaciated land. Beach and river-mouth sequences representing subsequent shorelines are located at 249 m, 243 m, and 240 m asl. Artifacts on each of these beach terraces suggest they were occupied by Paleoindian groups...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that Svalbard glaciers have retreated and thinned since the Little Ice Age. The analysis of glacial landforms and sediment deposits in the terrestrial and marine environments permits {{the reconstruction of the}} temporal and spatial variability of recent deglaciations. This study is founded on the analysis and interpretation of a geomorphological map (1 : 10000) of the foreland of Nordenskiöldbreen (inner Billefjorden, Svalbard). The map covers an area of ca. 43 km 2 and is constructed from a combination of field observations and remotely sensed imagery from both the terrestrial and marine environments. Landforms are classified into six genetic categories: (1) subglacial, (2) ice-marginal, (3) supraglacial, (4) proglacial, (5) periglacial and (6) coastal. Glacier front positions from 1896 to present are reconstructed using historical data, oblique and vertical aerial imagery and LANDSAT and ASTER imagery. The preservation of the landform record differs between the terrestrial and marine archive. Previous studies of this region have focused on either marine or terrestrial archives and have failed to capture the complexities of the Nordenskiöldbreen forefield. As a result, pre-existing landsystem models are not applicable to Nordenskiöldbreen. The results of this investigation suggest Nordenskiöldbreen has been a dynamic glacier with components of all Svalbard type glaciers. The retreat pattern reconstructed in this thesis indicates that water depth and bedrock pinning <b>points</b> (<b>sills)</b> {{played an important role in}} the antecedent stability of Nordenskiöldbreen. Additionally, existing landsystem models fail to capture the complexity of glaciers with a combined terrestrial and marine terminus such as Nordenskiöldbreen. The application of these models should therefore be carefully considered when investigating glaciers with a mixed terminus. This study contributes to an improved understanding of Svalbard glaciers and their response to recent climate fluctuations...|$|R

The dependence of this space-averaged pressure on mean flow parameters is studied. An equation is also presented for axial time-averaged local pressures...|$|R
40|$|Mafic sill {{complexes}} {{are increasingly}} being shown {{to play a major}} role in the movement of magma around the upper crust in volcanic terranes and to have a role in mass extinction events in Earth history. Most of the current models of sill emplacement assume that brittle fracture operates at all <b>points</b> of <b>sill</b> emplacement. Within this thesis, a series of observations are presented from sheet intrusions in South Africa, USA and the UK showing that in certain situations, dependent on host rock lithology, the propagation of magma through normal brittle fracture can cease. In this circumstance a prevalent fluid/fluid or fluid/ductile relationship between host rock and intruding magma is often developed. Once this occurs, the evolution of a given sheet intrusion becomes distinctly different from that produced by normal brittle fracture alone. The break down in brittle fracture often leads to the development of magma fingers, which accelerate ahead of the main sheet of magma. It is important to note that it is ultimately the host rock lithology and its coupled response to intrusion of magma that dictates the ongoing evolution of the morphology of sheet intrusions in high-level magmatic systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A terrain based method using locally {{adaptive}} thresholds that {{adjust to}} slope and orientation of banks was tested to delineate lake and channel {{banks in the}} Mackenzie Delta, NWT.

In addition to prevalent terrain-based methods that use point elevations alone, an approach based on using a water mask was tested.

40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} {{features}} of the volume flux in the narrow Drøbak strait, and water level changes in the inner Oslofjord. Earlier measurements suggest that the volum flux in the east course of the strait, calculated from one current profile at the deepest <b>point</b> of the <b>sill,</b> is only 50 % of the total volume flux in the strait, calculated from water level changes in the Inner Fjord. Because of the Drøbak Jetty {{it was expected that}} most of the volum flux would be in the east course of the strait. This result is confirmed by current measurments carried out in connection with this thesis. Three different methods is used to calculate the volum flux. The first is the method mentioned above, which uses one current profile measured by a bottom mounted acoustic current profiler. The second method derivates the water level and multiplies with the water area of the Inner Fjord. The water level was thoroughly examined by three different pressure sensors mounted at suitable positions, in addition to two sensors runned by Statens Kartverk (Oslo harbour and Oscarsborg). No big differences was found in phase or amplitude. The biggest difference in phase was between Oscarsborg and Oslo harbour (5 minutes). The lowest amplitude was at the Steilene station (94 % of the value at Oslo harbour). The water level was also examined by a numerical model with resolution of 200 meters. The third method used direct current measurments from a vessel mounted current profiler (VMCP). The volume flux was calculated in two diffrent sections, one in the east course right over the sill and one south of the sill covering the entire strait. Measurments from the first section, gave a volume flux comparable with the results from the bottom mounted current profiler, which was less than the continuity equation suggested. Measurements from the latter section, gave a volume flux which was a little more than the continuity equation suggested. Consequently this thesis offers no evident answer to the question about the volume flux, apart from that the estimates of the volume flux in the east course is too low and that the volume flux over the Drøbak Jetty is greater than assumed...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} Revillagigedo Island to Cape Fox area, southeast Alaska, {{is critical}} in understanding the regional structural development of the Alexander-Taku terrane boundary in southeast Alaska {{and its implications for}} the tectonic history of the Insular suture zone, which extends from southern Alaska to northern Washington. The study area offers what currently appears to be the greatest structural relief through the Alexander-Taku terrane boundary. This study presents U-Pb zircon and supporting Sr-Nd isotopic data as a structural and stratigraphic tool to augment detailed field studies that are nearing completion. The principal relations established are as follows. (1) Ordovician-Silurian and apparently Late Proterozoic-Cambrian crystalline basement rocks and cogenetic volcanic arc rocks of the Alexander terrane tectonically underlie nearly the entire area west of the Coast batholith. Many of the more highly tectonized and metamorphosed rocks of this structural basement were originally included in the Taku terrane. (2) The Taku terrane consists of two distinct sequences that include a Silurian- Devonian and possibly older North American continental margin sedimentary sequence with interbedded and intruded arc volcanic and plutonic members (Kah Shakes sequence), and an upper Paleozoic-lower Mesozoic island arc-marginal basin sequence (Alava). Data presented in this chapter, along with detailed field relations, pose the possibility of a depositional link between these two sequences. (3) The Taku terrane occurs as an isolated folded nappe sequence above the Alexander terrane. (4) The Alexander terrane was thrust eastward beneath the Taku terrane prior to Late Jurassic time, at which <b>point</b> dikes and <b>sills</b> crosscut the original thrust boundary. (5) The Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Gravina basinal arc sequence lapped unconformably across the terrane boundary thrust complex. (6) The Alexander-Taku terrane thrust complex underwent high-magnitude horizontal flattening and stretching that may represent deep crustal flow within the suture zone or, alternatively, a distinct postsuturing extensional event commensurate with Gravina basin formation. (7) Mid-Cretaceous superposed deformation within a fold-thrust belt resulted in the reimbrication of the suture-zone assemblage and the destruction of the Gravina basin. (8) Steeply dipping sill-like magmatic epidote tonalite plutons were syntectonically emplaced into the foldthrust belt. (9) Fold-thrust deformation was west-directed along the western domain of the belt, upright along its axis, and east directed along its eastern domain. (10) Alexander terrane rocks from the lower plate of the original terrane boundary were thrust back up against the Taku terrane along the axis of the fold-thrust belt and, as a result, constitute a major gneiss complex to the east of the Taku terrane along the western wall of the Coast batholith. (11) Latest Cretaceous to Paleocene, mainly northnorthwest- trending elongate tonalitic plutons of the Coast batholith intruded the eastern margin of the fold-thrust belt and, at least locally, assimilated substantial quantities of Alexander terrane crustal materials. (12) The Alexander-Taku terrane boundary in the study area does not map as a linear contact, but has considerable topologic complexity, including large domains that have low dips. The complexity of the map pattern is a result of prolonged suture-zone deformation, a finding that contrasts sharply with commonly held ideas of the boundary having formed abruptly at mid-Cretaceous time in conjunction with fold-thrust belt deformation...|$|R
