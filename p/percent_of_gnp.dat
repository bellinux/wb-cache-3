25|$|Whatever the {{promises}} {{and the costs}} of the many kinds of reform attempted by the Velasco government, the ship sank because of inadequate attention to balances between spending and productive capacity, and between export incentives and import demand. The Velasco government inherited recessionary conditions in 1968, with a positive external balance and productive capacity readily available for expansion. It maintained effective restraint on spending and deficits for several years but then let things get out of control. The central government's deficit was no more than 1 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1970, but its own deficit plus that of the greatly expanded group of state firms reached 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GNP</b> by 1975.

25|$|Foreign trade did {{not account}} for {{a large part of}} the Chinese economy for the first thirty years of the People's Republic. As in most large, {{continental}} countries, the amount of commerce with other nations was small relative to domestic economic activity. During the 1950s and 1960s, the total value of foreign trade was only about 2 percent of the gross national product (GNP). In the 1970s trade grew rapidly but in 1979 still amounted to only about 6 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GNP.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1929, federal {{expenditures}} {{accounted for}} only 3% of GNP. Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditures tripled, but the national debt as a <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GNP</b> showed little change. Spending on the war effort quickly eclipsed spending on New Deal programs. In 1944 government spending on the war effort exceeded 40% of GNP. The US economy experienced dramatic growth during the Second World War mostly due to the deemphasis of free enterprise {{in favor of the}} imposition of strict controls on prices and wages. These controls shared broad support among Labor and Business, resulting in cooperation between the two groups and the Federal Government. This cooperation resulted in the government subsidizing business and labor through both direct and indirect methods.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s, China {{reversed}} the Maoist economic development strategy and, by the early 1980s, had committed itself to a policy of being more open {{to the outside world}} and widening foreign economic relations and trade. The opening up policy led to the reorganization and decentralization of foreign trade institutions, the adoption of a legal framework to facilitate foreign economic relations and trade, direct foreign investment, the creation of special economic zones, the rapid expansion of foreign trade, the importation of foreign technology and management methods, involvement in international financial markets, and participation in international foreign economic organizations. These changes not only benefited the Chinese economy but also integrated China into the world economy. In 1979 Chinese trade totaled US$27.7 billion - 6 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> China's <b>GNP</b> but only 0.7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> total world trade. In 1985 Chinese foreign trade rose to US$70.8 billion, representing 20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> China's <b>GNP</b> and 2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> total world trade and putting China sixteenth in world trade rankings.|$|R

500|$|Before the war, the {{government}} spent 13 percent of GNP; in 1918 it spent 59 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GNP.</b> The war was financed by borrowing large sums {{at home and}} abroad, by new taxes, and by inflation. It was implicitly financed by postponing maintenance and repair, and canceling unneeded projects. The government avoided indirect taxes because they raised the cost of living, and caused discontent among the working class. In 1913-14, indirect taxes on tobacco and alcohol yielded £75 million, while direct taxes yielded £88 million, including an income tax of £44 million and estate duties of £22 million. That is, 54 percent of revenue came from direct taxes; by 1918, direct taxes were 80 percent of revenue. [...] There was {{a strong emphasis on}} being [...] "fair" [...] and being [...] "scientific." [...] The public generally supported the heavy new taxes, with minimal complaints. The Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an excess profits tax, of 50 percent of profits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in 1917. [...] Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax. The main increase in revenue came from income tax, which in 1915 went up to 3s. 6d in the pound (17.5%), and individual exemptions were lowered. The income tax rate grew to [...] 5s (25%) in 1916, and 6s (30%) in 1918. Altogether, taxes provided at most 30 percent of national expenditures, with the rest from borrowing. The national debt soared from £625 million to £7,800 million. Government bonds typically paid five percent. Inflation escalated so that the pound in 1919 purchased only a third of the basket it had purchased it 1914. Wages were laggard, and the poor and retired were especially hard hit.|$|E

Public expenditure on education has been 2.2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GNP</b> in recent years, a marginal increase from 2 percent before 1984-85. In addition, the allocation of government funds is skewed towards higher education, allowing the upper income class to reap majority of the benefits of public subsidy on education. Lower education institutes such as primary schools suffer under such conditions as the lower income classes are unable to enjoy subsidies and quality education. As a result, Pakistan has one of the lowest rates of literacy {{in the world and the}} lowest among countries of comparative resources and socio-economic situations.|$|E

To help achieve the Millennium Development Goals, enhanced ODA must be as productive as possible. In weighing the distribution of aid among countries, it is necessary to limit potentially adverse ‘real transfer effects’. A multi-pronged approach to ODA is recommended that includes the use of trust funds and the financing of global public goods, in addition to direct bilateral transfers. ...|$|R

Such higher costs have adversely affected the growth of the economy, for instance deterring foreign investments due to uncertainty and risk.

On average for 1985 / 86, about 11. 2 percent or $ 1. 05 billion (1985 prices and exchange rates) of U. S. official development assistance was related directly to agricultural production (OECD 1988). The impact of agricultural development assistance on U. S. agricultural export markets is a concern of the U. S. government and agricultural producers, especially in periods of excess supplies of agricultural commodities. Specifically, U.

50|$|Research by Chris Carroll, James Poterba and Lawrence Summers {{shows that}} the Ricardian {{equivalence}} hypothesis is refuted by their results. In the Ronald Reagan era, the US government had a historically large budget deficit due to the Reagan administration tax cuts and increases in military spending. During 1976-80, government revenue was 10.01 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> potential <b>GNP,</b> and it declined to 8.86 percent during 1981-1985. The ratio of the US government's budget deficit to its potential GNP did not exceed 4 percent from World War II until 1981, and exceeded 4 percent after 1981. The ratio of an inflation- and cycle-adjusted deficit to the potential GNP was 2.56 percent during 1981-1986, and this ratio was the largest between 1958 and 1986. If the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis is true, the rational consumers of the economy, who expect the government to raise taxes, try to reduce their consumption and increase their savings. The reality was that the net private saving as a percentage <b>of</b> <b>GNP</b> was 8.55 in the 1976-1980 period, and it decreased to 7.47 percent in the 1981-1986 period.

Unforunately, voter uncertainty during particular economic conditions is often overlooked. In this study, I attempt to uncover how uncertain voters are during an election by uncovering a relationship between election competitiveness and {{the state of the economy}}. Essentially, if an election is competitive, the outcome is as good as random; overall, voters are uncertain of who they want to govern the state. I use congressional elections from 1900 to 1976 to analyze these potential effects and find that the change in prices has the greatest effect on election competitiveness. Moreover, I find that, contrary to expectations, inflation actually makes candidates who are opposing an incumbent less competitive. Furthermore, I find that unemployment has very little effect on election competitivness; this is in line with the previous analysis of Gerald Kramer (1971) and George Stigler (1973). In the end, it is found that increases in the <b>percent</b> change <b>of</b> <b>GNP</b> lead to decreases in electoral competition, as predicted. Also, increases in inflation cause election...|$|R
