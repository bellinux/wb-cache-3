25|$|Retail stores {{may or may}} {{not have}} {{competitors}} close enough to affect their pricing, <b>product</b> <b>availability,</b> and other operations. A 2006 survey found that only 38% of retail stores in India believed they faced more than slight competition. Competition also affected less than half of retail stores in Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Azerbaijan. In all countries the main competition was domestic, not foreign.|$|E

25|$|Inventory {{management}} {{involves a}} retailer seeking to acquire {{and maintain a}} proper merchandise assortment while ordering, shipping, handling and related costs are kept in check. It also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements, set targets, provide replenishment techniques, report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material. This would include the monitoring of material moved {{into and out of}} stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances. It also may include ABC analysis, lot tracking, cycle counting support, etc. Management of the inventories, with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system, functions to balance the need for <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs.|$|E
25|$|Ralph Burger {{attempted}} to reverse downward tonnage figures by reintroducing trading stamps, creating A's Plaid Stamps. However, by late 1962, the initial sales gains evaporated {{and the six}} outside directors threatened to resign unless Burger retired. When Burger left in May 1963, the stock was trading in the $30s. Burger was replaced with a succession of presidents who were unable to stem the downward spiral. In 1971, the board turned to William J. Kane, who joined A in 1934 as a full-time store clerk. Kane believed that A could be turned around by focusing on basic store operations, including cleanliness, <b>product</b> <b>availability,</b> customer service, and courtesy. When his program stalled, Kane implemented a strategy to substantially cut prices by converting A to a warehouse store concept that became known as W.E.O. Warehouse Economy Outlet (or Where Economy Originates). The problem was that most A were not large enough to properly implement the program; losses quickly mounted. In early 1973, the stock dropped to $17, and Charles Bluhdorn of Gulf+Western made a tender offer at $20 per share. Kane rejected the offer, although some stockholders thought that the offer was attractive considering A's continuing difficulties. A exited California and Washington State in 1971 and 1974, respectively, making Missouri its westernmost reach. In 1974, the corporation also left its long-time headquarters in the Graybar Building, moving to Montvale, New Jersey.|$|E
500|$|In {{the most}} basic terms, the edict was ignorant {{of the law of}} supply and demand: it ignored the fact that prices might vary from region to region {{according}} to <b>product</b> <b>availability,</b> and it ignored the impact of transportation costs in the retail price of goods. In the judgment of the historian David Potter, the edict was [...] "an act of economic lunacy". The fact that the edict began with a long rhetorical preamble betrays {{at the same time a}} moralizing stance as well as a weak grasp of economics â€“ perhaps simply the wishful thinking that criminalizing a practice was enough to stop it.|$|E

40|$|The typical {{inventory}} routing problem {{deals with}} the repeated distribution of a single product from a single facility with an unlimited supply {{to a set of}} customers that can all be reached with out-and-back trips. Unfortunately, this is not always the reality. We introduce the inventory routing problem with continuous moves to study two important real-life complexities: limited <b>product</b> <b>availabilities</b> at facilities and customers that cannot be served using out-and-back tours. We need to design delivery tours spanning several days, covering huge geographic areas, and involving product pickups at different facilities. We develop an innovative randomized greedy algorithm, which includes linear programming based postprocessing technology, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in an extensive computational study. ...|$|R

Farm and household level data were obtained from 384 farmers consisting of 192 adopters and 192 non-adopters. The results demonstrated that family size, farming experience, availability of dairy production extension services, availability of cross breed cows, accessibility of saving institutions, total income from milk and milk <b>products,</b> <b>availability</b> of training on livestock, age of household head and off-farm activity participation played significant roles on both the probability of dairy technology adoption and its level of adoption...|$|R

50|$|Reintermediation {{occurred}} due to {{many new}} {{problems associated with}} the e-commerce disintermediation concept, largely centered on the issues associated with the direct-to-consumers model. The high cost of shipping many small orders, massive customer service issues, and confronting the wrath of disintermediated retailers and supply channel partners all presented real obstacles. Huge resources are required to accommodate presales and postsales issues of individual consumers. Before disintermediation, supply chain middlemen acted as salespeople for the producers. Without them, the producer itself would have to handle procuring those customers. Selling online has its own associated costs: developing quality websites, maintaining product information, and marketing expenses all add up. Finally, limiting a <b>product's</b> <b>availability</b> to Internet channels forces the producer to compete {{with the rest of the}} Internet for customers' attention, a space that is becoming increasingly crowded.|$|R
