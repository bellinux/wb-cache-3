40|$|<b>Pregnant</b> <b>mare</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (PMSG) {{was found}} to stimulate the {{production}} of cyclic AMP in isolated rat seminiferous tubule cells. The PMSG was equipotent with highly purified ovine FSH. The subunits of PMSG were inactive in this system but recombination resulted in partial restoration of activity, and the combination of PMSG =asubunit with FSH =bsubunitwas even more active. Desialation of PMSG, but not of ovine FSH, resulted in a reduction of slope and potency of this response, suggesting that sialic acid may be important for the interaction of PMSG and the Sertoli cell.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} {{the effect of}} electroacupuncture treatment on preventing early ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and the potential mechanisms involved using an induced rat model. The ovarian response was examined by measuring ovary weight, vascular permeability, levels of inflammation (interleukin- 6), tumour necrosis factor alpha, chemokine ligand 2 (also known as monocyte chemoactic protein 1), vascular endothelial growth factor and hormone concentrations (oestradiol, progesterone, testosterone and prolactin). Sprague–Dawley female rats underwent ovarian stimulation to induce OHSS. Hyperstimulated rats received consecutive electroacupuncture treatment from 3 days {{before the beginning of}} <b>pregnant</b> <b>mare</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> treatment or the time point of <b>pregnant</b> <b>mare</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> treatment respectively, and last until 3 days after HCG administration.

Electroacupuncture treatment also reduced the levels of serum steroid hormones (progesterone and testosterone), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin- 6, tumour necrosis factor alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor in hyperstimulated rats. The results indicate that electroacupuncture can modulate endocrine hormone secretion and affect the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and vascular endothelial growth factor, and thus prevent the progress of OHSS.

40|$|Ovulation is {{preceded by}} intraovarian {{inflammatory}} reactions {{that occur in}} response to the preovulatory gonadotropin surge. As a main inflammatory event, leukocytes infiltrate the ovary and release proteolytic enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix weakening the follicular wall, a required step for follicle rupture. This study aimed to quantitatively measure the infiltrating leukocytes, determine their cell types, and localize infiltration sites in the periovulatory rat ovary. Cycling adult and gonadotropin-stimulated immature rats were used as animal models. Ovaries were collected at five different stages of estrous cycle in the adult rats (diestrus, 1700 h; proestrus, 1500 h; proestrus, 2400 h; estrus, 0600 h; and metestrus, 1700 h) and at five different time points after superovulation induction in the immature rats (<b>pregnant</b> <b>mare’s</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin,</b> 0 h; <b>pregnant</b> <b>mare’s</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin,</b> 48 h; human chorionic gonadotropin, 6 h; human chorionic gonadotropin, 12 h; and human chorionic gonadotropin, 24 h). The ovaries were either dissociated into a single cell suspension for flow cytometric analysis or fixed for immunohistochemical localization of the leukocytes. Similar numbers of leukocytes were seen throughout the estrous cycle (∼ 500, 000 /ovary), except proestrus 2400 when 2 -fold higher numbers of leukocytes were found (∼ 1. 1 million/ovary). A similar trend of periovulatory rise of leukocyte numbers was seen in the superovulation-induced immature rat model, recapitulating a dramatic increase in leukocyte numbers upon gonadotropin stimulation. Both macrophage/granulocytes and lymphocytes were among the infiltrating leukocytes and were localized in the theca and interstitial tissues, where platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 may play roles in the transmigration of leukocytes, because their expressions correlates spatiotemporally with the infiltrating leukocytes. In addition, a strong inverse relationship between leukocyte numbers in the ovary and spleen, as well as significant reduction of leukocyte infiltration in the splenectomized rats, were seen, indicating that the spleen may serve as an immediate supplier of leukocytes to the periovulatory ovary...|$|R

Objective: This study was designed to evaluate effects of lithium chloride on the release of steroid hormones and steroidogenic enzymes in gonadotropin-stimulated rats. Materials and Methods: Immature 23 days old Wistar rats were divided into 10 groups; each group comprised of 8 rats, and induced with single injection of <b>pregnant</b> <b>mare’s</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (PMSG) and followed by single injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The study aim was {{to assess}} whether the {{incorporation}} of myo-inositol (MI) into culture medium could improve oocyte maturation in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a controlled prospective study using female ICR strain mice superovulated with <b>pregnant</b> <b>mare's</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophins.</b> Cumulus-enclosed germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes were randomly cultured in medium with or without MI supplementation. The kinetics of GV breakdown after 4 h of incubation was signi®cantly higher in oocytes incubated with 30 mmol/l of MI than in controls (P < 0. 001). Accordingly, this concentration of MI was used for subsequent experiments. The proportion of metaphase II oocytes achieved after 24 h of culture, their fertilization and cleavage rates were signi®cantly higher in the MI-treated group (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05, P < 0. 05 respectively). This group also demonstrated signi®cant improve-ment in postimplantation development after transferring the 2 -cell embryos to pseudopregnant mice. Confocal microscopy revealed spontaneous intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations within competent GV oocytes and treatment with MI caused an earlier onset of these Ca 2 + signals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that MI may affect meiotic progression of mouse GV oocytes possibly by enhancing the intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations.

Embryo-toxicity was assessed by documenting cleavage capacity, blastocyst formation and embryo degeneration in vitro. Exposure of culture medium to the ultrasound covers and sonographic gels tested resulted in a severely reduced cleavage capacity, a high incidence of embryo degeneration and absent or impaired blastocyst formation. This toxic effect could be reduced by high dilutions in vitro. In contrast, plastic polyethylene bags and paraffin oil had no influence on in-vitro development of mouse ova.

40|$|Background: Acceptance of uterus and {{reaction}} between endometrium and embryo {{has an important}} role for implantation. Muc 1, an integral membrane mucin, is expressed on the apical surface of uterine epithelial cells and could have effects on its receptivity. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the changes in Muc 1 expression of gravid mouse endometrium with and without hyperstimulation before implantation. Materials and Methods: Adult female NMRI mice were divided into control and experimental groups. Experimental group superovulated using an intraperitoneal injection of <b>Pregnant</b> <b>Mare’s</b> <b>Serum</b> <b>Gonadotrophin</b> (PMSG) followed 48 hours later by another injection of Human Chorionic Gonadotropic hormone (HCG). The female mice have mated with normal male mice. All control and hyperstimulated groups subdivided into six groups. After mating, female mice were examined by vaginal plaque as day of zero and in 0 - 5 days after copulation, they were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Then the middle 1 / 3 parts of their uterine horns were obtained and stained by immunohistochemicaly technique for Muc- 1 detection. Results: Our results showed that in the control and hyperstimulated groups, the Muc 1 expression is markedly reduced in the luminal uterus epithelium at the time of implantation. Furthermore, luminal and glandular uterus epithelium did not exhibit the same decrease in Muc 1 expression during the receptive phase. Conclusion: Ovarian hyperstimulation didn’t alter the Muc 1 expression markedly in surface and glandular epithelium of endometrium, which could affect on its receptivity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Successful oocyte {{in vitro}} {{maturation}} (IVM) would {{eliminate the need for}} hormonal stimulation used in assisted reproduction techniques. Unfortunately, oocytes matured in vitro have compromised developmental competence possibly due to disrupted oocyte–cumulus communication resulting from inappropriate levels of oocyte-secreted factors such as growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF 9). Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of exogenous GDF 9 during IVM of mouse oocytes on development and subsequent fetal viability. METHODS: Cumulus–oocyte complexes from <b>pregnant</b> <b>mare's</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> primed mice were cultured with or without 200 ng/ml exogenous recombinant GDF 9, 50 mIU/ml FSH and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF). After 18 h, cumulus expansion was scored and oocytes were fertilized in vitro. Cleavage, blastocyst development, blastocyst total, inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm cell numbers were assessed. Viability of embryos was assessed by transfer to recipient females and pregnancy outcome determined at day 15. RESULTS: Oocytes matured with exogenous GDF 9 in the presence of FSH and EGF had higher rates of development, percentage of hatching blastocyst and blastocyst total and ICM cell numbers (all P < 0. 05). Although implantation rate and fetal and placental weights were not affected, the number of viable fetuses at day 15 was increased with exogenous GDF 9. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous GDF 9 during IVM improved embryo development and fetal viability and provides a promising approach for human IVM. Christine X. Yeo, Robert B. Gilchrist, Jeremy G.

40|$|Thirty six Etawah-grade does (BW 20. 4 - 44. 2 kg, age 2. 5 - 7 years) {{were used}} to study the {{efficacy}} of increasing secretion of endogenous hormones of pregnancy by superovulation of does to stimulate of growth prenatal in uterus. The does were injected with <b>pregnant</b> <b>mare</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (PMSG), 0 IU/kg BW [grouped into nonsuperovulation-NSO] and 15 IU/kg BW [grouped into Superovulation-SO]. Intravaginal sponge (60 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) was applied for 14 days to synchronize estrus cycle. Twenty four hours prior to sponge removal, PMSG was injected to stimulate superovulation. After sponge removal, five experimental does were mixed with one buck for natural mating. Superovulation prior to mating increased number of corpora lutea, mean of maternal serum estradiol concentration, progesterone concentration, litter size, average birth weight and average milk yield, by 112, 67, 42, 27, 32, and 35 %, respectively.

40|$|Superovulation was induced in palm {{squirrels}} by {{the administration}} of gonadotrophins. The regimen of treatment effective in inducing ovulation was 60 i. u. <b>pregnant</b> <b>mare</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (PMS) administered in three doses of 20 i. u. on days 1, 4 and 7, followed by a single injection of 40 i. u. human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) on day 14. The same schedule of PMS and HCG administration induced ovulation in mature and im-mature squirrels both during the breeding season and the period of sexual quiescence. Ovulation did not occur in PMS-treated females if HCG was not administered. The period required for follicular growth before the follicles responded to the ovulatory stimulus of HCG was 13 =n- 4 days; the interval for follicular maturation leading {{to the release of}} the ovum was approxi-mately 24 hr.

40|$|Seventy mouse ova at the 4 [...] 8 -cell stages were {{collected}} {{at room temperature}} from mice treated with <b>pregnant</b> <b>mare's</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> and human chorionic gonadotrophin. Seventy ova were divided into 5 groups, and each group {{was placed in a}} 0. 5 ml plastic straw with 0. 2 ml of Brinster's medium. Then, the straws were immersed into an ice bath (0 ℃) for 5 minutes. Next, an equal volume of 2 M dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the sample straw. The medium with ova was then seeded at - 6 ℃ and cooled to - 100 ℃ at a rate of 0. 4 to 0. 5 ℃ per minute using an inexpensive freeze-thaw apparatus. After reaching - 100 ℃, the sample straws were directly immersed in liquid nitrogen at - 196 ℃ and stored for 1 - 9 days. Following the storage period, the sample straw were thawed at 12 - 15 ℃ per minute from - 196 ℃ to 0 ℃. The samples were then diluted with fresh medium and placed inside a petri dish at room temperature (20 - 25 ℃). The ova were moved immediately to a fresh medium 3 times, then incubated at 37 ℃ for 72 hours.

40|$|Despite {{the mouse}} being an {{important}} laboratory species, {{little is known}} about changes in its extracellular matrix (ECM) during follicle and corpora lutea formation and regression. Follicle development was induced in mice (29  days of age/experimental day 0) by injections of <b>pregnant</b> <b>mare’s</b> <b>serum</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> on days 0 and 1 and ovulation was induced by injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin on day 2. Ovaries were collected for immunohistochemistry (n= 10 per group) on days 0, 2 and 5. Another group was mated and ovaries were examined on day 11 (n= 7). Collagen type IV α 1 and α 2, laminin α 1, β 1 and γ 1 chains, nidogens 1 and 2 and perlecan were present in the follicular basal lamina of all developmental stages. Collagen type XVIII was only found in basal lamina of primordial, primary and some preantral follicles, whereas laminin α 2 was only detected in some preantral and antral follicles. The focimatrix, a specialised matrix of the membrana granulosa, contained collagen type IV α 1 and α 2, laminin α 1, β 1 and γ 1 chains, nidogens 1 and 2, perlecan and collagen type XVIII. In the corpora lutea, staining was restricted to capillary sub-endothelial basal laminas containing collagen type IV α 1 and α 2, laminin α 1, β 1 and γ 1 chains, nidogens 1 and 2, perlecan and collagen type XVIII. Laminins α 4 and α 5 were not immunolocalised to any structure in the mouse ovary.
