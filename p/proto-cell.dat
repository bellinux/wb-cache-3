40|$|We {{examine the}} role of {{self-maintenance}} (collective autocatalysis) {{in the evolution of}} computational biochemical networks. In primitive <b>proto-cells</b> (lacking separate genetic machinery) self-maintenance is a necessary condition for the direct reproduction and inheritance of what we here term Cellular Information Processing Networks (CIPNs). Indeed, partially reproduced or defective CIPNs may generally lead to malfunctioning or premature death of affected cells. We explore the interaction of this self-maintenance property with the evolution and adaptation of CIPNs capable of distinct information processing abilities. We present an evolutionary simulation platform capable of evolving artificial CIPNs from a bottom-up perspective. This system is an agent-based multi-level selectional Artificial Chemistry (AC) which employs a term rewriting system called the Molecular Classifier System (MCS). The latter is derived from the Holland broadcast language formalism. Using this system, we successfully evolve an artificial CIPN to improve performance on a simple pre-specified information processing task whilst subject to the constraint of continuous self-maintenance. We also describe the evolution of self-maintaining, crosstalking and multitasking, CIPNs exhibiting a higher level of topological and functional complexity. This proof of concept aims at contributing {{to the understanding of the}} open-ended evolutionary growth of complexity in artificial systems. ...|$|R

The authors conclude that ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for K+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and phosphate. Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in what we today call marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapour-dominated zones of what we today call inland geothermal systems.

40|$|We {{compare the}} D/H ratios of {{terrestrial}} cell material {{published in the}} literature with the values estimated for related organic substances of the solar nebula. In SOM (sedimentary organic matter) isoprenoid hydrocarbons are taken as biomarkers. Their D/H ratios measured for various oil sources indicate deuterium depletion relative to SMOW (Standard Mean Ocean Water). Similar values are found for LOM (living organic matter). A different situation occurs for EOM (extraterrestrial organic matter). We consider hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde. These compounds are precursors of biochemical substances like adenine or glycerol. In order to estimate the D/H ratio of water and the selected molecules in the solar nebula a hydrodynamic model of a collapsing cloud is coupled {{to a set of}} kinetic equations to include deuterium chemistry. Sublimation and accretion on the surface of interstellar dust are considered. The initial state of the collapsing cloud is a cold molecular hydrogen sphere. In the course of the collapse a low mass protostellar core evolves which corresponds to an early phase of our sun. The resulting hot cloud envelope near the protostar is related to the early phase of the solar nebula. Our calculations for the early solar nebula (ESN) show that water, hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde are deuterium enriched in comparison to SMOW. This result is confirmed by published measurements of D/H ratios for organic matter in comets, asteroids and in a lower amount meteorites (e. g. Murchison). In order to understand the deuterium depletion in SOM and LOM we draw the conclusion that two processes on the Earth surface are responsible for this effect. These processes are the exchange between organic matter and terrestrial water {{on the one hand and}} the isotope fractionation during the biochemical evolution of <b>proto-cells</b> on the other. ...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} developments in proto-biological evolution was the emergence of membrane-like structures. These are formed by spontaneous association of relatively simple amphiphilic molecules {{that would have been}} readily available in the primordial environment. The resulting interfacial regions between water and nonpolar interior of the membrane have several properties which made them uniquely suitable for promoting subsequent evolution. They can (1) selectively attract organic material and mediate its transport, (2) serve as simple catalysts for chemical reactions, and (3) promote the formation of trans-membrane electrical and chemical gradients which could provide energy sources for <b>proto-cells.</b> Understanding the structure of interfaces, their interactions with organic molecules and molecular mechanisms of their functions is an essential step to understanding proto-biological evolution. In our computer simulation studies, we showed that the structure of water at interfaces with nonpolar media is significantly different from that in the bulk. In particular, the average surface dipole density points from the vapor to the liquid. As a result, negative ions can approach the interface more easily than positive ions. Amphiphilic molecules composed of hydrocarbon conjugated rings and polar substituents (e. g., phenol) assume at the interface rigid orientations in which polar groups are buried in water while hydrocarbon parts are located in the nonpolar environment. These orientational differences are of special interest in connection with the ability of some of these molecules to efficiently absorb photons. Flexible molecules with polar substituents often adopt at interfaces conformations different from those in the bulk aquaeous solution and in the gas phase. As a result, in many instances both specificity and kinetics of chemical reactions in which these molecules can participate is modified by the presence of surfaces. Of special interest is the mechanism by which polar molecules are transferred across interface between water and a nonpolar medium. Our recent study showed that simple ionophores bind ions by the same mechanisms as ion channels and carriers from modern cells...|$|R
40|$|Work on the Origin of Life {{is poised}} to {{converge}} onto a fourth phase and, many of us hope, success. The first phase concerned prebiotic synthesis of the small molecules, amino acids, nucleotides, lipids and others, essential for life and spanned some forty years. The second overlapping phase {{was inspired by the}} symmetric of the DNA or RNA double helix, presumed that life must necessarily be based on some form of template replication of one strand by ligation of free nucleotides to create the second strand, melting of the two strands and cycling again. Spearheaded by L. Orgel, but with many others, this effort has, to date, failed. The third phase begins with the discovery that RNA molecules can act as enzymes, and posited the RNA world, in which RNA molecules dominated. This has led to slightly successful efforts to evolve an RNA sequence able to template replicate itself. Current success is an evolved ribozyme able to do so for 14 nucleotides. The forth phase is converging around four ideas: 1) liposomes, hollow bilipid spheres obtainable from lipids in water, can grow and divide. We now widely hope that these can serve as “containers” bounding <b>proto-cells.</b> 2) Sources of free energy, from pyrophosphate to proton pumps. 3) A minimal metabolism in a “messy” systems chemistry which supplies the small amino acids, nucleotides and lipids for proto -life. 4) Collectively autocatalytic sets of polymers, peptides, RNA, or other, which achieve molecular reproduction in dividing liposome containers, hence also open ended evolution. At present, a 9 peptide collectively autocatalytic set has been constructend, achieving catalytic closure, and demonstrated beyond doubt that the DNA or RNA double helix is not needed for molecular reproduction. In addition a two membered DNA autocatalytic set has been constructed and two two membered RNA ribozyme autocatalytic sets have been selected from a large RNA library. The author, in 1971 and 1986 proposed a theory in which the emergence of collectively autocatalytic sets is a first order phase transition as the diversity of polymers that are also candidates to catalyse the reactions they undergo, increases in diversity. Recent theorems have improved upon this initial model, simulations have shown that small collectively autocatalytic sets can emerge in this process and grow together, and also that, in the presence of inhibition of catalysis and if contained in duplicating containers, can indeed serve as plausible protocells able to evolve indefinitely.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computer}} simulation of group selection that {{is inspired by}} <b>proto-cell</b> division. Two types of replicating molecules, cooperators and defectors, reside inside membrane bound compartments. Cooperators pay a cost for other replicators in the cell to receive a benefit. Defectors pay no cost and distribute no benefits. The total population size fluctuates {{as a consequence of}} births and deaths of individual replicators. Replication requires activated substrates that are generated at a constant rate. Our model includes mutation between cooperators and defectors and selection on two levels: within proto-cells and between proto-cells. We find surprising similarities and differences between models with and without cell death. In both cases, a necessary requirement for group selection to favor some level of cooperation is the continuous formation of a minimum fraction of pure cooperator groups. Subsequently these groups become undermined by defectors, because of mutation and selection within cells. Cell division mechanisms which generate pure cooperator groups more efficiently are stronger promoters of cooperation. For example, division of a <b>proto-cell</b> into many daughter cells is more powerful in enhancing cooperation than division into two daughter cells. Our model differs from previous studies of group selection in that we explore a variety of different features and relax several restrictive assumptions that would be needed for analytic calculations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{stubborn}} {{question in}} early molecular evolution {{is how to}} sustain the ‘‘minimum’ ’ infor-mational length required for the basic features of life with a putative low-copying fidelity RNA polymerase ribozyme. Proposals to circumvent the information crisis have primarily focused on networks of coop-erative molecules or compartmentalization of non-cooperative unlinked templates, but success has been very limited so far. Lehman (2003) has recently sug-gested that recombination—a frequently ignored player in early evolution—could have been crucial to building up primeval genomes of sizable length. Here we investigate this claim by assuming (without loss of generality) that genes were already enclosed in a compartment (vesicle, protocell). The numerical re-sults show a quite intricate interplay among muta-tion, recombination, and gene redundancy. Provided that the minimum number of gene copies per <b>proto-cell</b> was enough for recombination to recreate wild-type templates—but not too high to impose an un-bearable burden of mutants—informational content could have increased by at least 25 % by keeping the same mutational load as that for a population with-out recombination.

In this framework, we have recently developed a computational platform called ENVIRONMENT suitable for designing and testing realistic <b>proto-cell</b> models and possible explanations for their spontaneous emergence in pre-biotic conditions. This software is an improvement of a previous program developed to simulate the stochastic time evolution of homogeneous, fixed-volume, chemically reacting systems that has been modified to be applied to the case of volume-changing, globally heterogeneous, systems. Our aim is to develop models and computational tools {{to bridge the gap between}} experimental and theoretical results, focusing the attention on bottom-up and semi-synthetic approaches to construct minimal artificial cells. In this contribution, we dealt with modelling and simulating the structural properties and the experimental dynamic behaviour of lipid vesicle populations used as biomimetic reactors. We start testing our approach by studying fatty acid vesicle dynamics that exhibits some peculiar features with respect to vesicles made of standard lipids as, for instance, the spontaneous formation and faster lipid exchange with the aqueous environment.

40|$|While modern cell {{membranes}} {{are composed of}} phospholipids, primitive membranes were probably made from simpler fatty acids. Due to the prebiotic availability of fatty acids, fatty acid vesicles are a popular model for <b>proto-cell</b> membranes in origin-of-life studies. Vesicles of one such fatty acid, decanoic acid, are often used to model early membranes, but the mechanism by which decanoic acid forms vesicles is not clear. Monolayer studies of the stability of decanoic acid on water surfaces may help illuminate the key molecular interactions that result in vesicle formation. To this end, consistent amounts of decanoic acid were deposited {{on the surface of}} aqueous salt and buffer solutions, and a variety of isotherms were collected with a Langmuir trough and Wilhelmy balance. Time versus surface pressure isotherms were analyzed and it was found that there was no statistical difference in the isotherms collected on 50 mM and 500 mM NaCl, indicating that the effects of salt on the phase behavior of decanoic acid might plateau at a lower concentration. However, the isotherms run on a Tris buffer substrate were statistically different from the isotherms at both salt concentrations. These preliminary results suggest that pH and buffer type are influential on decanoic acid surface partitioning and stability, and that the speed of equilibration increases at higher bulk ionic strength...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{remarkable}} {{potential of}} recent {{forms of life}} for reliably passing on genetic information through many generations now depends on the coordinated action of thousands of specialized biochemical "machines" (enzymes) that were obviously absent in prebiotic times. Thus the question how a complicated system like the living cell could have assembled on Earth seems puzzling. In seeking for a scientific explanation one has to search for step-by-step evolutionary changes from prebiotic chemistry {{to the emergence of}} the first <b>proto-cell.</b> Results We try to sketch a plausible scenario for the first steps of prebiotic evolution by exploring the ecological feasibility of a mineral surface-bound replicator system that facilitates a primitive metabolism. Metabolism is a hypothetical network of simple chemical reactions producing monomers for the template-copying of RNA-like replicators, which in turn catalyse metabolic reactions. Using stochastic cellular automata (SCA) simulations we show that the surface-bound metabolic replicator system is viable despite internal competition among the genes and that it also maintains a set of mild "parasitic" sequences which occasionally evolve functions such as that of a replicase. Conclusion Replicase activity is shown to increase even at the expense of slowing down the replication of the evolving ribozyme itself, due to indirect mutualistic benefits in a diffuse form of group selection among neighbouring replicators. We suggest possible paths for further evolutionary changes in the metabolic replicator system leading to increased metabolic efficiency, improved replicase functionality, and membrane production. </p...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{develops}} the Life Origination Hydrate Hypothesis (LOH-hypothesis), {{according to which}} living-matter simplest elements (LMSEs, which are N-bases, riboses, nucleosides, nucleotides), DNA- and RNA-like molecules, amino-acids, and proto-cells repeatedly originated {{on the basis of}} thermodynamically controlled, natural, and inevitable processes governed by universal physical and chemical laws from CH 4, niters, and phosphates under the Earth&# 039;s surface or seabed within the crystal cavities of the honeycomb methane-hydrate structure at low temperatures; the chemical processes passed slowly through all successive chemical steps in the direction that is determined by a gradual decrease in the Gibbs free energy of reacting systems. The hypothesis formulation method is based on the thermodynamic directedness of natural movement and consists ofan attempt to mentally backtrack on the progression of nature and thus reveal principal milestones alongits route. The changes in Gibbs free energy are estimated for different steps of the living-matter origination process; special attention is paid to the processes of <b>proto-cell</b> formation. Just the occurrence of the gas-hydrate periodic honeycomb matrix filled with LMSEs almost completely in its final state accounts for size limitation in the DNA functional groups and the nonrandom location of N-bases in the DNA chains. The slowness of the low-temperature chemical transformations and their “thermodynamic front” guide the gross process of living matter origination and its successive steps. It is shown that the hypothesis is thermodynamically justified and testable and that many observed natural phenomena count in its favor...|$|E
