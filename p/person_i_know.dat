[...] In June 2017, there were further reports that after extensive recruiting by the chief executive following a recommendation from Ivanka Trump, she had agreed to become an Ambassador-at-Large dealing with matters of human trafficking, refugees, and humanitarian aid. [...] No official announcement has yet been made regarding this. [...] In July 2017 she faced the news that her husband had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. [...] She issued a public statement saying that, [...] "We as a family will face the next hurdle together. One thing I do know is he is the toughest <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> He is my hero and I love him with all my heart." ...|$|E

Peacock has the appointment at his disposal & if he can not find a man willing to take the office, the opportunity will probably be lost— Capt. F. wants a man (I understand) more as a companion than a mere collector & would not take any one however good a Naturalist who was not recommended to him likewise as a gentleman. ... there never was a finer chance for a man of zeal & spirit... Don't put on any modest doubts or fears about your disqualifications for I assure you I think you are the very man they are in search of.|$|E
500|$|The {{genesis of}} Edward Scissorhands {{came from a}} drawing by then-teenaged {{director}} Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. [...] "I get the feeling people just got this urge to want {{to leave me alone}} for some reason, I don't know exactly why." [...] During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the Edward Scissorhands screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, First Born, which was [...] "about an abortion that came back to life". Burton felt First Born had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in Edward Scissorhands. [...] "Every detail was so important to Tim because it was so personal", Thompson remarked. She wrote Scissorhands as a [...] "love poem" [...] to Burton, calling him [...] "the most articulate <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> but couldn't put a single sentence together".|$|E

500|$|In May 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Susan and Karl's marriage would be run into trouble, when Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man. Susan strikes up a friendship with local builder, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), as he fights cancer, causing problems between herself and Karl. When asked by Channel 5 about her reaction to the storyline, Woodburne said [...] "I think it's a great story. Karl and Susan are both in their 50s; they've been married together; they've raised a bunch of kids; they’ve had careers and jobs. And to use the popular term 'empty nesters', that's what they’re looking at. For him he thinks, 'That's great, terrific! More time for us; we can travel.' But for her it's, 'Well, I don't know how to be that <b>person.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how to be this person, who's someone who's wrangling kids and busy doing things.' But her challenge I {{think is going to be}} to find out who she is as one half of a couple, as opposed to being the hub of a wheel." [...] The actress revealed she and Fletcher were both worried about Susan and Karl breaking up and having to work with new people, but they believe any new development for the characters is good. Woodburne told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she thought the new storyline was great and said any relationship which has been going for as long as the Kennedys' has, will have its [...] "turbulent patches". Woodburne said Susan develops a very strong attachment to Jim because of her desire to help and be needed. When asked if she was worried about revisiting old ground with the storyline, Woodburne said the new conflict, which arises within Karl and Susan's relationship, is [...] "very appropriate" [...] for the time of their lives and where they are at.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his later}} years, Laughlin turned his {{attention}} to politics. In 1992, as a protest he sought the Democratic Party nomination for U.S. President. He told the Milwaukee Sentinel, [...] "I am the least qualified <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> to be President, except George Bush." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{ends with}} the song [...] "North Star," [...] {{which serves as a}} [...] "closing credits" [...] type of song. In regard to this track and Popa Wu's inclusion, RZA later remarked [...] "The idea is Rae did {{everything}} he had to do. Everything is over now. The job is over. Mission is over, it's a perfect closing to the album. Popa Wu was a very smart mentor in the younger days to me and ODB. Everybody had dibs and dabs of knowledge of self, I brought him in to be a mentor to these men like, 'I love them and you the only <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that have the intelligence to keep them in sync with knowledge.' It's very poisonous unless they got proper guidance. He was the smartest man I'd ever met at a certain time in my life." [...] Raekwon further commented [...] "'North Star' was a track I really, really wanted on my album. It was a track that I felt a vibe of it was motion picture-like." ...|$|E

"Mr. Fischer is an American citizen," [...] Mrs. Hastings {{reminded}} her niece, [...] "and personally, I {{think that the}} American of German birth {{is one of the}} most loyal and long-suffering <b>persons</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> cannot say as much for the English people who are living over here. And as to fairy stories--" ...|$|R

2500|$|In remembering Shelly, Ostroy {{said that}} [...] "Adrienne was the kindest, warmest, most loving, generous <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> She was {{incredibly}} smart, funny and talented, {{a bright light}} with an infectious laugh and huge smile that radiated inner and outer beauty... she was my best friend, and the <b>person</b> with whom <b>I</b> was supposed to grow old".|$|R
6000|$|... "I found {{something}} {{much better than}} any baron, a courier. I've wanted one ever since we started; for two young ladies and their baggage are more than one man can do his duty by, Karl Hoffman had such excellent testimonials from <b>persons</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> that <b>I</b> {{did not hesitate to}} engage him, and he comes to-morrow; so henceforth I've nothing to do but devote myself to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing particular," [...] Philip replied, turning {{round and}} falling into step with her. [...] "I can't see my way, that's all, and I {{want to talk}} to you. You're the most human <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> and you {{understand}} Elizabeth." ...|$|E
60|$|CLARE. I came to Mr. Malise because he's {{the only}} <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> with {{imagination}} {{enough to see}} what my position is; I came to him {{a quarter of an}} hour ago, for the first time, for definite advice, and you instantly suspect him. That is disgusting.|$|E

2500|$|Kirkman said, disingenuously, {{that the}} pieces were [...] "written <b>I</b> <b>know</b> not when, by several <b>persons,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> not who", though he {{included}} {{items such as}} the gravediggers' scene from Hamlet, and the bouncing knight from The Merry Wives of Windsor, the authorship of which cannot have been unknown either to him or his audience. He attributed some to an actor, Robert Cox, who had published his own drolls, and probably performed them at the Red Bull Theatre, and outside London.|$|R
30|$|My {{mother was}} the most {{influential}} person in making the decision of what my wedding dress should be because I trust her opinion more than anyone <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> …She told me exactly what I needed to hear, the truth.

She was the most honest <b>person.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that, of everyone, she would be the one person to give me the best and most honest advice. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she would ultimately have my best interests at heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all; I call it {{the reverse}} of odd," [...] Miss Allan replied.

6000|$|... "He hates her! The {{last time}} I saw him he wouldn't {{allow me to}} mention her name. It {{is one of his}} innumerable oddities.

She is the most completely unconventional <b>person</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> When she does break out, poor dear, she says things and does things which are almost reckless enough to be worthy of Dexter himself.

60|$|I {{think she}} was talking to herself. I am sure, {{although}} absorbed in gazing at the water, that her shawl was off her shoulders, and that she was muffling her hands in it, in an unsettled and bewildered way, more like the action of a sleep-walker than a waking <b>person.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> and never can forget, that there was that in her wild manner which gave me no assurance but that she would sink before my eyes, until I had her arm within my grasp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] the man answered. [...] "I {{have come}} to tell you this. You are my wife, and I am {{determined}} to claim you.

60|$|I had {{determined}} not to enter on my profession within a hundred miles of home, and then to cover myself with a fictitious name.

For {{a week or two}} I travelled almost at random, seeking hardly any guidance except the whirling of a leaf at, some turn of the road, or the green bough that beckoned me, or the naked branch that pointed its withered finger onward. All my care was to be farther from home each night than the preceding morning.|$|E
