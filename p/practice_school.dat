25|$|Among all {{counseling}} specialty areas, public elementary, {{middle and}} high school counselors are (2009) paid the highest salary on average of all counselors. Budget cuts, however, have affected placement of public school counselors in Canada, Ireland, the United States, and other countries due to the global recession in recent years. In the United States, rural areas and urban areas traditionally have been under-served by school counselors in public schools due to both funding shortages and often a lack of best practice models. With the advent of No Child Left Behind legislation in the USA and a mandate for school counselors to be working with data and showing evidence-based <b>practice,</b> <b>school</b> counselors able to show and share results in assisting to close gaps are {{in the best position to}} argue for increased school counseling resources and positions for their programs (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012).|$|E

The first paper, "The Child as Meaning Aaker: The Organizing Theme of Professional <b>Practice</b> <b>Schools</b> " (Ellen M. Pechman), focuses on the implications for classroc is and schools in what is knoun about how children learn and develop socially and emotionally. The new roles teachers play as mediators of student learning are discussed. The second paper, " [...] acher Development in Professional <b>Practice</b> <b>Schools</b> " (Ann Lieberman and Lynne Miller), builds on a concept of professional practice, maintaining that teachers themselves are {{an important source of}} knowledge about teaching and ecrAating the renewel of teaching with the renewal of schools. A framework is Afered for developing a school culture that supports continuous inquiry and the improvement of teaching. The third paper, "Professional <b>Practice</b> <b>Schools</b> in Context: New Mixtures of Institutional Authority " (Barbara Neufeld), lays out a number of areas of critical importarle in implementing professional <b>practice</b> <b>schools,</b> such as issues surrounding collaboration among institutions, definitions of teaching and learning, and the policy context in which design and implementation will take place.

2500|$|Oglethorpe <b>Practice</b> <b>School</b> was {{established}} on Atlanta University's campus in 1905. It offered grades K–7, with the senior class gaining {{experience in the}} teaching profession. After several years of having a private tutor in her parents' home, Grace Towns transferred to Oglethorpe for her last two years at that level. Her high-school education was the preparatory school at the university, the era's only city high school available to black students. She earned a Bachelor of Arts from Atlanta University in 1927. [...] In 1929, she was awarded her master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University. Her brief sojourn as a student in Ohio was her initial experience with segregation. While {{she was aware of}} the effect of segregation on the African-American community, Atlanta University's integrated campus had sheltered her from being a part of it. Living in Columbus, Ohio, and working as a secretary at the YWCA brought her face-to-face with the effects of segregation and tokenism. After she and her husband Cookie Hamilton returned to live in Atlanta in 1941, she took two graduate courses at Atlanta University, one taught by family friend W. E. B. Dubois, and the other taught by former Director for Research at the National Urban League, Ira De Augustine Reid.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether or not either stress responses selected from a set of 15 critical incidents or personality characteristics were different both within and between groups of prospective and <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> administrators. Personality characteristics were measured by use of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF). Data about stress responses were collected by administration of a set of 15 critical incidents based on actual events experienced by <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> administrators. ^ The research questions investigated were: (1) Do responses to stressful situations (critical incidents) or measures of personality for prospective and <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> administrators differ at statistically significant levels when these two groups are compared with one another? (2) Do prospective school administrators differ from what would be expected in their selection of five categories of response to stress? (3) Do <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> administrators differ from what would be expected in their selection of five categories of response to stress?^ Five major categories of stress response were identified in the review of literature: dominance, negotiation, co-existence, avoidance or diversion, and integration. Each response can result in either the strengthening of the individual and/or the organization. ^ The subjects for this study were 17 prospective and 20 <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> administrators. All subjects were enrolled in preservice and inservice graduate courses in educational administration at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Data gathering procedures consisted of the administration of the 15 critical incidents and the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire to both groups of subjects. ^ The scores of the two groups were computed using discriminant analysis to distinguish whether or not personality traits differed between prospective and <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> administrators. A chi square and t-tests were computed to identify differences between and within the groups of subjects. ^ There were no statistically significant differences between trainees and practitioners on (1) measures of personality or (2) type of response selected for a set of 15 critical incidents. Trainees and practitioners did differ significantly in what would be expected in their selection of five categories of response to stress. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a {{proposed}} program that would provide comprehensive preparation for prospective secondary and elementary school administrators in Jamaica. The population consisted of one hundred <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> administrators in Jamaica. A Q-sort technique was used to prioritize thirty-six educational preparation goal statements. The twenty most important goals were chosen and rank-ordered to develop a core curriculum for the proposed program. Findings The following goal statements were ranked as the four most important goals by <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> administrators:-Goal Statement 1 [...] "Develop competence in selection, development and evaluation of personnel. "-Goal Statement 3 [...] "Development and understanding of the decision making process. "-Goal Statement 13 [...] "Develop competence in providing leadership in the development of the total school curriculum and educational policies. "-Goal Statement 27 [...] "Develop competence in fostering and maintaining staff and student morale. "Goal statements judged to be the least important by <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> administrators were:-Goal Statement 16 [...] "Develop competence in the process of negotiations and concepts of labor relations in the public school setting. "-Goal Statement 33 [...] "Develop competence in the use of computers in educational operations and in the decision making process. " Conclusions The judgment of <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> administrators regarding core preparation experiences needed by prospective administrators was revealed by the final rank-ordering of the set of twenty educational goal statements. Since the rank-ordering of the goal statements revealed that administrators in all types of positions were in substantial agreement on the items ranked in the top half of the set of twenty goal statements it would seem reasonable that the core of a program include the content suggested from these items.

40|$|Objective – This paper {{provides}} an overview of progress and developments surrounding evidence based <b>practice</b> in <b>school</b> librarianship, and seeks to provide a picture of current thinking about evidence based practice {{as it relates to the}} field. It addresses current issues and challenges facing the adoption of evidence based <b>practice</b> in <b>school</b> librarianship. Methods – The paper is based on a narrative review of a small but growing body of literature on evidence based <b>practice</b> in <b>school</b> librarianship, set within a broader perspective of evidence based education. In addition, it presents the outcomes of a collaborative process of input from 200 school libraries leaders collected at a School Library summit in 2007 specifically to address the emerging arena of evidence based practice in this field. Results – A holistic model of evidence based <b>practice</b> for <b>school</b> libraries is presented, centering on three integrated dimensions of evidence: evidence for practice, evidence in practice, and evidence of practice. Conclusion – The paper identifies key challenges ahead if evidence based school librarianship is to develop further. These include: building research credibility within the broader educational environment; the need for ongoing review and evaluation of the diverse body of research in education, librarianship and allied fields to make quality evidence available in ways that can enable <b>practicing</b> <b>school</b> librarians to build a culture of evidence based practice; development of tools, strategies, and exemplars to use to facilitate evidence based decision-making; and, ensuring that the many and diverse advances in education and librarianship become part of the <b>practice</b> of <b>school</b> librarianship...|$|R
