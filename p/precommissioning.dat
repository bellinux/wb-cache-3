These case studies cover different compressor lineups, such as axial and centrifugal compressors and parallel operations. One example shows how a dynamic model was used to identify critical design issues at the early stage of engineering phase to avoid design or field problems at a later date. Other examples show how dynamic simulation was used to evaluate design alternatives and ultimately improve overall compressor operation and protection...|$|E
