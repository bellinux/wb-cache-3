5|$|After 1728, Hylton's second son, John Hylton, de jure 18th Baron Hylton added a {{complementary}} south wing (its foundation wall still extant), crenellations to both wings {{and removed the}} door on the north wing. He also changed the circular bartizan on {{the north end of the}} west front, to an octagonal turret and removed the <b>portcullis</b> from the west entrance.|$|E
5|$|The 16th-century {{gatehouse}} is on {{the inland}} side of the Nether Bailey, and comprises twin D-plan towers flanking an arched entrance passage. Formerly the passage was defended by a <b>portcullis</b> and a double set of doors, with guard rooms either side. Over the entrance {{are a series of}} rooms which may have served as accommodation for the castle's keeper. Collapsed masonry surrounds the gatehouse, dating from its destruction after 1690.|$|E
5|$|The Gatehouse {{is reached}} across a wooden bridge, {{incorporating}} a drawbridge. Burges intended {{the bridge to}} copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire {{in the event of}} attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive bretache and, above the entrance, Burges sited a <b>portcullis</b> and a glazed statue of the Madonna and Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E
25|$|The town's arms {{might be}} {{described}} thus: Azure a round castle wall embattled with two <b>portcullises</b> open, the wall enclosing two towers, the whole Or, with peaked roofs gules, between the <b>portcullises</b> an inescutcheon azure with a lion rampant Or armed and langued gules among six billets Or.|$|R

5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{external}} work was complete {{by the end of}} 1879. The result closely followed Burges's original plans, with the exception of an additional watch tower intended to resemble a minaret, and some defensive timber hoardings, both of which were not undertaken. Clark continued to advise Burges on historical aspects of the reconstruction and the architect tested the details of proposed features, such as the drawbridge and <b>portcullis,</b> against surviving designs at other British castles.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle is through the western barbican, an exterior defence {{in front of the}} main gate. When first built, the barbican was reached over a drawbridge and a masonry ramp that came up sharply from the town below; the modern path cuts east along the outside of the walls. The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain, and the gate would originally have been protected by a <b>portcullis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between late 1962 {{and early}} 1964 the east {{ends of the}} {{platforms}} were extended to allow longer 8-car trains to be operated. This involved carefully enlarging the tunnels under the Metropolitan Police's original headquarters at New Scotland Yard (now Norman Shaw Buildings). The station was completely rebuilt to incorporate new deep-level platforms for the Jubilee line when it was extended to the London Docklands in the 1990s. During the works, {{the level of the}} sub-surface platforms was lowered to enable ground level access to <b>Portcullis</b> House. This was achieved in small increments which were carried out when the line was closed at night.|$|E

50|$|In England, working <b>portcullises</b> survive at the Tower of London, Monk Bar in York, Amberley Castle, and Hever Castle.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{extensive}} counter measures {{which included}} three huge <b>portcullises</b> slabs, plunderers were {{still able to}} penetrate to the burial chamber.|$|R
5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a <b>portcullis</b> for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
5|$|The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, {{is in the}} Gatehouse, entered {{from the}} Drawing Room. It {{contains}} a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the <b>portcullis.</b> The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and oil on attackers.|$|E
5|$|The {{polygonal}} gun platform {{around the}} keep has 16 sides, {{with a total}} of 14 gun embrasures. The two-storey forebuilding dates from {{the second half of the}} 16th century, with three rooms on each level linked by a spiral-staircase, and was originally used to house the captain of the castle. Its entrance was guarded with a <b>portcullis,</b> and the roof was designed to be defendable with handguns. The stone bridge that stretches across the ditch that protects the castle dates from 1902; it would originally have been protected at the front by a rectangular gatehouse, but this was demolished at the start of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Chamber gates {{were often}} {{integrated}} into existing buildings and {{protected by the}} defensive levels above them, by defensive towers or by <b>portcullises</b> and drawbridges.|$|R
50|$|The four roads {{leading out}} of the village in the {{cardinal}} compass directions were particularly well secured with <b>portcullises</b> at the four gates (Pforten), the (the Hangen-Weisheimer Pforte, the Flomborner Pforte, the Dintesheimer Pforte and the Alzeyer Pforte).|$|R
50|$|The gates {{that once}} guarded the entrances to the City of Copenhagen through the City Ramparts were stone {{buildings}} {{that had a}} single archway through the middle for traffic, protected by gates and <b>portcullises.</b> There were four gates affording access to the city.|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface {{platforms}} opened in 1868 by the District Railway (DR) {{as part of}} the company's first section of the Inner Circle route and deep level platforms opened in 1999 {{as part of the}} Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, but the original station was completely rebuilt in conjunction with the construction of the deep level platforms and <b>Portcullis</b> House, which sits above the station.|$|E
5|$|The top tower {{along the}} front wall of the forward compound, tower 6, has a square base which was {{reinforced}} with a six-sided foundation. Working west, the square base of tower 7 was reinforced with a circular foundation. Tower 8, on the upper side of the front <b>portcullis,</b> has an irregular, but generally square, base. It is also the shortest of the first nine towers. Guarding {{the other side is}} tower 9, which has a square base reinforced by an eight-sided foundation.|$|E
5|$|The two-storied north-west bastion {{protected}} the castle against attack along the spit from the mainland, and housed the castle's original <b>portcullis</b> {{as well as}} providing accommodation for the garrison. It had three levels of gun positions on its ground floor, first floor and roof, which were adapted in the 19th century to house heavier weapons and shelter riflemen. The bastion links to an external caponier, a covered walkway with rifle loops for close defence, built in 1852. The north-east and south-east bastions are only one storey tall, originally holding two levels of gun positions on the ground floor and roofs, again both adapted to support heavier guns in the 19th century.|$|E
6000|$|... "The burghers will {{maintain}} a strict watch upon the wall, drawbridges shall be raised and <b>portcullises</b> lowered, from sunset to sunrise, and strong patrols maintained through the night. This guard the burghers will willingly maintain, to secure against the escape of the murderer of their townsman." ...|$|R
50|$|External defences in {{the castle}} {{included}} two <b>portcullises</b> which could be lowered when the castle came under attack. Arrows could be shot through loopholes overlooking the gateway. The curtain walls had slits through which stones and boiling oil could be dropped on any attackers trying to scale the walls.|$|R
50|$|The <b>portcullises,</b> {{roses and}} lion were all {{associated}} with King Henry VII, {{who brought the}} rival houses of Lancaster and York together and helped build the palace. The swan represented the River Thames. The stag represented Richmond Park and Old Deer Park, and the wreath the idea of municipality.|$|R
5|$|These later castles did {{not always}} have a keep, but {{this may have been}} because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers {{provided}} space for habitation {{to make up for the}} loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway– although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances– and one or more <b>portcullis.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Protestants {{were caught}} in crossfire by townspeople {{engaging}} in the battle, many decided to flee through the Battant. They took the <b>portcullis</b> down, but could not find boats to cross the Doubs, so some soldiers chose to swim; many of them drowned, including goldsmith Guillaume Laboral from Montbéliard. Those who did not escape the battle were executed at the gallows. The executions occurred on the same day, or later in the week. In total, twenty Protestants were killed in combat, and two drowned in the Doubs. The Father of Faverney, Antoine d'Achey, and the army in Vesoul were dispatched to rescue the city, not knowing that the battle had already ended. Nonetheless, Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga thanked Achey for his attempts.|$|E
5|$|Derby Place was {{situated}} in the parish of St Benedict and St Peter, south of St Paul's Cathedral, more or less on the College's present location. There are records of the heralds carrying out modifications {{to the structure of}} Derby Place over many years. However, little record of its appearance has survived, except the description that the buildings formed three sides of a quadrangle, entered through a gate with a <b>portcullis</b> on the west side. On the south range, roughly where Queen Victoria Street now stands, was a large hall on the western end. Derby Place's hearth tax bill from 1663, discovered in 2009 at the National Archives at Kew, showed that the building had about thirty-two rooms, which were the workplace as well as the home to eleven officers of arms.|$|E
50|$|A {{little to}} the east of the keep is the main gatehouse. Like the keep, it was subject to slighting {{at the end of the}} Civil War. Some {{elements}} of the Paganell's Norman castle remain in the structure but it mainly dates from the rebuilding carried out after 1262 by the de Somery family. A double gateway with two <b>portcullises</b> was constructed at this time. Under the Suttons, a barbican was added to the outside of the gatehouse so that the whole structure is sometimes called the 'Triple Gate'. Originally the gatehouse was connected to the keep by a thick curtain wall. When built, the gatehouse had three floors with the machinery for opertaing the <b>portcullises</b> on the first floor and a guard room on the second floor. Above the guard room were the battlements.|$|R
5|$|On {{the north}} side lies the {{entrance}} to the underground chamber system, which was sealed by two granite <b>portcullises</b> indicating that a burial took place. A broken sarcophagus lid of blue-grey basalt was found in the burial chamber by Cecil Mallaby Firth during his brief excavations of the pyramid in 1930.|$|R
2500|$|Two large segment-arched {{entrance}}s {{are present}} {{on either side}} of the gatehouse, flanked by cross-windows. Each entrance is approximately [...] wide by [...] high. Above the east (main) entrance is a row of three carved shields in cusped panels. The shields present the arms of Darcy (centre) flanked by Meynell (right) and Gray (left), the latter reflecting the marriage of Philip Darcy to Elizabeth Gray in the late 14th century. Above the shields is a further single shield that shows the arms of Darcy and Meynell impaled, reflecting the original marriage that united the families and brought the castle into the hands of the Darcys. The entrances would originally have been blocked by <b>portcullises</b> made of wood or metal that could be raised or lowered by winches set into the gatehouse walls. The grooves for the <b>portcullises</b> are still visible today.|$|R
5|$|Following {{schooling}} at Wellington College, Bellew {{went up to}} Christ Church, Oxford. He {{arrived at}} the College of Arms in 1922, when he was appointed <b>Portcullis</b> Pursuivant. After four years in that capacity, {{he was promoted to}} the office of Somerset Herald and went on to serve as the College’s registrar from 1935 to 1946. His heraldic career was interrupted by World War II, when Bellew rose to the rank of Squadron Leader in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and was mentioned in despatches. Having spent 24 years as Somerset Herald, he succeeded Sir Algar Howard as Garter Principal King of Arms in 1950, the highest position in the College of Arms and the leading herald in England and Wales.|$|E
5|$|The castle is now {{entered through}} the 13th-century {{southern}} gatehouse, which faces towards the former deer park. This entrance was once {{protected by a}} 14th-century fortified bridge, also called a barbican, but only one set of stone arches remain, showing two surviving arrow slits in arched recesses. The south gatehouse has two drum towers {{on either side of}} a gateway, protected by a <b>portcullis,</b> and would have had three floors, linked to a wall walk around the castle. It would originally have been faced with dressed stonework, which has since been removed. The north gatehouse on the opposite site of the bailey originally led into the town of Launceston. The first floor of the building was probably first used as the porter's room, then by the castle's constable, and finally later as a prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in {{the centre}} of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13thcentury. It was originally accessed via a drawbridge and visitors had to pass through two gates, one {{at either end of the}} passage, and a <b>portcullis.</b> The semi-octagonal projections on either side of the gate passage are considered ornamental. Between the projections and above the gate were machicolations, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the passage were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are slits at ground level. Slits on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed the gatekeeper to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20thcenturies when it housed the castle's custodian; slits in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.|$|E
50|$|In 1329, <b>portcullises</b> were {{installed}} {{at all the}} gates of the castle. Unfortunately, in 1335, Edward III destroyed the castle just {{before the start of the}} Hundred Years War. This destruction was continued in 1337 by Charles III of Navarre who brought down the walls. In 1395, Philip II of Burgundy restored the castle walls.|$|R
5|$|Gate towers, one on {{each side}} of the gate and {{projecting}} out from the gate to allow defenders to shoot into the area in front of the entrance. The gates themselves were normally wooden with metal covering plates to prevent destruction by fire. Some gates had <b>portcullises.</b> Postern gates were built into towers or near them to allow sorties.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1485, many {{wealthy and}} noble landowners lived in homes {{that were not}} {{necessarily}} comfortable but built to withstand sieges, though manor houses that were only lightly fortified, if at all, had been increasingly built. Castles and smaller manor houses often had moats, <b>portcullises</b> and crenellations designed for archers to stand guard and pick off approaching enemies.|$|R
