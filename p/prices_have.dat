Semi-detached <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> more than doubled {{from an average of}} £60,000 in 1998, although house prices in most areas of the country have seen a similar increase. These figures are, however, below the England and Wales average.|$|E
5|$|About 100 tonnes of {{dysprosium}} {{are produced}} worldwide each year, with 99% of that total produced in China. Dysprosium <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> climbed nearly twentyfold, from $7 per pound in 2003, to $130 a pound in late 2010. The price increased to $1,400/kg in 2011 but fell to $240 in 2015, {{largely due to}} illegal production in China which circumvented government restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Prices {{of several}} rare-earth {{elements}} increased sharply by mid-2010 as China imposed a 40% export reduction, citing environmental concerns {{as the reason}} for the export restrictions. These quotas have been interpreted as an attempt to control the supply of rare earths. However, the high <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> provided an incentive to begin or reactivate several rare-earth mining projects around the world, including the United States, Australia, Vietnam, and Kazakhstan.|$|E

5000|$|The {{events leading}} up to the 72% {{increase}} in customer's rates has been referred to by BGE executives, state commissioners, and state legislators as [...] "the perfect storm". In the years since rates were capped, fuel <b>prices</b> <b>had</b> risen dramatically. Natural gas <b>prices</b> <b>had</b> risen about 125%, regular gasoline <b>prices</b> <b>had</b> risen over 150%, and heating oil <b>prices</b> <b>had</b> risen almost 200%. Maryland region’s fuel prices are tied greatly to natural gas prices. Subsequently, when Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused major natural gas pipelines to shut down for a short period, natural gas prices skyrocketed. Therefore, when BGE went to the market to procure power, prices for power were abnormally high.|$|R

5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. <b>Prices</b> <b>have</b> fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5|$|Factory-based {{industry}} {{accounted for}} an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in Douala and Bonabéri. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, {{but these are not}} extensively mined (see Mining in Cameroon). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but this is still a substantial sector such that dips in <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.|$|E
5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E
50|$|After <b>Price</b> <b>had</b> exposed Rudi, various {{scientists}} such Karl Przibram and {{the magician}} Henry Evans wrote to Price {{telling him that}} they agreed that Rudi would evade control during his séances and congratulated Price {{on the success of}} unmasking the fraud. In opposition, SPR members who were highly critical of Price, supported Rudi's mediumship and promoted a conspiracy theory that <b>Price</b> <b>had</b> hoaxed the photograph. SPR member Anita Gregory suggested that <b>Price</b> <b>had</b> deliberately faked the photograph to discredit SPR research and ruin Rudi's reputation. However, a photographic expert testified that the photograph was genuine. SPR member John L. Randall reviewed the Price and Schneider case and came to the conclusion the photograph was genuine, <b>Price</b> <b>had</b> caught Rudi in fraud.|$|R

5|$|Practical {{implementations}} of road {{congestion pricing}} are found {{almost exclusively in}} urban areas, because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers. Autoroute A1 in Northern France {{is one of the}} few cases of congestion pricing implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 congestion <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings. As congestion pricing has been increasing worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide congestion pricing; city center toll ring; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{has reduced}} as wind turbine {{technology}} has improved. There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades, improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital and maintenance costs {{have continued to}} decline. For example, the wind industry in the USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300feet to 400feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. <b>Prices</b> <b>have</b> fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been {{increasing the amount of}} wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5|$|The {{price of}} PV modules per MW {{has fallen by}} 60 percent since the summer of 2008, {{according}} to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power {{for the first time}} on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries. Wind turbine <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> also fallen – by 18 percent per MW in the last two years – reflecting, as with solar, fierce competition in the supply chain. Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar, wind and other technologies lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> fueled increased smuggling of slow lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, the advertisements on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow lorises prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow lorises were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok. Numerous illegal trade routes for each species were also documented prior to the 2007 CITES vote over Appendix I coverage in the Notification to Parties publication.|$|E
5|$|Unit <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> been readjusted {{and some}} units renamed, {{as well as}} new ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle unit that can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E
