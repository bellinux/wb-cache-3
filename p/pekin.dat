5|$|In 1873 the <b>Pekin</b> duck was {{introduced}} to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the <b>Pekin</b> was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders switched to the <b>Pekin</b> duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the <b>Pekin</b> duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.|$|E
5|$|Route98 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Route29 {{on the border}} of <b>Pekin</b> and North Pekin; Worley Lake and the Illinois River lie to the west. The route heads east as a divided two-lane road called Edgewater Drive, passing a group of houses which lie between two small lakes. After entering North <b>Pekin,</b> the highway becomes undivided and runs through a business district. It intersects County Route25, known locally as Parkway Road, before crossing into <b>Pekin.</b> Route98 enters a forested area in <b>Pekin</b> and passes to the north of John T. McNaughton Park near the city's eastern border.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the <b>Pekin</b> duck was {{introduced}} from China to Britain {{for the first}} time. Superficially similar in appearance to an Aylesbury duck, a <b>Pekin</b> is white with orange legs and bill, with its legs near the rear, giving it an upright stance while on land. Although not thought {{to have such a}} delicate flavour as the Aylesbury, the <b>Pekin</b> was hardier, a more prolific layer, fattened more quickly, and was roughly the same size as an Aylesbury at nine weeks.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>Pekins</b> are {{alleged to}} have been looted from the private {{collection}} of the Emperor of China at Peking (now known as Beijing) by British soldiers {{towards the end of}} the Second Opium War around 1860. However, some sources suggest that a consignment of birds from China around 1835 were given to Queen Victoria, assuming the name of 'Shanghais' and that these birds were bred with further imports and were developed into the breed we know today as <b>Pekins.</b> The <b>Pekins</b> first brought to the United Kingdom are said to have been Buff in colour, with Blacks and Cuckoos arriving later on. They are known in the United States and Canada as Cochin Bantams.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{foie gras}} was {{primarily}} produced with geese, {{but in the}} 1960s the majority of farmers began to use mulards. Geese are more expensive to maintain than ducks (they are larger and more aggressive), and the more temperamental muscovies did not accept the process of gavage (force feeding) as readily as <b>Pekins,</b> causing {{the quality of the}} foie gras to suffer. This problem was avoided by the introduction of mulards. These hybrids have also become extremely common in countries where foie gras is not produced.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} Beatrix Potter's 1908 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck—about an Aylesbury duck {{although}} set in Cumbria—caused {{renewed interest in}} the breed, the Aylesbury duck was in steep decline. The duckers of Buckinghamshire had generally failed to introduce technological improvements such as the incubator, and inbreeding had dangerously weakened the breed. Meanwhile, the cost of duck food had risen fourfold over the 19thcentury, and from 1873 onwards competition from <b>Pekin</b> and <b>Pekin</b> cross ducks was undercutting Aylesbury ducks at the marketplace.|$|E
5|$|Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were {{becoming}} inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were {{more susceptible to}} disease. Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers. Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of <b>Pekin</b> ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross <b>Pekin</b> ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks {{did not have the}} delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.|$|E

50|$|The {{incubation}} {{period of the}} hybrid eggs is between the mallard and muscovy, {{with an average of}} 32 days. About half of the eggs hatch into mulard ducks. Mulards tend to combine certain traits of the parent breeds. Due to their muscovy heritage, they produce leaner meat than Pekins; females tend to be raised for meat while males are used for foie gras. Like muscovy ducks, mulards have claws on their feet, but do not fly and perch; instead, they prefer to stay on water, as <b>Pekins</b> do.|$|R

50|$|Indian Runner {{ducks and}} <b>Pekins</b> brought in unusual plumage colour mutations. These {{included}} the dusky and restricted mallard genes, light phase, harlequin phase, blue and brown dilutions, {{as well as}} the famous pied varieties named by the geneticist F.M. Lancaster as the 'Runner pattern'. Much of the proliferation of new colour varieties in breeds of domestic duck begins with the importation of these oriental ducks. Original research by R.G. Jaap (1930s) and F.M. Lancaster has allowed breeders to understand the effect of genotypes in managing and creating colour varieties. Simplified information can be found in writings by Dave Holderread, and Mike and Chris Ashton.|$|R
5|$|After leaving <b>Pekin,</b> Route98 {{passes through}} {{farmland}} in unincorporated Groveland Township. The highway meets Cole Hollow Road and California Road at successive intersections {{in a residential}} area. Past a creek, the road heads into a rural area with sections of farmland and forest. As it enters Groveland, the highway intersects County Route1, which runs south through the community. Route98 leaves Groveland to the east, running through another farmed area. The route curves into Morton and takes the name Birchwood Street, traversing a creek before entering an industrial district. In this area, Route98 briefly becomes a divided highway before terminating at exit 31 on I-155. The road continues past the terminus as a local street, still carrying the name Birchwood Street.|$|E

30|$|Acoustic surveys using bat {{detectors}} {{are increasingly}} being used {{in addition to these}} traditional methods (Jones et al., 2009; O’Farrell & Miller, 1999; Ochoa, O'Farrell, & Miller, 2000). According to O’Farrell (1997), acoustic detection {{has been shown to be}} a powerful supplement to standard capture methods to identify many insectivorous bats that are underrepresented in field inventories. Indeed, bats of the families Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, and some subfamilies of Vespertilionidae are very skilled at avoiding mist nets because of their high versatility inflight and efficient echolocation calls (Kingston, Francis, Akbar, & Kunz, 2003). Acoustic detection depends on the use of ultrasonic bat detectors to monitor echolocation calls produced by insectivorous bats. These detectors are widely used to study habitat use by bats (Krusic, Yamasaki, Neefus, & <b>Pekins,</b> 1996; Law, Anderson, & Chidel, 1999; Vaughan, Jones, & Harris, 1997). Detectors often reveal the presence of more species at a site than capture techniques (Kuenzi & Morrison, 1998; Murray, Britzke, Hadley, & Robbins, 1999; O’Farrell & Gannon, 1999) and can be deployed in a much wider variety of locations than capture techniques (O’Farrell, Miller, & Gannon, 1999). Bat detectors can also be used to accurately identify bat (Britzke, Murray, Heywood, & Robbins, 2002; O’Farrell et al., 1999; Parsons & Jones, 2000). Detectors, unlike netting and trapping, do not involve handling and thus minimize disturbance. However, before acoustic methods can be used for inventories, a library of authenticated calls is required to describe the echolocation call characteristics of each species present in a particular area so that, when calls of unknown bats are recorded in the field, they can be compared with these reference calls. Acoustic survey has never been used to characterize and identify echolocation calls of bats anywhere in Cameroon. This explains the total absence of echolocation reference call libraries.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Pekin</b> Formation is a Late Triassic deposit in Deep River Basin of North and South Carolina, {{which dates}} from the Carnian about 231 million years ago. The {{formation}} is the oldest in the Chatham Group. The locality of Carnufex is in a boulder field, and the rock facies suggest that the region once represented a channel or alluvial deposit. In the Carnian, the formation would have been 2º north of the paleoequator. Many fauna from the <b>Pekin</b> Formation await formal description. The fauna include a new aetosaur, Carnufex and another crocodylomorph, an unnamed traversodont formerly assigned to Boreogomphodon, and a new dicynodont.|$|E
