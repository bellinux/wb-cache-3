40|$|Olfactory {{neuroblastoma}} (ONB) {{is a rare}} {{malignant neoplasm}} of sinonasal tract, derived from olfactory epithelium. Uni-lateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, si-nusitis, and headaches are common symptoms. Olfactory neuroblastoma shows neuroendocrine differentiation and similarly to other neuroendocrine tumors can produce several types of <b>peptic</b> <b>substances</b> and hormones. Ex-cess production of these substances can be responsible for different types of endocrinological paraneoplastic syn-dromes (PNS). Moreover, besides en-docrinological, in ONB may also occur neurological PNS, caused by immune cross-reactivity between tumor and normal host tissues in the nervous sys-tem. Paraneoplastic syndromes in ONB include: syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), ectopic ACTH syn-drome (EAS), humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM), hypertension due to catecholamine secretion by tumor, opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia (OMA) and paraneoplastic cerebellar degen-eration. Paraneoplastic syndromes in ONB tend to have atypical features, therefore diagnosis may be difficult. In this review, we described initial symp-toms, patterns of presentation, treat-ment and outcome of paraneoplastic syndromes in ONB, reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Current annual lemon {{production}} in Argentina is about 900 thousand t. 75 % is used industrially to obtain pasteurized juice concentrate. Since 40 - 45 % of citrus fruit content is peel and seeds, the annual lemon residue yield is 360 thousand t. Lemon peel contains about 30 % (B. S.) of <b>peptic</b> <b>substances</b> with an important commercial value {{due to its}} gelling and thickening properties for food, chemical, pharmacological and cosmetic products. Membrane processes have many applications in food manufacture. The objective {{of this study is}} to analyze the influence of ultrafiltration operating variables on instant permeate flow (Fp) and on the energy requirement for pectin extract concentration from lemon peel. A DDS lab module was used, lab 20 - 772 model with synthetic material membranes, 9 kDa, shear force, the intrinsic membrane resistance (Rm) being 3 * 1013 m - 1. Results show that Fp decrease caused by polarization induced resistance occurrence and the influence of operating variables on Fp offer relevant data to estimate the energy requirement in relation to feeding flow at constant temperature, which may be compared to pectin concentration increase in the retained flow in relation to initial extract concentration...|$|E
