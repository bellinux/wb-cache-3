40|$|The use of 130 -nm CMOS for <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> at 20 GHz is {{explored}} {{through a}} set of <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> as well as transistor level measurements. The <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> explore single versus cascode configuration, smaller versus larger transistor sizes, and the combination of two <b>amplifiers</b> using <b>power</b> splitters/combiners. A maximum output power of 63 mW at 20 GHz was achieved. Transistor-level characterization using load pull measurements on 1 -mm gate width transistors yielded 148 -mW/mm output power. Transistor modeling and layout for <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are also discussed.

500|$|The {{innovative}} split of pre- and power-amplifier sections {{allows the}} use of the pre-amp stage to drive multiple <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> in parallel, or use long signal cables to connect to remote <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> or <b>powered</b> speakers. This facility became hugely popular with audiophiles, who would seek to isolate this [...] "remarkably fine-sounding preamp section", to use with one or more external <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Currently the {{multiple}} wireless data transmission technologies have been commercially implemented, such as long-term evolution (LTE), Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. There is a keen requirement {{to combine the}} <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> for those technologies into a single one which can amplifies concurrent multi-band signals. On the physically layer, there are two popular architectures, namely parallel single-band <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and concurrent multi-band <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> In this thesis, quantitative comparison between parallel single-band <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and concurrent multi-band <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> has been presented theoretically in the aspects of area, drain efficiency and linearity. Methods of calculating drain efficiency is derived for concurrent multi-band PAs for different frequency ratios. Linearity issues of concurrent multi-band <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> have been addressed based on the concepts of gain compression and intermodulation distortion. Final, area consumption has been compared for both architectures with current technologies. Results of the drain efficiency map versus 2 -D frequency ratio are plotted in figures for class A, B and C. Linearity degradation of concurrent multi-band has been derived mathematically...|$|R
5|$|The {{authorized}} {{loudspeaker enclosure}} {{to use with}} a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet, which housed an external amplifier and speaker in a cabinet. The cabinet carried a balanced mono signal along with the necessary mains power directly from the organ, using a six-pin cable. Spinet organs contained a built-in <b>power</b> <b>amplifier</b> and loudspeakers, so did not require a tone cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a <b>power</b> <b>amplifier</b> capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS <b>power</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} the mechanics. In 1969 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the <b>power</b> <b>amplifier</b> design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model was added to the range.|$|E
5|$|Fender {{was bought}} by CBS in 1965. Rhodes stayed with the company, and {{released}} the first Fender Rhodes piano, a 73 note model. The instrument consisted of two components— the piano and a separate enclosure containing the <b>power</b> <b>amplifier</b> and loudspeaker, which was placed underneath the former. Like the piano bass, it was finished in black tolex, and came with a fiberglass top. During the late 1960s, two models of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell particularly well and examples are now hard to find.|$|E
5|$|MAR used {{separate}} transmitter and receivers, {{a necessity}} {{at the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own <b>power</b> <b>amplifier</b> using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E
30|$|Note {{that the}} {{simulation}} {{results have been}} obtained by normalizing the shifted modulation so the extra power needed to shift the modulation does not push the <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> into saturation and hence, <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> do not experience any non-linearities.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to study how the {{interference}} between two antennas in a MIMO system affects the linearity of the <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> <b>powering</b> the antennas. For the MIMO system, two <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and two antennas were constructed and designed using the software ADS and a software defined radio was constructed using the platform USRP and the software LabVIEW. The result was that the interference between the antennas affects the linearity of the <b>power</b> <b>amplifiers</b> <b>powering</b> the antennas adversely and a reasonable theory was that the interaction decreases inversely proportional to {{the square of the}} distance...|$|R

Its circuitry is supposedly identical {{to that of the}} XS, but has a 24-bit DAC that can be called from any of five S/PDIF inputs. It has more features, a more well-endowed power supply allowing delivery of 80 watts' music, and can bi-amp suitable speakers by adding a secondary <b>power</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E

25|$|A <b>power</b> <b>{{amplifier}}</b> is an amplifier designed {{primarily to}} increase the power available to a load. In practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load impedances, {{as well as the}} inherent voltage and current gain. A radio frequency (RF) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20dB might have a voltage gain of 20dB and an available power gain of much more than 20dB (power ratio of 100)—yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600Ω microphone and the output connects to a 47kΩ input socket for a <b>power</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In general the <b>power</b> <b>amplifier</b> is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of <b>power</b> <b>amplifier</b> based on the biasing of the output transistors or tubes: see <b>power</b> <b>amplifier</b> classes below.|$|E
