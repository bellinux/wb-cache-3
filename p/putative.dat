5|$|In his 1995 revision, Nelson {{refers to}} <b>putative</b> hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.apiculatus, citing the 1978 paper {{in which he}} {{published}} <b>putative</b> hybrids with A.dobsonii and A.forrestii. It is unclear whether the reference to A.apiculatus is an error or a fourth <b>putative</b> hybrid.|$|E
5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both <b>putative</b> parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, the <b>putative</b> hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the <b>putative</b> hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E
5|$|Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Ralph de la Fuente Marcos have {{calculated}} {{that some of}} the statistically significant commensurabilities are compatible with the Planet Nine hypothesis; in particular, a number of objects may be trapped in the 5:3 and 3:1 mean-motion resonances with a <b>putative</b> Planet Nine with a semimajor axis ∼700 AU.|$|E
5|$|Five <b>putative</b> lower molariforms of Ferugliotherium {{are known}} from the Los Alamitos Formation (MACN Pv-RN 20, 174, 175, and 253 and MLP 88-III-28-1). These teeth include the holotypes of Ferugliotherium windhauseni (MACN Pv-RN 20, the only second lower molariform, or m2) and Vucetichia {{gracilis}} (MACN Pv-RN 174).|$|E
5|$|Hybrids of {{the species}} are known in nature and cultivation. In the Whipstick forest near Bendigo in Victoria, <b>putative</b> hybrids with Whirrakee wattle (Acacia williamsonii) have been identified; these {{resemble}} hakea wattle (Acacia hakeoides). Garden hybrids with Queensland silver wattle (Acacia podalyriifolia) raised in Europe {{have been given the}} names Acacia x siebertiana and Acacia x deneufvillei.|$|E
5|$|The earlier {{theories}} of Newberry, Černý and Grdseloff {{said that the}} Egyptian state under Peribsen suffered from several civil wars, either economic or political in origin. If he was {{held responsible for the}} <b>putative</b> misery in the past, this could explain why later king lists excluded Peribsen.|$|E
5|$|The {{well-developed}} compound {{eyes were}} stalked. The striking morphological similarities {{of the eyes}} of Waptia fieldensis to that of extant mysid shrimp make it very likely that they were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion. A median eye may have also been present. Nervous tissue, including a <b>putative</b> brain, has been identified.|$|E
5|$|Betts was one {{of several}} {{longtime}} editors to leave Vogue around the new millennium. A year later, Sykes, another <b>putative</b> successor, left to concentrate on her best-selling novels set in the city's upper classes and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume the top jobs at other publications. While some of their replacements didn't last, a new group of core editors formed.|$|E
5|$|Bioinformatic screens have {{predicted}} that over 250 human proteins contain prion-like domains (PrLD). These domains are hypothesized {{to have the same}} transmissible, amyloidogenic properties of PrP and known fungal proteins. As in yeast, proteins involved in gene expression and RNA binding seem to be particularly enriched in PrLD's, compared to other classes of protein. In particular, 29 of the known 210 proteins with an RNA recognition motif also have a <b>putative</b> prion domain. Meanwhile, several of these RNA-binding proteins have been independently identified as pathogenic in cases of ALS, FTLD-U, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|Comprising {{the nascent}} motion picture genres of horror and science fiction, the {{nightmare}} picture provoked individual psychological terror in its horror incarnations, while embodying group sociological terror in its science fiction manifestations. The two main types of pre-Code horror pictures were the single monster movie, and films where masses of hideous beasts rose up and attacked their <b>putative</b> betters. Frankenstein and Freaks exemplified both genres.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, morphological, {{ecological}} and molecular traits of all <b>putative</b> tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction {{of the two}} evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely Panthera tigris tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and Panthera tigris sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.|$|E
5|$|In a 2012 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{based on}} mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, the plain maskray and the Ningaloo maskray (N. ningalooensis) {{were found to}} be the most basal members of Neotrygon. The divergence of the N. annotata lineage was estimated to have occurred ~54 Ma. Furthermore, the individuals sequenced in the study sorted into two genetically distinct clades, suggesting that N. annotata is a cryptic species complex. The two <b>putative</b> species were estimated to have diverged ~4.9 Ma; the precipitating event was likely the splitting of the ancestral population by coastline changes.|$|E
5|$|It took almost 4billion {{years from}} the {{formation}} of the Earth for the Ediacaran fossils to first appear, 655million years ago. While <b>putative</b> fossils are reported from , the first uncontroversial evidence for life is found , and cells with nuclei certainly existed by : The reason why it took so long for forms with an Ediacaran grade of organisation to appear is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Many {{prominent}} scientists {{argued that}} the system was futile. Hans Bethe, along with IBM physicist Richard Garwin and Cornell University colleague Kurt Gottfried, wrote an article in Scientific American which analyzed the system and concluded that any <b>putative</b> enemy could disable such a system {{by the use of}} suitable decoys that would cost a very small fraction of the SDI program.|$|E
5|$|On the {{question}} of Malcolm's <b>putative</b> pilgrimage, pilgrimages to Rome, or other long-distance journeys, were far from unusual. Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Cnut and Mac Bethad have already been mentioned. Rognvald Kali Kolsson {{is known to have}} gone crusading in the Mediterranean in the 12th century. Nearer in time, Dyfnwal of Strathclyde died on pilgrimage to Rome in 975 as did Máel Ruanaid uá Máele Doraid, King of the Cenél Conaill, in 1025.|$|E
5|$|The Irascibles or Irascible 18 {{were the}} labels {{given to a}} group of American {{abstract}} artists who put name to an open letter, written in 1950, to the president of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, rejecting the museum's exhibition American Painting Today - 1950 and boycotting the accompanying competition. The subsequent media coverage of the protest and a now iconic group photograph, that appeared in Life magazine, gave them notoriety, popularised the term Abstract Expressionist and established them as the so-called first generation of the <b>putative</b> movement.|$|E
5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{outcrops}} in north-central Chubut Province, and the mammalian fossils {{come from}} the Mirasol Chico valley. The formation includes fluvial (river), deep-sea, and near-shore deposits, and the mammalian fauna probably comes from an estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain. The La Colonia Formation also contains dryolestoids, such as Coloniatherium and Reigitherium, {{as well as a}} ferugliotheriid and the <b>putative</b> multituberculate Argentodites. In addition, the La Colonia Formation has yielded fossils of a wide array of other animals, including crocodiles, plesiosaurs, lungfish (Ceratodus), and dinosaurs (including Carnotaurus).|$|E
5|$|The <b>putative</b> anamorph form of C.dentatus {{has been}} {{described}} as Tricladiopsis flagelliformis. Grown on 2% malt agar at standard conditions, it forms black-centered colonies that have a growth rate of 7cm per week. The conidia produced are thin and curved with a whip-like shape. They have 13–20 septa, measure 65–135 by 2–3.5μm, and usually have a single branch (typically about 45μm long) that appears before cells are released.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, <b>putative</b> complex hybrids {{occur on}} the Neblina Massif among populations of H. ceracea, H. hispida, H. neblinae, and H. parva. <b>Putative</b> crosses between H.macdonaldae and H.tatei have also been {{recorded}} {{in the southern part}} of Cerro Duida.|$|E
25|$|Proteins minK and MiRP1 are <b>putative</b> hERG beta subunits.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} claim {{inheritance}} {{rights as a}} <b>putative</b> partner (equivalent to the rights given to heterosexual couples under the <b>putative</b> spouse doctrine) when one partner believes himself or herself to have entered into a domestic partnership in good faith and is given legal rights {{as a result of}} his or her reliance upon this belief.|$|E
25|$|Buprenorphine is {{also known}} to bind to with high {{affinity}} and antagonize the <b>putative</b> ε-opioid receptor.|$|E
25|$|Specimens of a <b>putative</b> natural {{cross between}} N. dubia and N. jacquelineae {{have also been}} recorded.|$|E
25|$|A further {{thirteen}} <b>putative</b> BPVs {{have recently}} been identified; the novel viruses {{have yet to be}} assigned to subgroups.|$|E
25|$|The <b>putative</b> pterosaurian {{origins of}} Pteraichnus ignited {{controversy}} {{at the annual}} meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.|$|E
25|$|Naa15 harbors a <b>putative</b> NLS between {{residues}} 612-628 (KKNAEKEKQQRNQKKKK); however, {{analysis of}} the nuclear localization of Naa15 revealed discrepant results.|$|E
25|$|A user of {{marijuana}} and LSD, Breen believed in reincarnation, often recalling <b>putative</b> past lives in Atlantis, ancient Greece, and other mythological and historical epochs.|$|E
25|$|Theories on the <b>putative</b> {{succession}} had to {{be revised}} constantly from the later 1590s. The speculations were wide, and the cast of characters changed their status.|$|E
25|$|Small {{molecule}} U73122: aminosteroid, <b>putative</b> PLC inhibitor. However, {{the specificity}} of U73122 has been questioned. It {{has been reported that}} U73122 activates the phospholipase activity of purified PLCs.|$|E
25|$|Simple {{approaches}} {{compare the}} distribution of similarity scores of particular sequences and their orthologous counterparts in other species; HGT are inferred from outliers. The more sophisticated DLIGHT ('Distance Likelihood-based Inference of Genes Horizontally Transferred') method considers simultaneously the effect of HGT on all sequences within groups of <b>putative</b> orthologs: if a likelihood-ratio test of the HGT hypothesis versus a hypothesis of no HGT is significant, a <b>putative</b> HGT event is inferred. In addition, the method allows inference of potential donor and recipient species and provides an estimation of the time since the HGT event.|$|E
25|$|Since {{this virus}} {{has not yet}} been {{isolated}} from other outbreaks in other parts of southern China to date this <b>putative</b> association should be treated with circumspection.|$|E
25|$|Karl Hirsch {{tentatively}} {{concluded that}} the <b>putative</b> pterosaur eggs Oolithes were actually laid by turtles. Pterosaur eggs would remain unknown in the fossil record until 2004.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, nixtamalization {{significantly}} reduces (by 90–94%) mycotoxins {{produced by}} Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum, molds that commonly infect maize and the toxins {{of which are}} <b>putative</b> carcinogens.|$|E
25|$|This small <b>putative</b> gene {{exists only}} in a few {{papillomavirus}} types. The gene is not known to be expressed as a protein and {{does not appear to}} serve any function.|$|E
25|$|C.This {{is not a}} Saxon name, but a Latin one {{invented by}} 18th century antiquarians to define a <b>putative</b> route. It amounts to just a series of cross routes to reach Watling Street from Colchester.|$|E
25|$|A <b>putative</b> third {{grouping}} {{has been}} proposed—Alpavirinae—which infect the order Bacteroidales. This {{a group of}} viruses known only as prophages and additional work on these viruses seems indicated before subfamily status is granted.|$|E
