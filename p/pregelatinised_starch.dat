40|$|This paper {{describes}} the internal structure of tablets compressed from binary mixtures of sodium chloride and <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch.</b> The minimum particle diameter of <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> inside tablets compressed from mixtures was {{calculated from the}} difference between the initial pore size distribution and the pore size distribution after removal of the starch particles by burning. Subsequently, the tablets were carefully crushed. These powders, consisting of almost only sodium chloride particles, were measured by laser diffraction. It was found that the diameter of the sodium chloride particles hardly changed, whereas the minimum diameter of starch particles strongly decreased during the compaction process. As an effect of the difference in yield pressure, the harder sodium chloride particles cause deformation of the softer starch particles, resulting in a change in particle shape. The pore size distribution of tablets compressed from mixtures of sodium chloride and starch is typically that of viscoelastic materials; the larger pores (> 5 μm) change, while the small pores stay constant in number and size. The median pore diameter in tablets compressed from the mixtures is higher than the median pore diameter in tablets compressed from the pure materials.

After cooking of the <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch,</b> some undissolved granules remained in solution. Aqueous mixtures of kappa-carrageenan and starch were studied at 60 degrees C and 20 degrees C by combining rheological measurements and microscopic observations under conditions allowing gelation of carrageenan and non-gelation of starch. The viscometric study of mixed dilute solutions of amylose from <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> and carrageenan {{showed that the}} components are slightly incompatible. Mixture viscosity and elastic modulus were studied at 60 degrees C in details {{as a function of}} mixture composition for a total polymer concentration of 3 %; both were found to be significantly higher than the corresponding theoretical additive values. This finding was interpreted by starch granules excluded volume effect. At 20 degrees C, no noticeable increase of mixture elastic modulus was found as compared with the additive value. The absence of the synergistic effect is supposed to be due to the formation of highly inhomogeneous gels with agglomerates of undissolved granules...|$|E

40|$|Both dietary {{fermentable}} {{carbohydrates and}} the availability of straw bedding potentially affect activity patterns and energy utilisation in pigs. The present study aimed to investigate the combined effects of straw bedding and fermentable carbohydrates (native potato starch) on energy partitioning in growing pigs. In a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, 16 groups of 12 pigs (approximately 25 kg) were assigned to either barren housing or housing on straw bedding, and to native or <b>pregelatinised</b> potato <b>starch</b> included in the diet. Pigs were fed at approximately 2. 5 times maintenance. Nitrogen and energy balances were measured per group during a 7 -day experimental period, which was preceded by a 30 -day adaptation period. Heat production and physical activity were measured during 9 -min intervals. The availability of straw bedding increased both metabolisable energy (ME) intake and total heat production (P < 0. 001). Housing conditions did not affect total energy retention, but pigs on straw bedding retained more energy as protein (P < 0. 01) and less as fat (P < 0. 05) than barren-housed pigs. Average daily gain (P < 0. 001), ME intake (P < 0. 001) and energy retention (P < 0. 01) were lower in pigs on the native potato starch diet compared to those on the <b>pregelatinised</b> potato <b>starch</b> diet. Pigs on the <b>pregelatinised</b> potato <b>starch</b> diet showed larger fluctuations in heat production and respiration quotient over the 24 -h cycle than pigs on the native potato starch diet, and a higher activity-related energy expenditure. The effect of dietary starch type on activity-related heat production depended, however, on housing type (P < 0. 05). In barren housing, activity-related heat production was less affected by starch type (16. 1 % and 13. 7 % of total heat production on the pregelatinised and native potato starch diet, respectively) than in straw-enriched housing (21. 1 % and 15. 0 % of the total heat production on the pregelatinised and native potato starch diet, respectively). In conclusion, the present study shows that the availability both of straw bedding and of dietary starch type, fermentable or digestible, affects energy utilisation and physical activity of pigs. The effects of housing condition on protein and fat deposition suggest that environmental enrichment with long straw may result in leaner pigs. The lower energy expenditure on the physical activity of pigs on the native potato starch diet, which was the most obvious in straw-housed pigs, likely reflects a decrease in foraging behaviour related to a more gradual supply of energy from fermentation processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the apparent moisture content and compactibility of sodium starch glycolate was compared to similarly obtained data for pregelatinized starch. Samples of sodium starch glycolate (SSG) and <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> (PGS) were stored at 44 % or 75 % relative humidity (RH), producing samples exhibiting moisture contents of up to 14 % w/w, as determined by loss on drying (LOD). Increasing the moisture content of SSG and PGS resulted {{in an increase in}} compressibility and compactibility for both materials. However, the effect was more dramatic for SSG with unlubricated compactibilities of 2. 0 MPa and 0. 9 MPa at approximately 11. 5 % LOD for SSG and PGS, respectively, which was further exemplified in the compactibility of lubricated materials and in blends with microcrystalline cellulose. These results suggested that moisture content had a greater effect on the compactibility of SSG compared with PGS and that the interactions of water with the components of the SSG starch granules may be different from those within the PGS starch granules at comparable LOD values...|$|E

Proportion of PEO polymer, type of insoluble filler, proportion of tramadol HCl, amount of drug in tablet, tablet diameter and compression pressure were recognized as critical formulation and process parameters and their influence on drug release and tablet mechanical properties was evaluated. Percentages of tramadol HCl released after 30 and 240 minutes were selected for evaluation of drug release, while tensile strength was used as indicator of tablet mechanical properties. Only proportion of tramadol HCl exhibits statistically significant effect on percentages of tramadol HCl released after 30 and 240 minutes, with higher, wherein increasing of the tramadol HCl proportion increased its release rate among the evaluated variables in selected ranges. All of the investigated factors exhibit statistically significant effect on tablets tensile strength, with the largest influence of filler type.

40|$|The tensile {{strength}} of tablets compressed from binary mixtures is in general not linearly {{related to the}} strength of tablets prepared from single materials; in many cases it shows a decreased {{tensile strength}} relative to interpolation. The materials used in this study, sodium chloride and <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch,</b> are both plastically deforming materials, but have a different densification and relaxation behaviour. The yield pressure of the binary mixtures shows an almost linear relationship. As an effect of their lower yield pressure, starch particles yield earlier than sodium chloride particles. The following enclosure prevents some sodium chloride particles to yield or crack. The relaxation of the tablets is higher than the relaxation calculated by linear interpolation of the relaxation behaviour of the two pure materials. The difference between the measured porosity expansion and the data obtained by linear interpolation can be considered as a measure for the reduced interparticle bonding. SEM-photographs indicate that the reduced interparticle bonding is caused by the low adhesive forces. The measured decrease of the tensile strength of the tablets is also considered {{to be the result of}} reduced interparticle bonding. In this paper it is shown that there exists a similar relationship between the tensile strength reduction and the percentage of starch on the one hand and the extra porosity expansion and the starch percentage on the other hand.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} produce new {{directly}} compressible materials {{from a local}} sago starch. The sago <b>starch</b> was <b>pregelatinised</b> at 65 °C with four different heating times followed by oven drying. The <b>pregelatinised</b> sago <b>starches</b> (PS) were evaluated as directly compressible materials including their properties at molecular, particle and powder level {{in addition to their}} functional properties in directly compressible Paracetamol tablet formulations. Analysis of FT-IR and 13 CNMR spectra revealed that pregelatinisation did not alter the chemical structure of sago starch. XR-D patterns of sago starch showed characteristics of C-type while PS exhibited A-type, as the degree of crystallinity decreased with increasing heating time. DSC curves showed pregelatinisation increased gelatinisation temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp), and degree of gelatinisation (DG), narrowed gelatinisation temperature range (Tc – To) and decreased the melting enthalpy (ΔH) of sago starch, becoming more pronounced with increased heating time. SEM observations showed more sago starch granules lost their surface smoothness and more irregular shapes appeared as the heating time increased. PS showed higher swelling power (SP) at ≤ 55 ˚C and water solubility index (WSI) at ≤ 65 ˚C than sago starch. Longer heating time produced PS with lower amylosa content, higher viscosity, SP and WSI. Powder flow evaluations and powder compacts analysis by Heckel and Kawakita equations, mechanical properties and lubricant sensitivity revealed pregelatinisation improved flowability, compressibility, compactibility and lubricant sensitivity of sago starch, with the order PS 4 >PS 3 >PS 2 >PS 1 >sago starch. PS 4 flowability, compressibility and compactibility was comparable to Spress® B 820 but showed lower lubricant sensitivity. Compared to Avicel PH 101, PS 4 flowability was superior but its compressibility, compactibility and lubricant sensitivity were inferior. Based on the findings, PS 4 was the best candidate for directly compressible excipient iv among PS. Evaluation on the loading capacities for Avicel PH 101, PS 4 and Spress® B 820 relative to poorly compressible Paracetamol reached up to 70. 16...|$|R
40|$|The site {{specific}} {{delivery of}} drugs to the colon {{can be highly}} advantageous for various applications, including: (i) the local treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, and (ii) the oral administration of protein drugs, which are to be absorbed into the blood stream. In the first case, premature drug release into the stomach is {{likely to lead to}} complete and rapid drug absorption into the systemic circulation. Thus, the risk of undesired side effects can be considerable, {{and at the same time}} the resulting drug concentrations at the site of action (in the colon) are low, leading to poor therapeutic efficacies. In the second case, fragile protein drugs need to be effectively protected against the low pH and enzymatic degradation within the upper gastro intestinal tract (GIT). Thus, in both cases, premature release into the contents of the stomach and small intestine must be avoided. In contrast, once the colon is reached, the drug should be released (in a time-controlled manner) to allow for local drug action in the case of inflammatory bowel diseases or to allow for drug absorption into the blood stream in the case of protein drugs with systemic effects. Several strategies have been reported in the literature in order to provide such site specific drug delivery to the colon. Most of them are based on the incorporation of the drug within a polymeric matrix or on the coating of a drug reservoir with a polymeric film. In both cases, the macromolecular networks should be poorly permeably for the drug in the upper GIT, but become permeable once the colon is reached. To provide this change in drug permeability, the delivery system might: (i) be sensitive to the changes in the pH along the GIT, (ii) be preferentially degraded by enzymes, which are located in the colon, or (iii) undergo significant structural changes, e. g. crack formation in poorly permeable coatings once the colon is reached. Alternatively, the dosage form might release the drug right from the beginning (in the stomach), but at a rate that is sufficiently low to allow for drug release throughout the GIT, including the colon. However, great caution must be paid, because the conditions in a patient’s colon might significantly differ from those in the physiological state. For instance, it is well known that the pH and transit times in the various GIT segments as well as the types and concentrations of enzymes in the colon of patients suffering from Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis can fundamentally vary from those in a healthy subject. Thus, a dosage form might reliably delivery the drug to the target site in a healthy subject, but fail in a patient. Furthermore, considerable inter- and intra- individual variability in the therapeutic efficacy might be observed. To avoid these major disadvantages, the drug delivery system needs to be adapted to the disease state of the patient. In this work, novel types of polymeric film coatings have been developed, which allow for colon targeting under the pathophysiological conditions in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases. These films consist of blends of different types of starch derivatives and ethylcellulose. The starch derivative is water-soluble and preferentially degraded by enzymes secreted by the microflora present in the colon of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Ethylcellulose is water-insoluble and avoids premature film dissolution in the upper GIT. Based on the water uptake and dry mass loss kinetics as well as on the changes in the mechanical properties of thin polymeric films upon exposure to release media simulating the contents of the GIT the following starch derivatives could be identified as being most promising for this type of advanced drug delivery systems: Nutriose FB 06 (a branched dextrin with non digestible glycoside linkages: α- 1, 2 and α- 1, 3), Lycoat RS 780 (a pregelatinized modified starch), Glucidex 1 (a maltodextrin), Eurylon 7 A-PG (an acetylated and <b>pregelatinised</b> high amylose <b>starch),</b> Eurylon 6 A-PG (an acetylated and <b>pregelatinised</b> high amylose <b>starch)</b> and Eurylon 6 HP-PG (a hydroxypropylated and <b>pregelatinised</b> high amylose <b>starch).</b> 	Importantly, it could further be shown how desired membrane properties (in particular the water uptake and dry mass loss kinetics as well as the mechanical stability) can effectively be adjusted to the specific needs of particular drug treatments. Different highly efficient and easy to apply tools were identified allowing to alter the membranes’ properties, especially their mechanical resistance required to withstand the shear forces resulting from the motility of the upper GIT and the hydrostatic pressure built up within the devices upon contact with aqueous media. This includes the variation of the starch derivative:ethylcellulose blend ratio and initial plasticizer content. Furthermore, 5 -Aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) -loaded beads were prepared by extrusion-spheronisation and coated with different types of Nutriose:ethylcellulose blends. In vitro drug release from these systems was measured under various conditions, including the exposure to fecal samples from inflammatory bowel disease patients under anaerobic conditions. Interestingly, the release of 5 -ASA (which is commonly used for the local treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases) could effectively be suppressed upon exposure to release media simulating the conditions in the upper GIT, irrespective of the degree of agitation and presence or absence of enzymes. In contrast, drug release started as soon as the pellets came into contact with fecal samples of inflammatory bowel disease patients and continued in a time-controlled manner. Thus, this novel type of colon targeting system is adapted to the pathophysiology of the patient. In addition, the starch derivative Nutriose also exhibits significant pre-biotic activity, normalizing the microflora in the patients’ colon, which is of major clinical benefit in the case of inflammatory bowel diseases...|$|R
40|$|Oats are a {{good source}} of protein and dietary fibre, {{especially}} ?-glucan. Due to the health benefits of ?-glucan, oats have gained popularity in snack food formulations. The literature review deals with oats and its components, removal of lipids and fractionation of oat products. The particular emphasis of the literature review was given to studies on the effects of different oat fractions and extrusion process variables on the properties of oat-containing extrudates. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out how different oat fractions and extrusion process variables (screw speed, water content and feed rate) affect the physical and chemical properties of the extrudates. The measured physical properties were expansion, hardness and water content. Extrusion trials were carried out by using defatted oat endosperm flour (EF) as the main ingredient. Whole grain oat flour (WF) was used as a reference. To improve the nutritional quality, defatted oat protein concentrate (PC) and defatted oat bran concentrate (OBC) were added to EF. The oat fractions were defatted by supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2). <b>Pregelatinised</b> corn <b>starch</b> (CS) and waxy corn starch (WS) were added in some trials to increase the expansion of the extrudates. A co-rotating twin-screw extruder was used for the extrusion. Different process variables were: water content of the mass (16, 18 and 20 %), screw speed (240, 370 and 500 rpm) and feed rate (68, 76 and 84 g/min). The temperature profile of the extruder barrel was held constant in all of the trials: 40, 70, 70, 100, 110, 130 and 130 °C (sections 1 6 and die). Screw speed had significant effect on the expansion and hardness. Expansion increased and hardness decreased with increasing screw speed. Water content of the mass affected all the response variables in WF extrudates and all but not hardness and torque in EF extrudates. Increased water content of mass decreased the expansion and hardness in WF extrudates. Feed rate did not have significant effect on the physical properties. When using EF, more expanded and less hard extrudates compared to the WF were obtained. Addition of PC or OBC (10 %) decreased the expansion and increased the hardness. Mixing of EF with corn starch (CS or WS; 30 %) gave less hard and more expanded extrudates compared to pure EF. The highest expansion was achieved by the addition of WS. Even addition of OBC (20 %) in a presence of WS (30 %) gave highly expanded and less hard extrudates with high ?-glucan content 7. 4 % (dry weight). Decreasing the particle size of OBC (by ultra-fine milling) or the molecular weight of ?-glucan (by enzymatic hydrolysis) did not affect the physical properties of the extrudates even though small decrease in hardness was observed in the trial with enzyme-hydrolysed OBC. The results showed that defatted oat fractions can successfully be used in extrusion when mixed with corn starch. Screw speed had the most profound effect on the physical properties of the oat-containing extrudates followed by the water content of mass...|$|R

The model APIs were caffeine/oxalic acid, caffeine/malonic acid cocrystals and aspirin whilst spheronised microcrystalline cellulose (s-MCC), <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> (PGS) and dicalcium phosphate dehydrate served as examples of excipients. The difference between the surface and bulk behaviour of caffeine cocrystals in response to storage in controlled humidity environments was investigated. Surface imaging illustrated an anisotropic element to the microstructure of the caffeine cocrystals, which became more pronounced at the extremities of relative humidity (RH) storage. The trends in surface reactivity which were observed for the cocrystals were found to follow those previously reported for bulk behaviour, using PXRD. Atomic force microscopy imaging, however, gave an earlier indication of incompatibility between the ecocrystals and > 75 % RH, with surface transformations occurring on a shorter timescale than indicated from the results of bulk analysis. This work represents the first reported analysis of organic molecular cocrystals by AFM. The material properties and subsurface structure of s-MCC and PGS were examined using AFM.

Excipient characteristics play key role in efficient blending process and final product quality. In this work the effect of excipient type and properties, blending technique and processing time on content uniformity was investigated. Powder characteristics for three commonly used excipients (starch, <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> and microcrystalline cellulose) were initially explored using laser diffraction particle size analyser, angle of repose for flowability, followed by thorough evaluations of surface topography employing scanning electron microscopy and interferometry. Blend homogeneity was evaluated based on content uniformity analysis of the model API, ergocalciferol, using a validated analytical technique. Flowability of powders were directly related to particle size and shape, while surface topography results revealed the relationship between surface roughness and ability of excipient with high surface roughness to lodge fine API particles within surface groves resulting in superior uniformity of content. Of the two blending techniques, geometric blending confirmed the ability to produce homogeneous blends at low dilution when processed for longer durations, whereas manual ordered blending failed to achieve compendial requirement for content uniformity despite mixing for 32 minutes. Employing the novel dry powder hybrid mixer device, developed at Aston University laboratory, results revealed {{the superiority of the}} device and enabled the production of homogenous blend irrespective of excipient type and particle size.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the matrix {{strength}} of sodium chloride particles in pure sodium chloride tablets and in tablets compressed from binary mixtures of sodium chloride with low concentrations of <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch.</b> Because this study concerns {{the strength of the}} sodium chloride matrix, the tablet strength is reflected {{as a function of the}} sodium chloride volume fraction in the tablet. Starch particles in the mixture tablets decrease the sodium chloride volume fraction-tensile strength relationship compared with that of pure sodium chloride tablets. To determine the contribution of the sodium chloride matrix to the tablet strength, the starch particles were removed from the mixture tablets by heat treatment. Determination of the strengths of these heat-treated tablets reveals that the sodium chloride matrix strength determines the tablet strength of mixture tablets containing a single matrix of sodium chloride particles. The decrease of the sodium chloride matrix density in the three different tablets (pure sodium chloride tablets, mixture tablets and heat-treated tablets) is reflected by an increase of the median pore size. The matrix in sodium chloride tablets shows a higher tensile strength to median pore size relation than the matrices in the mixture and heat-treated tablets. Based on calculations according to the theory of elastic-brittle fracture, it is suggested that the initial presence of starch particles during tablet compaction causes the pores in the matrices of the mixtures and heat-treated tablets to be relatively more flat and longer. These pores weaken the sodium chloride matrix in the mixture and heat-treated tablets to a larger extent than the shorter, more spherical pores formed during compaction of pure sodium chloride. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Background and {{the purpose}} of the study: The purpose of the present {{investigation}} was to characterize and evaluate solid dispersions (SD) of indomethacin by using a novel carrier sucrose fatty acid ester (SFE 1815) to increase its in vitro drug release and further formulating as a tablet. Methods: Indomethacin loaded SD were prepared by solvent evaporation and melt granulation technique usingSFE 1815 as carrier in 1 : 0. 25, 1 : 0. 5 1 : 0. 75 and 1 : 1 ratios of drug and carrier. Prepared SD and tablets were subjected to in vitro dissolution studies in 900 mL of pH 7. 2 phosphate buffer using apparatus I at 100 rpm. The promising SD were further formulated as tablets using suitable diluent (DCL 21, Avicel PH 102 and <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch)</b> to attain the drug release similar to that of SD [...] The obtained dissolution data was subjected to kinetic study by fitting the data into various model independent models like zero order, first order, Higuchi, Hixon-Crowell and Peppas equations. Drug and excipient compatibility studies were confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. Results: The in vitro dissolution data exhibited superior release from formulation S 6 with 1 : 0. 5 drug and carrier ratio using solvent evaporation technique than other SDs prepared at different ratio using solvent evaporation and melt granulation technique. The in vitro drug release was also superior to that of the physical mixtures prepared at same ratio and also superior to SD prepared using common carriers like polyvinyl pyrollidone and PEG 4000 by solvent evaporation technique. Tablets (T 8) prepared with DCL 21 as diluent exhibited superior release than the other tablets. The tablet formulation (T 8) followed first order release with Non-Fickian release.

40|$|Fermentation of {{resistant}} starch might prolong satiety, and, therefore, positively affect behaviour {{and welfare}} of restrictedly-fed pigs. The impact of a potentially satiating diet likely depends on housing conditions, such as the availability of rooting material which {{may serve as a}} substrate for foraging behaviour. We investigated effects of resistant starch on behaviour of growing pigs in barren housing (B) or on straw bedding (S) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Thirty-two groups of eight pigs (approximately 25 kg) were assigned to either B- or S-housing, and to native, resistant (NS) or highly digestible <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> (PS) in the diet. Pigs were fed at 2. 5 times energy requirements for maintenance in two daily meals. Behaviour was recorded in week 3 for five 1 -h periods using 2 -min instantaneous scan sampling. On day 23, six pigs per group were relocated to respiration chambers. Activity over the 24 -h cycle was scored in week 5 using 9 -min instantaneous scan sampling. S-housed pigs on the PS-diet were more active over the 24 -h cycle than S-housed pigs on the NS-diet, whereas effects of starch type on activity patterns were less obvious in B-housing (starch type × housing interaction, P = 0. 05). In the morning, when fresh straw was supplied, behaviour was strongly affected by housing, whereas effects of dietary starch were most obvious around the second, afternoon, meal. S-housed pigs were more active, showed more exploration and less oral manipulation of pen mates and fixtures than B-housed pigs. The PS-diet resulted in more aggression over the day than the NS-diet in B-housed pigs, whereas levels of aggression were similar for S-housed pigs on both diets (starch type × housing interaction, P < 0. 10). Before their second meal, NS-fed pigs showed less locomotion, aggression (P < 0. 05) and manipulation of pen mates (P < 0. 10) than PS-fed pigs, which likely reflects reduced restlessness due to enhanced inter-meal satiety in the NS-fed pigs. After the afternoon meal, NS-fed pigs showed less activity, exploration and manipulation of pen fixtures (P < 0. 05) than PS-fed pigs. In conclusion, dietary resistant starch affected behaviour patterns of restrictedly-fed growing pigs. The decreased activity and reduced preprandial restlessness suggest that fermentable starch enhances interprandial satiety in pigs, and therefore may improve their welfare. Even though effects of resistant starch on activity levels were more obvious in enriched housing, the welfare benefits of fermentable starch may be more pronounced in barren housed pigs as these animals lack an outlet for their increased foraging motivatio...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Process {{analytical}} {{technologies are}} {{systems for the}} analysis and control of manufacturing processes to assure acceptable end-product quality. This is achieved by timely measurements of critical parameters and performance attributes of raw material and in-process material and processes. The introduction of process analytical technology using near infrared analysis was investigated in three areas, namely incoming raw material analysis, blend uniformity analysis and moisture determination in the fluid bed dryer. Methodology: Incoming raw material identification - The FOSS XDS rapid content analyzer {{was used for the}} development of a NIR method for the identification and material qualification of starch maize and lactose monohydrate. Blend uniformity analysis – The SP 15 Laboratory Blender fitted with near infrared probe was utilized for the study. Two types of blend experiments were designed to monitor the distribution of magnesium stearate (lubricant) in the blend, namely, a powder blend utilizing lactose monohydrate and a granule blend utilizing Ridaq® granule. Software methods were developed to monitor the standard deviation of the absorbance at the wavelengths that were specific for lactose monohydrate, Ridaq® granule and magnesium stearate. To confirm the prediction of end-point using near infrared, results were verified using an atomic absorption method for magnesium stearate. The blends were sampled at the selected time intervals corresponding to three states of the blend, namely, before end-point, at end-point and after end-point using a sampling plan. An additional six blends were conducted for the granule blend and sampled when the standard deviation had reached a value below 3 x 10 - 6 at the magnesium stearate wavelength at four consecutive data points (standard deviation value extrapolated from blends carried out to predetermined time intervals). Moisture determination in the fluid bed dryer – Moisture values for two products (Product A and Product B) were retrospectively collected from past production batches. A process capability study was conducted on the moisture values to determine if the current process was in a state of control. Results and Discussion: Incoming raw material identification – The algorithms used for the spectral library were able to distinguish between the raw materials selected. The spectral library positively identified the starch maize and lactose monohydrate samples that were not present in the library. The negative challenge with <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> and tablettose demonstrated that the spectral library was able to differentiate between closely related compounds. Blend uniformity analysis – Blends sampled at the predetermined time intervals demonstrated a homogeneous state when the standard deviation of the absorbance was low and a non-homogeneous state when the standard deviation of the absorbance was high, thus near infrared prediction on the state of the blend was confirmed by the standard analytical methods. The series of Ridaq® granule and magnesium stearate blends sampled when the standard deviation was below 3 x 10 - 6 were homogeneous with the exception of one blend that was marginally out of specification. Blend durations were significantly lower than the standard blend durations used in the facility and ranged from 112 to 198 seconds. Moisture determination in the fluid bed dryer – From the process capability study of the two products it was noted that Product A is stable but can still be optimized while Product B is at a desirable state. The statistical evaluation of the moisture values for Product A and Product B demonstrated that the use of the product temperature to monitor the moisture gave consistent results. The current process is stable and capable of producing repeatable results although near infrared provides a means for continuously monitoring the product moisture and allows one to take action to prevent over-drying or under-drying. Conclusion: From the investigations conducted, it can be seen that there is definitely a niche for process analytical technology at this pharmaceutical company. The implementation is a gradual process of change, which may take time, probably several years (Heinze & Hansen 2005) ...|$|E
