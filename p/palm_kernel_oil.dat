25|$|Since the 1950s, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil)</b> is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.|$|E
25|$|Mayo Clinic has {{highlighted}} certain oils {{that are}} high in saturated fats, including coconut, palm oil and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil.</b> Those having lower amounts of saturated fats {{and higher levels of}} unsaturated (preferably monounsaturated) fats like olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, soy and cottonseed oils are generally healthier. The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats. One study showed that consumption of non-hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil for lowering the risk of heart disease.|$|E

2500|$|In Canada, {{palm oil}} {{is one of}} five {{vegetable}} oils, along with <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil,</b> coconut oil, peanut oil and cocoa butter, which must be specifically named in the list of ingredients for a food product. Also, oils in Canadian food products which have been modified or hydrogenated must contain the word [...] "modified" [...] or [...] "hydrogenated" [...] when listed as an ingredient. A mix of oils other than the aforementioned exceptions may simply be listed as [...] "vegetable oil" [...] in Canada; however, if the food product is a cooking oil, salad oil or table oil, the type of oil must be specified and listing [...] "vegetable oil" [...] as an ingredient is not acceptable.|$|E
2500|$|SDS is {{synthesized}} {{by treating}} lauryl alcohol with sulfur trioxide gas, oleum, or chlorosulfuric acid to produce hydrogen lauryl sulfate.

[...] When produced from these sources, commercial samples of these [...] "SDS" [...] products are actually not pure SDS, rather a mixture of various sodium alkyl sulfates with SDS being the main component. [...] For instance, SDS is a component, along with other chain-length amphiphiles, when produced from coconut oil, and is known as sodium coco sulfate (SCS). SDS is available commercially in powder, pellet, and other forms (each differing in rates of dissolution), as well as in aqueous solutions of varying concentrations.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} dye-sensitized {{photo-oxidation}} of some vegetable oils {{was carried out}} to investigate the effect of light and dye- sensitizer (Methylene blue) {{on the quality of}} some vegetable oils.

Soyabean, groundnut, <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> and <b>palm</b> <b>oils</b> were each photo-oxidized in dichloromethane/methanol solution using methylene blue as sensitizer. The reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatographic measurements (TLC), followed by peroxide value measurements.

30|$|The most {{important}} property of a lubricant is the viscosity. Loosely defined, the viscosity is the fluid’s ability to resist motion.

In an earlier work KV of 35.55 and 7.66 cSt were reported at 40 and 100  °C, respectively, for sesame oil based trimethylolpropane ester [34]. Similarly, 35.43 and 7.93 cSt KV were reported for Sesame oil TMP ester [48].

For the identity prediction of the fats/oils several (combinations of) datasets were used: absolute and relative measurements of fatty acid compositions, of triacylglycerol compositions, and of combined fatty acid and triacylglycerol compositions. Volatile organic compound compositions were used as well. Fatty acid and triacylglycerol compositions were determined by gas chromatography. Fingerprints of volatile compositions were acquired using Proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry. The rates of successful prediction were high and varied between 89 and 100 %.
