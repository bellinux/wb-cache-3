[...] On the input side, Farmland and its joint venture partners helped farmers in their production efforts by providing such items as fertilizers, insecticides and herbicides, animal feeds, and petroleum products. [...] On the output side, Farmland added value to members' food and fiber products and marketed them throughout the world. [...] A {{major part of the}} output strategy was to enhance the [...] "Farmland" [...] name and its trademarked phrase, [...] "Proud to be farmer-owned." [...] The cooperative also employed vertical integration as much as possible. [...] With petroleum products, for instance, Farmland pumped crude oil from its own wells, refined it in its own facilities, and marketed the resulting products through its Ampride service stations. [...] With hogs and beef, the cooperative was involved in the raising of the animals through feed, the slaughtering and <b>packaging</b> <b>process,</b> as well as marketing the meats under the [...] "Farmland" [...] brand.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{new method}} for the MEMS die <b>package</b> <b>process</b> was reported. Using {{the method of}} bionic package, a novel MEMS vector {{hydrophone}} was fabricated from a typical mass-beam accelerometer structure. According to the auditory principle of fish’s lateral line and its nature’s fundamental acoustic sensors-stereocilia, a rigidity cylinder was fixed {{on the center of}} the mass as a stereocilia, and the sensitivity structure of the hydrophone was obtained. By means of a specific <b>package</b> <b>process,</b> the sensor was fabricated properly for the underwater sound detection application. From the test results of the sensor, we can see that, this vector hydrophone has a receiving sensitivity of- 165 dB (0 dB= 1 V/µPa, the amplification factor of the preamplifier is 100.) and a good directional pattern in form of “ 8 ”-shape. The hydrophone can work well under the maximum pressure of 2 MPa...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of the study: Innovative {{packaging}} and new package development {{are becoming more}} and more important factors in highly competitive fast-moving consumer goods market were the number of products is high and the need for differentiation is vital in getting consumers’ attention. In order to develop successful package innovations that lead to sales increase, the success factors of new <b>package</b> development <b>process</b> need to be identified. Although the determinants of new product development process have been widely studied, academic literature lacks research in new <b>package</b> development <b>process.</b> This study aims to fill the research gap by exploring and identifying success factors of new <b>package</b> development <b>process.</b> Methodology: The data used in this study was collected via a web-based questionnaire, targeted to decision makers in supplier companies in Finnish fast-moving consumer goods sector. 92 managers and specialists participated in survey questionnaire investigating new <b>package</b> development <b>process</b> and attitudes towards packaging innovations within target companies. The data was analyzed by using correlation analysis and one-way ANOVA test to find relations between independent and dependent variables. The hypotheses were formulated based on the theoretical insights of NPD process success factors. Findings: The study succeeded in finding statistically significant correlations between success of new packages and certain factors of new <b>package</b> development <b>process.</b> More precisely, the study suggests that innovation-friendly company climate and attitude have positive influence on new package success. Furthermore, the results indicate that significant amount of internal resources allocated to new package development has a positive influence on new package success. Moreover, the study found that packaging innovations are widely reckoned as an essential factor for product success. However, it also revealed that new <b>package</b> development <b>process</b> is still significantly less developed and organized than new product development process. In addition, the measurement and goals of <b>packaging</b> innovation <b>process</b> should be better defined in Finnish fast-moving consumer goods supplier companies...|$|R
