40|$|Com o objetivo de comparar reações locais e conversão sorológica apresentadas por adultos que receberam o toxóide tetânico através de <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> (via subcutânea) ou de seringa hipodérmica (via intramuscular), o toxóide foi administrado a 472 recrutas do Exército. Em observações {{realizadas}} 4 e 24 horas após a vacinação verificou-se que as reações locais dos indivíduos vacinados com <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> eram significativamente mais freqüentes e mais intensas do que aquelas dos vacinados com seringa hipodérmica, não tendo ocorrido, entretanto, reações graves. A conversão sorológica dos não imunes vacinados com <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> ocorreu numa freqüência maior do que nos indivíduos vacinados com seringa hipodérmica. Conclui-se portanto, que o <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> pode ser utilizado em campanhas de vacinação em massa contra o tétano, embora a via de administração preferencial, até o momento, seja a intramuscular. This paper {{deals with}} the administration of tetanus toxoid to 472 army recruits, 50 % of which received the vaccine subcutaneously using a <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> pressure injector and the remaining subjects received the vaccine intramuscularly, with hypodermic syringe and needle. The objective was to draw comparative conclusions regarding local reactions and serumconvertion in those young adults. Local reactions were observed four and 24 hours after immunization. Although significantly more frequent and intense in individuals receiving the toxoid by jet injection than in those inoculated with hypodermic syringe, no serious reactions were registered. At the first observation, local reactions occured in 64 % of black men vaccinated by <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> and in only 31 % of those vaccinated by syringe; 70 % of the non-black showed local reactions when vaccinated by <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> and 21 % when vaccinated by hypodermic syringe. At the second observation, black men vaccinated by <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> showed local reactions in 78 % of the cases and in 3 % when vaccinated by syringe; 87 % of the non-black {{had some kind of}} local reaction when vaccinated by <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> and 17 % when the vaccine was administered by syringe. Systemic reactions did not differ in either group. There was no statistical difference between blacks and non-blacks regarding local reactions. Antibody response to vaccination as measured by the paper filter Whatman &# 35; 31 technique, after digital punction, occured in a higher frequency in non-immune individuals vaccinated by <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> than in those vaccinated by hypodermic syringe. While in the first ones only 6. 6 % did not show serumconvertion, 26. 9 % of those vaccinated by syringe remained susceptible. The jet injector did not have any performance problems and was well accepted by the subjects, Results led {{to the conclusion that the}} <b>Ped-o-Jet</b> can be used for mass vaccination against tetanus...|$|E
40|$|A {{field trial}} is {{reported}} in which good sero-conversion rates were obtained when {{a dose of}} 200 TCID 50 Beckenham 31 strain (Wellcovax) measles vaccine was administered by <b>Ped-O-Jet</b> subcutaneously in a volume of 0. 5 ml. per dose. It is suggested that use of this reduced dosage {{would lead to a}} significant reduction in the cost per dose of the vaccine, especially when administered on a scale large enough to justify the use of multidose containers...|$|E
40|$|In mass {{vaccination}} programmes, the jet-injection {{of vaccine}} may have considerable operational advantages over the classical techniques. The technical performance of two models of jet-injector, the Dermo-Jet and the <b>Ped-O-Jet,</b> in BCG vaccination was assessed {{in a number}} of studies which are reviewed by the authors. It is shown that the jet-injectors do not administer the full dose for which they are calibrated and that the size of the vaccination lesion varies more than after vaccination by syringe...|$|E
