The European Commission has recently presented year-to-year transition rates from fixed-term to permanent contracts (see Fig.  3).

In the following the French case of the sans-papiers strike between October 2009 and summer 2010 is empirically examined as an example of relatively successful ‘bridge-building’ between established unions and precarious wage-earners. Although this case is also committed to specific French conditions, some things can be learned from it for a more general assessment of the topic of union politics in the low-pay area.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{employment}} {{quality in the}} EU 27 is investigated {{by means of a}} typological approach, based on several features of the employment conditions and relations characterising jobs. The analyses are drawing on data from the 2005 European Working Conditions Survey. Results of Latent Class Cluster Analyses show that it is empirically and theoretically possible to reduce a multitude of factors determining the quality of employment into five different types of jobs regarding their employment quality: SER-like <b>jobs,</b> instrumental <b>jobs,</b> <b>precarious</b> unsustainable <b>jobs,</b> <b>precarious</b> intensive <b>jobs</b> and portfolio jobs. These five types of jobs are strongly related with important covariates such as the socio-demographic profile of workers, organisation level features and indicators of the intrinsic nature of work tasks. Moreover, they are clearly distributed differently between countries within the EU 27. The findings from this innovative approach towards the quality of employment are discussed in terms of the implications for the measurement of contemporary employment arrangements in Europe.

In this type of situations, the need for accessing to social protection systems deepens. In Navarre, the principal exclusion coverage system is the Renta de Inclusión Social (RIS). The RIS is a benefit of subjective right and key element for the containment of socioeconomic deterioration processes. Due to the multiple situations of long term unemployment and <b>precarious</b> <b>job</b> contracts, people without coverage present a real social need which is attended in Navarre through the RIS.

30|$|The studies {{presented}} in this paper also shed light on the role of psychological and social capitals in achieving subjective entrepreneurial outcomes. Findings of Study 2 specifically indicate that psychological capital has positive effects on entrepreneurs’ satisfaction and well-being. This result reaffirms previous research reporting psychological capital to be negatively related to stress and positively associated with the well-being of entrepreneurs (Baron et al., 2016). Entrepreneurship is a complex task that is executed in the highly competitive business environment. Moreover, small business or self-employment is sometimes considered a <b>precarious</b> <b>job</b> (Kottwitz, Hünefeld, Frank, & Otto, 2017). It would, therefore, be expected that entrepreneurs would report low satisfaction and wellbeing. On the contrary, some entrepreneurs tend to be satisfied with their entrepreneurial job and have higher wellbeing, partly attributed to high levels of psychological capital (Baron et al., 2016). The mental resources constituting psychological capital are useful in coping with business stress and work demands, maintaining vigor, finding solutions to problems, and recovering from business challenges. These may translate into high satisfaction and wellbeing. Moreover, our results also indicate that psychological capital is related to entrepreneurial performance, which further boosts the entrepreneur’s satisfaction.|$|E
40|$|Financial {{crisis and}} global imbalances: its labour market origins and the {{aftermath}} Pasquale Tridico* The {{objective of this}} paper is to articulate how the 2007 – 09 economic crisis is rooted in the uneven income distribution and inequality caused by the current finance-led model of growth. The process of financialisation that took place in the 1980 s in the USA and then in the European Union was coupled with labour flexibility, wage moderation and soaring profits. The flexibility agenda of the labour market and the end of wage increases, along with the contraction of indirect wages (i. e. public social expenditure), diminished workers ’ purchasing power. This was partly compensated with increased borrowing opportunities and the boom of credit consumption, all of which helped workers to maintain unstable consumption capacity. However, in the long term, unstable consumption patterns derived from <b>precarious</b> <b>job</b> creation, job instability and poor wages have weakened aggregate demand. Hence, labour market issues such as flexibility, uneven income distribution, poor wages and the financial crisis are two sides of the same coin. Both have a direct impact on the economic crisis and the current global imbalances...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades most industrialised {{countries}} have experienced a massive educational expansion. Corresponding to this development {{there has been an}} increase of female employment which is, however, to a large extent part-time. At the same time, the attempts of firms to achieve more employment flexibility - facilitated by government intervention to deregulate the labor market - has contributed to the growth of <b>precarious</b> <b>jobs,</b> such as, fixed-term, (certain types of) part-time jobs and self-employment. This has been true in particular for the United Kingdom. In this paper we examine the relationships between the growth of precarious employment, the general educational expansion and gender in Germany and the United Kingdom. Our first question is to what extent education shields from insecure employment. The empirical analysis focuses on effects of both general and vocational education and compares these effects between countries. Based on national differences in the educational systems, we expect a relatively smaller influence of education on the likelihood of precarious employment in the UK where the educational system is less restrictive - that is, less rigidly stratified - than in Germany. Second, we try to better understand the link between gender and precarious employment by looking at its embeddedness within the national institutional arrangements. We expect that the economic interests of firms to create <b>precarious</b> <b>jobs</b> are more or less closely linked to the national gender regimes. Given the stronger emphasis on the male-breadwinner model we expect that the female bias in precarious employment is relatively stronger in Germany than in the United Kingdom.

Focusing on interview data on the work experiences of young adults (18 - 26 years old), in urban centres of Greece, this study attempts to explore {{the ways in which}} informants account for working in precarious conditions and construct agency and subjectivity within these ways of accounting. The analysis drawing on insights from critical discursive social psychology indicates that participants construct precarious work conditions as widespread and banal a) by treating precarious work as a sine qua non condition of youth employment, b) by considering precarious work as an inherent trait of the Greek job-market, c) by considering precarious work as a necessary step on a (biographical) path leading to the desired and/or appropriate job, or d) by adopting a “there is no other alternative” accounting, representing <b>precarious</b> <b>job</b> conditions as the only alternative to unemployment. The analysis also points out the ways in which participants orient themselves to a dilemma of stake and accountability, being concerned to position themselves as effortful subjects, while they are rhetorically constructing the banal regime of precarious labour.

40|$|The paper {{concentrates}} {{on the problem of}} age discrimination in the labour market and the way it can be conceptualised and measured in a multi-disciplinary way. The approach proposed here combines two understandings of age discrimination - a sociological and legal one, what allows for a fuller and expanded understanding of ageism in the workplace. At the heart of the study is a survey carried out in Poland with a sample of 1000 men and women aged 45 – 65 years. The study takes a deeper and innovative look into the issue of age discrimination in employment. Confirmatory factor analysis with WLSMV estimation and logistic regressions were used to test the hypotheses. The study shows that age discrimination in labour market can take on different forms: hard and soft, where the hard type of age discrimination mirrors the legally prohibited types of behaviours and those which relate to the actual decisions of employers which can impact on the employee’s career development. The soft discrimination corresponds with those occurrences, which are not inscribed in the legal system per se, are occurring predominantly in the interpersonal sphere, but can nevertheless have negative consequences. Soft discrimination was experienced more often (28. 6 % of respondents) than hard discrimination (15. 7 %) with higher occurrences among women, persons in <b>precarious</b> <b>job</b> situation or residents of urban areas.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Time {{and future}} {{perspectives}} {{are at the}} core of biographical studies on youth transition to adulthood. Lifetime, interpreted in terms of age, assumes a twofold interpretation. Years of age are an objective concept but the definition of age groups to study youth is a social construction. Object: We focus on timing of leaving parental home in Italy and France. The transition of leaving parental home is a complex process calling for both a quantitative description and a qualitative explanation. The subjective dimension is intrinsically associated with lifetime perception and definition of future choices. Method: The research problem calls for an explanatory mixed-method design. The quantitative analyse is carried out employing EU SILC cross-sectional analyses (2005 and 2011 panel) to identify which predictors affect the time of leaving home according to levels of education, social origin and gender. Subsequently, semi-structured interviews of Italian and French people aged 20 - 35 will help identify mechanisms and individual strategies in leaving the parental home. Results: Main results show how French young people feels to be late in achieving residential autonomy compared to previous generation. Social and familial norms are pushing factors to move out earlier, despite <b>precarious</b> <b>job</b> conditions and readiness. Italian young people use longer time at parent’s home as strategic choice, especially for highly educated young men. In both countries, young people around thirty perceive to be “out of time” as if a mismatch occurs at a global level between what young-adult people are and what they should achieve. Conclusion: The comparative mixed-method analysis puts light both on cross-national difference in achieving residential autonomy and on how young people perceive the mark of adulthood as age based structure. Emergence of a young-adult category as an intermediate category will have a reflection in both the statistic-demographic domain and the socio-psychological one...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} decent work was {{developed}} by the International Labour Organization twenty years ago. The notion is now well known by lawyers, economists, and sociologists, and even if it appears difficult to define it clearly, it constitutes a useful general framework with which to think of the relationships between policy practices, work market globalization, and human rights principles. The fields of career guidance and counseling psychology are highly concerned by questions of social justice and human rights that people experience through work. Career choices being made in a liquid and unstable society, incompatibility between individualist values and collective work issues, increasing psychological health problems at work, work-family balance in <b>precarious</b> <b>job</b> situations, the growing necessity of mobility, adaptability or flexibility… all of these questions {{are at the heart of}} current career counseling practices, and concern the decent work debate. Nevertheless, the notion of decent work is not well developed in the field of vocational psychology. Despite its relevance, it is difficult to operationalize the policy and human rights principles during career counseling sessions. The article aims to explore the usefulness of the concept for career counselors, and to propose a psychosocial framework that incorporates decent work in career counseling practices. The first part of this article presents the theoretical bases of the notion of decent work and their possible use in the field of psychology. It deals with the necessity of a multilevel and psychosocial perspective, that takes into account both objective and subjective dimensions of decent work. The second part focuses on a case study illustrating how the notion of decent work emerges during counseling sessions. Four levels of the work experience linked with subjective and objective dimensions of decent work are explored; the personal level, the activity level, the collective level, and the social level. Finally, the third part discusses and proposes a framework based on the analysis of the four dimensions of work (activity, trade, others and society) in order to integrate a psychosocial view of decent work into career counseling...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze changes in the development of women’s role as labor force over a 40 -year period. This is done by presenting research results that concern the restructuring of the labor market over different time periods. The empirical material is from the 1960 s, the heyday of the Swedish model; from the 1980 s, the period that economic historians label the third industrial revolution; and from the 1990 s, a period labeled the new working life that is covering the reorganization of the public sector. For the first period results from restructuring in the shipyard industry are presented as well as employment outcomes for single individuals. This industry was male dominated with very few women employed, but regional policy measures were implemented to reach a latent female labor force. The second period is covered by a study of closures and cutbacks in different industries in Sweden during 1982 – 1983. The proportion of women employed in the industries studied was around one third and employment outcomes had a specific gendered pattern. Women did to a lower extent than men get new permanent jobs. Permanent temporariness was introduced as a concept to describe their labor market situation. The recession that one decade later hit both female- and male-dominated sectors is illustrated by a study of the relations between labor market attachment, working life, and family conditions. The material comes from a regional research program based on a questionnaire and on register data on incomes from 1990 to 1999. The paper analyzes several areas related to work and outside of work that indicate a gendered pattern of multidimensional subordination and an increased polarization in terms of both gender and class. In conclusion, the 40 years has been a period of dramatic change in women’s situation as labor force. In times of restructuring they often entered into <b>precarious</b> <b>job</b> situations or unemployment. Women’s double burden proved remarkably resilient when explaining gender differences in employment and working conditions...|$|E
