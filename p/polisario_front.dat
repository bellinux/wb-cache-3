The city has had massive and uncontrained growth, driven by the North African drought, {{since the beginning of the}} 1970s; hundreds of thousands moved there in search of a better life. The official censuses showed 134,000 residents in 1977 and 393,325 in 1988, although both figures were probably smaller than reality. The population is now estimated to consist of at least one third of the country's population of 3.2 million and the 2013 census showed a population of 958,399.|$|E

50|$|Mustafa Ould Salek was {{appointed}} army commander by longtime President Mokhtar Ould Daddah in February 1978, {{as the country}} faced dire economic crisis and was failing to contain the <b>Polisario</b> <b>Front's</b> Sahrawi guerrillas after invading Western Sahara in 1975 in alliance with Morocco. On July 10, 1978, Ould Salek led a military coup d'état against President Daddah, and {{was appointed}} head of the 20-man junta (the Military Committee for National Recovery, CMRN) that was to rule the country.

Morocco's ally, Zaire, similarly opposed the OAU's admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, and the Mobutu regime boycotted the organisation from 1984 to 1986.

Council of 10 December 2015. With its judgment the EU General Court had annulled the Council Decision 2012 / 497 /EU on the conclusion of the Agreement {{in the form of an}} Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco concerning reciprocal liberalization measures on agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products, in so far as it had approved the application of the Agreement to Western Sahara, a «disputed territory» partially controlled by the <b>Front</b> <b>Polisario,</b> a national liberation movement involved in a long armed conflict with the Kingdom of Morocco. The ECJ stated that the Agreement did not apply to Western Sahara and therefore <b>Front</b> <b>Polisario</b> is not concerned by the decision of the Council and so it lacked standing in the European Courts. This paper aims to analyze the issues, mutually linked, involved in the <b>Front</b> <b>Polisario</b> case, with a special attention for the relationship between the principle of self-determination of peoples and the rules on the validity of the treaties, not forgetting the necessity to protect the fundamental rights of the Western Sahara population...|$|R

50|$|Colonized by Spain from 1884 to 1975, as Spanish Sahara, {{and after}} the {{tripartite}} agreement, known as the Madrid Accords, the territory was partitioned between Morocco and Mauritania in 1976, with Morocco acquiring northern two-thirds. Mauritania, under pressure from Polisario guerrillas, abandoned all claims to its portion in August 1979, with Morocco moving {{to take control of}} that sector shortly thereafter and has since asserted administrative control over the majority of the territory. The <b>Polisario</b> <b>front's</b> SADR claims to administer a portion to the east of the Moroccan Wall. The Polisario's government-in-exile was seated as member of the Organisation of African Unity in 1984, and was {{a founding member of the}} African Union. Guerrilla activities continued until a United Nations-monitored cease-fire was implemented September 6, 1991 via the mission MINURSO.

5000|$|The {{nation of}} the former colony of Western Sahara {{territory}} has caused a deep-seated antagonism and general mistrust {{between the two nations}} that has permeated all aspects of Moroccan-Algerian relations. After Spain announced its intention to abandon the territory in 1975, relations between Morocco and Algeria, who had previously presented a united front, disintegrated. [...] Algeria, although not asserting any territorial claims of its own, was averse to the absorption of the territory by any of its neighbors and supported the <b>Polisario</b> <b>Front's</b> wish to found an independent nation in the territory. Before the Spanish evacuation, the Spanish government had agreed to divide the territory, transferring the majority of the land to Morocco and the remainder to Mauritania. This agreement violated a United Nations (UN) resolution that declared all historical claims by Mauritania or Morocco to be insufficient to justify territorial absorption and drew heavy criticism from Algeria.|$|R
40|$|The EU’s {{international}} agreements with Morocco on trade in agricultural and fishery products have drawn criticism {{due to their}} application to the disputed territory of Western Sahara, a territory that remains {{on the list of}} non-self-governing territories to be decolonised in accordance with the right of self-determination of the indigenous Sahrawi people. Recently, the Sahrawi liberation movement <b>Front</b> <b>Polisario</b> brought an action for annulment before the General Court of the European Union (GC) against the Council Decision approving the conclusion of one such agreement, alleging multiple violations of European and international legal norms. Interestingly, although the GC concurred by annulling the Decision insofar as it applies to Western Sahara, it chose to exclusively base its judgment on EU fundamental rights, invoking the EU’s failure to ensure that the fundamental rights of the Sahrawi people were not infringed by applying the agreements to Western Sahara. By summarily setting aside <b>Front</b> <b>Polisario’s</b> other claims, several relevant questions of applicable international and European law, which warrant further discussion, remain. This article examines these questions using the GC’s judgment in <b>Front</b> <b>Polisario,</b> thereby combining general matters of international and European law with the specific circumstances of the EU-Morocco relations and Western Sahara...|$|R
50|$|After the {{crushing}} of the Harakat Tahrir, Sahrawi nationalists abandoned {{the hope of}} a peaceful end to colonial rule. In May 1973 the militant <b>Front</b> <b>Polisario</b> formed under the leadership of El-Ouali, calling for armed revolution against Spanish rule. The Polisario, which is still active, would later turn its guns on the Moroccan and Mauritanian forces which invaded Western Sahara upon Spain's departure in 1975.|$|R
25|$|The fortifications were {{progressively}} {{built by}} Moroccan forces starting in 1981, and formally ending on 16 April 1987. Their main {{function is to}} exclude guerrilla fighters of the <b>Polisario</b> <b>Front,</b> who have sought Western Saharan independence since before Spain ended its colonial occupation in 1975, from the Moroccan-controlled part of the territory.|$|E
25|$|Today 45 {{countries}} around the world recognize the legitimacy of the Polisario over Western Sahara. Support for the <b>Polisario</b> <b>Front</b> came mostly from newly independent African states, such as Angola and Namibia. Most of the Arab world had supported Morocco; only Algeria and Libya have, at different times, given any significant support to Polisario. Iran recognized the SADR in 1980, Mauritania had recognized the SADR in 1984, and Syria and South Yemen had supported the Polisario position on the conflict when they were all members of the Front of Refusal. Additionally, many third world non-aligned countries have supported the <b>Polisario</b> <b>Front.</b> Ties with Fretilin of East Timor (occupied by Indonesia in 1975) were exceptionally strong and remain so after that country's independence; both Polisario and Fretilin have argued that there are numerous historical parallels between the two conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Between 1979 and 1981, the Royal Moroccan Air Force {{received}} 24 Alpha Jets {{which were}} organized into a training squadron and a COIN squadron both based in Meknes.

50|$|There {{was some}} {{criticism}} against Abdelaziz {{from within the}} Polisario for preventing reforms inside the movement, and for insisting on a diplomatic course which had gained few concessions from Morocco, rather than re-launching the armed struggle favored by many within the movement. The only supposedly opposition group is the <b>Front</b> <b>Polisario</b> Khat al-Shahid, which states that it wants to continue with militant attacks. Abdelaziz specifically denied {{the existence of such}} a group; he maintained that only the Polisario exists in the camps.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, an anti-ceasefire and anti-Abdelaziz {{opposition}} fraction, the <b>Front</b> <b>Polisario</b> Khat al-Shahid {{announced its}} existence, {{in the first}} break with the principle of [...] "national unity" [...] (i.e., working in one single organization to prevent internal conflict). It calls for reforms in the movement, as well as resumption of hostilities with Morocco. But it remains of little importance to the conflict, as the group had split in two factions, and Polisario has refused dialogs with it, stating that political decisions must be taken within the established political system.|$|R
5000|$|The scene breaks {{here and}} the film, Stolen, has changed. Before this moment, as Ayala has narrated, the {{documentary}} was to film a UN-sponsored family reunion program between refugees and their families. Fetim {{had come to a}} refugee camp in the Algerian desert as a child some 30 years ago, leaving behind her mother Embarka and her siblings. With some 27,000 on the waiting list, the fact that Fetim and Embarka have been selected seems miraculous. And yet: this story is now reframed, as Ayala and Fallshaw learn that their subjects are not only refugees, but also slaves. The filmmakers can’t begin to imagine the complications that follow this discovery. Their questions elicit astonishing and also cryptic stories, as Fetim and Leil, as well as Fetim’s cousin Matala, sort through what is safe to tell “the foreigners.” [...] As the film reports, the <b>Polisario</b> Liberation <b>Front,</b> a nationalist organization backed by Algeria, has been fighting with Morocco over Western Sahara for the last 34 years. Neither the Moroccan government nor the Polisario want stories about slavery documented. And yet, with at least 2 million black people living in slavery in North Africa, STOLEN insists, telling such stories is only a first step to bringing out slavery’s end.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Polisario</b> <b>Front</b> {{was formed}} by Saharwi people in 1973. The group started {{fighting}} for the independence of Western Sahara. The group has been backed by Algeria. Polisario's fight for independence caused Mauritania to relinquish its claim on Western Sahara in 1978. In August 1979, Mauritania signed a peace agreement with Polisario and when Mauritania withdrew, Morocco took up occupation of that land as well.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{several members}} of the Polisario have decided to {{discontinue}} their military or political activities for the <b>Polisario</b> <b>Front.</b> Most of them returned from the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria to Morocco, among them a few founder members and senior officials. Some of them are now actively promoting Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, which Morocco considers its Southern Provinces.|$|E
25|$|After 1975, he {{commanded}} {{forces in the}} north of Mauritania and Tiris al-Gharbiya (Western Sahara), in the war against <b>Polisario</b> <b>Front</b> guerrillas, notably in the Zouerate region and Bir Moghrein. In 1978, with the country in severe disorder, he participated in a coup d'état that overthrew Mauritanian President Mokhtar Ould Daddah. As a member of the CRMN military junta, he was promoted to the post of Chief of the General Staff.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{international}} law situation of Western Sahara. It analyses {{the historical development of}} Western Sahara, in particular its decolonization, and by means of the analysis of the proposed solutions it tries to reach the actual status of the area and outlines some possibilities of the future development. The right of self-determination of Saharawi people is the key issue and appears in many resolutions of the United Nations dealing with Western Sahara. This territory is the topic of long-lasting disputes between Morocco and the <b>Front</b> <b>Polisario.</b> Attempts to solve the problem have lasted for many years but there has been almost no advance because of the different attitudes of the parties. Not only neighbouring countries but also other states with the special interests in the region interfere in the negotiations. Since 1991, when the ceasefire came into effect after many years of the military conflict, the proposals of solution have been refused...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{literature}} on peace and state-building highlights {{the need for}} women’s participation in post-conflict reconstruction to move from war and displacement, towards stability and future independence. This thesis analyses this ‘gender mainstreaming’ approach to statebuilding using {{the example of the}} Saharawi Popular Liberation <b>Front</b> (<b>Polisario)</b> and its long term struggle for independence, focussing specifically on gender representation in Polisario representatives abroad. Both the National Union of Saharawi Women and the Polisario liberation movement have been praised by academics and institutions alike for their achievements in gender mainstreaming. Despite living as refugees in Algeria, Saharawi women have led the camps’ administration for more than thirty years, and today constitute more than 35 % of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic’s parliament. I argue that while women’s participation in refugee camp administration has always been a feature, a substantial female representation in high-level political office and in the state-in-waiting’s foreign relations is relatively new to the Polisario. Gender mainstreaming can thus be tested against the historical practice of the Polisario and the broader campaign to win international acceptance and support for independence for Western Sahara. In a situation of political stalemate, where UN sponsored diplomatic discussions between the Polisario and Morocco on a peaceful solution for Western Sahara have been so-far inconclusive, the job done by Saharawi representatives abroad in lobbying host countries to their cause is invaluable. Yet exactly how has the presence of women as foreign representatives assisted the political cause of Western Sahara? This study draws on the work of Third World and Islamic feminist theorists in order to interpret gender relations in state-building with the Muslim Saharawi refugees, arguing that Saharawi were implementing gender mainstreaming approaches to social, political and administrative life in exile long before the international community began to promote a discourse of gender and statebuilding. A critical ethnographic approach is used in a bid to understand the interplay between gender and power, and analyse the relationship between Saharawi political representatives abroad and their supporters...|$|R
25|$|On 3 November 2005, the <b>Polisario</b> <b>Front</b> {{signed the}} Geneva Call, {{committing}} {{itself to a}} total ban on landmines, and later began to destroy its landmine stockpiles under international supervision.
