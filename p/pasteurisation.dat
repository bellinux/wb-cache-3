5|$|While Playford {{was known}} for his use of price {{controls}} to restrain the price of living and therefore attract blue-collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia was slow to introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory <b>pasteurisation</b> and other quality standards on milk to avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen do-it-yourself handyman.|$|E
5|$|From 1979, keg Stones {{began to}} be {{promoted}} heavily nationwide, and the beer {{was introduced to the}} South of England for the first time. The beer was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally the beer would be produced at the Cannon Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for <b>pasteurisation</b> and kegging, but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too great for the Cannon alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s, it was produced at Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this was quickly halted after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured beer. The Runcorn beer had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in the beer.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{pre-treatment}} {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the necessary retention time to produce biogas. For example, certain processes shred the substrates to increase the surface area or use a thermal pretreatment stage (such as <b>pasteurisation)</b> to significantly enhance the biogas output. The <b>pasteurisation</b> process {{can also be used to}} reduce the pathogenic concentration in the digesate leaving the anaerobic digester. <b>Pasteurisation</b> may be achieved by heat treatment combined with maceration of the solids.|$|E

25|$|Since the Industrial Revolution {{some two}} hundred years ago, the food {{processing}} industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include <b>pasteurisation,</b> autoclavation, drying, salting, and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food. <b>Pasteurisation</b> and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies have downfalls as well.|$|E
25|$|Throughout its history, a {{sizeable}} number of ENS alumni, {{some of them}} known as normaliens, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise, ranging from Louis Pasteur, the chemist and microbiologist famed for inventing <b>pasteurisation,</b> to philologist Georges Dumézil, novelist Julien Gracq and socialist Prime Minister Léon Blum.|$|E
25|$|After obtaining {{an alcohol}} content {{of at least}} 12 percent by volume, the mead {{undergoes}} racking prior to ageing. Leaving the pitched wort on the lees beyond the still fermentation period would adversely affect the mead's organoleptic properties because of yeast autolysis. Ageing (maturing) and siphoning (decantation) is repeated as necessary to prevent unwanted processes from {{taking place in the}} lees. During ageing, it is possible to carry out <b>pasteurisation</b> and filtration. This stage is essential for ensuring that the product has the right organoleptic properties.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{can catch}} bTB, but public health control measures, {{including}} milk <b>pasteurisation</b> and the BCG vaccine, {{mean it is}} not a significant risk to human health. The disease affects cattle and other farm animals (including pigs, goats, deer, sheep, alpacas and llamas), and some species of wildlife including badgers, deer and a few domestic pets. Geographically, bTB has spread from isolated pockets in the late 1980s to cover large areas of the west and south-west of England and Wales in the 2010s. Some people believe this correlates with the lack of badger control.|$|E
25|$|A {{dramatic}} {{example of}} the effect of food processing on a population's health is the history of epidemics of beri-beri in people subsisting on polished rice. Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin thiamine, causing beri-beri. Another example is the development of scurvy among infants in the late 19th century in the United States. It turned out {{that the vast majority of}} sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat-treated (as suggested by Pasteur) to control bacterial disease. <b>Pasteurisation</b> was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.|$|E
25|$|Mothers express {{milk for}} {{multiple}} reasons. Expressing breast milk can maintain a mother's milk supply {{when she and}} her child are apart. A sick baby who is unable to nurse can take expressed milk through a nasogastric tube. Some babies are unable or unwilling to nurse. Expressed milk is the feeding method of choice for premature babies. Viral disease transmission can be prevented by expressing breast milk and subjecting it to Holder <b>pasteurisation.</b> Some women donate expressed breast milk (EBM) to others, either directly or through a milk bank. This allows mothers who cannot breastfeed to give their baby the benefits of breast milk.|$|E
25|$|Fresh and {{stabilized}} pastas (paste alimentari fresche e stabilizzate): Includes {{fresh and}} stabilized pastas, {{which may be}} made with soft-wheat flour without restriction on the amount. Prepackaged fresh pasta must have a water content not less than 24%, must be stored refrigerated at a temperature of not more than 4°C (with a 2°C tolerance), must have undergone a heat treatment at least equivalent to <b>pasteurisation,</b> and must be sold within 5 days of the date of manufacture. Stabilized pasta has a lower allowed water content of 20%, and is manufactured using a process and heat treatment that allows it to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Under typical circumstances, hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and {{acidogenesis}} {{occur within}} the first reaction vessel. The organic material is then heated to the required operational temperature (either mesophilic or thermophilic) prior to being pumped into a methanogenic reactor. The initial hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks prior to the methanogenic reactor can provide a buffer to {{the rate at which}} feedstock is added. Some European countries require a degree of elevated heat treatment to kill harmful bacteria in the input waste. In this instance, there may be a <b>pasteurisation</b> or sterilisation stage prior to digestion or between the two digestion tanks. Notably, {{it is not possible to}} completely isolate the different reaction phases, and often some biogas is produced in the hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks.|$|E
25|$|Terracotta {{feeding bottles}} {{surviving}} {{from the third}} millennium BC in Sumeria indicate that children who were not being breastfed were receiving animal milk, probably from cows. It {{is possible that some}} infants directly suckled lactating animals, which served as alternatives to wet nurses. Unless another lactating woman was available, a mother who lacked enough breast milk was likely to lose her child. To avert that possibility if a wet nurse was not available, an animal such as a donkey, cow, goat, sheep or dog could be employed. Suckling directly was preferable to milking an animal and giving the milk, as contamination by microbes during the milking process could lead to the infant contracting a deadly diarrheal disease. It was not until as late as the 1870s that stored animal milk became safe to drink due to the invention of <b>pasteurisation</b> and sterilisation.|$|E
25|$|However, chromatographic {{methods for}} {{separation}} started being {{adopted in the}} early 1980s. Developments were ongoing in the time period between when Cohn fractionation started being used, in 1946, and when chromatography started being used, in 1983. In 1962, the Kistler & Nistchmann process was created which was a spin-off of the Cohn process. Chromatographic processes {{began to take shape}} in 1983. In the 1990s, the Zenalb and the CSL Albumex processes were created which incorporated chromatography with a few variations. The general approach to using chromatography for plasma fractionation for albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to viral inactivation procedures, including <b>pasteurisation</b> at 60°C. This is a more efficient alternative than the Cohn process for four main reasons: 1) smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed, 2) easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good manufacturing environment, 3) chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein, and 4) a more successful albumin end result can be achieved. Compared with the Cohn process, the albumin purity went up from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%. Small percentage increases make a difference in regard to sensitive measurements like purity. There is one big drawback in using chromatography, which {{has to do with the}} economics of the process. Although the method was efficient from the processing aspect, acquiring the necessary equipment is a big task. Large machinery is necessary, and for a long time the lack of equipment availability was not conducive to its widespread use. The components are more readily available now but it is still a work in progress.|$|E
500|$|Today, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} modern methods for making clotted cream. The [...] "float cream method" [...] includes scalding a floating layer of double cream in milk (skimmed or whole) in shallow trays. To scald, the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for {{up to an hour}} it is slowly cooled for 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged. The [...] "scald cream method" [...] is similar, but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used. This cream is then heated in a similar manner, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged. In the United Kingdom the resultant cream is deemed to be equivalent to pasteurised for legal purposes. Unlike <b>pasteurisation,</b> however, there is no requirement for the temperatures to be recorded on thermograph charts. As the temperatures are lower than used in standard <b>pasteurisation,</b> much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene.|$|E
500|$|Glastonbury {{has been}} the birthplace or home to many notable people. Peter King, 1st Baron King was the {{recorder}} of Glastonbury in 1705. Thomas Bramwell Welch the discoverer of the <b>pasteurisation</b> process to prevent the fermentation of grape juice was born in Glastonbury in 1825. [...] The judge John Creighton represented Lunenburg County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1770 to 1775. The fossil collector Thomas Hawkins lived in the town during the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Humans {{can become}} {{infected}} by the Mycobacterium bovis bacterium, which causes the disease [...] "bovine TB" [...] (bTB). Between 1994 and 2011 there were 570 human cases of bovine TB in humans. Most {{of these cases}} {{are thought to be}} in people aged 45 or over, who could have been infected before milk <b>pasteurisation</b> became common in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|The risk {{of humans}} {{contracting}} bTB from milk is extremely low if certain precautions are taken, and scientists {{have argued that}} badger culling is unnecessary. [...] The low risk is accepted by Defra who wrote in a report published in 2011: [...] "The risk to public health is very low these days, largely thanks to milk <b>pasteurisation</b> and the TB surveillance and control programme in cattle".|$|E
2500|$|One {{route of}} {{transmission}} to humans is drinking infected, non-pasteurised milk (<b>pasteurisation</b> kills the bacterium). [...] European badgers can become infected with bTB and transmit {{the disease to}} cattle, thereby posing a risk to the human food chain. [...] Culling is a method used {{in parts of the}} UK {{to reduce the number of}} badgers and thereby reduce the incidence and spread of bTB that might infect humans.|$|E
2500|$|By 1895 the {{institute}} was outgrowing its Turbot Street premises; work had expanded beyond pleuropneumonia to tuberculosis, redwater, tetanus, and as time permitted, leprosy. The laboratory featured bacteria culturing apparatus, and histopathology preparation using paraffin. The institute's [...] "museum" [...] included specimens that showed advanced bovine tuberculosis (communicable to humans and a risk before milk <b>pasteurisation),</b> collected from apparently healthy cattle which supported Pound in urging {{for the establishment}} of public abattoirs and inspection of carcasses.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his early}} career he was manager {{in some small}} creameries, one in County Tipperary, and others in [...] Black Abbey, Adare, County Limerick; in Dicksgrove, Farranfore, and [...] BallymcElligott, and Ballydwyer in County Kerry. He was {{influenced}} by the cooperative movement being driven by Sir Horace Plunkett, well described in the account of country life of the times by Elizabeth, Countess of Fingall, Seventy Years Young. [...] Sir Horace Plunkett, MP, and later Senator of the Irish Free State, third son of Lord Dunsany, was father of the Irish agricultural co-operative movement, and founded the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society (now the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society), which included several hundred creameries. Accordingly, Denis O'Donnell actively organised farmers in the early cooperative movement in County Kerry, and founded the Lee Strand Co-operative Creamery on April 20, 1920 in Church Street, Tralee, still a going concern in 2009 although it relocated to Ballymullen in 1992. He owned a pub at #2 Edward Street, Tralee, run by his sister Bride, until her emigration to Kimberly, South Africa. The pub was sold in 1938. He also owned shops in Rock Street and Castle Street in Tralee. He was the first to introduce the <b>pasteurisation</b> of milk, much against the prejudice of dairy farmers at the time, and also was the first to market ice-cream in Tralee.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{retiring}} from the navy in 1910, Wilson, in partnership with Maj. Frank Joyce, established a property of [...] at Ulu, Kenya (near Machakos), where they initially farmed ostriches. On {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, he established a unit of volunteers, Wilson's Scouts, which was incorporated into the East African Mounted Rifles and saw service in the East African Campaign. Wilson was later attached to a South African division, where he oversaw military transport along the Rufiji River, in present-day Tanzania. He was awarded the DSO for his service during the war, with his partner, Joyce, receiving the MC. When the pair returned to their property, Kilima Kiu, many of their ostriches had been killed, and they turned to dairy farming. Kilima Kiu was at one stage the [...] "largest dairy farm in all East Africa", but Wilson and Joyce divided it between themselves in 1934, after a quarrel. In later years, Wilson's farm held 2,500 cattle and employed over 400 staff, managed largely by his two sons. He also bred Arabian horses. Under a policy of self-containment, the property had its own factory, <b>pasteurisation</b> facilities, cannery, school, and airstrip. Wilson was also involved in public life in Kenya, briefly representing Ukamba in the Legislative Council of Kenya, and later chairing the Board of Agriculture, for which he was made a CMG in 1935 and knighted in 1949. He remained a keen cricketer, and was a pioneer of the sport in Kenya, serving as vice-president of the Kenya Kongonis Cricket Club. Wilson had married Elizabeth Frances Pease, a daughter of Sir Arthur Pease, 1st Baronet, in 1919, with whom he had four children. He died at Kilima Kiu in 1964. He and Frank Joyce both feature in the memoirs of Elspeth Huxley.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned seed pretreatments, seed germination is also assisted when disease-free soil is used. Especially when trying to germinate difficult seed (e.g. certain tropical fruit), prior treatment of the soil (along with the usage of the most suitable soil; e.g. potting soil, prepared soil or other substrates) is vital. The two most used soil treatments are <b>pasteurisation</b> and sterilisation. Depending on the necessity, <b>pasteurisation</b> is to be preferred as this does not kill all organisms. Sterilisation can be done when trying to grow truly difficult crops. To pasteurise the soil, the soil is heated for 15 minutes in an oven of 120 °C.|$|E
