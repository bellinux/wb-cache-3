25|$|In May 2011, {{the debate}} over Nestlé's {{unethical}} marketing of infant formula was relaunched in the Asia-Pacific region. Nineteen leading Laos-based international NGOs, including Save the Children, Oxfam, CARE International, Plan International, and World Vision have launched a boycott of Nestlé and written {{an open letter to}} the company. Among other unethical practices, the NGOs criticised the lack of labelling in Laos and the provision of incentives to doctors and nurses to promote the use of infant formula. In November 2011, Bureau Veritas was commissioned by Nestlé S.A. to provide independent assurance of Nestlé Indochina’s compliance with the Nestlé policy for the implementation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes (1981). There was no significant evidence that indicated Nestlé Indochina was systematically operating in violation of the WHO Code and Lao PDR Decree in Lao PDR. The presence of promotional materials in retail units constituted a non-conformance, and Bureau Veritas recommended that the Nestlé’s Policy and <b>Procedures</b> <b>Manual</b> on the Marketing of breastmilk substitutes be reviewed and updated to ensure consistency against the more stringent requirements of the Lao PDR Decree. Ernest W. Lefever and the Ethics and Public Policy Center were criticized for accepting a $25,000 contribution from Nestlé while the organization {{was in the process of}} developing a report investigating medical care in developing nations which was never published. It was alleged that this contribution affected the release of the report and led to the author of the report submitting an article to Fortune Magazine praising the company's position.|$|E
500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigated}} the accident. [...] Although {{the tail of}} the Delta DC-9 was several feet from the runway, the NTSB determined that DAL 379's engines were still operating at idle when Flight 159 attempted to take off, and DAL 379's idling jet engines were directing hot jet exhaust over the runway. The NTSB determined that neither Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations nor the Terminal Air Traffic Control <b>Procedures</b> <b>Manual</b> defined the phrase [...] "clear of the runway," [...] and found that the pilots of each plane and the air traffic controller each had their own slightly different definition of the term. The NTSB concluded that DAL 379 was not actually [...] "clear of the runway" [...] because its jet exhaust continued to pose a hazard to aircraft attempting to use runway 27L.|$|E
