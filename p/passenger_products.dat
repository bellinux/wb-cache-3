40|$|Abstract. The basic {{framework}} of passenger train line plan {{is determined by}} its parameters. Considering the association between passenger train line plan and the travel choice behavior of passengers, the paper introduces the distributed artificial intelligence to study decision-making process of passenger train line plan and builds up the multi-agents based model of matching between transport demand and transport resource. Based on this, the paper puts forward a method that realizes the parameter optimization for passenger train line plan by using the multi-agents model. This method not only improves the quality of railway <b>passenger</b> <b>product,</b> but also increases the comprehensive benefit of transportation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIATA is {{promoting}} Simplifying the Business. The traditional passenger services and business process, such as ticketing, airport counters, {{had a great}} influence. The airlines have the passenger service and convenience as the next product development requirements. With civil aviation industry and their company's products construction, the authors propose a solution of <b>passenger</b> multi-channel service <b>product</b> platform. The solution is to streamline the business as the breakthrough point, around the convenience of passengers travel services to travelers as the center, using the current mainstream and the latest IT technology to establish <b>passenger</b> service <b>product</b> platform. The solution will promote DCS e-ticketing business development and service channel diversity. In this paper, the research results have been applied in the product platform construction of the authors’ company. The practice shows that through traditional business with the latest IT technologies, traditional passenger services into the emerging service model, <b>passenger</b> service <b>product</b> platform has strong advantages and characteristics.

5000|$|A {{new set of}} {{high-speed}} long-distance services was introduced in 1966, launching British Rail's highly successful [...] "Inter-City" [...] brand (the hyphen was later dropped) and offering journey times as London to Manchester or Liverpool in 2 hours 40 minutes (and even 2 hours 30 minutes for the twice-daily Manchester Pullman). A new feature was that these fast trains were offered on a regular-interval service throughout the day: hourly to Birmingham, two-hourly to Manchester, and so on. With {{the completion of the}} northern electrification in 1974, London to Glasgow journey times were reduced to 5 hours.Along with electrification came modern coaches such as the Mark 2 and from 1974 the fully integral, air-conditioned Mark 3 design.

The face-lifts and rebranding of AMC's once-innovative and successful cars were not enough in a competitive landscape that had changed dramatically. No longer was the threat limited to the Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). The Japanese manufacturers (Honda, Toyota, Nissan) used streamlined production methods such as outsourcing and Just In Time (JIT) supply-chain management. They had new, highly efficient assembly plants in the United States. And now they targeted the heart of AMC's <b>passenger</b> <b>product</b> line: small cars.|$|R
50|$|The route {{across the}} flanks of Pico de Orizaba {{required}} expensive construction. The bridge at Tomatlán was 78 m above {{a tributary of}} the Río Jamapa; and 7 km of 3.7% grade with 19 degree (304.94 ft radius) curves were required to reach Coscomatepec from Tomatlán. The construction of the railroad as well as the transportation of <b>passengers,</b> <b>products</b> and supplies were affected by the weather, topography, and infectious diseases, which were more prevalent near the coast. Construction was also delayed by the need for specialized equipment, some of which had to be acquired from firms in the United States and overseas.

40|$|A {{developed}} and well-maintained road network is imperative for {{the distribution of}} freight in the modern world. During transportation, both <b>passengers</b> and <b>products</b> are subjected to dynamic motion due to the irregular nature of pavement surfaces. This dynamic interaction is difficult to accurately predict due to the random and nonstationary nature of pavements and the complicated (and often nonlinear) dynamic characteristics of vehicles. Accurately characterising the dynamic motion generated by vehicles during transport would provide significant benefits to numerous fields. One field of interest is {{in the development of}} protective packaging systems to prevent, or minimise, product damage occurring during the distribution phase. Often, the level of packaging used is far greater than required, resulting in excessive waste which is of significant environmental concern. Another is in evaluating the performance of heavy vehicles to prevent and minimise pavement damage. As a heavy vehicle passes over a pavement, dynamic forces are exerted onto the pavement and induce damage, resulting in rougher roads. The maximum allowable loads of heavy vehicles is constantly increasing, further emphasising the importance of designing suspension systems which are considered road-friendly. For both fields it is important to establish accurate estimates of the dynamic characteristics, namely the Frequency Response Function (FRF), of vehicles...|$|R
