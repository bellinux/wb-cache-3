5|$|Aristocrates, who was {{commanding}} a regiment of hoplites in <b>Piraeus,</b> {{arrested the}} extremist general Alexicles; enraged, the extremist {{leaders of the}} 400 demanded action, and {{made a number of}} threats against Theramenes and his party. To their surprise, Theramenes volunteered to lead a force to rescue Alexicles; the leaders of the extremists acquiesced, and Theramenes set out to <b>Piraeus,</b> sharing his command with one other moderate and one extremist, Aristarchus. When Theramenes and his force arrived at <b>Piraeus,</b> Aristarchus, in a rage, exhorted the men to attack the hoplites who had seized Alexicles. Theramenes feigned rage as well, but when asked by the hoplites whether he thought that the fortification on Eetioneia was a good idea, he responded that if they wanted to pull it down, he thought that would be good. Calling out that everyone who wanted the 5,000 to govern instead of the 400, the hoplites set to work. Donald Kagan has suggested that this call was probably instigated by Theramenes' party, who wanted the 5,000 to govern; the hoplites tearing down the fortification might well have preferred a return to the democracy. Several days later, the Peloponnesian fleet approached <b>Piraeus,</b> but, finding the fortifications destroyed and the port well defended, they sailed on to Euboea. Several days later, the 400 were formally deposed and replaced by a government of the 5,000; the most extreme of the oligarchs fled the city.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Vladimir Šaškijević {{replaced}} Pavić as captain. In August 1935, Dubrovnik visited Corfu and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. In August 1937, Dubrovnik visited Istanbul and the Greek {{ports of}} Mudros {{in the northern}} Aegean Sea and <b>Piraeus</b> near Athens.|$|E
5|$|The Spartans {{then sent}} Teleutias to Aegina {{to command the}} fleet there. Noticing that the Athenians had relaxed their guard after Chabrias's victory, he {{launched}} a raid on <b>Piraeus,</b> seizing numerous merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|By dawn on 20 April 1941, the Germans {{were well}} aware that British and Allied forces had begun {{preliminary}} withdrawal operations from ports in southern Greece. The Luftwaffe made substantial attacks against these departure points {{in a bid to}} prevent or forestall an evacuation. On Sunday 20 April — Hitler's 52nd birthday — the Luftwaffe mounted mass attacks against Allied shipping in <b>Piraeus</b> Harbour.|$|E
5|$|In Greece, despite British aid, little air {{opposition}} was encountered. As the Allies withdrew and resistance collapsed, the Allies began evacuating to Crete. The Stukas inflicted severe damage on Allied shipping. On 22 April, the 1,389ton destroyers Psara and Ydra were sunk. In {{the next two}} days, the Greek naval base at <b>Piraeus</b> lost 23 vessels to Stuka attack.|$|E
5|$|Nea Salamina's emblem {{incorporates}} the Olympic flame, the color red {{and the five}} rings of the Olympic Games. The club's colors during its first two years were yellow and crimson, when {{it was part of}} the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation. After 1950, the governing council changed its colors to red and white: red symbolizing power, and white symbolizing peace. Red-and-white striped jerseys were chosen because they resembled those worn by Olympiakos <b>Piraeus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stamata Revithi {{was born}} in Syros in 1866. Records of her life from 1896 show that {{she was living in}} poverty in <b>Piraeus</b> in 1896. At that point she had given birth to two children, a son who died in 1895, aged seven, and another child who was {{seventeen}} months old {{by the time of the}} 1896 Olympics. According to Olympic historian Athanasios Tarasouleas, Revithi, who was blonde and thin with large eyes, looked much older than her age.|$|E
5|$|The Great Idea (Μεγάλη Ιδέα), {{the dream}} of uniting all Greek populations of the Ottoman Empire, thereby {{restoring}} the Byzantine Empire under Christian rule, led him to contemplate entering the Crimean War {{on the side of}} Russia against Turkey and its British and French allies in 1853; the enterprise was unsuccessful, and resulted in renewed intervention by the two Great Powers and a second blockade of <b>Piraeus</b> port, forcing Greece to neutrality.|$|E
5|$|The King's prestige, {{which was}} based {{in large part on}} his support by the {{combined}} Great Powers, but mostly the support of the British, suffered in the Pacifico incident of 1850, when British Foreign Secretary Palmerston sent the British fleet to blockade the port of <b>Piraeus</b> with warships, to exact reparation for injustice done to a British subject.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles {{probably}} turned 30 in 494BC, which qualified him {{to become}} an archon, the highest of the magistracies in Athens. On {{the back of his}} popularity, he evidently decided to run for this office and was elected Archon Eponymous, the highest government office in the following year (493BC). Themistocles's archonship saw the beginnings of a major theme in his career; the advancement of Athenian sea-power. Under his guidance, the Athenians began the building of a new port at <b>Piraeus,</b> to replace the existing facilities at Phalerum. Although further away from Athens, <b>Piraeus</b> offered three natural harbours, and could be easily fortified. Since Athens was to become an essentially maritime power during the 5th centuryBC, Themistocles's policies were to have huge significance for the future of Athens, and indeed Greece. In advancing naval power, Themistocles was probably advocating a course of action he thought essential for the long-term prospects of Athens. However, as Plutarch implies, since naval power relied on the mass mobilisation of the common citizens (thetes) as rowers, such a policy put more power into the hands of average Atheniansand thus into Themistocles's own hands.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 16 April, the German command {{realised}} that the British were evacuating troops on ships at Volos and <b>Piraeus.</b> The campaign then {{took on the}} character of a pursuit. For the Germans, it was now primarily a question of maintaining contact with the retreating British forces and foiling their evacuation plans. German infantry divisions were withdrawn due to their limited mobility. The 2nd and 5th Panzer Divisions, the 1st SS Motorised Infantry Regiment and both mountain divisions launched a pursuit of the Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|Born in <b>Piraeus,</b> Greece, Kefalas {{earned a}} bachelor's degree in botany from Colorado State University in 1978 and then joined the Peace Corps in 1979, {{serving as an}} {{agricultural}} extension worker in El Salvador. After returning to the United States, he earned a master's degree in teaching, with a secondary science specialization from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1982 and taught in the Poudre School District. He has also worked as an employment counselor for Larimer County, Colorado, and as a health outreach worker.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Quinet {{had left}} {{with the rest of}} the expedition. However, from the time he arrived in Greece, he kept apart from his companions, as did another member of his section, the Lyon {{sculptor}} Jean-Baptiste Vietty. The two travelled through the Peloponnese separately and Quinet visited <b>Piraeus</b> on April 21, 1829, thence reaching Athens. He saw the Cyclades in May, starting with Syros. Having taken ill, he returned to France on June 5, and his Grèce moderne et ses rapports avec l’Antiquité appeared in September 1831. Vietty pursued his research in Greece until August 1831, long after the expedition had returned to France at the end of 1829.|$|E
5|$|In June and July 1930, Hrabri, Nebojša and {{the fleet}} {{auxiliary}} Sitnica again cruised the Mediterranean, visiting Alexandria and Beirut. In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises or manoeuvres due to reduced budgets. In 1934, Hrabri visited Valletta in Malta and the Kelibia Roads {{off the coast}} of Tunisia, and in August 1935, Hrabri again visited Malta, this time in company with the more modern French-designed submarine Osvetnik. In August and September 1937, Hrabri, along with the other French-made submarine Smeli and the depot ship Zmaj, visited Greece, including the port of <b>Piraeus,</b> and the islands of Crete and Corfu.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{departed}} <b>Piraeus</b> on 26 April, touching at Algiers and Tangiers {{before arriving}} at Norfolk on 9 May. She departed for Culebra Island on 12 May to join Admiral Mitscher's 8th Fleet in the Navy's first large-scale postwar Atlantic training maneuvers. The battleship returned to New York City on 27 May, {{and spent the}} next year steaming Atlantic coastal waters north to the Davis Strait and south to the Caribbean on various Atlantic command training exercises. On 13 December, during a target practice exercise in the North Atlantic, a star shell accidentally struck the battleship, but without causing injuries.|$|E
5|$|Olga {{remained}} {{nostalgic for}} Russia. Her room {{was filled with}} icons from her homeland and, in the palace chapel, she sang Slavic hymns with her children. She often visited Russian ships that were docked at <b>Piraeus</b> and invited the Russian sailors to the royal palace. She {{was the only woman}} in history to bear the title of Admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy, an honor given to her on marriage. She was honored in the Greek navy by having a ship named after her.|$|E
5|$|Olga was {{genuinely}} popular and was extensively involved in charity work. On arrival in Athens, her immediate patronages included the Amalieion orphanage {{founded by the}} previous queen consort Amalia of Oldenburg, and the Arsakeion school for girls located on University Boulevard. With her personal support {{and the support of}} wealthy donors, she built asylums for the terminally ill and for the elderly disabled, and a sanatorium for patients with consumption. She founded a society to help the poor, a kindergarten for the children of the poor, and a soup kitchen in <b>Piraeus</b> that doubled as a cooking school for poor girls that was later expanded into a weaving school for girls and elderly women in financial difficulty. She was patron of two military hospitals and endowed the Evangelismos (Annunciation) Hospital, Greece's largest, in downtown Athens. She built the Russian Hospital in <b>Piraeus</b> in memory of her daughter, Alexandra, who died in Moscow in 1891. Although aimed primarily at Russian sailors, the hospital was open to all seamen visiting Greece, with consultation fees set at the low rate of thirty lepta and medicines being free. Olga also supported the establishment and funding of hospitals during the conflicts between Greece and its neighbors, including the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and the First Balkan War (1912–13). For their work for the wounded, Olga and her daughter-in-law Crown Princess Sophia were awarded the Royal Red Cross by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in December 1897.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April, {{the ship}} was {{transferred}} to the island of Syros, where she could support the seaplanes of No. 62 Wing of the Royal Air Force (RAF) on anti-submarine patrols; part of the former No. 2 Wing RNAS redesignated when the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps were merged to form the RAF. Ark Royal was transferred to <b>Piraeus</b> in October and was still there when the Armistice of Mudros with Turkey was signed on 31 October. The ship joined the Allied fleet that occupied Constantinople after the surrender.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, on 8 June 1866, General Admiral {{departed}} Kronstadt for the Mediterranean, {{making a}} port visit at Copenhagen on 22 June en route. In June 1867 she made another port visit at <b>Piraeus</b> before leaving Cadiz on 26 July {{bound for the}} Baltic. She returned to the Mediterranean {{the next year and}} evacuated Cretan insurgents and their families in 1868 during the Cretan Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Having returned to Russia by 1869, she was struck from the Navy List on 26 June 1869 and broken up the following year.|$|E
5|$|With {{the signing}} of the Anglo-Polish {{military}} alliance impending, Pułaski sailed from Gdynia to Falmouth on 24 August 1939. On 26 September, the ship left Dartmouth for Gibraltar (calling there on 2 September) and <b>Piraeus,</b> where she arrived on 13 October. Picking up Polish soldiers there, she sailed five days later for Marseille, where she eventually arrived on 2 December. Until March 1940, Pułaski underwent a refit in Marseille after which she sailed under charter to the French Fabre Line. At the end of the 1930s, the Fabre Line sailed ships on a Marseille–Dakar route with intermediate stops in other African ports.|$|E
5|$|After {{a battle}} with Erinys, Kratos arrives in Sparta and {{witnesses}} a group of Spartans tearing down a statue of Ares, intent on replacing it with one of Kratos. Kratos then chases a dissenter loyal to Ares into the Spartan Jails, who attempts to kill Kratos by releasing the <b>Piraeus</b> Lion. Defeating both foes, Kratos journeys to the Temple of Ares, where he encounters the spirit of his child self and learns that he must return to the now sunken Atlantis and locate the Domain of Death. Before leaving, a loyal Spartan provides him with his former weapons—used during Kratos' days as a Captain of the Spartan army—the Arms of Sparta. After returning to the sunken Atlantis, Kratos receives great resentment from Poseidon for sinking his beloved city.|$|E
5|$|As a {{marriage}} gift, the Tsar gave George {{a group of}} islands in the Petalioi Gulf, which the family visited on the royal yacht Amphitrite. George later purchased a country estate, Tatoi, north of Athens, and on Corfu he built a summer villa called Mon Repos. George developed Tatoi, building roads and planting grapes for making his own wine, Chateau Décélie. Intent on not letting his subjects know that he missed Denmark, he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at Tatoi, which was managed by native Danes {{and served as a}} bucolic reminder of his homeland. Queen Olga was far less careful in hiding her nostalgia for her native Russia, often visiting Russian ships at <b>Piraeus</b> two or three times before they weighed anchor. When alone with his wife, George usually conversed in German. Their children were taught English by their nannies, and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English.|$|E
5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for <b>Piraeus</b> and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the decade, Nea Salamina was strong in home games but weak away. Noteworthy is the conquest of the amateur {{championship}} from farm team the period 1960–61, The games of the farm team gathered the same interest with the main team among fans, who enthusiastically celebrated winning the title. During this period the nucleus for a successful team was created, including Kyriakos Koureas (who later played for Olympiakos <b>Piraeus).</b> In December 1963, the league disbanded; at that time, Nea Salamina was in a tight three-way race with Omonia and APOEL. With the creation of Cypriot National Guard, many Nea Salamina's players joined the army; players would often come straight from camps throughout Cyprus to play league games with no training.|$|E
5|$|Finally on 10 June 1917, Charles Jonnart, the Entente's High Commissioner in Greece, ordered King Constantine {{to give up}} his power. On {{the threat}} of Entente forces landing in <b>Piraeus,</b> the king conceded and agreed to go into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while {{determined}} to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with another member of the royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the natural heir, was ruled out by the Allies because they thought him too pro-German, like his father. Instead, they considered installing Constantine's brother (and Alexander's uncle), Prince George, but he had tired of public life during his difficult tenure as High Commissioner of Crete between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne. As a result, Constantine's second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.|$|E
5|$|Forming an {{alliance}} with Ptolemy, Antigonus, and Lysimachus, Cassander had his officer Nicanor capture the Munichia fortress of Athens' port town <b>Piraeus</b> in defiance of Polyperchon's decree that Greek cities should be free of Macedonian garrisons, sparking the Second War of the Diadochi (319–315 BC). Given a string of military failures by Polyperchon, in 317 BC Philip III, by way of his politically-engaged wife Eurydice II of Macedon, officially replaced him as regent with Cassander. Afterwards Polyperchon desperately sought the aid of Olympias, mother of Alexander III who still resided in Epirus. A joint force of Epirotes, Aetolians, and Polyperchon's troops invaded Macedonia and forced the surrender of Philip III and Eurydice's army, allowing Olympias to execute the king and force his queen to commit suicide. Olympias then had Nicanor killed along with dozens of leading Macedonian nobles, yet {{by the spring of}} 316 BC Cassander defeated her forces, captured her, and placed her on trial for murder before sentencing her to death.|$|E

5|$|In 393 BC, Conon and Pharnabazus {{sailed to}} {{mainland}} Greece, where they raided {{the coast of}} Laconia and seized the island of Cythera, where they left a garrison and an Athenian governor. They then sailed to Corinth, where they distributed money and urged {{the members of the}} council to show the Persian king that they were trustworthy. Pharnabazus then dispatched Conon with substantial funds and {{a large part of the}} fleet to Attica, where he joined in the rebuilding of the long walls from Athens to <b>Piraeus,</b> a project that had been initiated by Thrasybulus in 394 BC. With the assistance of the rowers of the fleet, and the workers paid for by the Persian money, the construction was soon completed. Athens quickly took advantage of its possession of walls and a fleet to seize the islands of Scyros, Imbros, and Lemnos, on which it established cleruchies (citizen colonies).|$|E
5|$|In December, the 4th Infantry Division was {{deployed}} to Greece to reinforce British forces embroiled in the country's civil war. Conflict in Greece between government forces and Communist partisans followed the vacuum {{created by the}} German withdrawal. The partisans (ELAS) sought to establish themselves as the new political authority and confronted the British-supported government-in-exile when ordered to disband and disarm. Within 24 hours of being flown to <b>Piraeus</b> on 12 December, the 2nd King's had to engage partisans in a brief action, seizing occupied barracks {{at a cost of}} 14 casualties. During a seven-week internal security employment, there were many instances of house-to-house and street fighting in Athens. By mid-January 1945, the city had been cleared of insurgents and a ceasefire agreed upon, followed by the Varkiza Agreement in February. The King's remained for a year to support a tense peace until they left for Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, George {{maintained}} {{a strong relationship}} with his brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales (eventually King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), and sought his help in defusing the recurring and contentious issue of Crete, an overwhelmingly Greek island that remained under Ottoman Turk control. Since the reign of Otto, the Greek desire to unite Greek lands in one nation had been a sore spot with the United Kingdom and France, which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main Greek port <b>Piraeus</b> to dissuade Greek irredentism during the Crimean War. During the Cretan Revolt (1866–1869), the Prince of Wales sought the support of British Foreign Secretary Lord Derby to intervene in Crete on behalf of Greece. Ultimately, the Great Powers did not intervene and the Ottomans put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{departed}} Istanbul on 9 April {{and entered}} Phaleron Bay, <b>Piraeus,</b> Greece, {{the following day}} for an overwhelming welcome by Greek government officials and anti-communist citizens. Greece had become {{the scene of a}} civil war between the communist World War II resistance movement and the returning Greek government-in-exile. The United States saw this as an important test case for its new doctrine of containment of the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pushing for concessions in the Dodecanese {{to be included in the}} peace treaty with Italy and for access through the Dardanelles strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The voyage of Missouri to the eastern Mediterranean symbolized America's strategic commitment to the region. News media proclaimed her a symbol of U.S. interest in preserving both nations' independence.|$|E
5|$|On , 1896 the leaking Sissoi Veliky reached Algiers. The captain {{planned to}} stay there for at least 20 days to {{complete}} the most urgent repairs, but five days later a telegram from Saint Petersburg forced him to leave for <b>Piraeus.</b> There the crew managed to seal the seams between the armour plates and repair the electrical systems. In February 1897 Sissoi Veliky steamed for Crete and she had her first gunnery exercise ten miles off the shore of Souda Bay, Crete {{at the end of}} the month. The second exercise, held on , ended in disaster when the rear turret exploded after an hour of target practice. The explosion blew the roof of the turret over the mainmast so that it struck the base of the foremast, crushing one 37mm gun and a steam cutter. The explosion killed 16 men and wounded another 15; 6 of these later died of their wounds. The badly damaged Sissoi Veliky headed to Toulon for repairs.|$|E
5|$|Philip's fleet {{had just}} {{escaped from the}} allied {{blockade}} and Philip ordered that a squadron head to Athens. The Macedonian squadron sailed into <b>Piraeus</b> and captured four Athenian ships. As the Macedonian squadron was retreating, the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet, which had followed Philip's ships across the Aegean, appeared from the allied base at Aegina and attacked the Macedonians. The allies defeated the Macedonian fleet and recaptured the Athenian ships, which {{they returned to the}} Athenians. The Athenians were so pleased by the rescue that they replaced the recently abolished pro-Macedonian tribes, the Demetrias and Antigonis tribes, with the Attalid tribe in honour of Attalus as well as destroying monuments that had previously been erected in honour of Macedonian Kings. Attalus and the Rhodians convinced the Athenian assembly to declare war on the Macedonians.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral Lionel Tufnell, {{the head}} of a British naval mission to Greece, {{advocated}} purchasing another armored cruiser like Gerogios Averof, along with several smaller vessels and allocating funds to modernizing the Greek naval base at Salamis; this proposal was supported by Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who sought to control naval spending in the tight Greek budget projected for 1912. The plan came to nothing, as the Greek government waited for the arrival of British advisers for the Salamis project. In early 1912, the Greek Navy convened a committee that would be in charge of acquiring a new capital ship to counter Reşadiye, initially conceived as a battlecruiser. The new ship would be limited to a displacement of , since that was the largest vessel the floating dry dock in <b>Piraeus</b> could accommodate. The program was finalized in March, and along with the new battlecruiser, the Greeks invited tenders for destroyers, torpedo boats, submarines, and a depot ship to support them.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} power, the extremist {{leaders of the}} {{revolution}} had begun constructing fortifications on Eetioneia, a dominant point in {{the entrance to the}} harbor of <b>Piraeus,</b> ostensibly to protect the harbor against an attack from the fleet at Samos. With internal dissent increasing, they joined these new fortifications to existing walls to form a redoubt defensible against attacks from land or sea, which contained a large warehouse into which the extremists moved most of the city's grain supply. Theramenes protested strongly against the building of this fortification, arguing that its purpose was not to keep the democrats out, but to be handed over to the Spartans; Thucydides testifies that his charges were not without substance, as the extremists were actually contemplating such an action. Initially cautious (as enemies of the regime had been executed before), Theramenes and his party were emboldened and galvanized into action by several events. First, a Peloponnesian fleet, ostensibly dispatched to assist anti-Athenian forces on Euboea, was moving slowly up the coast of the Peloponnese; Theramenes charged that this fleet was planning to seize the fortifications on Eetioneia, in collaboration with the extremists. Second, an Athenian militiaman, apparently acting on orders from conspirators higher in the ranks of the government, assassinated Phrynichus, the leader of the extremist faction. He escaped, but his accomplice, an Argive, was captured; the prisoner, under torture, refused to state the name of his employer. With the extremists unable to take effective action in this case, and with the Peloponnesian fleet overrunning Aegina (a logical stopping point on the approach to <b>Piraeus),</b> Theramenes and his party decided to act.|$|E
5|$|Smeli was {{the second}} of her class, and the fourth {{submarine}} of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the Royal Yugoslav Navy). She was launched on 1 December 1928. She and Osvetnik arrived in the Bay of Kotor on 9 December 1929. In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets. In October 1934, Smeli visited Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia, and the Kelibia Roads {{off the coast of}} Tunisia. In August and September 1937, Smeli, along with the British-made submarine Hrabri and the depot ship Zmaj, visited Greece, including the port of <b>Piraeus,</b> and the islands of Crete and Corfu.|$|E
