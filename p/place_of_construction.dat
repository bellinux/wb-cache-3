500|$|The ship could {{originally}} {{have been}} said to be of Arabian or Indian origin, as {{there is little to}} differentiate between ships of the area during that period, in regard to construction techniques—though its frame uses a species of tree that is only found in a small part of Africa. After analysing the hull form, timber species, and construction methods, Ilic concluded that the wreck was of Indian or Arabian origin. India was considered the more probable <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> but Arabian construction was not ruled out, as the timber used was commonly imported to the Middle East for use in shipbuilding.
