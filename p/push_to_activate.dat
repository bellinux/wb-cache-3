In March 1982 he was appointed Chief Commander of Sayeret Matkal. During his time as Chief Commander the Lebanon War broke out and Avital <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> the unit as a regular infantry unit. During the war, Avital said, in a conference attended by the Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and the Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan, that he opposed {{the very idea of}} armored forces entry to Beirut, it being the capital of a neighboring country. Yet Avital said should it be decided to enter the city, he will lead his troops in the operation. A few days before Omer Bar Lev replaced him in the position, Avital participated in the rescue of the kidnapped hostages in line 300.|$|R

Regulations do not specify a mandatory location for the turn signal control, only that it be visible and operable by the belted-in driver, and—at least in North America—that it be labelled with a specific symbol if it is not located on the left side of the steering column. The international UN Regulations do not include analogous specifications.|$|R

From better crosswalks, sidewalks and pedestrian technologies to growing educational and safety programs, the FHWA’s Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Research Program strives {{to pave the way}} for a more walkable future. At many signalized intersections, pedestrian detection is accomplished by the pedestrians <b>pushing</b> buttons <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> the Walk phase. Pedestrians often do not activate the Walk signal because they believe the button already has been pressed, do not think it is working, or cannot access the button. Automated pedestrian detection systems can detect the presence of pedestrians and call the Walk signal without any require action by the pedestrian. This study evaluated the safety effects of microwave and infrared detectors used in conjunction with standard pedestrian push buttons. This study was part of a larger Federal Highway Administration research study investigating the effectiveness of innovative engineering treatments on pedestrian safety. It is hoped that readers also will review the reports documenting the results of the related pedestrian safety studies. The results of this research will be useful to transportation engineers, planners, and safety professionals who are involved in improving pedestrian safety and mobility...|$|R

For example, he had {{subjects}} wear an active orthosis on one leg which performed a very strong plantar flexion every time they flexed the soleus, {{which is expected to}} plantar flex. However, the plantar flexion performed by the device was too strong and the subjects had to only use a minimal amount of muscle strength on that one leg in order to walk normally. People were able to adapt to this difficulty in under 30 minutes. Another study by S.

50|$|As {{no small}} part of the {{manpower}} required was dedicated to calculation and plotting, a great reduction could be made by using as much automation as possible. This started with the use of various mechanical aids; these were eventually replaced by the fruit machine, an electromechanical analogue computer of some complexity. It replicated all of these devices and tables in electrical form. An electrical repeater, or synchro, was added to the gonio dial. To measure the range, a new dial was added that moved a mechanical marker to a selected blip on the display. When a particular target was properly selected, the operator <b>pushed</b> a button <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> the fruit machine, which then read these inputs. In addition to the inputs, the fruit machine also had a series of local corrections for both angle and altitude, as measured by calibration flights and stored in the machine in telephone uniselectors. These corrections were automatically added to the calculation, eliminating the time-consuming lookup of these numbers from tables. The output was the altitude, which then allowed the plotters to determine the proper over-ground distance to the target.|$|R

40|$|The paper aims at {{contributing}} {{to the body of}} knowledge referred to Public Administrations co-operation. In particular, the research is focused on Local Public Administration (LPA), intensely influenced by the global economic crisis. The study regards to how LPAs could reach more efficiency and effectiveness in providing services to its final users (citizen, companies and other PAs), as well as provide new services, especially on the cooperation among LPAs, called inter- LPA cooperation (ILPAC). Having analysed LPA paradigm, it has been possible to isolate some relevant trends characterizing LPA and some open scientific literature gaps about ILPAC: nowadays, in ILPAC phenomenon, some weak points can be highlighted, especially in start-up and in management phases. Consequently, in collaboration with the eGovernment Observatory of the Milan University of Technology, the research has inquired the reasons that lead <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> an ILPAC and develop a decision making framework for the governance of shared functions in the LPA. Particularly, it has focused on the identification of LPA environmental reasons and LPA proper characteristics <b>pushing</b> LPA <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> an ILPAC of its fundamental functions. Once identified these elements, it has tried to identify the organizational and managerial configurations adopted for ILPAC to manage shared functions. The study has implied the use of several instruments in order to investigate ILPAC phases, from their founding to ordinary management in the Italian context. Results have been analysed using statistical methods, in order to come to light some peculiarities already pointed out by the descriptive examination. In addition, linear regression has been set in order to inquire into ILPAC performances, compared to autonomous municipalities. Using this methodology, the analysis has pointed out some important suggestions pertaining to ILPAC management. Primary considerations has shown the effect of regional different governances that impact on the amount and the dimension of ILPACs in their territories. Secondly, associated municipalities obtain better performances than independent bodies, for instance, considering the One-Stop-Shop proceedings. In addition, linear regression has proven that ILPACs produce benefits in a wider context: the analysis has pointed out some important suggestions pertaining to ILPAC management, as organizational performances increase when the number of associated municipalities increase or both proceeding costs and time improve when large ILPACs formalize and clearly declare their objectives...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} extended emission line region (EELR) around quasars is presented. New Subaru/Suprime-Cam observation {{is combined with}} literature search, resulting in a compilation of 81 EELR measurements for type- 1 and type- 2 quasars with associated active galactic nucleus (AGN) and host galaxy properties. It is found that EELR phenomenon shows clear correlation with Eddington ratio, which links EELR to the constituents of the principal component 1 (PC 1), or eigenvector 1, of the AGN emission correlations. We also find that EELR is preferentially associated with gas-rich, massive blue galaxies. It supports {{the idea that the}} primary determinant of EELR creation is the gas availability and that the gas may be brought in by galaxy merger triggering the current star formation as well as AGN activity, and also gives an explanation for the fact that most luminous EELR is found around radio-loud sources with low Eddington ratio. By combining all the observations, it is suggested that EELR quasars occupy the massive blue corner of the green valley, the AGN realm, on the galaxy color - stellar mass diagram. Once a galaxy is <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> this corner, <b>activated</b> AGN would create EELR by the energy injection into the interstellar gas and eventually blow it away, leading to star-formation quenching. The results presented here provide a piece of evidence for the presence of such AGN feedback process, which may be playing {{a leading role in the}} co-evolution of galaxies and central super-massive black holes.
