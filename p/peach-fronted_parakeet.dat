50|$|The <b>peach-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> has a peach cap, yellow {{round the}} eye and green plumage. Peach Front Conures are sexually monomorphic. Juvenile Peach Front Conures {{resemble}} adults, with a much smaller peach crown, with no yellow eye ring.|$|E
50|$|The <b>peach-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Eupsittula aurea), more {{commonly}} known as the peach-fronted conure in aviculture, is a species of parrot in the family Psittacidae. It is widespread and often common in semi-open and open habitats in eastern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, far northern Argentina and southern Suriname (Sipaliwini savanna). Both its common and scientific name is a reference to the orange-yellow forehead, although this is reduced in juveniles.|$|E
50|$|Average annual {{rainfall}} is 1200 mm.Temperature {{ranges from}} 18 to 23 C, with average of 21 C.Vegetation includes trees up to 20 m high, with scattered Mata Mesof√≠lica species among the Savannah species.There are distinct layers of savannah vegetation: grasses, shrubs up to 3 m, trees from 8 to 10 m and trees over 15 m.Endemic fauna include curl-crested jay (Cyanocorax cristatellus), <b>peach-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Eupsittula aurea), shrike-like tanager (Neothraupis fasciata), white-eared puffbird (Nystalus chacuru) and red-bellied macaw (Orthopsittaca manilatus).|$|E

This article describes a refrigeration system as an unusual nesting {{site for the}} <b>Peach-fronted</b> <b>parakeet,</b> Eupsittula aurea, in the Central-West of Brazil.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} from August 1995 to August 1998 in order to describe the breeding behavior of the <b>Peach-fronted</b> <b>Parakeet</b> Aratinga aurea in southwestern of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Aratinga aurea breeds mainly in terrestrial termitarium, and all nests found during the research were located in areas of high human disturbances. The eggs were mostly laid every three days, and the clutch size varied between two to five eggs. The mean size of the eggs is 21, 02 x 26, 83 mm (n = 29 eggs). The incubation period varied from 23 to 25 days and the hatching was asynchronous, with duration {{of five or six}} days. Nestlings fledged at 45 - 51 days after hatching. During all the reproductive period the couple visited the nests...|$|E

The objective is obtain data on feeding behavior of the <b>Peach-fronted</b> <b>Parakeet</b> (Aratinga aurea) in southwestern Minas Gerais State. Thirty-three plant species were eaten by A. aurea. Hyptis suaveolens (Lamiaceae) and Psidium guajava (Myrtaceae) were the most consumed. Aratinga aurea fed on flowers, fruit pulp but seeds were the most consumed item. The use of leaves as food was recorded only for Pyrus communis (Rosaceae), on a single feeding bout. From 33 species eaten, parakeets used seeds from 18 species, fruit pulp from seven and flowers from 12 species. The methods used to obtain food varied according {{to the size of}} plant species, as well as the morphology. Generally, it was possible to define three basic strategies: (1) the bird pecks the food without ripping it from the branch, (2) the birds plucks off the food with its beak and grinds it, (3) the bird plucks off the food with its beak, grabs it using its foot and only then starts to eat it. There was statistically significant variation of the methods used in relation to the food item. The flock size during feeding is highly variable. Flock size varied from one individual eating alone to 20 individuals at the same site. Records of flocks of one or two birds were mostly made during breeding period...|$|E
