5|$|Developed {{alongside}} the subsonic and smaller Hawker Siddeley P.1127/Kestrel, the P.1154 {{was derived from}} the P.1150. The P.1150 proposal did not meet NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 and, consequently, the P.1154 was born. This Mach 2-capable aircraft retained <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> burning previously designed for the P.1150. Although the technical winner of eleven submissions, follow-on testing and production for the P.1154 did not proceed as a result of political strife.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{development}} of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four swivelling nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation's Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, on 13April1961, HSA {{decided to}} conduct {{preliminary}} {{work on a}} supersonic derivative of the P.1127 {{under the guidance of}} Ralph Hooper. This would result in a new design, designated P.1150, which was 50% larger than the preceding P.1127; it was proposed that a new performance enhancing feature be adopted {{in the form of the}} <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> burning (PCB)– essentially an afterburner – in the engine. The P.1150 proposal broadly resembled its P.1127 predecessor despite major changes being made, including its revised fuselage, the adoption of a thinner wing, and an advanced version of the Pegasus engine. The Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine was equipped with a similar arrangement of four swivelling exhaust nozzles, the front nozzles of which were to be equipped with PCB. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the P.1150 was to have been capable of Mach 1.3.|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of an experimental investigation of ventilated-wall interference on dynamic measurements using half-models in four transonic tunnels, {{three of which}} have a slotted roof and floor whilst the other has a perforated roof and floor. It is shown that if wall interference effects are present at subsonic speeds then these probably persist to low supersonic speeds. The supersonic interference {{can be associated with}} an upstream propagation of disturbances in the <b>plenum</b> <b>chambers</b> in a region close to the ventilated walls. The interference effects in the perforated tunnel are comparable with those produced previously when it was fitted with a slotted roof and floor. It is found that variation of diffuser suction to the <b>plenum</b> <b>chambers</b> behind the perforated walls has a significant effect on the damping derivatives. With the half-model technique used, both lift and pitching-moment derivatives are shown to be influenced by the thickness of the side-wall boundary layer, but in many practical cases the effect may be acceptably small...|$|R
40|$|A novel multi-jet burner {{was built}} to provide {{one-dimensional}} laminar flat flames {{with a wide range}} of variable parameters for multipurpose quantitative optical measurements. The burner is characterized by two independent <b>plenum</b> <b>chambers,</b> one supporting a matrix of 181 laminar jet flames and the other supporting a co-flow from a perforated plate with small holes evenly distributed among the jets. A uniform rectangular burned gas region of 70 mm × 40 mm can be generated, {{with a wide range of}} temperatures and equivalence ratios by controlling independently the gas supplies to the two <b>plenum</b> <b>chambers.</b> The temperature of the hot gas can be adjusted from 1000 K to 2000 K with different flame conditions. The burner is designed to seed additives in gas or liquid phase to study homogeneous reactions. The large uniform region can be used to burn solid fuels and study heterogeneous reactions. The temperature was measured using two-line atomic fluorescence thermometry and the temperature profile at a given height above the burner was found to be flat.

Borrowing from technologies pioneered in the US and Australian markets (where strict emissions regulations meant the inclusion of high compression carburetted engines was not feasible) the new derivative was originally only available in the Vitesse model, but from 1984 onwards it was also offered in the luxury Vanden Plas range, badged as the Vanden Plas EFi. To {{meet the demands of}} the luxury executive car market, where automatic transmission tended to be preferred, Rover first offered an auto as an option in the Vitesse, but later withdrew the option and lured the customers to the plush Vanden Plas EFi instead which had all the standard comforts of the Vitesse, such as electric mirrors, windows and locks, a trip computer, headlight washers, an adjustable steering column and a four-speaker stereo (something special at that time). Additionally, it added as standard leather seats (velour cloth was a no-cost option), an electrically operated sunroof (available on all models) and cruise control; the only option being air-conditioning.

40|$|Abstract: We {{have been}} {{investigating}} a microfluidics platform for highspeed, low-cost sequencing of single DNA molecules using novel “chargeswitch” nucleotides. A significant challenge is {{the design of}} a flowcell suitable for manipulating bead-DNA complexes and sorting labeled polyphosphate molecules by charge. The flowcell is part of a singlemolecule detection instrument, creating fluorescence images from labeled polyphosphates. These images would ultimately be analyzed by signal processing algorithms to identify specific nucleotides in a DNA sequence. Here we describe requirements of the fluidics system for loading, identifying, tracking, and positioning beads. By dynamically modulating pressure gradients in the <b>plenum</b> <b>chambers</b> of a multi-channel network, we could guide individual beads with high precision to any desired coordinate and reversibly trap them in stepped channels. We show that DNA immobilized on pressure-trapped beads can be physically extended into a downstream channel under electric force for analysis.

40|$|Modifications {{to local}} and state codes are seen as an {{appropriate}} strategy {{for the prevention of}} residential air distribution system leakage and its impacts. A model code element has been developed to assist this strategy. Recent field studies of Florida residences by Cummings, Tooley and Moyer have revealed a mean leakage of 11 percent for the air distribution systems of central, fan-force heating and air conditioning systems. Such leakage may cause an estimated 20 percent increase in energy consumption for air conditioning, as well as a 50 percent increase in peak cooling load and an 80 percent increase in peak heating load. In addition, building air leakage may be expected to be several times greater when duct leakage is present or when avenues of air egress from closeable rooms are absent. The model duct construction element presented here contains all of the standards, definitions and code language needed to replace the current duct construction element of the local or state code. The content of this paper was used as a principal source for language adopted for the 1991 Florida Energy Efficiency Code For Building Construction. Addressed are the most appropriate standards required for the closure and sealing of metal duct, rigid fibrous glass duct, and nonmetallic flexible duct. Also addressed are (1) detailed requirements for the sealing of mechanical closets when they function as <b>plenum</b> <b>chambers,</b> (2) detailed requirements for the sealing of enclosed support platforms or air handlers and furnaces when they function as return duct, (3) detailed requirements for the sealing of uninhabitable cavities of the building structure, when they function as duct, and (4) detailed requirements for the egress of air from enclosed rooms which receive supply air.

40|$|International audienceIn annular {{combustion}} chambers of aero-engines and gas turbines, acoustic coupling {{may arise from}} azimuthal modes which are less well damped than axial modes. Also, since the circumference is the largest length in the combustor, the azimuthal modes have the lowest resonance frequencies and are most prone to instability. Such a coupling raises many scientific issues which are considered in {{a small number of}} funda- mental experiments. The present investigation focuses on this problem and provides experimental data on a special type of combustion instability in which the thermo-acoustic resonant coupling involves a combina- tion of modes. This produces an unusual pattern of flame responses in which the distribution of heat release rate is slanted. Data are provided in the form of free radical light intensity patterns (interpreted as heat release rate distributions) and microphone signals detected in the <b>plenum</b> and <b>chamber.</b> It is shown that the slanted pattern is the signature of a combination of two modes with coinciding frequencies, the first being a standing azimuthal mode while the second is an axial mode.

40|$|International audienceOscillations in fully annular systems {{coupled by}} {{azimuthal}} modes are often observed in gas turbine combustors but not well documented. One {{objective of the}} present study is to characterize this type of oscillation in a laboratory scale system, allowing detailed pres- sure measurements and high speed visualization of the flame motion. The experiment is designed to allow detailed investigations of this process at a stable limit cycle and {{for an extended period of}} time. Experiments reported in the present article are carried out in the MICCA facility which was used in our previous work to analyze instabilities arising when the chamber backplane was equipped with multiple swirling injectors (Bourgouin et al., 2013, “Self-Sustained Instabilities in an Annular Combustor Coupled by Azimuthal Acoustic Modes,” ASME Paper No. GT 2013 - 95010). In the present study, these units are replaced by a set of matrix injectors. The annular plenum feeds 16 such devices confined by two cylindrical quartz tubes open to the atmosphere. The multiple flames formed by the matrix injectors are laminar and have a well documented describing function. This constitutes an ideal configuration allowing systematic investigations of thermo-acoustic oscillations coupled by longitudinal or azimuthal modes while avoid- ing complexities inherent to swirling turbulent flames studied previously. Optical access to the chamber allows high speed imaging of light emission from the flames providing instantaneous flame patterns and indications on the heat release rate fluc- tuations. Eight waveguide microphones record the pressure signal at the combustor injection plane and in the plenum. Among the unstable modes observed in this setup, this analysis focuses on situations where the system features a spinning azimuthal mode. This mode is observed at a frequency which is close to that associated with the 1 A mode of the plenum.

40|$|This thesis endeavors towards {{developing}} various concepts {{employed in}} analysis {{and design of}} acoustic ﬁlters for varied applications ranging from combination mufflers for automobiles to complex networks of gas carrying ducts to multiply connected complex automotive silencing devices to the noise control coatings for underwater applications. A two-dimensional wave modeling approach has been proposed to evaluate sound attenuation characteristics of dissipative mufflers of ﬁnite length with/without extended inlet and outlet tubes including very large mufflers. The correctness of the method has been validated through comparison with experimental results from literature. Two other frequently used approximate schemes have been discussed brieﬂy {{with reference to the}} available literature. These three approaches have then been weighed against each other to show the effectiveness and limitations of each one. A thorough comparison study has been performed to investigate each one’s extent of applicability. A parametric study with different parameters suggests some useful design guidelines that can be put to use while designing such mufflers. Beneﬁts and drawbacks of reactive and dissipative mufflers have been discussed with an intention of striking a compromise between them to achieve a better transmission quality over a broad frequency range. This has been accomplished by combining these two types of mufflers/ﬁlters explicitly. These combination mufflers are analyzed using a transfer matrix based approach by extending the aforesaid concept of two-dimensional wave modeling for ﬁnite dissipative ducts. The present approach has been used to analyze axi-symmetric circular lined <b>plenum</b> <b>chambers</b> also. The effectiveness of the bulk reaction assumption to model absorptive lining is illustrated. A parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effects of different thicknesses and placements of the absorptive lining. The contributions of reﬂective and absorptive portion of the combination mufflerto overall attenuation performance have been investigated from the designer’s point of view A generalized algorithm has been developed for studying the plane sound wave propa- gation in a system of interconnected rigid-walled acoustic ﬁlter elements. Interconnection between various elements is represented by a connectivity matrix. Equations of volume velocity continuity and pressure equilibrium at the interconnections are generated using this connectivity matrix and are solved using the Gauss-Jordan elimination scheme to get the overall transfer matrix of the system. The algorithm used for generalized labeling of the network and computation of Transmission Loss has also been discussed. The algorithm has been applied to investigate a multiply connected automobile mufflers as a network of acoustic elements which guides the way to a specialized application discussed next. Results for some conﬁgurations have been compared with those from the FEM analysis and experiments. A parametric study with respect to some geometric variables is carried out. The acoustical similarity between apparently different networks is discussed. The approach is ﬂexible to incorporate any other acoustic elements, provided the acoustic variables at the junctions of the element can be related by a transfer matrix a priori. Commercial automotive mufflers are often too complex to be broken into a cascade of one dimensional elements with predetermined transfer matrices. The one dimensional (1 -D) scheme presented here is based on an algorithm that uses user friendly visual volume elements to generate the system equations which are then solved using a Gauss-Jordan elimination scheme to derive the overall transfer matrix of the muffler. This work attempts and succeeds to a great extent in exploiting the speed of the one dimensional analysis with the ﬂexibility, generality and user friendliness of three dimensional analysis using geometric modeling. A code based on the developed algorithm has been employed to demonstrate the generality of the proposed method in analyzing commercial muffers by considering three very diverse classes of mufflers with diﬀerent kinds of combinations of reactive, perforated and absorptive elements. Though the examples presented in the thesis are not very complex for they are meant to be just representative cases of certain classes of mufflers, yet the algorithm can handle a large domain of commercial mufflers of high degree of complexity. Results from the present algorithm have been validated through comparisons with both the analytical and the more general, three-dimensional FEM based results. The forte of the proposed method is its power to construct the system matrix consistent with the boundary conditions from the geometrical model to evaluate the four pole parameters of the entire muffer and thence its transmission loss,etc. Thus, the algorithm can be used in conjunction with the transfer matrix based muffler programs to analyze the entire exhaust system of an automobile. A different kind of acoustic ﬁlter than the above mentioned cases is then taken up for investigation. These refer to the specialized underwater acoustic ﬁlters laid as linings on submerged bodies. These kind of underwater noise control linings have three different types of objectives, namely, Echo Reduction, Transmission Reduction (TL maximization) and a combination thereof. These coatings {{have been shown to be}} behaving very differently with different shape, size and number of air channels present in the layer. In this regard, a ﬁnite element model based methodology has been followed. An hybrid type ﬁnite element based on the Pian and Tong formulation has been modiﬁed and used so as to make the computational efforts less demanding as compared to the original one. The developed ﬁnite element has been shown to be immune to the difficulties that arise due to the near incompressible characteristics of the viscoelastic materials used and the high distortion of the elements of the FE mesh. The adequacy of this formulation has been shown by comparing its results with the analytical, FE based, and experimental results. Then, this methodology has been used to analyze and generate design curves to control various geometrical parameters for proper designing of these linings. Different unit cell representations for different types of distributions of air cavities on the linings have been discussed. Four different types of layers have been introduced and analyzed to address different objectives mentioned above. They have been termed as the Anechoic layer, Insulation layer and Combination Layer of coupled and decoupled type in this thesis. The ﬁrst two layers have been designed to achieve very dissimilar characteristics and the next two layers have been designed to balance their disparities. A thorough parametric study has been carried out on the geometrical parameters of all the layers to come up with the design guidelines. For anechoic and the insulation layers, different distributions have been analyzed with different unit cell geometries and their usability in speciﬁc situations has been outlined. Effect of static pressure has also been studied by using an approximate ﬁnite element method. This method can be used to simulate deep-sea testing environment...|$|R
