5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada <b>pickup</b> <b>trucks</b> are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, <b>pickup</b> <b>trucks</b> and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E
5|$|To {{some extent}} {{this is due}} to {{geography}} and driver training, but more rigorous impaired driving enforcement and severe penalties in Sweden for driving under the influence may also explain the difference. While it might be argued that highways and vehicles in Sweden are different from those in the United States, the U.S. fatality rate is also about double the rate in the Canadian province of Ontario, which experienced 3.6 road fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km according to preliminary 2014 data. Ontario, which is a vast province of more than 1 million square kilometers, has a similar mix of highway types including congested urban and rural highways. Ontario also has a similar mix of large transport trucks essentially identical to U.S. transport trucks, full-sized <b>pickup</b> <b>trucks,</b> SUVs and passenger cars, although there may be more small cars driven in Ontario compared to the United States. This suggests that differences in fatality rates are due to non-physical factors such as driver behavior.|$|E

40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the design of}} a wind turbine system and the evaluation of aerodynamics performance of <b>pickup</b> <b>truck</b> with wind turbine system. <b>Pickup</b> <b>truck</b> with wind turbine models was developed using Solid Work sohare. Computer simulation (using Ansys software) was carried out to investigate the effects of wind turbine installation on aerodynamics of the <b>pickup</b> <b>truck.</b> Three <b>pickup</b> <b>truck</b> models with different wind turbine system positions i. e in front of the fiont bumper, on top of the hood and on top of the roof plus one model without the wind turbine system were simulated. The study proved that the position of the wind turbine system will change the characteristic of the air flow around the <b>pickup</b> <b>truck</b> body and affects the aerodynamic performance of the <b>pickup</b> <b>truck.</b> Without the wind turbine, the coefficient of drag Cd for the <b>pickup</b> <b>truck</b> model was 0. 345, which was computable to that of stated in Toyota Hilux specification [...] As for the model with wind turbine, the Cd obtained were 0. 345, 0. 349. 0. 353 and 0. 344 for the case of fiont bumper, hood, roof and under <b>pickup</b> <b>truck</b> respectively. Extended fiont bumper of a <b>pickup</b> <b>truck</b> was not significantly affect the aerodynamics performance of the <b>pickup</b> <b>truck.</b> The Cd obtained for the case of extended bumper was slightly lower than of the original bumper height...|$|R

5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, <b>pickup</b> <b>trucks,</b> and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users are not aware they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, {{and even though the}} newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users are still not aware because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E
