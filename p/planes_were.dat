25|$|The {{frontal plane}} or coronal plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or {{posterior}} and anterior) portions. For post-embryonic humans a coronal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> vertical and a transverse <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> horizontal and a transverse <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> vertical. A longitudinal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> any <b>plane</b> {{perpendicular to the}} transverse plane. The coronal plane and the sagittal <b>plane</b> <b>are</b> examples of longitudinal planes.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1979, {{the number}} of Grønlandsfly {{passengers}} served annually exceeded 60,000, more than the population of Greenland. That year, the airline's first international route was also opened, running between Greenland's capital Nuuk {{and the town of}} Iqaluit in northern Canada. The route connected Greenland's Kalaallit with Canada's Inuit and was operated in conjunction with the Canadian First Air line, but the <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> generally run empty and the route was shuttered 13 years later.|$|E
5|$|Diving <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} only fitted at the stern, but additional <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> {{mounted on}} the conning tower during construction of B1, B2, and B3; B4 was not fitted with them and it is uncertain if the remaining boats received them during construction. These greatly improved the boats' depth-keeping, surfacing and diving abilities compared to the A-class boats. These were later exchanged for bow planes; the last boat to receive them was B6, which did not get hers until January 1916. The B-class submarines lacked any internal bulkheads which exposed the crew to the petrol engine's exhaust fumes. In fact mice were used to detect any concentrations of carbon monoxide inside the hull. Ventilation was provided for the batteries, but none for the crew's living area. No accommodations were provided for the crew and {{they were forced to}} improvise while at sea. In recognition of this issue, the crew's endurance was only expected to be four days during the summer and three days during the winter.|$|E
5|$|He {{established}} his own aeronautics manufacturing company, Longren Aircraft Corporation, which produced several models through the 1920s. The handcrafted Longren <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> well regarded by aviation professionals of the era. Longren created several innovations including {{the design for}} the first semi-monocoque airplane body.

5|$|It {{was created}} in the 1950s, to {{overcome}} the problems with supersonic planes taking off and landing on aircraft carriers. The program was canceled after a series of unsatisfactory results and a tragic accident on 4 November 1954, when test pilot Charles E.

5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 16:56:54 BRT at FL370, {{and it was}} confirmed that neither Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system had activated or alerted its respective crew, nor did any crew see the oncoming traffic visually or initiate any evasive action prior to the collision. While both <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's transponder had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Herbert Frederick Norman Appleroth, {{known as}} Bert Appleroth, was a tram {{conductor}} who created jelly crystals using gelatine {{and sugar in}} his bathtub. He sold these jelly crystals door-to-door, using his tram route to transport him around Sydney. In 1917, Appleroth rented premises to manufacture his jelly, then formed a company with Albert Francis Lenertz named Traders Pty Ltd in 1927. <b>Planes</b> <b>were</b> considered new and exciting at the time, so aviation fan Appleroth named the brand Aeroplane Jelly. Appleroth used a Tiger Moth plane to make deliveries to rural areas in 1934, and his publicity stunts and Aeroplane Jelly's advertising campaigns made the jelly a national icon, like Holden and Vegemite.|$|E

5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3. During {{the evaluation of}} the U-3 class conducted by the Navy, the class' poor diving and handling characteristics were noted. To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E

During his forty-seven years in the aviation industry, {{he was responsible for}} the design and development of nearly twenty commercial and military airplanes. Verville is known for designing flying boats, military racing airplanes (such as the record breaking Verville-Sperry R-3 Racer), and a series of commercial cabin airplanes. His <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> awarded with the Pulitzer Speed Classic Trophy in 1920 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|Both {{boats were}} {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1909, with U-4 commissioned in August and U-3 in September. During the evaluations {{conducted by the}} Navy, the U-3 design bested the U-1 (Lake) and U-5 (Holland) classes in reliability and provided the best living conditions. They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke. To remedy the diving problems of the U-3-class, the fins were changed in size and shape several times. Eventually the front diving <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull.|$|E

5|$|Hiryū began {{recovering}} her Midway strike {{force at}} around 09:00 and finished shortly by 09:10. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers' crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations were interrupted at 09:18, {{when the first}} attacking American carrier aircraft were sighted. These consisted of 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron from the Hornet. They attempted a torpedo attack on Soryū, {{but all of the}} American <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> shot down by the 18 CAP fighters, leaving one surviving aviator treading water.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Battleship Row and the island's naval field, the fixed moorings {{on the western}} side of Ford Island (capable of securing battleships or aircraft carriers) were high-priority targets. Just west of the island, the seaplane tender Curtiss was hit by a crashing dive bomber, a bomb and fragments of another bomb. She was then unsuccessfully attacked by a Japanese midget submarine, which fired a torpedo before being sunk by the destroyer Monaghan. Hangar 6 and several patrol seaplanes and other aircraft on Ford Island (33 out of 70 of the island's <b>planes)</b> <b>were</b> destroyed.|$|E
