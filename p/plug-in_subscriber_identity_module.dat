50|$|Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA), is an EAP {{mechanism}} for authentication and session key distribution using the UMTS <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Module</b> (USIM). EAP-AKA {{is defined in}} RFC 4187.|$|R
50|$|UMTS {{specifies}} {{a complete}} network system, {{which includes the}} radio access network (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network, or UTRAN), the core network (Mobile Application Part, or MAP) and the authentication of users via SIM (<b>subscriber</b> <b>identity</b> <b>module)</b> cards.|$|R
50|$|GSM {{cellular}} networks use a <b>subscriber</b> <b>identity</b> <b>module</b> card {{to carry}} out user authentication. EAP-SIM use a SIM authentication algorithm between the client and an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server providing mutual authentication between the client and the network.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely known {{digitally}} secure telecommunication device is the SIM (<b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Module)</b> card, a device that is embedded {{in most of the}} worldâ€™s cellular devices before any service can be obtained. The SIM card is just the beginning of this digitally secure environment.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the required improvement in the user profile, there is necessity for reliable and secure authentication system. In the first releases of IMS (before Release 7), the only authentication and key agreement (AKA) system which was specified by the 3 GPP was IMS-AKA. This is an authentication system based on USIM/ISIM approach. The UMTS <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Module</b> (USIM) and IMS <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Module</b> (ISIM) are found on the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) of 3 G devices [28]. USIM-based IMS-AKA and ISIM-based IMS-AKA authentication require the phone to be equipped with the operator UICC card (i.e., a 3 G SIM card) with USIM or ISIM capability. In the absence of UICC (because of hardware limitation), ISIM can be provided as a software module on end devices (PCs).|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Cellebrite {{announced}} {{a line of}} products it called 'Universal Forensic Extraction Device' (UFED), aimed at the digital forensics and investigation industry. The UFED system is a hand-held device with optional desktop software, data cables, adapters and other peripherals. The UFED additionally has an integrated <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Module</b> (SIM) reader.|$|R
50|$|Removable <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Modules</b> (SIMs) {{are used}} in Iridium phones, much like those used for GSM. Prepaid SIM cards are usually green while {{post-paid}} cards are red. The 9601 and 9602 SBD modems don't use a SIM card, they are identified by the network solely through the IMEI of the device and the customer account associated with that IMEI.|$|R

After activation the card is then programmed with the subscriber's Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number (MSISDN) (the telephone number). Personal information such as contact numbers {{of friends and family}} can also be stored on the SIM by the subscriber.|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of UMTS introduced an optional Universal <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Module</b> (USIM), {{that uses a}} longer authentication key to give greater security, as well as mutually authenticating the network and the user, whereas GSM only authenticates the user to the network (and not vice versa). The security model therefore offers confidentiality and authentication, but limited authorization capabilities, and no non-repudiation.|$|R
50|$|GSM {{consists}} of two components: the mobile radio telephone and <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Module.</b> GSM is a cellular network, which is a radio network {{made up of a}} number of cells. For each cell, the transmitter (known as a base station) is transmitting and receiving signals. The base station is controlled through the Base Station Controller via the Mobile Switching Centre.|$|R
30|$|The main {{assumption}} {{for this}} security architecture {{is a global}} collaboration of all mobile operators. <b>Subscriber</b> <b>identity</b> <b>module</b> (SIM)-based authentication schemes allow to provide cellular services to a mobile terminal independently of the network being roamed (assuming, of course, that the user has roaming activated and the phone and network are compatible). Encryption of the MIB and SIB messages would require a similar collaboration among carriers.|$|R
50|$|UMTS {{provides}} {{mutual authentication}} between the UMTS subscriber, {{represented by a}} smart card application known as the USIM (Universal <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Module),</b> and the network in the following sense 'Subscriber authentication': the serving network corroborates the <b>identity</b> of the <b>subscriber</b> and 'Network authentication': the subscriber corroborates that he is connected to a serving network that is authorised, by the subscribers home network, to provide him with services.|$|R

5000|$|A direct-to-mobile gateway is {{a device}} which has {{built-in}} wireless GSM connectivity. It allows SMS text messages {{to be sent}} and/or received by email, from Web pages or from other software applications by acquiring a unique identifier from the mobile phone's <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Module,</b> or [...] "SIM card". Direct-to-mobile gateways are different from SMS aggregators, because they are installed on an organization's own network and connect to a local mobile network.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Module</b> (SIM) is {{conventionally}} used in {{wireless communication}} systems. However, several limitations involving SIM significantly reduce public access in wireless communications. This {{study examined the}} feasibility of using public telephone cards in wireless communications. This novel application retains the merits of SIM. Among the relevent issues addressed are location tracking of the user, authentication of the phone card, and the billing scheme. Moreover, two implementations of phone card authentication are presented...|$|R
