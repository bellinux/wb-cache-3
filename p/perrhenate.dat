40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{immobilization}} of technetium- 99 (99 Tc) in {{a suitable}} host matrix {{has proven to}} be a challenging task for researchers in the nuclear waste community around the world. In this context, the present work reports on the solubility and retention of rhenium, a nonradioactive surrogate for 99 Tc, in a sodium borosilicate glass. Glasses containing target Re concentrations from 0 to 10 000 ppm [by mass, added as KReO 4 (Re 7 +) ] were synthesized in vacuumsealed quartz ampules to minimize the loss of Re from volatilization during melting at 1000 °C. The rhenium was found as Re 7 + in all of the glasses as observed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure. The solubility of Re in borosilicate glasses was determined to be ∼ 3000 ppm (by mass) using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. At higher rhenium concentrations, additional rhenium was retained in the glasses as crystalline inclusions of alkali <b>perrhenates</b> detected with X-ray diffraction. Since 99 Tc concentrations in a glass waste form are predicted to be < 10 ppm (by mass), these Re results implied that the solubility should not be a limiting factor in processing radioactive wastes, assuming Tc as Tc 7 + and similarities between Re 7 + and Tc 7 + behavior in this glass system. 1...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{wide range}} of uses of {{information}} related to rhenium's geochemical behavior. Field studies indicate that rhenium is highly enriched in reducing sediments. However the mechanisms by which this high degree of enrichment is achieved are unclear. <b>Perrhenate's</b> (ReO 4 -) sorption onto a clay mineral, kaolinite, was investigated and found to be weak. This behavior is consistent with rhenium's conservative behavior in the oceans. Sorption was enhanced by the presence of a reducing agent, lithium borohydride. The presence of sulfide, a reducing agent found in nature, enhanced sorption slightly. Sulfide apparently does not reduce ReO 4 - rapidly as shown by the failure of polysulfide species to appear in solution. Instead, sulfide causes the formation of thioperrhenates. The mechanism of thiolation is the successive replacement of oxygen atoms in ReO 4 - by sulfur atoms, but ReO 3 S- and ReS 4 - are the only thioperrhenates observed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The di- and tri- thioperrhenates, ReO 2 S 2 - and ReOS 3 - are absent due to their relative instability. Thiolation of ReO 4 - appears to be general-acid catalyzed. Quantitative yield of ReS 4 - from ReO 4 - was never achieved. Thioperrhenates undergo polymerization in solution to yield a colloidal Re-S species, probably related to Re 2 S 7, which contains polysulfide ions in its structure. This Re-S polymer is stable under different experimental conditions and thermodynamic calculations confirm that it is a very stable, insoluble species.

40|$|The system (Re 3 (m-Cl) 3 Cl 6 (1 -I)) / HCl (6 - 12 M) / Hg catalyses {{efficiently}} the chemically, industrially and biochemically important reaction Ο 2 + 4 Η+ + 4 e- ? 2 Η 2 Ο at {{ambient temperature}} and pressure. Cluster 1 -Ι has a polymeric structure in the solid state. However, upon dissolution in HCl 6 - 12 Μ the trianion [Re 3 (μ-Cl) 3 Cl 9] 3 - 1 -ΙΙα is generated, which can be phase-transferred into CH 2 Cl 2 by means of [(C 6 H 5) 4 P]Cl, and isolated as the dark red compound [(C 6 H 5) 4 P] 3 [ReIII 3 (m-Cl) 3 Cl 9] (5 -II). Anaerobic one-electron reduction of 1 -IIα by Hg in HCl (6 - 12 M), followed by addition of an aqueous solution of [(C 6 H 5) 4 P]Cl produces the purple, air-sensitive cluster [(C 6 H 5) 4 P] 2 [Re 3 (m-Cl) 3 Cl 7 (H 2 O) 2]·H 2 O (5 -III), which is the active form of the catalyst. Τhe structure of 5 -III features a planar [Re 3 (m-Cl) 3] framework containing the reduced Re 38 + core, involving two water ligands which occupy neighboring out of plane positions in a trans arrangement. Oxidation of 5 -III with O 2 in organic media (CH 2 Cl 2, CH 3 NO 2) results {{in the formation of}} the dark red complex [(C 6 H 5) 4 P] 4 [{Re 3 (m-Cl) 3 Cl 7 (m-OH) } 2]· 2 CH 2 Cl 2 (5 -IV). Structure of complex 5 -IV reveals that two oxygen ligands (hydroxo units) bridge asymmetrically two Re 39 + triangular clusters. Reduction of cluster 5 -II is also observed in methanolic solutions of HCl by Zn(Hg). Complexes 5 -II and 5 -III exhibit nitrile hydratase type activity, inducing hydrolysis of CH 3 CN to acetamide. In particular, the reaction of 5 -III with CH 3 CN yields [(C 6 H 5) 4 P] 2 [Re 3 (m-Cl) 3 Cl 6. 5 (CH 3 CN) 1. 5 (CH 3 C(O) NH) 0. 5] (5 -V), the structure of which is composed of [Re 3 (m-Cl) 3 Cl 7 (CH 3 CN) 2] 2 - (5 -Vα) and [Re 3 (m-Cl) 3 Cl 6 (CH 3 CN) (CH 3 C(O) NH) ] 2 - (5 -Vβ) as a disordered mixture (1 ? 1), both featuring the reduced Re 38 + core. The same species is also obtained at the early stages of the reduction of 5 -II with Zn in CH 3 CN, followed by dissociation of the triangular cluster upon prolonged reduction. Oxidation of 5 -V with O 2 in CH 3 CN affords [(C 6 H 5) 4 P] 2 [Re 3 (m-Cl) 3 Cl 7 (CH 3 CONH) ]·CH 3 CN (5 -VI) and small amounts of [(C 6 H 5) 4 P][ReO 4]. Compound 5 -VI is also independently isolated from the reaction of 5 -II with wet (3 % H 2 O) CH 3 CN. Furthermore, 5 -VI is obtained by dissolving 5 -IV in CH 3 CN (along with recovery of starting material). Cluster 5 -ΙΙ is easily reduced by pyridine in CH 2 Cl 2 solution and the product seems to retain the trinuclear core. Reaction of compound 5 -ΙΙΙ with pyridine and O 2 in CH 3 CN yields the octahedral complex trans-[Re(O) 2 (C 5 H 5 N) 4]Cl (5 -VIII). All isolated complexes have been characterised by analytical and spectroscopic methods (UV-VIS, IR, NMR, ESI-MS), and X-ray crystallography. The reactivity of the redox couple Re 38 + / Re 39 + towards oxidation of organic substrates (alcohols, alkenes, alkanes) has been studied. In organic solvents (CH 2 Cl 2) compound 5 -ΙΙ is an efficient catalyst precursor for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The reaction mixture with the catalytic system 5 -ΙΙ / C 6 H 5 IO is initially red, but for molar ratios 5 -ΙΙ ? C 6 H 5 IO > 1 ? 10 becomes light yellow and finally colourless, and complex [(C 6 H 5) 4 P][ReO 4] (6 -Ι) can be isolated. The catalytic system [(n-C 4 H 9) 4 N][ReO 4] (5 -VII) / C 6 H 5 IO is very efficient towards the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols (benzyl alcohol, substituted benzylic alcohols, benzhydrol) to the corresponding carbonyl compounds. This is the first example of oxidation induced by the <b>perrhenates</b> and has advantages compared to the well studied organometallic analogue [CH 3 ReO 3]. The system exhibits low reactivity towards olefin epoxidation, and more interestingly, has the ability to activate C-H bonds of hydrocarbons. ...|$|R
