50|$|Kistler studied {{sciences}} at the University of Geneva and earned a master's degree in physics from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. While subsequently head of the Instrumentation Lab at the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works, Winterthur, he pioneered a new measurement technology using <b>Piezo-electric</b> <b>quartz</b> crystals as the transduction element in accelerometers, load cells, and pressure gauges. This new technology {{was made possible by}} Kistler’s invention of a charge amplifier that could handle the very high impedance signals obtained from such sensors. For these achievements, he would in 1980 receive the prestigious Albert F. Sperry Award from the Instrument Society of America (ISA).|$|E
40|$|The {{distance}} between tip and sample can be regulated using piezoelectric quartz fork glued with micro optic fiber probe. A biquadrate vibration equation for the fork–probe–sample system is established to theoretically analyze {{the relations of}} the electric current flow through fork versus tip–sample (T–S) distance (I–d). The I–d curve and the action distance for shear force are influenced by environmental humidity. The results reinforce the opinions in the earlier works by other researches that the physical origin of the shear force {{is due to a}} material filling the tip–sample gap. Furthermore, the intrinsic reasons for shear force damping between tip and sample have been confirmed and developed, i. e. the water and hydrocarbon coupled between optic fiber probe and sample due to the capillary cohesion force.

2500|$|In 1917 and 1918, Pegram [...] {{served on}} a {{committee}} established by the National Research Council headed by the President of Columbia University, Nicholas Murray Butler, with Michael I. Pupin as its secretary, that created a <b>quartz</b> <b>piezo-electric</b> sound detector for locating submerged submarines. The device worked, and the Naval Experimental Station at New London, Connecticut, took over its development in September 1918. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Duke University in 1918.|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of operation of force sensors {{most commonly used}} in machining processes and the trends of this technology arepresented in this paper. Force sensors are needed because measuring cutting forces during machining processes is the mostimportant and basic step to determine and control {{the conditions under which}} the machine, the tool, and the workpiece are performing. In the majority of applications the measurement of cutting forces during machining is done using dynamometers basedon either strain gages or <b>piezo-electric</b> transducer with <b>quartz</b> sensors. Recently, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) arebeing designed and constructed using polysilicon beam resonators to measure forces. These sensors relate the force that is beingmeasured to the frequency of vibration of the resonator. In recent research projects and studies, {{there is a tendency to}} transferthe force sensor signals by wireless technology...|$|R
40|$|Multiphase {{process design}} and {{optimization}} often {{depends upon the}} rheological properties of sludges and slurries. In practice the task of determining these important properties is usually carried out by removing small samples from a process line or process unit and performing tests with proprietary bench-top analysers near to site or at a remote laboratory. Sampling will remain an important procedure in industrial processes, {{but there is also}} a strong case for augmenting the routine information obtained using an in situ sensor, as suggested below. Sampling protocols can result in extensive turnaround periods from sample collection to the generation of results. The delay can have an effect on a variety of factors such as product quality, process operability and efficiency. Sampling of toxic or radioactive material can prove an even greater challenge to minimize human involvement. Removal often changes the rheology of a specimen, and might lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn about the condition of a sludge. Sludge and slurry in a containment suffers a gravitational gradient, so that a removed sample should be paired with its location, particularly in the vertical dimension. Sludge or slurry removed from a duct or from siphoning tubes suffers a velocity gradient such that lighter fractions are preferentially represented in the sample, causing an underestimate of coarser particles. Many more data points can be collected by a remote instrument, improving the sampling statistics of the measurement. This paper presents results of an investigation using a small <b>piezo-electric</b> driven AT-cut <b>quartz</b> crystal to measure changes in suspension stability. Mono-dispersed silica suspensions were prepared in several different chemical environments, with the conditions chosen from examination of the zeta potential and sedimentation data. The study shows that by varying the suspension stability, the resonating frequency of a 5 MHz AT-cut quartz silica crystal significantly deviates as the amplitude of oscillation is increased for a coagulated suspension, while remaining unchanged for a dispersed suspension...|$|R
