40|$|The white-clawed {{crayfish}}, Austropotamobius pallipes (Lereboullet), is {{the only}} crayfish species found in Ireland. Because of the <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>importation</b> of exotic species of crayfish onto the island and of its relatively clean rivers up to now, Ireland has kept an abundant population of crayfish. A survey was conducted in the catchments of the Liffey and Boyne rivers, in eastern Ireland to assess water quality and to sample crayfish populations. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the water quality requirements of the white-clawed crayfish in Ireland. Baited traps and nets were used to sample crayfish while water quality was measured with biological indices calculated from samples of macroinvertebrates. Distribution of this crayfish species is patchy in the Liffey catchment and seems to be related to factors such as soil types and water quality. They were not found in the downstream part of the river Liffey possibly due to poor water quality. In the Boyne catchment, no crayfish were found in most of the catchment. They were only present in the Kells Blackwater subcatchment. This may be due to an earlier outbreak of the fungal plague caused by Aphanomyces astaci. The disease was discovered in lakes at the top of some of the tributaries of the Boyne in 1987 and it probably spread from there through the whole catchment...|$|E

50|$|Because of this, {{slavery in}} the early colonial period {{differed}} greatly in the American colonies from that in the Caribbean. Often Caribbean slaves were worked literally to death on large sugar and rice plantations, while the American slave population had a higher life expectancy and was maintained through natural reproduction.

5000|$|In 1947, {{when the}} decree {{by which the}} Spanish Government granted Vigo the right to {{establish}} the third Free Trade Zone in Spain (after Barcelona and Cadiz) {{was published in the}} State Official Gazette, this news was welcomed with great enthusiasm by local authorities and business organisations, who rightly realised that the advantages this offered in comparison to other cities would drive the economic growth of Vigo. [...] As Francisco López Peña, State Representative on two separate occasions, explained to University of Vigo students, “When the Free Trade Zone was created, Spain was still in a state of complete self-sufficiency with a completely closed economy. The <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>importations</b> had been a huge mistake. Indeed, instead of protecting the country's industry, it resulted in industrial processes being more expensive and effectively prevented the economy from becoming specialised and competitive. However, the Free Trade Zone, allowed companies to be established that took full advantage of the availability of cheap imports and the possibilities for exports. It was a highly significant step for the city, a comparative advantage that permitted the city’s economic expansion”.|$|R

50|$|The fifth {{phase of}} {{migration}} history, {{beginning in the}} late 1990s and 2000s, saw the number of students increase. The influx of students coincided with a more relaxed visa policy of the Bureau of Immigration (BI) aimed at attracting foreign students. It was also marked by growing influence and engagement by the various Korean associations with mainstream Philippine society. For example, the Merchant Association, formed in July 2001 and renamed as the Financial Expert Union Association in 2002, helped to regularise the status of South Korean entrepreneurs who had been working without a proper visa, while the South Korean Used Automobile Import Association fought against a newly introduced <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> the <b>importation</b> of used cars, and the Travel Company Association worked with the Philippine Department of Tourism to resolve visa and licensing issues for South Korean tour guides who hoped to work in the Philippines.|$|R
2500|$|In 1986 {{the embargo}} {{was found to}} be in {{violation}} of international law by the International Court of Justice. The court's ruling states that the embargo was [...] "in breach of obligations under Article XIX of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the Parties signed at Managua on 21 January 1956". This Treaty states that [...] "neither party shall impose restrictions or <b>prohibitions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>importation</b> of any product of the other party, or on the exportation of any product to the territories of the other party." [...] Further, by laying mines in Nicaraguan waters to enforce the embargo, the United States of America also violated [...] "its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State". The United States was therefore obligated [...] "to cease and to refrain from all such acts" [...] and pay an unspecified amount in reparations to Nicaragua. However, the United States continued the embargo nearly 4 years after the ruling, and did not pay reparations.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2006, an Australian news company {{reported}} that Vegemite had been {{banned in the}} United States, and that the United States Customs Service had {{gone so far as}} to search Australians entering the country for Vegemite because it naturally contains folate, a Bvitamin approved as an additive in the United States for just a few foods, including breakfast cereals.

50|$|In {{those times}} such stores {{operated}} as both retail and production outlets. The coffee, sold among {{thousands of other}} products, was bought raw, and then roasted and blended according to very personal recipes depending on the customers' requests. This activity soon attracted the interest of Luigi Lavazza, who had already demonstrated considerable knowledge and skills in the processing of blends, including both the quantities of the ingredients {{and the degree of}} roasting. The firm's expansion from retailing to wholesale trade (1910), the joining of Luigi's three sons Mario, Beppe and Pericle (during the First World War), and the progressive narrowing of the production range marked the first steps of an irresistible commercial growth, which enabled the Firm to acquire a notable position at regional level. The little grocery store became in 1927 the modern Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. that, after the forced stop caused by the League of Nations' economic sanctions, by the <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> the <b>importation</b> of coffee, and by the outbreak of the Second World War, finally came to specialize in the production of coffee. The first Lavazza logo was then created and the annual production reached 1,000 tons.|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "American consumers are increasingly drawn to the convenience, privacy, and cost advantages that might be accrued by purchasing prescription drugs over the Internet. However, there is growing concern {{about the safety of}} the drugs and the lawfulness of shipping the drugs into the United States through international mail and private carriers. Under current law, the importation of prescription drugs for personal use is illegal, with few exceptions. All prescription drugs offered for import must meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and those that are controlled substances also must meet the requirements of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. According to the agencies responsible for enforcing these laws, prescription drugs imported for personal use generally do not meet these requirements. The Department of Homeland Security's U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Health and Human Service's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are responsible for inspecting and interdicting unapproved prescription drugs that are being illegally imported via the U. S. mail or private carrier.
