The key benefit is the relatively simple processing, compared to multiple exposures or multiple depositions and etching. The main drawback of this technique is the relatively limited range of feature sizes and duty cycles for a given process formulation. Typical applications have been regular lines and spaces as well as arrays of closely packed holes or cylinders. However, random, aperiodic patterns may also be generated using carefully defined guiding patterns.|$|E

The elements of music speech and their connections are learned in special sequence from less probable to more probable. The more often an element appears in classical and modern music, as well as appropriate styles of folklore, the more probable it is. The program presupposes lessons held weekly or twice a week. The program is tested in one-on-one lessons, in groups with 3 - 8 children, as well as larger groups. The paper describes the following forms of work: learning probable rhythmic elements and <b>patterns</b> <b>by</b> <b>means</b> of special form of “rhythmic solmization”; learning probable melodic elements and <b>patterns</b> <b>by</b> <b>means</b> of a special form of sol-fa, including a combination of movable tonic and the fixed Do, as well as a special approach to associations between degrees of the relative scale and the 12 colours of the spectrum; learning probable harmonic elements and <b>patterns</b> <b>by</b> <b>means</b> of special form of sol-fa. This method is illustrated with graphic examples (music) and video fragments from lessons. As a main result: A subconscious reaction by the children when hearing the described elements of musical speech in the process of listening to classical and modern music and high attention and interest on hearing.

40|$|Substrates {{for organic}} {{light-emitting}} diodes currently are <b>patterned</b> <b>by</b> <b>means</b> of photolithography. In {{order to achieve}} a large market penetration in a segment like lighting, the cost issue of the complete fabrication chain is the major key for commercialisation. In the field of OLED signage and lighting alternative patterning technologies {{have the potential for}} considerable cost saving compared to standard photolithography. This is realized with much less requirements for the patterning resolution of the OLED substrate layers. Fraunhofer IPMS uses a screen printing process for OLED substrate patterning. Base is an ITO coated glass substrate (370 x 470 mm 2). The ITO is <b>patterned</b> <b>by</b> printing an ITO etch paste which is activated under nitrogen atmosphere at 150 °C. After cleaning (removing the residual etch paste) only the patterned ITO layer remains on the glass. In a second step contact lines and a metal grid are printed upon the anode to compensate the insufficient sheet resistance of the ITO layer. Finally a passivation layer for isolating the metallisation grid is added to prevent short-circuits to the cathode or organic thin film layers. With this method, the manufactured OLEDs on screen printed substrates reach performance parameters comparable to substrates <b>patterned</b> <b>by</b> <b>means</b> of photolithography. As an alternative to printing an ITO etch paste Fraunhofer IPMS recently investigated patterning the ITO layer <b>by</b> <b>means</b> of laser ablation. This allows further enhancement of the patterning process, additionally simplifies the cleaning process after ITO patterning, and minimizes the number of ITO defects...|$|R
