60|$|By {{the time}} that he had arrived abreast of the shepherd's {{premises}} the rain came down, or rather came along, with yet more determined violence. The outskirts of the little settlement partially broke the force of wind and rain, and this induced him to stand still. The most salient of the shepherd's domestic erections was an empty sty at the forward corner of his hedgeless garden, for in these latitudes the principle of masking the homelier features of your establishment by a conventional frontage was unknown. The traveller's eye was attracted to this small building by the pallid shine of the wet slates that covered it. He turned aside, and, finding it empty, stood under the <b>pent-roof</b> for shelter.|$|E
25|$|It is a five-bay two-and-a-half-story clapboard-sided {{structure}} with Gothic detailing and a molded cornice and plain frieze at the roofline. The wooden-shingled roof, pierced by brick chimneys at either end, is cross-gabled by a two-story rear wing projecting {{from the south}} side, itself with a one-story <b>pent-roofed</b> bay on its own west.|$|R
25|$|The west facade has a {{basement}} entrance and tripartite window, again with diamond-paned colored glass, on the apse flanked by pointed {{windows on the}} <b>pent-roofed</b> sides, with another octagonal oculus in the rear gable field above where the apse projects. Below the apse the basement is mortared fieldstone. Windows, a main entrance and a secondary entrance {{on the south side}} are trabeated with brick.|$|R
25|$|Later {{that year}} another new {{architectural}} style {{was introduced to}} the district. A new commercial building at 201–203 Main Street used the Spanish Colonial Revival, with a tiled <b>pent-roofed</b> parapet and stucco face. Down the street at 125 Main, a 1920 building is the district's only example of a yellow brick building with limestone trim, {{in the form of a}} stone cornice topped with a parapet.|$|R

50|$|Two pavilions {{project from}} the main block, {{separated}} by a gable-roofed dormer and a <b>pent-roofed</b> dormer on the second story. The south side has a one-and-a-half-story gambrel-roofed wing, {{and there is a}} two-story gabled wing on the east side. A one-story hip-roofed porch is located on the north, and the east wing has a one-story addition that extends around its southern and eastern sides.|$|R
50|$|The {{photograph}} of the band on the front cover was taken on Cathcart Road in Glasgow. The building {{on the right of}} the picture was the Hermon Baptist Church, a single-storey <b>pent-roofed</b> structure built on {{to the end of a}} block of tenement houses. At some point the tenements were demolished and the church stood in isolation for some years until it was destroyed by fire in 2001, and subsequently demolished.|$|R
50|$|Its {{cylinders}} {{are numbered}} 1-2-3-4, cylinder number 1 is beside the timing belt. The Dual Over Head Cam (DOHC) 16-valve cylinder head designed by Yamaha {{is made of}} aluminum alloy. The <b>pent-roof</b> combustion chambers are complemented by a cross flow intake and exhaust layout. Spark plugs {{are located in the}} middle of the combustion chambers. A distributor based system is used to fire the cylinders in a 1-3-4-2 order.|$|E
50|$|The EJ series {{engine was}} offered. in both 1.8 and 2.0 liter displacements. The engine has either single or double {{overhead}} camshaft architecture and <b>pent-roof,</b> cross flow cylinder firing chambers. The 2.0 liter fuel delivery was managed with sequential multiport fuel injection, and the 1.8 liter engine used a modified fuel delivery system with single point throttle body fuel injection called SPFI. The DOHC 2.0 liter non turbocharged engine had a dual stage intake manifold.|$|E
50|$|The fourth {{generation}} TMAX had a redesigned body and powertrain. Cylinders were bored-out by 2 mm, increasing displacement to 530cc. Other engine modifications included a newly designed <b>pent-roof</b> combustion chamber and a reworking {{of the fuel}} injection. The continuously variable transmission and final drive system were redesigned; the previous chain drive enclosed in an oil-bath (attached {{to one side of}} the swingarm) was replaced by a belt drive with a separate die-cast aluminum swingarm.|$|E
50|$|At {{the rear}} of the building, there is a 3-storey 3-bay <b>pent-roofed</b> {{extension}} which houses a square clock tower. The tower itself is crowned with an ogee roofed open cupola and timber columns. The schoolroom block of the main building is 2 storeys tall and has a 3 bay front. The windows are once again 12 pane sashes with differences in size and moulding {{between the first and second}} floors. All the windows have flat arches of rubbed brick.|$|R
25|$|St. Luke's is a one-and-half-story {{asymmetrical}} cruciform building {{faced in}} Schenectady bluestone in an ashlar pattern with Ohio sandstone trim. It is {{over a hundred}} feet (30 m) in length and 60 feet (20 m) wide. Two porches extend from the south profile, a main entrance {{in the middle of}} the nave and a secondary one in the transept. There is another porch, <b>pent-roofed,</b> on the north transept. An organ and robing room is attached to the north side of the chancel.|$|R
50|$|On {{the north}} {{elevation}} the frieze and cornice {{at the top}} of the stone wall continue around the corner and terminate in returns. The basement window on that side shows the signs of having once been an entrance. The west (rear) has a centrally located door and three windows, with the southernmost having an unusually large lintel. At the roof is a shed dormer with five windows. The two-bay frame wing has a small <b>pent-roofed</b> porch over the door on its rear elevation.|$|R
5000|$|... 1994: [...] Updates to the {{ignition}} timing due to {{adoption of the}} <b>pent-roof</b> combustion chamber design, the internal structure of the muffler, and {{the shape of the}} cam chain links for reduced mechanical noise. The engine mount location was updated for improved handling. A new instrument cluster appeared with the analogue fuel gauge moved to a central location from previously within the tachometer face, a row of indicator LEDs below the clocks, and a hazard light switch. Weight increased by 1 kg.|$|E
50|$|The Toyota 3S-GE (originally titled 3S-GELU in transversely-mounted {{applications}} with Japanese emission controls), is an in-line 4 cylinder {{engine in}} the S engine family, manufactured by Toyota and designed {{in conjunction with}} Yamaha. While the block is iron, the cylinder head is made of aluminium alloy. The <b>pent-roof</b> combustion chambers are complemented by a cross-flow intake and exhaust layout. The spark plug {{is located in the}} center of the combustion chamber. The firing order is 1-3-4-2, with cylinder number 1 adjacent to the timing belt. The 3S-GE was designed to be light, the first iteration 3S-GELU weighing in at a low 143 kg.|$|E
5000|$|Gallop {{joined the}} team as an engine {{designer}} developing the [...] straight-4 engine. Although large for its day compared to similar engines from Bugatti, it was its technical innovations that were most noticed. One of the first production engines with 4 valves per cylinder, these were driven by an overhead camshaft. It was also among the first with two spark plugs per cylinder, <b>pent-roof</b> combustion chambers, and twin carburetors. It was extremely undersquare, optimized for low-end torque, with a bore of 80 mm and a stroke of 149 mm. To increase durability, the iron engine block and cylinder head were cast as a single unit.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Denniston House, 6 Delavan Terrace. This three-bay two-and-a-half-story cross-gabled Tudor Revival house {{dates to}} 1911. It too has a {{recessed}} <b>pent-roofed</b> entrance porch with four-pointed arch on the architrave, flanked by sidelights. Above it is a projecting gabled pavilion supported by consoles with pendants and diamond-paned casement windows. Elsewhere on the facades are bay windows and half-timbering in the gable ends, per the style. The side porch {{is supported by}} Tuscan columns; the rear porch has an open deck.|$|R

5000|$|The SRT-4 {{performance}} variant utilized a 2.4L Turbo. The turbocharged EDV/EDT {{is similar}} to the regular EDZ. Output is [...] SAE (172 kW) at 5300 rpm with 260 lb·ft (339 N·m) of torque at 2200-4400 rpm. This engine, code A855, has a cast iron partially open deck block and split crankcase. It uses an 8.1:1 compression ratio with Mahle cast eutectic aluminum alloy pistons, forged connecting rods with cracked caps and threaded-in 9 mm rod bolts, and a cast high-hardness steel crankshaft. The cylinder head is cast aluminum, with the cylinder heads being a 48-degree <b>pent-roof</b> design with a partial cloverleaf between the intake valves. The valves are actuated by hydraulically adjusted rocker arms with roller cam followers.|$|E
50|$|Bentley used {{multi-valve}} engines {{from the}} beginning. The Bentley 3 Litre, introduced in 1921, used a monobloc straight-4 with aluminium pistons, <b>pent-roof</b> combustion chambers, twin spark ignition, SOHC, and four valves per cylinder. It produced appr. 70 bhp (0.38 bhp per cubic inch). The 1927 Bentley 4½ Litre was of similar engine design. The NA racing model offered 130 bhp (0.48 bhp per cubic inch) and the 1929 supercharged 4½ Litre (Blower Bentley) reached 240 bhp (0.89 bhp per cubic inch). The 1926 Bentley 6½ Litre added two cylinders to the monobloc straight-4. This multi-valve straight-6 offered 180-200 bhp (0.45-0.50 bhp per cubic inch). The 1930 Bentley 8 Litre multi-valve straight-6 produced appr. 220 bhp (0.45 bhp per cubic inch).|$|E
50|$|It is a one-and-a-half-story, three-bay structure, {{rectangular}} with a one-story frame addition on {{the west}} (rear) facade. The main block is sided in fieldstone. On all but the east (front) side it is not laid in any approximation of a pattern. On the east, there are large blocks approximating quoins on the corners and the stones are laid in an approximation of courses. It is topped by a flush gable roof, shingled in cedar shake with simple cornice pierced by two <b>pent-roofed</b> dormer windows and a single stone chimney.|$|R
50|$|The {{north side}} is faced entirely in stone. It has two {{windows in the}} center of each story, both six-over-six double-hung sash.

50|$|Most of Dale's churches {{share common}} features: a {{tympanum}} with bas-reliefs over the main door, pantiled roofs, an Italianate <b>pent-roofed</b> chimney for the boiler {{and in some}} cases a baldachin over the main altar and a pantiled bell-cot on the west gable. With the exception of St. Francis of Assisi (which is stuccoed) they are built of a modern buff brick that contrasts with traditional building materials in this part of England. The tympanum at St. Alban the Martyr was carved by John Brookes, then Principal of Oxford City Technical College. St. Francis' has also a set of Stations of the Cross carved by Eric Gill.|$|R
50|$|The {{key feature}} of the GSX engine was the change from the common two-valve per {{cylinder}} hemispherical combustion chamber with domed piston design of the GS engine, to a four-valve per cylinder Twin Swirl Combustion Chamber (TSCC) with flat topped piston design. The TSCC design was essentially a modification of the <b>Pent-roof</b> combustion chamber design to which was added a slightly raised ridge running along the combustion chamber roof parallel to the gas flow of the inlet charge. This was to encourage controlled swirl of the incoming fuel-air charge {{in order to increase}} the fuel burn speed through better flame front propagation. The higher burn speed, coupled with lowered heat loss from the shallower combustion chambers created by comparatively narrow included valve angles and the flat topped piston meant that the GSX engines produced more power and torque than the same sized GS mills.|$|E

5000|$|The 6G73 is a 24-valve SOHC {{design with}} two valves running off a single cam lobe on the exhaust valves using a forked rocker arm and each intake valve {{actuated}} with two cam lobes, {{with a smaller}} bore than the 3.0 liter {{version of the same}} block. Bore and stroke are 83.5 x 76 mm; it is a 60-degree V6 and weighs around 155 kg. The engine has low-profile cast aluminum heads which help it to fit into compact engine bays, while <b>pent-roof</b> combustion chambers increase efficiency and make room for four valves per cylinder, arranged in a cross-flow pattern with a [...] "tumble" [...] intake port for both strong breathing and low emissions. Spark plugs are centered in the combustion chambers. The intake valves are 33 mm in diameter while exhaust valves are 29 mm. It also {{should be noted that the}} SOHC 24 valve version of the 6g72 uses these same cylinder heads. A toothed timing belt is used. The output of 6G73 is 161 hp (122 kW; 163 PS) at 5,900 rpm with 221 Nm (163 lb-ft) of torque at 4,350 rpm.|$|E
60|$|Burnamy got {{his charges}} with {{difficulty}} by the shrines {{in which they}} felt the far-reflected charm of the crucifixes of the white-hot Italian highways of their early travel, and by the toyshops where they had a mechanical, out-dated impulse to get something for the children, ending in a pang {{for the fact that}} they were children no longer. He waited politely while Mrs. March made up her mind that she would not buy any laces of the motherly old women who showed them under <b>pent-roofs</b> on way-side tables; and he waited patiently at the gate of the flower-gardens beyond the shops where March bought lavishly of sweetpease from the businesslike flower-woman, and feigned a grateful joy in her because she knew no English, and gave him a chance of speaking his German.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{itself is a}} two-and-a-half-story rectangular structure sided with clapboard and topped with a wood-shingled hipped roof gabled on the north (front) elevation. That two-bay facade has a full-length shed-roofed porch {{on the ground floor}} with turned posts, balustrade and a spindled frieze. At the northeast corner is a square-shaped two-story projecting bay topped with a gabled dormer window. On the east facade the porch roof is continued with a belt course of dark wood shingles, flared slightly and set off with molded surrounds. Near {{the south end of the}} facade on the first story is another slight projecting bay with a hipped roof. Its two windows are one-over-one double-hung sash, like all those on the house. There is a single window above. On the rear the shingled course ends in a steeply pitched <b>pent-roofed</b> porch with similar treatment to the front.|$|R
50|$|In 1914, {{the bank}} {{buildings}} would be complemented by the village's own new municipal building. The stone edifice at 16-20 Croton Avenue, {{the northern end}} of the district, was in the Classical Revival mode common for most governmental buildings of the era. The upper floors were initially used as a school. It is the only Westchester building by Donn Barber, designer of the Connecticut State Library and the first American admitted to the French Society of Beaux-Arts architects.Later that year another new architectural style was introduced to the district. A new commercial building at 201-203 Main Street used the Spanish Colonial Revival, with a tiled <b>pent-roofed</b> parapet and stucco face. Down the street at 125 Main, a 1920 building is the district's only example of a yellow brick building with limestone trim, {{in the form of a}} stone cornice topped with a parapet.|$|R
