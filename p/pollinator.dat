5|$|As {{with many}} other Ficus species, the {{community}} of wasps inside the figs of F. rubiginosa is made up mostly of <b>pollinator</b> wasps. These develop deep inside the syconium, presumably protected there from parasites. Also present are much smaller numbers of other wasp species, which do not pollinate the fig. At least fourteen species have been recorded, of which four—two each belonging to the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis—are common while others are rare. Investigation of F. rubiginosa syconia found that the fig seeds and parasitic wasps develop closer {{to the wall of}} the syconium. The wasps of the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis are parasitic and are around {{the same size as the}} <b>pollinator</b> species. Their larvae are thought to feed on the larvae of the <b>pollinator</b> wasp. Male Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis wasps fight other males of the same species when they encounter each other in a F. rubiginosa fig. Several genera of uncommon larger wasp species enter the immature figs before other wasps and induce galls, which may impact on numbers of <b>pollinator</b> wasps in the fig later. An example of this is Pseudidarnes minerva, a metallic green wasp species.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Floral {{visitors}} vary {{in their}} pollination effi-ciency and their preferences for floral traits. If low-efficiency <b>pollinators</b> decrease the amount of pollen available to higher efficiency visitors, then low-efficiency visitors may actually have negative fitness consequences for the plants that they visit. We used experimental arrays in two populations to determine the floral preferences and the fitness effects of low-efficiency (or “ugly”) <b>pollinators</b> on Campanula americana. These ugly <b>pollinators</b> (halictid bees) preferentially visited flowers with pollen over flowers that had had their pollen removed. C. americana pollen color varies quantitatively from light tan to dark purple, {{and we found that}} natural variation in pollen color influenced the magnitude of halictid preferences for flowers with pollen. In general, preferences for flowers with pollen were stronger when the ugly <b>pollinators</b> foraged in arrays of flowers with tan-colored pollen than in arrays with purple-colored pollen. When plants received few visits by efficient Bombus <b>pollinators,</b> visits by ugly <b>pollinators</b> significantly decreased siring success relative to plants where visits by ugly <b>pollinators</b> were prevented. In contrast, ugly <b>pollinators</b> did not influence siring success when higher efficiency <b>pollinators</b> were more abundant. Thus, the relationship between low-efficiency <b>pollinators</b> and the plants that they visit varies from commensalistic to antagonistic depending on the presence of other <b>pollinators</b> in the community. Our findings suggest that the negative fitness effects and floral preferences of low-efficiency or “ugly ” <b>pollinators</b> may contribute to the maintenance of a pollen color polymor-phism in C. americana...|$|R

40|$|Animal <b>pollinators</b> {{have driven}} the {{diversification}} of plants {{on the earth}} for more than 100 million years. The mutualism between plants and their <b>pollinators</b> rests on an exchange: food for <b>pollinators</b> and efficient vectoring of sexual reproduction for plants.

Competition between <b>pollinators</b> for access to nectar and pollen, and among flowering plants for the attention of <b>pollinators,</b> has influenced the shape, colour, and scent of flowers {{and the extent to which}} plants invest in the production of pollen and nectar.

40|$|Measuring {{the agents}} of natural {{selection}} {{is important because it}} allows us to understand not only which traits are expected to evolve but also why they will evolve. Natural selection by <b>pollinators</b> on floral traits is often assumed because in outcrossing animal-pollinated plants flowers are generally thought to function as advertisements of rewards directed at <b>pollinators.</b> We tested the role of bee <b>pollinators</b> in selection on Penstemon digitalis and found that <b>pollinators</b> were driving selection for larger and more flowers. However, what makes our publication unique is the additional information we gained from reviewing the few other studies that also directly tested whether <b>pollinators</b> were agents of selection on floral traits. As we would expect if <b>pollinators</b> are important agents of selection, selection on floral traits was significantly stronger when <b>pollinators</b> were present than when their choices were experimentally removed.

40|$|Abstract: Pollination is {{the process}} of {{transferring}} pollens to the stigma of conspecific plant and pollination ecology is the mutual relationship between flowers and <b>pollinators.</b> Pollination is a co-evolutionary process between flowering plants and <b>pollinators,</b> which dates back to millions of years. Insects are the most effective <b>pollinators</b> and have important role in pollination ecology. This review deals with different aspects of pollination ecology with special reference to insects. The effect and relationship of different characteristics of flowers, insect <b>pollinators</b> and environmental factors are discussed. <b>Pollinators</b> are greatly influenced by shape, length, colour, odour, nectar, pollen and other rewards of flowers. Effectiveness of pollination also depends upon vision, olfaction, taste, anatomy, food preference, behaviour and learning ability of the <b>pollinators.</b> Physical factors, i. e. altitude, temperature, light, wind and rainfall also influence the flower visiting, foraging behaviour and effectiveness of <b>pollinators...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{field study}} in Brisbane found that F. rubiginosa trees often bore {{both male and}} female phase syconia at the same time, which could be {{beneficial}} for reproduction in isolated populations. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp <b>pollinator</b> tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species. F. rubiginosa itself can endure cooler climates than other members of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Bees play an {{important}} role in pollinating flowering plants, and are the major type of <b>pollinator</b> in many ecosystems that contain flowering plants. It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by insects, birds and bats, most of which is accomplished by bees, whether wild or domesticated.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, a {{plant species}} {{may only be}} {{effectively}} pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are endangered {{at least in part}} because their <b>pollinator</b> is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the creosote bush in the arid parts of the United States southwest, for example.|$|E

Some crops, e. g. oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), are pollinated by {{a broad range}} of insects such as by honeybees, wild bees, and hoverflies. According to experimental studies, oilseeds rape production can be increased by 10 - 50 % by insect pollination, however these results are often obtained by comparison between presence-absence of <b>pollinators</b> not with <b>pollinators</b> gradients. Moreover, no study has investigated the effect of <b>pollinators</b> on the oil’s fatty acid composition while rapeseed is cultivated for oil. Here, we quantified the contribution of insect pollination on rapeseed production in terms of yield and oil quality in real farmers’ fields. We selected 352 rapeseeds plants into 73 fields in 3 consecutive years along a gradient of landscape to investigated effect of <b>pollinators</b> on yield and oil seed composition. In addition, 93 fields are followed by farmer’s survey to confirm effect of <b>pollinators</b> at field level. On each plant, we quantified total seed mass and oil composition on one control branch and one branch where <b>pollinators</b> were excluded using bags. Comparison between these two branch permit to estimate insect contribution. Abundance and richness of <b>pollinator’s</b> species in landscape are quantified by pan-traps. We show insect contribution to yield is to 27 % and increase with <b>pollinators</b> richness whatever at the plant or field level. <b>Pollinator’s</b> richness also increases quality of the production by decreasing saturated acid in oil.

40|$|Using an {{experimental}} approach, this study addresses {{the following two}} questions for the perennial herb Paeonia broteroi (Paeoniaceae) at a location in southeastern Spain. (1) What are the relative magnitudes {{of the effects of}} <b>pollinators</b> and herbivores (invertebrates and vertebrates feeding on flowers and developing fruits) on maternal fe- cundity (total seed production per plant) ? (2) Are the effects of <b>pollinators</b> and herbivores on fecundity additive, or is there some significant interaction between them? A two-factor (‘‘Pollinators’’ and ‘‘Herbivores,’’ each with two levels, ‘‘present’’ and ‘‘excluded’’) ex- perimental design was used, with individual plants being treated as experimental units and maternal fecundity as the response variable. On average, the effects of <b>pollinators</b> and herbivores were of opposite sign and roughly similar absolute magnitude (— 7. 5 seeds per plant), thus approximately canceling each other. A significant interaction (non-additivity) between factors did exist, with plants exposed to <b>pollinators</b> experiencing a disproportion- ately higher incidence of herbivores than those from which <b>pollinators</b> had been excluded. This was mainly due to mammals browsing only on the larger fruits from flowers that had been exposed to <b>pollinators.</b> Only in the absence of herbivores did <b>pollinators</b> account for a significant amount of between-plant variance in maternal fecundity. It is concluded that the interaction between <b>pollinators</b> and herbivores will lead to variable, herbivore-dependent ‘‘opportunity for selection’’ (sensu Arnold and Wade 1984) on P. broteroi by its <b>pollinators.</b> Regional variation in herbivore incidence experienced by P. broteroi populations will pre- sumably generate local variation in the degree of adaptedness of the plant to its <b>pollinators.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Mutualism, or a {{mutually}} beneficial interaction between two organisms, are ubiquitous in ecological systems. However, some “empty flowers”, which offer <b>pollinators</b> no any kinds of rewards, design different strategies to attract <b>pollinators</b> without providing rewards to the <b>pollinators.</b> These pollination mechanisms are called deceptive pollination. The family Orchidaceae, representing {{one of the}} largest groups in angiosperms, is distinguished by high floral diversity and intricate adaptations to <b>pollinators.</b> Darwin described and identified most of the functional floral morphology and biomechanics in orchid pollination. However, henever recognized that many of the flowers that he examined lacked food rewards for <b>pollinators.</b> Floral evolution in the Orchidaceae appears to be dominated by modes of deceptive pollination, and more than one third of orchid species are thought to be pollinated by deceit. Deceptive pollination is thought to be one of key roles which has lead to relatively high species diversity within the Orchidaceae. Deceptive orchids frequently exploit the food foraging, sexual, oviposition and sleep/warmth behaviors of insects. The most common deception mechanisms include generalized food deception, Batesian floral mimicry, sexual deception, brood-site imitation and shelter imitation. Additionally, floral color, morphology and fragrance play key roles to cheat target <b>pollinators.</b> Relationships between deceptive orchids and their <b>pollinators</b> possibly involveasynchronous evolution; therefore orchids track the diversification of their <b>pollinators.</b> However, deception has negative impacts on the <b>pollinators,</b> which may exert selection on the <b>pollinators.</b> Because duped <b>pollinators</b> tend to avoid rewardless flowers, deceptive orchids suffer low visitation rates and fruit set, various environment factors can affect the reproductive success of these orchids. Deceptive orchids depend largely on insect <b>pollinators</b> for reproduction, and the proclivity of these species to use deceptive pollination strategies puts many of these species at a relatively higher rate of extinction. Therefore, pollination biology studies areneeded to provide a scientific basis for proper conservation of orchids. At the community level, co-occurring mimic, non-mimic, and mimic signal providing plant species affect the reproductive fitness of orchids. Therefore, it is necessary to further study the co-evolution webs of deceptive orchids and <b>pollinators</b> along with other related biological and ecological factors...|$|R

40|$|Publicación ISIThe {{effect of}} mutualists (i. e. <b>pollinators)</b> and antagonists (i. e. herbivores) can have non-additive effects on plant fitness.

This situation {{has been found to}} prevail in plants that have large floral and fruit displays but are not limited by <b>pollinators</b> for seed set. We suggest the alternative hypothesis, where plants limited by <b>pollinators</b> for seed set (e. g. deceit-pollinated plants) exhibit additive effects of <b>pollinators</b> and herbivores on fitness (i. e. noncorrelated evolution). Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, we tested this hypothesis by solely and simultaneously evaluating the effects of <b>pollinators</b> and the single herbivore, Battus polydamas archidamas, on female reproductive success of Aristolochia chilensis. Plants exposed to herbivores presented 2. 6 -fold greater herbivory than plants that excluded them. In addition, plants exposed to <b>pollinators</b> showed strong limitation by <b>pollinators</b> for seed set compared with other plants of the genus Aristolochia. However, only <b>pollinators</b> had a significant effect on fruit and seed set because plants that excluded them did not set fruits or seeds.

5|$|Female {{and male}} flowers in each syconium mature at {{different}} times. Female wasps enter the syconium and lay {{eggs in the}} female flowers as they mature.

A field study in Brisbane found that F. obliqua trees often bore {{both male and female}} syconia at the same time—this could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations, such as those on islands.

Variation in pollinator-mediated selection explained most of the among-population variation in the strength of directional and correlational selection. <b>Pollinators</b> mediated correlational selection on pairs of display traits, and on one display trait and spur length, a trait affecting pollination efficiency.

The two types of <b>pollinators</b> caused correlational selection on different pairs of traits and selected for different combinations of spur length and number of flowers.

Plant species diversity declined most rapidly with preferential removal of the most-linked <b>pollinators,</b> but declines were no worse than linear. This relative tolerance to extinction derives from redundancy in <b>pollinators</b> per plant and from nested topology of the networks. Tolerance in pollination networks contrasts with catastrophic declines reported from standard food webs. The discrepancy may {{be a result of}} the method used: previous studies removed species from multiple trophic levels based only on their linkage, whereas our preferential removal of <b>pollinators</b> reflects their greater risk of extinction relative to that of plants.
