For these standards, valuation of assets and liabilities in “Fair Value ” is the basic principle. However as it is difficult to assess the market value of P & C insurance contracts, the valuation of liabilities would be carried on the “Entity Specific Value” principle. This principle relies on a <b>prospective</b> <b>valuation</b> of future cash-flows from the current book of contracts with a margin for risk and uncertainty and a discount of technical reserves.

40|$|Evolving {{theories}} of schizophrenia emphasize a ‘disconnection’ in distributed fronto-striatal-limbic neural systems, which may {{give rise to}} breakdowns in cognition and emotional function. We discuss these diverse domains of function {{from the perspective of}} disrupted neural circuits involved in ‘cold’ cognitive vs. ‘hot’ affective operations and the interplay between these processes. We focus on three research areas that highlight cognition-emotion dysinteractions in schizophrenia: First, we discuss the role of cognitive deficits in the ‘maintenance’ of emotional information. We review recent evidence suggesting that motivational abnormalities in schizophrenia may in part arise due to a disrupted ability to ‘maintain’ affective information over time. Here, dysfunction in a prototypical ‘cold’ cognitive operation may result in ‘affective’ deficits in schizophrenia. Second, we discuss abnormalities in the detection and ascription of salience, manifest as excessive processing of non-emotional stimuli and inappropriate distractibility. We review emerging evidence suggesting deficits in some, but not other, specific emotional processes in schizophrenia – namely an intact ability to perceive emotion ‘in the moment’ but poor <b>prospective</b> <b>valuation</b> of stimuli and heightened reactivity to stimuli that ought to be filtered. Third, we discuss abnormalities in learning mechanisms that may give rise to delusions, the fixed, false and often emotionally charged beliefs that accompany psychosis. We discuss the role of affect in aberrant belief formation, mostly ignored by current theoretical models. Together, we attempt to provide a consilient overview for how breakdowns in neural systems underlying affect and cognition in psychosis interact across symptom domains. We conclude with a brief treatment of the neurobiology of schizophrenia and the need to close our explanatory gap between cellular-level hypotheses and complex behavioral symptoms observed in schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the study}} was to develop a menopause-specific, preference-based {{health-related}} quality-of-life (HRQoL) index reflecting both menopausal symptoms and potential side-effects of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Methods The study had three phases: the development of a health state classification, a <b>prospective</b> <b>valuation</b> survey and the estimation of a model to interpolate HRQoL indices for all remaining health states as defined by the classification. A menopausal health state classification was developed with seven dimensions: hot flushes, aching joints/muscles, anxious/frightened feelings, breast tenderness, bleeding, vaginal dryness and undesirable androgenic signs. Each dimension contains between three and five levels and defines a total of 6, 075 health states. A sample of 96 health states was selected for the valuation survey. These states were valued by a sample of 229 women aged 45 to 60, randomly selected from 6 general practice lists in Sheffield, UK. Respondents were asked to complete a time trade-off (TTO) task for nine health states, resulting in an average of 16. 5 values for each health state. Results Mean health states valued range from 0. 48 to 0. 98 (where 1. 0 is full health and zero is for states regarded as equivalent to death). Symptoms, as described by the classification system, can be rank-ordered in terms of their impact (from high to low) on menopausal HRQoL as follows: aching joints and muscles, bleeding, breast tenderness, anxious or frightened feelings, vaginal dryness, androgenic signs. Hot flushes did not significantly contribute to model fit. The preferred model produced a mean absolute error of 0. 053, but suffered from bias at both ends of the scale. Conclusion This article presents an attempt to directly value a condition specific health state classification. The overall fit was disappointing, but the results demonstrate that menopausal symptoms are perceived by patients to have a significant impact on utility. The overall effect is modest compared to the more generic health state descriptions such as the EQ- 5 D. The resultant algorithm generates a preference-based index that can be used economic evaluation and that reflects the impact of this condition. </p...|$|E
