It is the communication architecture that determines the collaboration efficiency on the hardware side. Optical networks-on-chip (ONoCs) are emerging communication architectures that can potentially offer ultra-high communication bandwidth and low latency to multiprocessor systems. Thermal sensitivity is an intrinsic characteristic of photonic devices used byONoCsaswellasapotentialissue. Thispaper systematically modeled and quantitatively analyzed the thermal effects in ONoCs. We used an 8 8 mesh-based ONoC {{as a case study}} and evaluated the impacts of thermal effects in the average power efficiency for real MPSoC applications. We revealed three important factors regarding ONoC power efficiency under temperature variations, and proposed several techniques to reduce the temperature sensitivity of ONoCs. These techniques include the optimal initial setting of microresonator resonant wavelength, increasing the 3 -dB bandwidth of optical switching elements by <b>parallel</b> <b>coupling</b> multiple microresonators, and the use of passive-routing optical router Crux to minimize the number of switching stages in mesh-based ONoCs. We gave a mathematical analysis of periodically <b>parallel</b> <b>coupling</b> of multiple microresonators and show that the 3 -dB bandwidth of optical switching elements can be widened nearly linearly with the ring number. Evaluation results for different real MPSoC applications show that, on the basis of thermal tuning, the optimal device setting improves the average power efficiency by 54 % to 1. 2 pJ/bit when chip temperature reaches 85 C.

The meandered <b>parallel</b> <b>coupled</b> line can equalize the modal transmission phases at any interested frequency such as first spurious passband frequency due to its dispersive response.

The example filters are chosen to be of large fractional bandwidth and with a relatively high dielectric-constant substrate where, in these cases, the first spurious passband near twice of the passband frequency (2) seriously degrades the conventional <b>parallel</b> <b>coupled</b> filter’s upper stopband performance. The upper stopband performance of the proposed filters drastically improves that the measured first spurious passband are suppressed to better than 50 dB for all example filters.
