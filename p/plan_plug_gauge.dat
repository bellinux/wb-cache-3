5000|$|A spark <b>plug</b> gap <b>gauge</b> is a disc with {{a sloping}} edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, {{and is used}} to measure the gap. Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars. [...] Vehicles using compressed natural gas generally require narrower gaps than vehicles using gasoline.|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a novel optical thread <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> (OTPG) for internal thread inspection using machine vision. The OTPG {{is composed of}} a rigid industrial endoscope, a charge-coupled device camera, and a two degree-of-freedom motion control unit. A sequence of partial wall images of an internal thread are retrieved and reconstructed into a 2 D unwrapped image. Then, a digital image processing and classification procedure is used to normalize, segment, and determine {{the quality of the}} internal thread. The proposed OTPG provides an orientation-free and convenient method for detecting defects such as scratches, collapses, and flaws in an internal thread. Keywords Internal thread.

5000|$|Snap gauges {{are often}} used when a large {{quantity}} of work pieces must be inspected. The snap gauge has four anvils or jaws, the first one or pair (outermost) are set using the upper limit (tolerance) of the part and the inner set adjusted to the lower limit of the part.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a methodology for modelling {{the control of}} a threaded <b>plug</b> <b>gauge.</b> There had been examined works of scientists who had studied the aspects of the average thread diameter control and studied the problems of providing and {{improving the quality of}} threaded joints. At a modern machine-building enterprise, threaded gauges are important in controlling threaded joints of parts. There had been built a functional model of the caliber life-cycle. The article shows possible applications of threaded gauges and examines the method of automating the average thread diameter control on a universal three-axis measuring video microscope. The application of this method is expedient in the conditions of modern production, since that usage reduces time expenses and requirements for the operators' qualification, as well as increases the reliability {{of the results of the}} average thread diameter control...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of quality}} control was {{a sketch of}} the desired item. If the sketch did not match the item, it was rejected, in a simple Go/no go procedure. However, manufacturers soon found it was difficult and costly to make parts be exactly like their depiction; hence around 1840 tolerance limits were introduced, wherein a design would function if its parts were measured to be within the limits. Quality was thus precisely defined using devices such as <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> and ring gauges. However, this {{did not address the}} problem of defective items; recycling or disposing of the waste adds to the cost of production, as does trying to reduce the defect rate. Various methods have been proposed to prioritize quality control issues and determine whether to leave them unaddressed or use quality assurance techniques to improve and stabilize production.|$|R

40|$|Carbon fibre {{composites}} {{are increasingly}} being used in aircraft structures due to their superior physical and mechanical properties. The process of drilling of carbon fibre composites in aircraft manufacture is economically important since the extremely abrasive nature of the fibres limits drill life. The hole quality produced by drilling in terms of fibre pullout and matrix cracking affects the notch sensitivity of the hole. The present thesis describes an experimental and analytical study of drilling of the carbon fibre composites carried out {{with the support of}} British Aerospace (Military Aircraft Division). Full drill life testing was carried out using four low cost commercial cemented carbide drills, three of which had brazed inserts, and drill life was determined by measuring the outer drill corner wear. Hole quality was measured in terms of diametrical tolerance using accurate <b>plug</b> <b>gauges.</b> Drill forces were measured using a two component Kistler dynamometer and attempts were made to measure residual stress in the workpiece using the birefringent photoelastic technique. The hole quality was related to drill wear, cutting forces and heat generated during drilling. Independent tasks were carried out to relate cemented carbide physical and mechanical properties to wear using several standard sliding wear experiments. Three different cemented carbide tool materials were investigated in terms of cobalt layer thickness, carbide distribution and physical properties including hardness and fracture toughness. Independent sliding wear tests were performed using a Pin-on-Disc machine, lathe and machining centre. These tests allowed the materials to be ranked in terms of wear resistance when rubbing against carbon fibre composite. The fracture toughness was measured using the techniques developed by Palmqvist. The wear resistance was correlated to the physical and mechanical properties of the tool materials. Hole quality was studied experimentally using scanning electron microscopy and fibre pullout shown to be primarily dependent on the fibre-matrix interface bond strength and the intrinsic strength of the fibres. The surface morphology of the fractured fibres in areas of fibre pullout showed inultimode damage due to anisotropy of the carbon fibre composite and the dynamics of drilling. The degree and pattern of damage developed in the drilled holes was found to be highly directionally dependent. The experimental results and theoretical analysis showed that the degree of hole damage depends not only on drilling parameters but also on the material composition and the manufacturing process of the carbon fibre composite...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic plan {{migration}} {{is concerned with}} the on-the-fly transition from one continuous query plan to a semantically equivalent yet more efficient plan. Migration is important for stream monitoring systems where long-running queries may have to withstand fluctuations in stream workloads and data characteristics. Existing migration methods generally adopt a pause-drain-resume strategy that pauses the processing of new data, purges all old data in the existing plan, until finally the new <b>plan</b> can be <b>plugged</b> into the system. However, these existing strategies do not address the problem of migrating query plans that contain stateful operators, such as joins. We now develop solutions for online plan migration for continuous stateful plans. In particular, in this paper, we propose two alternative strategies, called the moving state strategy and the parallel track strategy, one exploiting reusability and the second employs parallelism to seamlessly migrate between continuous join plans without affecting the results of the query. We develop cost models for both migration strategies to analytically compare them. We embed these migration strategies into the CAPE [7], a prototype system of a stream query engine, and conduct a comparative experimental study to evaluate these two strategies for window-based join plans. Our experimental results illustrate that the two strategies can vary significantly in terms of output rates and intermediate storage spaces given distinct system configurations and stream workloads. 1...|$|R
40|$|If {{classical}} {{planners are}} ever to auto-matically plan {{the actions of}} the smart machines, particularly robots for the automatic assembly of indus-trial objects, then they will have to know much more about geometry and topology as well as sensing. Con-sider that the simple act of changing an object’s grasp-the change might be necessitated by the nature of some assembly goal-involves the interac-tion of the geometries of the grasping device and the object if the change is to occur without a collision between the device and the object. Of course, one could ask, Could geometric con-siderations be divorced from the highly developed symbolic-level planning? That is, could we first syn-, thesize a symbolic <b>plan</b> and then <b>plug</b> in the geometry for the execu-tion of the actions? Experience has shown the answer to be, unfortunate-ly, a big no. The actions chosen to fulfill an assembly goal depend as much on the symbolic nature of the goal-for example, by the form (PUTON A B) -as they do on the geo-metric constraints involved in putting object A on top of object B-for example, we might want cer-tain features on the exteriors of A and B to line up {{as a result of the}} assem-bly action. Then, there is the ever-present issue of how to integrate sensing with planning. This integration must be achieved if machines are to be able to use sensing to reduce the uncertain-ties in their environments. This issue is complex for a variety of reasons: An action can either increase or decrease the uncertainties associated with the environment and do so in a differential manner; that is, an action can cause a decrease in the uncertain-ty associated with, say, the x coordi-nate of the position of an object while causing an increase in the Avi Kak uncertainty associated with the y coordinate. A sensor has to be chosen in light of this interplay between actions and uncertainties. The plan-ner must be able to figure out what actions are executable given the cur-rent uncertainties and what are exe-cutable if appropriate sensors are invoked to reduce these uncertain-ties. 1 In an attempt to answer these issues, the planner Spar was devel-oped in the Robot Vision Lab a...|$|R
