40|$|BACKGROUND: Interpretation of glucose sensor results {{requires}} {{clarification of}} the relationship between interstitial (IG) and blood (BG) glucose. We examined the delay of IG upon BG change and reinvestigated the <b>push-pull</b> phenomenon in <b>type</b> 1 diabetes patients. The push-pull phenomenon postulates that IG shows a delayed increase but earlier decrease compared to BG. If so, postprandial sensor curves should have narrower peak widths than BG curves. METHODS: For both sensors a two-point calibration procedure was used. Delay was assessed by shifting combined fitted postprandial glucose sensor curves horizontally. The sensor and BG peak widths of the separately fitted curves were assessed and compared. Peak width was re-assessed for the microdialysis sensor using raw current values to rule out any calibration effect on the shape of the curve. The contribution of instrumental delay to the earlier reported 7. 1 -min delay of the microdialysis sensor was calculated. RESULTS: No delay [- 2. 2 +/- 6. 2 (SD) min] was seen for the needle-type sensor. Instrumental delay was > 6. 2 min for the microdialysis sensor, accounting for more than 87 % of the total reported delay of 7. 1 +/- 5. 5 min. Mean peak width for the BG curves was 100. 8 +/- 25. 0 min, for the needle-type sensor curves 110. 0 +/- 20. 5 min, and for the microdialysis sensor curves 104. 6 +/- 21. 7 min (P = 0. 052 and P = 0. 11 vs. BG, respectively). Mean peak width for the uncalibrated microdialysis current values was 105. 0 +/- 23. 1 min, which was not different from the peak width of the BG curves (P = 0. 347).

All the three dyes have the same porphyrin core and acceptor group (ethynylbenzoic acid) but their donor groups vary from the triphenylamine in YD 20 to meso-diphenylaminoanthracene in WW- 7 to N-phenyl carbazole in WW- 8.

To this extent, novel <b>push-pull</b> <b>type</b> organic semiconducting materials have been synthesized, with different architectures and composed of electron-poor isoindigo building blocks alternating with electron-rich moieties, presenting a favorable spectral overlap with the solar emission. The optical properties of the novel materials were generally investigated by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, while cyclic voltammetry was implemented to estimate the frontier orbital (HOMO/LUMO) energy levels. Relationships between the chemical nature and architecture of the push-pull systems and their absorption spectra and HOMO-LUMO energy levels have been pursued. Finally, the photovoltaic performances of the new materials have been evaluated in conventional bulk heterojunction organic solar cells using methanofullerene acceptor materials. Correlations between the molecular and photovoltaic parameters have been established. Ultimately, cross-linkable diblock copolymers based on poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) have been synthesized to improve the long-term stability of P 3 HT/PC 61 BM photovoltaic cells. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells have been prepared and their stability has been evaluated by accelerated ageing experiments and compared with standard P 3 HT-based devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of organic materials displaying high two-photon absorption (TPA) has {{attracted much attention}} in recent years due {{to a variety of}} potential applications in photonics and optoelectronics, such as three-dimensional optical data storage, fluorescence imaging, two-photon microscopy, optical limiting, microfabrication, photodynamic therapy, upconverted lasing, etc. The most frequently employed structural motifs for TPA materials are donor–pi bridge–acceptor (D–pi–A) dipoles, donor–pi bridge–donor (D–pi–D) and acceptor–pi bridge-acceptor (A–pi–A) quadrupoles, octupoles, etc. In this work we present the synthesis and photophysical characterization of quadrupolar heterocyclic systems with potential applications in materials and biological sciences as TPA chromophores. Indole is a versatile building block for the synthesis of heterocyclic systems for several optoelectronic applications (chemosensors, nonlinear optical, OLEDs) due to its photophysical properties and donor electron ability and 4 H-pyran- 4 -ylidene fragment is frequently used for the synthesis of red light-emitting materials. On the other hand, 2 -(2, 6 -dimethyl- 4 H-pyran- 4 -ylidene) malononitrile (1) and 1, 3 -diethyl-dihydro- 5 -(2, 6 -dimethyl- 4 H-pyran- 4 -ylidene) - 2 -thiobarbituric (2) units are usually used as strong acceptor moieties for the preparation of π-conjugated systems of the <b>push-pull</b> <b>type.</b> These building blocks were prepared by Knoevenagel condensation of the corresponding ketone precursor with malononitrile or 1, 3 -diethyl-dihydro- 2 -thiobarbituric acid. The new quadrupolar 4 H-pyran- 4 -ylidene fluorophores (3) derived from indole were prepared through condensation of 5 -methyl- 1 H-indole- 3 -carbaldehyde with the acceptor precursors 1 and 2, {{in the presence of a}} catalytical amount of piperidine. The new compounds were characterized by the usual spectroscopic techniques (UV-vis., FT-IR and multinuclear NMR - 1 H, 13 C).

40|$|While the syntheses of phosphaferrocene and diphosphaferrocene {{have been}} known for several decades, {{derivatization}} of these molecules has been limited. Prior to our work, functionalization of the phosphametallocenes has been through two routes: electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and functionalization of phospholide ions that are later coordinated to an iron source. The most common method, EAS, is limited to alpha carbon substitution and only with acetyl or benzoyl groups. A small number of 2, 5 -silyl substituted phosphametallocenes {{have been reported in}} literature, via coordination of substituted phospholide ions with Cp*FeCl or FeCl 2. However, the 2, 5 -silyl substituted phosphaferrocene and diphosphaferrocene have not been found to be useful precursors of phosphametallocene macrocyles. Our group has explored other routes for making substituted phosphaferrocene molecules and this work is presented hereafter. Using phospholide ions that are carbonyl substituted at the alpha position to react with iron (II) chloride in the presence of zinc chloride, we were able to prepare the corresponding 2, 2 '-difunctional- 1, 1 ' diphosphaferrocenes as mixtures of meso and rac diastereomers. When the 2, 5 -bis(ethoxycarbonyl) phospholide was reacted under the same conditions however the product was found to be the tetrafunctional 1, 1 '-biphospholyl which lead us to believe that the reaction is occurring through a bis(eta 1 -phospholyl) iron intermediate. We were successful at synthesizing 2, 5 -bis(ethoxycarbonyl) phosphaferrocene, 2, 5 -dibenzoylphosphaferrocene, and the 2, 2 ', 5, 5 '-tetrapivaloyl- 1, 1 'diphosphaferrocene by reacting iron (II) chloride with a 1 : 1 mixture of Cp*Li and the corresponding 2, 5 substituted phospholide ion in the presence of zinc chloride. We attributed the stability of the 2, 5 -substituted phosphametallocenes to a <b>push-pull</b> <b>type</b> stabilization, where the Cp* unit acts as an electron donor to the metal center and the phospholide plays the role of an electron acceptor. Our new protocol for making phosphaferrocene derivatives was used in the synthesis of a new 2 -(azacymantrenylmethyl) phosphaferrocene ligand, and in the preparation of building blocks for phosphametallocene macrocycles 2, 5 -bis(hydroxylmethyl) phosphaferrocene and 2, 5 -bis(pyrrolylmethyl) phosphaferrocene...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the experimental work {{carried out to}} further {{the understanding of the}} mechanisms involved in the process of fretting fatigue. The design and construction of a rig to enable a controlled fretting action to be applied to a <b>push-pull</b> <b>type</b> of fatigue specimen is discussed. Special consideration is given to the form of the fretting contact geometry with regard to the generated stress field, and the reasons behind the final choice of a circular Hertzian contact are given. The investigation of the effects of various parameters on the fatigue life of the specimen are reported. The parameters chosen for the investigation were the slip amplitude, the bulk stress and the normal load. Examination of the developing fretting damage was carried out ty interrupting the tests at prescribed intervals. The subsequent observations made of the surface and sue-surface damage are illustrated by optical and scanning electron micrographs. Two distinct forms of damage are proposed, these have been termed type I and type II fretting fatigue damage. Type I damage is considered to be by crack nucleation from the conjoint action of the bulk and surface stress fields. These cracks were found to nucleate in the direction of maximum shear {{at the edge of the}} fretting contact, and at the position where the alternating tensile stress was largest. The subsequent direction of propagation of these cracks, determines whether or not fatigue failure of the specimen will occur. The type I fretting damage process, is noted to have been responsible for every case of catastrophic fatigue failure of the test specimens. Type II fretting damage was found at the centre of the fretting contact area, where the hydrostatic stress and surface shear traction are maximum. The material in this region was found to have undergone extensive microstructural alteration. White etching layers with a hardness in excess of 1300 Hv (more than four times the original hardness) are reported. An extensive literature survey is presented which shows no previous evidence of white etching layers forming under clean fretting conditions. The white layers are shown to have important consequences on the rate of wear, thus it is postulated that under certain conditions fretting wear and fretting fatigue may be linked ty the same mechanism, i. e. white etching layer formation. The white etching layers are also discussed in terms of their potential for nucleating fatigue cracks, this phenomenon is illustrated by a service failure from a diesel engine...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Organic {{electro-optic}} {{materials are}} {{at the forefront of}} current photonics applications that enable high speed data transmission, micro-scale sensors, and terahertz applications. Typically linearly conjugated <b>push-pull</b> <b>type</b> chromophores are the primary molecules of choice for various second and third order non-linear optical (NLO) applications. However, intra-molecular charge transfer responsible for many NLO properties can take place in molecules through other means such as σ-conjugation, cross-conjugation and omniconjugation as well. In Chapter 2 a study of electronic transitions, excited states and first hyperpolarizibility (β) of a series of molecules with a cross-conjugated bridge functionalized with a dialkylaminobenzene donor on one end and varying strength acceptors on the other end is reported. A lowered excited state dipole moment compared to the ground state dipole was indicated for an asymmetric cross-conjugated molecule with a relatively stronger acceptor confirming that the cross-conjugated bridge does in fact break the over-all molecular dipole into two constituent parts. The primary charge-transfer transition was, however still identified to occur from the donor across the cross-conjugated bridge to the acceptor. X-ray diffraction (XRD) found the molecules to be twisted significantly resulting in further isolation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). This reduced overlap of the HOMO and the LUMO in cross-conjugated systems may in fact enable independent modulation of donor and acceptor strengths while minimizing unfavorable effects on electronic transitions and dipole moments. Comparison of hyperpolarizabilities with a control molecule found that cross-conjugation did not completely diminish β. In Chapter 3, a tricyanopyrroline (TCP) type acceptor was substituted on the cross-conjugated molecules to observe the effects of cross-conjugation on the molecular structure, the ground and excited states of the molecules and consequently β. Through XRD the cross-conjugated motif was found to be perpendicular to the conjugated TCP chromophore and the TCP acceptor was twisted out of plane from the donor despite being conjugated to the donor. Further the aromatic substituents on the cross-conjugated side group were found to interact with each other influencing crystal packing. The dihedral twist and the aromatic interactions are indicated as the cause of reduced aggregation behavior. Hyper-Raleigh scattering measurements found the compounds to have β values comparable to their fully conjugated control molecules. The β values were expected to be influenced by the cross-conjugated side groups acting as auxiliary acceptors {{as well as by the}} dihedral twist observed in these molecules resulting in larger spatial isolation between the HOMO and LUMO. In conclusion the use of a cross-conjugated motif by itself (Chapter 2) and in conjunction with a conjugated chromophore (Chapter 3) was studied and found to be useful towards affecting aggregation, solubility and hyperpolarizability of NLO chromophores...|$|E
