5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E

5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal {{force at the}} equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One {{possible explanation for the}} braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E

A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E

The school's attitude towards the series worsened to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> 1889 game was rescheduled away from the traditional Thanksgiving Day playing and was moved to a week earlier. That year's game ended in a 36–0 shutout victory for the Naval Academy, and wound up being the breaking point for Johns Hopkins. Hopkins decided to terminate the series following that game. However, Hopkins' students returned to the Naval Academy the following year, yet again to root against Navy, this time supporting Lehigh.|$|E
