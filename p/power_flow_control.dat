40|$|Abstract—Power <b>flow</b> <b>controlling</b> {{devices such}} as phase {{shifting}} transformers are increasingly important in the power system. They can increase reliability and can serve {{as an alternative to}} new investments in overhead lines, which are difficult {{due to a lack of}} public support. Furthermore, they are an important means of control for a transmission system operator in the liber-alized market. HVDC links recently also got renewed attention as they do not only provide the possibility to <b>control</b> the <b>power</b> <b>flow,</b> but can also be economically competitive to underground ac cables [1]. Especially with the emergence of VSC HVDC applications for bulk power transport, HVDC is a real alternative in the meshed power system. The usage of <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controlling</b> devices in a meshed grid causes the <b>power</b> to <b>flow</b> along alternative paths. However, these devices, and especially HVDC and VSC HVDC, incorporate significant losses. Furthermore, the shifting of power to other lines can cause losses in other parts of the grid. In this paper, the losses caused by the different <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controlling</b> elements are discussed, and afterwards their influence on the power system losses of a meshed grid are investigated. An important issue that is addressed in this paper is the use of multiple <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controlling</b> devices in one grid, consisting of multiple control areas.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the European {{policies}} on sustainability, market integration, competition and renewable energy resulted in a higher loading of the transmission system. As the power system is being operated much closer to its limits, an unforeseen sequence of events can cause the power system to deteriorate very fast from normal state to the alert or emergency state. Simultaneously the number of <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controlling</b> devices in the European power system is increasing steadily. However, how these devices are operated during the alert and emergency state remains a largely unanswered question.

As such the presented methodology provides the operator with the minimal PFC devices set point changes, to obtain a steady state secure operating point. Or if no secure set point can be reached, the set points that will deliver extra time to allow the operator to implement complementary control actions. As both HVDC links and phase shifting transformers are included in the problem with quadratic indices, this eventually results in a mixed integer quadratic problem.
