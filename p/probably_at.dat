5|$|In 1577, Parker's {{successor}} gave Joscelyn a rectory at Hollingbourne, Kent, {{replacing the}} prebend at Hereford. He died on 28 December 1603, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> High Roding, and {{was buried in}} All Saint's Church in High Roding. He never married.|$|E

5|$|The embassy was <b>probably,</b> <b>at</b> that time, {{part of a}} plan {{to diversify}} and {{increase}} trade with foreign countries, before the participation of Christians in the Osaka rebellion triggered a radical reaction from the shogunate, with the interdiction of Christianity in the territories it directly controlled, in 1614.|$|E
5|$|After this feat {{that earned}} him fame and glory, in 1262 Alexios was {{appointed}} again to lead an army against Epirus. Here, however, he was defeated and captured by Nikephoros Doukas, who {{sent him to}} Manfred in Italy. He was ransomed in 1265 in exchange for Constance II of Hohenstaufen, widow of John Vatatzes. He is last mentioned in a document from December 1270 in which he made a donation to the Makrinitissa Monastery near Volos, and died sometime between 1271 and 1275, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|By 1445 Richard {{had become}} a knight, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> Margaret of Anjou's {{coronation}} on 22April that year. He is visible in the historical record of service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father, and might have taken part {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI.|$|E

5|$|Flemish {{metallurgist}} and alchemist P. M. de Respour {{reported that}} he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668. By the start of the 18th century, Étienne François Geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted. In Britain, John Lane is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.|$|E
5|$|John is not {{mentioned}} in the sources during the reign of Constantine X, perhaps indicating, according to Konstantinos Varzos, that he was in imperial disfavour, despite Bryennios' assertion that both he and his brother remained much honoured by the new emperor. The late 12th-century typikon of the Monastery of Christ Philanthropos, founded by Alexios I's wife Irene Doukaina, is the only source to record that John Komnenos retired to a monastery, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> the same time as his wife, Anna Dalassene. He died as a monk on 12 July 1067.|$|E
5|$|Stela 26 {{was found}} in the summit shrine of Temple 34, {{underneath}} a broken masonry altar. The monument had originally been erected {{at the base of the}} temple during the Early Classic period and was later broken, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of the Late Classic. Its remains were then interred within the temple shrine.|$|E

5|$|The Scandinavian {{influence}} in Scotland was <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> its height {{in the mid}} eleventh century {{during the time of}} Thorfinn Sigurdsson, who attempted to create a single political and ecclesiastical domain stretching from Shetland to Man. The permanent Scandinavian holdings in Scotland at that time must therefore have been at least a quarter of the land area of modern Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of Northumbria, and perhaps the whole kingdom, had probably been ruled by Ealdred son of Eadulf since 913. Faced with Ragnall's invasion, Ealdred came north seeking assistance from Constantine. The two advanced south to face Ragnall, and {{this led to a}} battle somewhere {{on the banks of the}} River Tyne, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> Corbridge where Dere Street crosses the river. The Battle of Corbridge appears to have been indecisive; the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba is alone in giving Constantine the victory.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> the 1125 {{church council}} held at Westminster by the papal legate John of Crema, and shortly {{afterwards}} accompanied the legate on his journey back to Rome. He {{was still in}} Rome in 1126, and may have helped to obtain a papal confirmation of his uncle's possession of Malmesbury Abbey, Abbotsbury Abbey, and Horton. At some point during his episcopate, an eighth archdeaconry was established in his diocese, for the West Riding area of Lindsey. Besides these reorganisations, Alexander {{had a number of}} clerics in his personal household, including Gilbert of Sempringham, who later founded the Gilbertine order. Other members of the bishop's household were Ralph Gubion, who became abbot of St Albans, and an Italian Bible scholar named Guido or Wido, who taught that subject while serving Alexander.|$|E

5|$|Although Æthelwig {{was known}} for his loyalty to King William, he had an uncle who held land at Witton who died {{fighting}} for King Harold Godwinson, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Stamford Bridge. While abbot, even after the Conquest, Æthelwig continued to build and ornament his abbey in the Anglo-Saxon style, not the Norman Romanesque which was being used in many of the other churches and abbeys. Besides his administrative and legal duties, Æthelwig {{was known for}} his care for the sick and the poor, as well as lepers. After the Harrying of the North by King William in 1069–1070, Æthelwig offered shelter to refugees from the ravaged areas. The Chronicon states that Æthelwig offered aid to the refugees because of his charitable nature, but it is possible that it was also part of his royal duties in western England.|$|E
5|$|Anderitum {{appears to}} have been a {{particularly}} important link in the Saxon Shore forts, which extended from Hampshire to Norfolk and may have been connected by intermediate watchtowers. The Notitia Dignitatum mentions a fleet that was presumably based there, the Classis Anderidaensis. It would probably have acted in coordination with naval units based on the other side of the Channel to intercept pirate ships passing through the Channel. Like the other Saxon Shore forts, Anderitum's position at a strategic harbour would have enabled the Romans to control access to the shoreline and prevent invaders from penetrating inland. It was linked by a road built in the late Roman period, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> the same time as the fort.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{became a}} monk in about 1170, and then abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Forde. He {{was well known}} as a canonist, and often acted as a judge-delegate for the papacy, hearing cases that had reached the Roman Curia and been remanded to local experts for decision. In 1166, Baldwin was the {{addressee}} of a work by John of Salisbury, Expectiatione longa, {{which was one of}} the tracts written during the Becket controversy. It was <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> this time that Baldwin wrote De sacramento altaris. In 1175 he served with his old bishop, Bartholomew, as joint papal judge in a dispute between Malmesbury Abbey and Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury. In 1178 he was recommended to Pope Alexander as a possible candidate for a cardinalship, but this never occurred.|$|E

5|$|During 655, Æthelhere {{joined with}} Penda in {{an assault on}} Northumbria. Steven Plunkett asserts that Æthelhere's motive for {{changing}} sides was to deflect Penda's attention from East Anglia {{and the destruction of}} his kingdom that would have ensued. Penda invaded Northumbria with a force of thirty duces regii (or royal commanders) under his command that included a large contingent of Britons. He laid siege to Oswiu at Maes Gai, in the district of Loidis, which was <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> that time within the sphere of influence of the British kingdom of Rheged. Oswiu offered him a great ransom of treasure which, according to Bede, was refused (or according to the Historia Brittonum, was accepted and distributed)— in either case Penda resolved on battle and the destruction of the Northumbrians. Oswiu had a much smaller force, but in the event the Welsh armies of King Cadfæl of Gwynedd decamped on the eve of battle and Penda's ally Œthelwald of Deira stood aside to await the outcome.|$|E
5|$|Francis Walsingham {{was born}} in or about 1532, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> Foots Cray, near Chislehurst, Kent. His parents were William and Joyce Walsingham. William was a successful, well-connected and wealthy London lawyer who died in 1534 and Joyce was the {{daughter}} of courtier Sir Edmund Denny and the sister of Sir Anthony Denny, who was the principal gentleman of King Henry VIII's privy chamber. William Walsingham served {{as a member of the}} commission that was appointed to investigate the estates of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in 1530, and his elder brother, Sir Edmund Walsingham, was Lieutenant of the Tower of London. After William's death, Joyce married the courtier Sir John Carey in 1538. Carey's brother William was the husband of Mary Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's elder sister. Of Francis Walsingham's five sisters, Mary married Sir Walter Mildmay, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer for over 20 years, and Elizabeth married the parliamentarian Peter Wentworth.|$|E
5|$|Giraldus Cambrensis wrote a Life of St Æthelberht, <b>probably</b> <b>at</b> Hereford {{during the}} 1190s. He quotes an {{incident}} from Asser {{that occurred during}} the reign of Offa of Mercia, who died in 796. This incident is not in the surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work. It is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or even that Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.|$|E
