Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} examine the ratio between "pulling" and "pushing" strength in sedentary individuals. 212 healthy participants, of both genders (139 male and 73 female; age 32 ± 13. 3 years, weight 70. 2 ± 14. 1 kg, height 173 ± 9 cm) were retained for investigation. Strength was assessed through a new methodology: Pulling through a lat-pulldown test while pushing strength through a chest-press test. Both tests were performed to exhaustion with an overload of 30 % of each participants bodyweight. Such method aims to prevent excessive overloads in sedentary individuals. Pearson's correlations and a t test to assess differences were analyzed. Subsequently, the ratio for both genders of pulling and pushing local endurance strength was assessed by means. A mean number of 57 repetitions was shown with the lat-pulldown while 34 repetition with the chest press. A correlation of 0. 42 has been found between the number of repetitions of the two tests. A significant difference (p < 0. 001) was found between such performances. No correlation was found between the strength measures and the anthropometric parameters of the participants. The lat machine to chest <b>press</b> <b>ratio</b> was 1. 36 : 1 for male while 2. 69 : 1 for female.

40|$|Human {{behavior}} {{in daily life}} is based on various brain functions, including cognitive and motor functions. A better understanding of neural mechanisms underlying motor learning is an important prerequisite {{for the development of}} treatments and has important clinical implications. Previous studies developed a sequence and skill learning task, called “three-lever operant task,” where rats were trained to press three levers in correct order within a given time, and demonstrated that this task is dependent on the basal ganglia. As genetically altered mice {{have been shown to be}} useful for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying brain functions, we applied the three-lever operant task to mice and examined whether this task can be used as a mouse model for studying motor sequence and skill learning. 　Experiments were carried out with ﬁve C 57 BL/ 6 NCr male mice at the age of 8 weeks. One training session lasting 60 minutes was given once a day, ﬁve times a week. Mice were trained to press any one of active levers for food reinforcement （R） （one-lever task）, three levers in a given sequence within a given time （T） （three-lever task）, and three levers in the opposite sequence （reverse three-lever task）. 　Analysis of the performance in the one-lever task, which was used as a shaping procedure for the three-lever task, demonstrated that mice change their behavior after inactivation of the most frequently pressed lever, and that this behavioral change can be evaluated quantitatively from the inactive lever <b>press</b> <b>ratio.</b> In the three-lever task, the number of sessions required to learn the order without time restriction ranged from 4 to 16 sessions （ 1 ‒ 3 weeks）, which was comparable to that in rats （ 1 ‒ 4 weeks）. In the three-lever task with time restriction, the mice showed good performance （R > 100 ） even at T = 0. 6 s. In the reverse three-lever task, mice relearned the order of lever press within three sessions, indicating that this task can be used to study reversal learning. These results indicate that the three-lever operant task is useful for studying several diﬀerent aspects of motor learning, including sequence learning, skill learning, adaptation, and reversal learning. We expect that the application of this task to various types of genetically altered mice will yield substantial progress in understanding the neural mechanisms of motor learning...|$|E

40|$|Mesolimbic {{dopamine}} (DA) {{is involved}} in behavioral activation and effort-related processes. Rats with impaired DA transmission reallocate their instrumental behavior away from food-reinforced tasks with high response requirements, and instead select less effortful food-seeking behaviors. In the present study, the effects of several drug treatments were assessed using a progressive ratio (PROG) /chow feeding concurrent choice task. With this task, rats can lever press on a PROG schedule reinforced by a preferred high-carbohydrate food pellet, or alternatively approach and consume the lesspreferred but concurrently available laboratory chow. Rats pass through each ratio level 15 times, after which the ratio requirement is incremented by one additional response. The DA D 2 antagonist haloperidol (0. 025 – 0. 1 mg/kg) reduced number of lever <b>presses</b> and highest <b>ratio</b> achieved but did not reduce chow intake. In contrast, the adenosine A 2 A antagonist MSX- 3 increased lever <b>presses</b> and highest <b>ratio</b> achieved, but decreased chow consumption. The cannabinoid CB 1 inverse agonist and putative appetite suppressant AM 251 decreased lever <b>presses,</b> highest <b>ratio</b> achieved, and chow intake; this effect {{was similar to that}} produced by pre-feeding. Furthermore, DA-related signal transduction activity (pDARPP- 32 (Thr 34) expression) was greater in nucleus accumbens core of high responders (rats with high lever pressing output) compared to low responders. Thus, the effects of DA antagonism differed greatly from those produced by prefeeding or reduced CB 1 transmission, and it appears unlikely that haloperidol reduces PROG responding because of a general reduction in primary food motivation or the unconditioned reinforcing properties of food. Furthermore, accumbens core signal transduction activity is related to individual differences in work outpu...|$|R
40|$|Rats {{lived in}} {{individual}} chambers {{in which the}} only food available was delivered for lever pressing. During Stage I, a fixed number of presses was required for each food pellet. As this fixed <b>ratio</b> of <b>presses</b> per food pellet was increased daily, a rat's daily intake of food was reduced. During Stage II, {{the cost of a}} food pellet was increased by replacing each fixed ratio with its interval equivalent. Each interval was a rat's mean time between the first <b>press</b> of a <b>ratio</b> and the delivery of a pellet during Stage I. During Stage II, only two presses were every required for a food pellet: The first press initiated a delay and the second activated the pellet dispenser after that delay elapsed. Food intakes for the series of fixed ratios and a rat's series of delay equivalents were very similar when plotted as a function of delay, but not when plotted as a function of presses per pellet. Consequently, the fixed ratio reduced food intake because larger ratios increased delay to food from the first <b>press</b> of a <b>ratio.</b> Observations and an analysis of interresponse times further revealed that as the fixed ratio increased, and local as well as overall rate of food intake decreased, lever pressing became more stereotyped. Because this increased stereotypy resulted in greatly increased rates of lever pressing, delay to food was minimized, and perhaps more importantly, so too was the reduction of a rat's baseline daily intake...|$|R

Interaction effect between breed and muscle was not found (p> 0. 05) for any parameter. The T 45 min, T 24 h, pH 45 min, and M/T value were influenced by the muscle, whereas T 24 h was also influenced by the breed.

40|$|Behavioral {{activation}} is {{a fundamental}} feature of motivation, and organisms frequently make effort-related decisions based upon evaluations of reinforcement value and response costs. Furthermore, people with major depression and other disorders often show anergia, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, and alterations in effort-related decision making. Tasks measuring effort-based decision making {{can be used as}} animal models of the motivational symptoms of depression, and the present studies characterized the effort-related effects of the vesicular monoamine transport (VMAT- 2) inhibitor tetrabenazine. Tetrabenazine induces depressive symptoms in humans, and also preferentially depletes dopamine (DA). Rats were assessed using a concurrent progressive ratio (PROG) /chow feeding task, in which they can either lever press on a PROG schedule for preferred high-carbohydrate food, or approach and consume a less-preferred lab chow that is freely available in the chamber. Previous work has shown that the DA antagonist haloperidol reduced PROG work output on this task, but did not reduce chow intake, effects that differed substantially from those of reinforcer devaluation or appetite suppressant drugs. The present work demonstrated that tetrabenazine produced an effort-related shift in responding on the PROG/chow procedure, reducing lever <b>presses,</b> highest <b>ratio</b> achieved and time spent responding, but not reducing chow intake.

Canopy scale #uxes were measured using a gradient approach, leaf level #uxes used a #ow-through chamber. Emissions were dependent on ambient {{light and temperature}} levels and showed a diurnal cycle very similar to isoprene in deciduous forests. Maximum #uxes occurred between 1000 and 1700 h {{with an average of}} 2 mg C m~ 2 h~ 1 in July and August, which equaled approximately 0. 3 } 0. 5 % of the simultaneously measured gross carbon uptake. MBO mixing ratios and #uxes over the pine plantation were also measured with a relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) system operated during part of our measurement campaign (Baker et al., 1999 Journal of Geophysical Research, in <b>press).</b> Mixing <b>ratios</b> measured by both systems were in good agreement but the gradient approach estimated MBO #uxes twice as high than the REA approach. Leaf level investigations revealed a seasonal cycle in basal emission rate (emissions at 1000 lmol m~ 2 s~ 1 PAR and 303 C) with a maximum in August, decreasing {{towards the end of the}} season. We developed an emission model to scale MBO #uxes from the leaf level to the ecosystem level based on the well-known isoprene algorithm. The model estimates are substantially lower than our gradient #ux measurements, and match better with the REA #ux measurements, and we conclude that the gradient approach overestimated MBO #uxes at this site.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the contributions of the}} primary and secondary motor cortices (M 1 and M 2) to action differentiation and sequencing in mice. In Experiment 1, mice with excitotoxic lesions of M 1 and M 2 and sham controls learned to emit lever presses exceeding a criterion duration to earn food rewards. Duration differentiation obeys Weber’s law—i. e. the spread of the distribution is proportional to the average duration. M 1 or M 2 lesions did not affect differentiation of press durations. Experiment 2 studied the effects of the same lesions on the learning of a simple sequence consisting of two lever presses, one distal, and the other proximal, to the reward. M 2 lesions impaired the acquisition and reversal of this sequence. M 1 lesions, by contrast, had no effect on acquisition but impaired sequence reversal. Moreover, duration of the first press in a sequence was on average twice as long as that of the second <b>press,</b> though this <b>ratio</b> was not affected by motor cortex lesions.

The major issue was the occurrence of the BSE crisis, with its major impact in mainland Europe from 1996 on. Much research has addressed concern over declining consumer confidence in the meat food category {{and what can be}} done to counter the deteriorating image for fresh meat. This contribution focuses on consumer reactions and consequent economic implications of the BSE crisis in Belgium. With respect to consumer reactions, the reported data and analyses result from consumer studies that are on going since 1996 until today.

We hypothesise that in stroke patients metabolic alterations in the apparently normal contralateral brain are dependent on the presence or not of such risk factors. Methods: Fifty nine patients (31 male, 28 female: 58. 8 +/- 16. 1 years old) with cortical middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction were included. Long echo time chemical shift imaging spectroscopy was carried out on a Siemens 1. 5 T Magnetom Vision scanner using a multi-voxel <b>PRESS</b> technique. Metabolite <b>ratios</b> (NAA/choline, NAA/creatine, lactate/choline, etc) were studied using uni- and multivariate analyses with respect to common risk factors. The influence of age, stroke lesion size, and time since stroke was studied using a linear regression approach. Results: Age, sex, and hypertension all appeared to individually influence metabolite ratios, although only hypertension was significant after multivariate analysis. In both basal ganglia and periventricular white matter regions in apparently normal contralateral brain, the NAA/choline ratio was significantly lower in hypertensive (1. 37 +/- 0. 16 and 1. 50 +/- 0. 19, respectively) than in normotensive patients (1. 72 +/- 0. 19 and 1. 85 +/- 0. 15, respectively). Conclusions: Regarding MCA infarction, contralateral tissue remote from the lesion behaves abnormally {{in the presence of}} hypertension, the NAA ratios in hypertensive patients being significantly lower.
