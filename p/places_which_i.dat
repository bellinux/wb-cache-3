The first of these was published on May 15, and Miller writes of the public’s response, [...] "I began to be flooded with letters of inquiry respecting my views, and visitors flocked to converse {{with me on the}} subject." [...] In 1834, unable to personally comply with many of the urgent requests for information and the invitations to travel and preach that he received, Miller published a synopsis of his teachings in a [...] "little tract of 64 pages." [...] These he [...] "...scattered, the most of them gratuitously, sending them in reply to letters of inquiry and to <b>places</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> could not visit." ...|$|E

60|$|One of the <b>places</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> wished {{especially}} to revisit was the school-house at Burr Oak, the room {{which had been}} our social center in the early eighties. In it we had listened to church service in summer, and there in winter our Grange Suppers and Friday Lyceums had been held. It was there, too, that I had worshiped at the shrine of Hattie's girlish beauty, when as a shock-haired lad I forgot, for a day, the loneliness of my prairie home.|$|E

60|$|On the Saturday Mr. Hartright {{had left}} before I {{got down to}} breakfast. Miss Fairlie kept her room all day, and Miss Halcombe {{appeared}} {{to me to be}} out of spirits. The house was not {{what it used to be}} in the time of Mr. and Mrs. Philip Fairlie. I took a walk by myself in the forenoon, and looked about at some of the <b>places</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> first saw when I was staying at Limmeridge to transact family business, more than thirty years since. They were not what they used to be either.|$|E

Your situation is different--you are here by choice, the partaker and minister of the pleasures of a class below you in education, birth, and fortunes. If I speak harshly, Mr. Latimer,' she added, with much sweetness of manner, 'I mean kindly.' ...|$|E
60|$|It happened, in {{the fatal}} year ninety-six, that the brave North Bungays were {{quartered}} at Portsmouth, a maritime <b>place,</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> need not describe, and <b>which</b> <b>I</b> wish I had never seen. I {{might have been}} a General now, or, at least, a rich man.|$|R
60|$|It {{is also a}} very well-governed town, and I {{have nowhere}} in England {{observed}} the Sabbath day so exactly kept, or the breach so continually punished, as in this <b>place,</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> name to their honour.|$|R
60|$|Having {{had it on}} my mind {{to relate}} {{the end of this}} dear little child, I have omitted {{something}} from its exact <b>place,</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> will supply here. It will come quite as well here as anywhere else.|$|R
60|$|The next voyage {{my friend}} {{proposed}} to me, {{was to go}} among the spice islands, and bring home a load of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts; islands belonging partly to Spain, but where the Dutch trade very considerably. We were not long in preparing for this voyage, which we made no less successful than the last, touching at Borneo, and several other <b>places</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> do not perfectly remember, and returning home in about five months time. We soon sold our spices, which were chiefly cloves and some nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away to the gulph; and, in short, making five to one advantage, we were loaded with money.|$|E
60|$|I was now light-hearted, {{and all my}} late {{trouble and}} perplexity being over, I had no anxious {{thoughts}} about me, which made this journey the pleasanter to me; in which no ill accident attended me, only in passing or fording a small river, my horse fell and made me free of the country, as they call it--that is to say, threw me in. The place was not deep, but it wetted me all over. I mention it because it spoiled my pocket- book, wherein I had set down the names of several people and <b>places</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> had occasion to remember, and which not taking due care of, the leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be read.|$|E
60|$|The <b>places</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> have {{described}} may seem strange and remote to my townsmen,--indeed, from Boston to Provincetown {{is twice as}} far as from England to France; yet step into the cars, and in six hours you may stand on those four planks, and see the Cape which Gosnold {{is said to have}} discovered, and which I have so poorly described. If you had started when I first advised you, you might have seen our tracks in the sand, still fresh, and reaching {{all the way from the}} Nauset Lights to Race Point, some thirty miles,--for at every step we made an impression on the Cape, though we were not aware of it, and though our account may have made no impression on your minds. But what is our account? In it there is no roar, no beach-birds, no tow-cloth.|$|E
6000|$|... we now read, on an {{inscription}} in black letters, and, following the path indicated, {{we reached the}} dank tank where the monsters dwell. We had arrived at a <b>place</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> {{find it difficult to}} describe. The floor was smooth and hard.|$|R

60|$|On the {{following}} day, {{they stopped at}} a <b>place</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> shall call Ramontown. From one of the dock owners, they learned where they could find a master carpenter, and they called upon this individual and had him look at the damage done.|$|R
6000|$|... “Then {{they will}} bring you sugar-canes half as thick as your wrist, looking as {{innocent}} as may be; both ends are sealed up with bits of the pith, and when you open one end you find that all the joints have been bored through, and the cane is full of rum. But mind, lads, you are fools if you touch it; it is new and strong and rank, {{and a bottle of}} it would knock you silly. And that is not the worst of it, for fever catches hold of you, and fever out there ain’t no joke. You eats a good dinner at twelve o’clock, and you are buried in the palisades at six; that’s called yellow jack. It is a country where you can enjoy yourselves reasonable with fruit, and perhaps a small sup of rum, but where you must beware of drinking; if you do that you are all right. The islands are beautiful, downright beautiful; there ain’t many <b>places</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> troubles myself to look at, but the West Indies are like gardens with feathery sorts of trees, and mountains, and everything that you can want in nature.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was our old exercise," [...] said he. [...] "Doubtless you young bloods have {{improved}} upon it, {{and yet it}} was good enough for the Spaniards at Rocroy and at one or two other <b>places</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> could mention. But they still see life at the court, I understand. There are still love passages and blood lettings. How has Lauzun prospered in his wooing of Mademoiselle de Montpensier? Was it proved that Madame de Clermont had bought a phial from Le Vie, the poison woman, two days before the soup disagreed so violently with monsieur? What did the Due de Biron do when his nephew ran away with the duchess? Is it true that he raised his allowance to fifty thousand livres for having done it?" [...] Such were the two-year-old questions which had not been answered yet upon the banks of the Richelieu River. Long into the hours of the night, when his comrades were already snoring under their blankets, De Catinat, blinking and yawning, was still engaged in trying to satisfy the curiosity of the old courtier, and to bring him up to date in all the most minute gossip of Versailles.|$|E
60|$|I {{was indeed}} surprised, {{and began to}} name several large <b>places,</b> <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> thought, had singly more Spaniards in them than what he talked of. He {{presently}} ran over some of them, and, naming Baldivia first, as the most southward, he asked me how many I thought were there? And I told him about three hundred families. He smiled, and assured me there were not above three or four-and-fifty families in the whole place, and about twenty-five soldiers, {{although it was a}} fortification, and a frontier. At Villa Rica, or the Rich Town, where he lived, he said there might be about sixty families, and a lieutenant, with twenty soldiers. In a word, we passed over the many places between and came to the capital, St. Jago, where after I had supposed there were five thousand Spaniards, he protested to me there were not above eight hundred, including the viceroy's court, and including the families at Valparaiso, which is the seaport, and excluding only the soldiers, which as he said, being the capital of the whole kingdom, might be about two hundred, and excluding the religious, who he added, laughing, signified nothing to the planting a country, for they neither cultivated the land nor increased the people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where am I? Why have I {{been taken}} away from the <b>place</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> knew--where I, blind, could move without fear? It is like black night to those who see. And the sun is near its setting--and I have not {{heard the sound of}} her {{footsteps}} since the morning! Twice a strange hand has given me my food to-day. Why? Why? Where is she?" ...|$|R
60|$|These {{particulars}} awakened my ardent curiosity {{to see a}} <b>place</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> pictured {{to myself}} the very fountain-head of certain hereditary habits and customs prevalent among {{the descendants of the}} original Dutch settlers of my native State. I accordingly lost no time in performing a pilgrimage to Broek.|$|R
60|$|In short, my {{midshipman}} {{returned with}} the horses and servants, {{and when he had}} brought what I had sent for into a <b>place</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> desired the Spaniard to allow me to open my things in, I sent my doctor to desire the Spaniard to let me speak with him.|$|R
60|$|A {{while before}} this several people, under the {{patronage}} of some great persons, {{had engaged in}} planting of foreign colonies (as William Penn, the Lord Shaftesbury, Dr. Cox, and others) in Pennsylvania, Carolina, East and West Jersey, and the like <b>places,</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> do not call projects, because it was only prosecuting what had been formerly begun. But here began the forming of public joint-stocks, which, together with the East India, African, and Hudson's Bay Companies, before established, begot a new trade, which we call by a new name stock-jobbing, which was at first only the simple occasional transferring of interest and shares from one to another, as persons alienated their estates; but by the industry of the Exchange brokers, who got the business into their hands, it became a trade, and one perhaps managed with the greatest intrigue, artifice, and trick that ever anything that appeared with a face of honesty could be handled with; for while the brokers held the box, they made the whole Exchange the gamesters, and raised and lowered the prices of stocks as they pleased, and always had both buyers and sellers who stood ready innocently to commit their money to the mercy of their mercenary tongues. This upstart of a trade, having tasted the sweetness of success which generally attends a novel proposal, introduces the illegitimate wandering object I speak of, as a proper engine to find work for the brokers. Thus stock-jobbing nursed projecting, and projecting, in return, has very diligently pimped for its foster-parent, till both are arrived to be public grievances, and indeed are now almost grown scandalous.|$|E
6000|$|Friday, March 31st, 1843.--The {{first month}} of spring is already gone; and still the snow lies deep on hill and valley, and the river is still frozen from bank to bank, {{although}} a late rain has caused pools of water {{to stand on the}} surface of the ice, and the meadows are overflowed into broad lakes. Such a protracted winter has not been known for twenty years, at least. I have almost forgotten the wood-paths and shady <b>places</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> used to know so well last summer; and my views are so much confined to the interior of our mansion, that sometimes, looking out of the window, I am surprised to catch a glimpse of houses, at no great distance, which had quite passed out of my recollection. From present appearances, another month may scarcely suffice to wash away all the snow from the open country; and in the woods and hollows it may linger yet longer. The winter will not have been a day less than five months long; and it would not be unfair to call it seven. A great space, indeed, to miss the smile of Nature, in a single year of human life. Even out of the midst of happiness I have sometimes sighed and groaned; for I love the sunshine and the green woods, and the sparkling blue water; and it seems as if the picture of our inward bliss should be set in a beautiful frame of outward nature. [...] . As to the daily course of our life, I have written with pretty commendable diligence, averaging from two to four hours a day; and the result is seen in various magazines. I might have written more, if it had seemed worth while; but I was content to earn only so much gold as might suffice for our immediate wants, having prospect of official station and emolument which would do away with the necessity of writing for bread. Those prospects have not yet had their fulfilment; and we are well content to wait, because an office would inevitably remove us from our present happy home,--at least from an outward home; for there is an inner one that will accompany us wherever we go. Meantime, the magazine people do not pay their debts; so that we taste some of the inconveniences of poverty. It is an annoyance, not a trouble.|$|E
6000|$|The basin-like plains at {{the foot}} of the Cordillera are in several respects remarkable; that on which the capital of Chile stands is fifteen miles in width, in an east and west line, and of much greater length in a north and south line; it stands 1,750 feet above the sea; its surface appears smooth, but really falls and rises in wide gentle undulations, the hollows {{corresponding}} with the main valleys of the Cordillera: the striking manner in which it abruptly comes up to the foot of this great range has been remarked by every author since the time of Molina. (This plain is partially separated into two basins by a range of hills; the southern half, according to Meyen ("Reise um Erde" [...] Th. 1 s. 274), falls in height, by an abrupt step, of between fifteen and twenty feet.) Near the Cordillera it is composed of a stratified mass of pebbles of all sizes, occasionally including rounded boulders: near its western boundary, it consists of reddish sandy clay, containing some pebbles and numerous fragments of pumice, and sometimes passes into pure sand or into volcanic ashes. At Podaguel, on this western side of the plain, beds of sand are capped by a calcareous tuff, the uppermost layers being generally hard and substalagmitic, and the lower ones white and friable, both together precisely resembling the beds at Coquimbo, which contain recent marine shells. Abrupt, but rounded, hummocks of rock rise out of this plain: those of Sta. Lucia and S. Cristoval are formed of greenstone-porphyry almost entirely denuded of its original covering of porphyritic claystone breccia; on their summits, many fragments of rock (some of them kinds not found in situ) are coated and united together by a white, friable, calcareous tuff, like that found at Podaguel. When this matter was deposited on the summit of S. Cristoval, the water must have stood 946 feet above the surface of the surrounding plain. (Or 2,690 feet above the sea, as measured barometrically by Mr. Eck. This tuff appears to the eye nearly pure; but when placed in acid it leaves a considerable residue of sand and broken crystals, apparently of feldspar. Dr. Meyen ("Reise" [...] Th. 1 s. 269) says he found a similar substance on the neighbouring hill of Dominico (and I found it also on the Cerro Blanco), and he attributes it to the weathering of the stone. In some <b>places</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> examined, its bulk put this view of its origin quite out of the question; and I should much doubt whether the decomposition of a porphyry would, in any case, leave a crust chiefly composed of carbonate of lime. The white crust, which is commonly seen on weathered feldspathic rocks, does not appear to contain any free carbonate of lime.) ...|$|E
