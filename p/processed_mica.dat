Most errors in logistics occur during the picking <b>process.</b> <b>MICA</b> — a mobile assistance system for warehouse workers — unobtrusively navigates the worker on his way through the warehouse and effectively prevents picking errors using RFID technology. Therefore, MICA reduces error rates, job training periods, and the time required for picking and packing, leading to lower costs for warehouse operators and increased customer satisfaction. In this paper you will read about a case study where the MICA prototype was field-tested in the warehouse of a medium-sized enterprise...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we applied 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating methods to {{muscovite}} grains in sands from the modern Red and Yangtze Rivers in order to constrain palaeo and modern erosion patterns and sediment transport <b>processes.</b> <b>Micas</b> in {{the headwaters of the}} Red River and its southern Da River tributary are dominantly Cenozoic, while the northern Lo River tributary shows a typical 160 – 220  Ma population. The lower reaches of the Red River comprise 53 % of such Triassic grains, indicating that the Lo River is the most important net contributor to the modern delta. However, this contrasts with zircon U–Pb data indicating that {{the upper reaches of the}} Red River dominate that mineral group. We suggest that the mismatch reflects the rapid transport of mica relative to zircon in the river and the fact that the Red River is not in equilibrium. We hypothesize that the zircons were eroded &# 62;  8  ka under a regime of stronger monsoon that enhanced erosion in the northern drainage basin, while modern erosion is focused in the south, especially in the Song Chay Massif. Micas from the upper Yangtze River are resolvably older than those in the Red River (230 – 250  Ma), so that this method could be used to test for drainage capture in palaeo-delta sediments. Micas in the modern Yangtze delta are generally much younger than those in the upper reaches and indicate that erosion in the Longmen Shan (Sichuan) and neighbouring regions is more important than the upper Yangtze in supplying sediment, reflecting the stronger monsoon rains in those areas...|$|R

40|$|Macroscopically {{homogenous}} muscovite plate {{from the}} Cruzeiro pegmatite, {{located in the}} Eastern Pegmatite Province in Minas Gerais, may show complex distribution patterns of some trace elements. In geochronological and petrological studies, as for example in the distinction of magmatic and post-magmatic mica, the cause of zoning could be taken into consideration. The complex chemical zoning in the studied mica plate can be best explained by growth in an evolving magma followed by alteration due to percolation of hydrothermal fluids. Enrichment of Rb towards the border is interpreted as resulting from the chemical evolution of the residual magma during crystal growth. The depletion in (IV Al+VI Al) {{as well as the}} increase in (Fe+Mg) and Si along a fracture could be due to the hydrothermal celadonitic substitution of muscovite. This alteration also caused depletion in the contents of Rb, Ga, Y, Nb, Sn, and Zn and residual concentration of Ti.

40|$|AbstractSupported lipid bilayers (SLBs) {{are popular}} models of cell {{membranes}} with potential biotechnological applications {{and an understanding}} of the mechanisms of SLB formation is now emerging. Here we characterize, by combining atomic force microscopy, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, and ellipsometry, the formation of SLBs on mica from sonicated unilamellar vesicles using mixtures of zwitterionic, negatively and positively charged lipids. The results are compared with those we reported previously on silica. As on silica, electrostatic interactions were found to determine the pathway of lipid deposition. However, fundamental differences in the stability of surface-bound vesicles and the mobility of SLB patches were observed, and point out the determining role of the solid support in the SLB-formation process. The presence of calcium was found to have a much more pronounced influence on the lipid deposition <b>process</b> on <b>mica</b> than on silica. Our results indicate a specific calcium-mediated interaction between dioleoylphosphatidylserine molecules and mica. In addition, we show that the use of PLL-g-PEG modified tips considerably improves the AFM imaging of surface-bound vesicles and bilayer patches and evaluate the effects of the AFM tip on the apparent size and shape of these soft structures...|$|R

A clear example of tetrahedrally coordinated Fe a + ions in a natural phlogopite is given. This phlogopite has a very high vermiculitization ability. The Fe z + content of the samples has been determined by two different chemical methods and it is shown that even when precautions are taken to minimize oxidation, the agreement with M 6 ssbauer spectra is poor. During the weathering <b>process</b> of <b>micas,</b> iron plays an important role and therefore information concerning the amount, valence and site occupation of this element is essential.

40|$|The {{promotion}} of strengthening of vanadium oxidation by compound additive of sodium salts is described from the {{changes of the}} vanadium valence state and mineral phase. The results are as follows: during the roasting <b>process,</b> dehydroxy <b>mica</b> converts to the melt, which the composite system mainly contains Na, K, Al, Si, and O. Under the action of NaCl-Na 2 CO 3, ion exchange between sodium and potassium promotes the crystallization of albite from the melt. Na 2 CO 3 enhances the reactivity of quartz. The albite reacts with activated quartz, which promotes the migration of sodium ions and the generation of vanadate. Under the action of NaCl-Na 2 SO 4, The crystallization of spinel in the melt is promoted {{and that of the}} albite is inhibited. Under the action of Na 2 SO 4 -Na 2 CO 3, the permeability of ore is deteriorated. The ion exchange process and the vanadium oxidation is inhibited from the melt. The composite additive with three sodium salts shows a stronger promoting effect on vanadium oxidation. The contribution of NaCl and Na 2 CO 3 to V(V) in roasted slag was the highest among three sodium salts. With a certain ratio of NaCl and Na 2 CO 3, the low content of Na 2 SO 4 did not significantly affect the V(V) content in roasted slag...|$|R
40|$|The lithology, age, {{geological}} setting, {{structural and}} metamorphic {{history of the}} granitic mylonites from the Mylonite Zone (MZ) in southwestern Sweden have been studied extensively. The deformation history, growth of microstructures, intensity of deformation, changes in mineral compositions, and pressure-temperature conditions of deformation have, however, not been addressed. In this study, powder X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, electron microprobe analysis and transmission electron microscopy of micas, chlorite, and plagioclase are combined to understand the physical and textural changes experienced by the rocks during mylonitization. It is shown that the occurrence of foliated micas in shear bands, recrystallization of quartz and biotite, and undulatory extinction in quartz grains were not uniform throughout the samples studied. Occurrence of dislocations and low-angle grain boundaries confirm that deformation occurred largely by glide dislocations. The low-angle grain boundaries observed are formed by the re-arrangement of these dislocations during grain size reduction <b>processes.</b> The <b>micas</b> show {{a high degree of}} spatial stacking order, but spatial stacking disorder in micas and chlorites has also been found. Ordered stacking faults are formed during low strain while disordered stacking faults are formed under high strain conditions. Occurrence of both ordered and disordered stacking faults indicates that the intensity of deformation was not uniform through the entire MZ. Moreover, the chemical composition of plagioclase shows that the exsolution lamellae observed with optical and electron microscopy are due to Ca-subsolidus reactions during low temperature deformation. Several substitution reactions occurring in the micas indicate that deformation took place between 0. 3 and 0. 4 GPa, at a temperature higher than 500 degreesC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{alteration}} experiments ofphlogopite with 0. 01 N HC 1 {{solution containing}} 0. 1 M NaC 1 at 50 *, 80 * and 120 "C {{have been carried}} out to aid in the understanding of the dissolution <b>process</b> of <b>mica</b> and the formation of secondary phases uch as vermiculite and interstratified mica/vermiculite. Twenty milligrams of phlogopite samples were suspended in 20 ml or 100 ml of leaching solution. In these xperiments, the dissolution ofphlogopite occurred incongruently, where the preferential release of K occurred in almost all stages of the alteration reaction. In the 100 ml experiments, the priority in dissolution in the initial stage was in the order; K> Fe> Mg, Al> Si. This supports that phlogopite leaching is controlled by the mineral structure. At 80 * and 50 "C in the 20 ml experiments, the release of all elements except for K was nearly congruent. At 120 "(2 in the 20 ml experiments, the dissolution was outwardly incongruent, which Fe decreased remarkably after six days and A 1 was released most slowly compared with all other elements in phlogopite. This is probably due to the precipitation of secondary phases uch as aluminum and iron oxides and/or hydroxides. Vermiculite and Rl-type interstratified mica/vermiculite, containing 70 - 50 % mica, were formed in the alteration process of phlogopite. The following two processes were confirmed for the formation of interstratified structure: Interstratified structure was formed (1) directly from phlogopite or (2) from vermiculite which was produced earlier from phlogopite by regaining of K from the ambient solution. It may depend on the release rate of K from phlogopite whether mica-vermiculite layer sequences develop or vermiculite-vermiculite sequences do...|$|R
40|$|The 33 -mer gliadin peptide, LQLQPF(PQPQLPY) 3 PQPQPF, is {{a highly}} {{immunogenic}} peptide involved in celiac disease and probably in other immunopathologies associated with gliadin. Herein, dynamic light scattering measurements showed that 33 -mer, in the micromolar concentration range, forms polydisperse nano- and micrometer range particles in aqueous media. This behaviour is reminiscent of classical association of colloids and we hypothesized that the 33 -mer peptide self-assembles into micelles {{that could be the}} precursors of 33 -mer oligomers in water. Deposition of 33 -mer peptide aqueous solution on bare mica generated nano- and microstructures with different morphologies as revealed by atomic force microscopy. At 6 μM, the 33 -mer is organised in isolated and clusters of spherical nanostructures. In the 60 to 250 μM concentration range, the spherical oligomers associated mainly in linear and annular arrangements and structures adopting a "sheet" type morphology appeared. At higher concentrations (610 μM), mainly filaments and plaques immersed in a background of nanospherical structures were detected. The occurrence of different morphologies of oligomers and finally the filaments suggests that the unique specific geometry of the 33 -mer oligomers has {{a crucial role in the}} subsequent condensation and organization of their fractal structures into the final filaments. The self-assembly <b>process</b> on <b>mica</b> is described qualitatively and quantitatively by a fractal diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) behaviour with the fractal dimension in the range of 1. 62 ± 0. 02 to 1. 73 ± 0. 03. Secondary structure evaluation of the oligomers by Attenuated Total Reflection FTIR spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) revealed the existence of a conformational equilibrium of self-assembled structures, from an extended conformation to a more folded parallel beta elongated structures. Altogether, these findings provide structural and morphological information about supramolecular organization of the 33 -mer peptide, which might offer new perspectives for the understanding and treatment of gliadin intolerance disorders.

40|$|The Eocene Gregoriou Plutonic Complex (GPC) {{is located}} in the easternmost finger of the three-legged Chalkidiki Peninsula (northern Greece), and intrudes the {{metamorphic}} basement of the Serbo-Macedonian Massif to the north, and the Circum Rhodope Belt to the south. The intrusive rocks comprising the GPC are studied {{on the basis of their}} mineral chemistry, whole-rock major and trace element geochemistry, and Sr and Nd isotopic composition. The rocks have been subdivided, on the basis of petrography, into a basic- intermediate group bearing hornblende and biotite, with the basic rocks showing not strong evidence of cumulus, and an intermediate- acid group bearing biotite only; common mineralogical assemblage is made up of quartz, perthitic orthoclase, plagioclase, and allanite, epidote, titanite, apatite, and opaques as accessories. On the basis of geochemistry the most basic rocks are cumulates, whereas the others are intermediate and acid in silica. Metamorphic xenoliths are very common, whereas magmatic enclaves are present, yet not widespread, and strong field evidence of magma mixing are restricted to some areas. Some rocks of GPC are similar to rocks of the Sithonia Plutonic Complex on the basis of elemental and isotopic composition. Cumulitic samples show evidence of amp ± bt ± pl, although textural evidence of cumulus processes (e. g. layering) are scarce. A filter pressing process that squeezed out some portions of the residual liquid determined the ‘cumulitic’ signature of some samples. A process of Mixing plus Fractional Crystallization followed by an Assimilation plus Fractional Crystallization process is considered responsible for the evolution of GPC. The first step explains the chemical variation in the less evolved intermediate rocks, whereas the second step explains the geochemical variations of the remaining intermediate-acid rocks. The least evolved rock of GPC represents the mafic end-member, whereas some leucogranites found in the Sithonia Plutonic Complex represent the acid end-member of the first step. The average of less evolved intermediate-acid GPC rocks represents the parental magma of the AFC <b>process,</b> whereas a <b>mica</b> gneiss, found in the basement of Sithonia Plutonic Complex, represents the contaminant. Tectonomagmatic characterization of the GPC rocks indicates continental arc environment, and the mafic magma is presumably the result of melting of a repeatedly metasomatized and enriched in LILE mantle. Accordingly, GPC magmatism is connected with the subduction events, which affected the area since the Jurassic...|$|R
