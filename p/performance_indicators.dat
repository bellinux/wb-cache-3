Therefore, to improve {{the accuracy of the}} predictive auto-scaling systems, researchers have strived to improve the accuracy of the prediction techniques that are being used in the auto-scaling systems (see [4] for a comprehensive overview of the auto-scaling prediction techniques). According to [4], the most dominant prediction technique in the IaaS layer of the cloud auto-scaling domain is time-series prediction. Time-series prediction techniques use the historical values of a <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> to forecast its future value. Although in recent years many innovative time-series prediction techniques have been proposed for the auto-scaling systems, the existing approaches neglect the influence of the <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> pattern (i.e., how the <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> values change over time) on the accuracy of the time-series prediction techniques. This paper proposes an autonomic prediction suite using the decision fusion technique for the resource provisioning of the IaaS layer of the cloud computing environment. The proposed suite identifies the pattern of the <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> and accordingly selects the most accurate technique to predict the near future value of the <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> for better resource management.
