This study aimed to evaluate the influence of pre-planting, planting and sidedress N application on oat residue decomposition, on soil N immobilisation and remineralisation and on N uptake by maize plants in no-till oat/maize sequential cropping. Undisturbed soil cores of 10 and 20 cm diameter were collected from the 0 - 15 cm layer of a no-till Red Latossol, when the oat cover crop was in the milk-grain stage. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted simultaneously. Experiment A, established in the 10 cm diameter cores and without plant cultivation, was used to asses N dynamics in soil and oat residues. Experiment B, established in the 20 cm diameter cores and with maize cultivation, was used to assess plant growth and N uptake. An amount of 6. 0 Mg ha- 1 dry matter of oat residues was spread {{on the surface of the}} cores. A rate of 90 kg N ha- 1 applied as ammonium sulphate in both experiments was split in pre-planting, planting and sidedress applications as follows: (a) 00 - 00 - 00 (control), (b) 90 - 00 - 00 (<b>pre-planting</b> <b>application,</b> 20 days before planting), (c) 00 - 90 - 00 (planting application), (d) 00 - 30 - 60 (split in a planting and a sidedress application 31 days after emergence), (e) 00 - 00 - 00 * (control, without oat residue) and (f) 90 - 00 - 00 * (<b>pre-planting</b> <b>application,</b> without oat residue). The N concentration and N content in oat residues were not affected during decomposition by N fertilisation. Most of the fertiliser NH 4 +-N was converted into NO 3 [...] N within 20 days after application. A significant decrease in NO 3 [...] N contents in the 0 - 4 cm layer was observed in all treatments between 40 and 60 days after the oat residue placement on the soil surface, suggesting the occurrence of N immobilisation in this period. Considering that most of the inorganic N was converted into NO 3 - and that no immobilisation of the pre planting fertiliser N occurred at the time of its application, it was possible to conclude that pre-planting applied N was prone to losses by leaching. On the other hand, with split N applications, maize plants showed N deficiency symptoms before sidedress application. Two indications for fertiliser-N management in no-till oat/maize sequential cropping could be suggested: (a) in case of split application, the sidedress should be earlier than 30 days after emergence, and (b) if integral application is preferred to save field operations, this should be done at planting...|$|E
40|$|The {{yield of}} maize (Zea mays L.) on sandy soils with high {{rainfall}} regimes is generally low due to poor nutrient use efficiency.

The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of fertilizer application methods on the growth, yield and agronomic characteristics of maize on a sandy soil with approximately 1, 350 mm of rainfall during crop growth. Field experiments were conducted on Oxic Paleustults (Korat series) with a low cation exchange capacity (CEC) of 2 – 4 cmol kg– 1. Three to four split applications of the fertilizer increased the grain yield from 2. 7 to 3. 3 – 4. 5 Mg ha– 1. There was a greater crop growth rate (CGR) and relative growth rate (RGR) with the split applications of fertilizer during 30 – 60 d after emergence (DAE). The highest agronomic efficiency (AE) resulted from a three-split application. However, application of fertilizer later than 45 DAE had only a low effective rate.

O objetivo foi quantificar o N dos fertilizantes imobilizado no solo (15 N-orgânico), no sulco de adubação, e o N-recuperado na planta nos estádios de 5 - 6 folhas, 11 - 12 folhas, florescimento e maturação fisiológica. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi inteiramente casualizado com parcelas subdivididas e três repetições. As parcelas foram constituídas das fontes U e SA, e as subparcelas, das épocas de aplicação de N. O experimento foi realizado em Latossolo Vermelho ácrico típico fase cerrado subcadocifólio, na Fazenda Floresta do Lobo-Pinusplan, em Uberlândia (MG). Na aplicação em pré-semeadura, a máxima imobilização foi observada aos 19 dias da aplicação do SA (13, 3 kg ha- 1 ou 16, 6 % do N-aplicado) e aos 40 dias da aplicação da U (13, 7 kg ha- 1 ou 17, 1 % do N-aplicado). A maior quantidade de N fertilizante assimilado pela planta ocorreu entre os estádios de 5 - 6 e 11 - 12 folhas (44, 1 e 23, 4 % do N-SA e N-U, respectivamente). Na aplicação em cobertura, a imobilização do N-SA foi inferior a 3, 5 % do N-aplicado, enquanto a imobilização do N-U foi de 9, 9 kg ha- 1 e 7, 9 kg ha- 1, respectivamente, nos estádios de 11 - 12 folhas e florescimento. Até o estádio de maturação fisiológica da cultura, 61, 8 % do N-SA e 42, 0 % do N-U foram recuperados pelo milho. Em média, nos estádios de 11 - 12 folhas e de florescimento, para cada kg de N-SA imobilizado, as plantas de milho recuperaram 8, 0 e 16, 7 kg ha- 1 de N fertilizante em pré-semeadura e cobertura, respectivamente. Nos tratamentos com U, a média foi de 3, 1 kg ha- 1, independentemente da época de aplicação. As produtividades de grãos obtidas com SA e U, independentemente da época de aplicação, foram de 7. 824 kg ha- 1 e 6. 977 kg ha- 1, respectivamente. Na adubação em pré-semeadura do milho, o SA apresentou maior rapidez na ciclagem do N imobilizado-mineralizado ("turnover"), em relação a U, e, conseqüentemente, causou maior assimilação do N pela cultura. Em cobertura, no sulco de adubação, somente houve imobilização do N-U, retardando a sua assimilação pela planta. In {{order to}} evaluate the amount of immobilized N {{and the amount of}} N-fertilizer recovered by corn plants at the stages: 5 - 6 leaves, 11 - 12 leaves, flowering, and physiologic maturation, ammonium sulfate (AS) and urea (U), labeled with 15 N, were applied to maize in a no-till system 43 days before planting and 31 days after planting at a single rate of 80 kg ha- 1 of N incorporated at 5 - 7 cm depth and in a spacing of 0. 8 m. Corn was sown after black oat (Avena strigosa Schieb.). The treatments were applied in split-plots set up in the completely randomized design with three replications. The original plots with two N sources were halved for the application time factor (pre-planting and top-dressing application). The field experiment was carried out on a Typic Acrustox on the farm Floresta do Lobo, Uberlandia, state of Minas Gerais. Results show that in <b>pre-planting</b> <b>application</b> treatments the maximum N-AS immobilization occurred 19 days after the fertilizer application (13. 3 kg ha- 1 or 16. 6 % of N applied) whereas the maximum immobilization of N-U occurred 40 days after fertilizer application (13. 7 kg ha- 1 or 17. 1 % of N applied). The highest amount of 15 N-fertilizer taken up by corn plants was observed between the stages 5 - 6 leaves and 11 - 12 leaves, at ratios of 44. 1 % of N-AS and 23. 4 % of N-U. The immobilized N in the treatment with top-dressed AS was lower than 3. 5 % of the applied N whereas in the treatment with top-dressed U it was 9. 9 kg ha- 1 and 7. 9 kg ha- 1 at the stages 11 - 12 leaves and flowering, respectively. The recovery of N-fertilizer measured at the stage of physiologic maturation in the treatments with AS and U was 61. 8 % and 42. 0 % respectively. The 15 N-fertilizer amounts recovered by corn plants per kg of 15 N immobilized in the treatments with AS were 8. 0 kg ha- 1 and 16. 7 kg ha- 1 respectively for pre-planting and top-dressing application. Independent of the application time, the ratio N-fertilizer recovery/immobilized N-fertilizer in the U treatments was 3. 1 kg ha- 1. The highest corn yields were obtained in the AS treatments (grain mean of 7, 824 kg ha- 1), independent of the application time. The average crop yield in the treatments with U in both application periods was 6, 977 kg ha- 1.

However, the impact of Persian darnel on crop yield has not been quantified. Producers are managing this weed {{with a range of}} weed control practices. In some instances management practices have lost their effectiveness. Integrated weed management practices, such as crop rotation, might improve the management of Persian darnel. This thesis quantifies the effect of crop type and crop seeding rate on Persian darnel fecundity and impact on crop yield. Experiments were established in Bozeman, MT in 2000 and 2001. Crops were seeded at 1 X, 1. 5 X and 2 X the MSU recommended rate, and Persian darnel was established to create a range of densities from 0 to 2, 000 seedlings/m 2. Yield was related to crop and weed seedling densities, using a combined modified hyperbolic function. Increasing crop density increased crop yield and often reduced weed fecundity. Crop seeding rate was inefficient at increasing crop yield or reducing weed fecundity, likely due to variability in crop seedling establishment. Crop yield loss was estimated to reach 83 %, 70 % and 57 % for spring wheat, canola and sunflower, respectively at high Persian darnel densities.

40|$|Abstract: Governing bodies {{throughout}} the world, particularly in Europe, are now implementing legislative mandates {{with the objective}} of decreasing dependence on pesticides in agriculture to increase consumer and environmental safety. In order to reduce the risks associated with pesticide applications and reduce dependency on their use, Directives will promote low pesticide-input by implementing integrated pest management (IPM), and provide the means to establish the necessary conditions and measures to employ these practices, as well as to ensure security of commercial products. One approach includes the use of biological control agents and their products as alternatives to synthetic agro-chemicals. Trichoderma spp. are widely studied fungi and are among the most commonly used microbial biological control agents (MBCAs) in agriculture. They are presently marketed as bio-pesticides, biofertilizers, growth enhancers and stimulants of natural resistance. The efficacy of this fungus can be attributed to their ability to protect plants, enhance vegetative growth and contain pathogen populations under numerous agricultural conditions, as well as to act as soil amendments/inoculants for improvement of nutrient ability, decomposition and biodegradation.

Four field trials were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} organic C amendments (OCA) on N dynamics and spring wheat (Triticum durum L.) harvest parameters proceeding early- and late-broccoli (Brassica olecerea var italica L.) systems in 2009 and 2010. The experimental controls represented the traditional grower practice of incorporated broccoli crop residue (CR-control) and the <b>pre-plant</b> <b>application</b> of N fertilizer (CRN-control) to subsequent spring wheat. Alternative practices were compared to the controls, which included broccoli crop residue removal (CR-removal), an oat (Avena sativa L.) cover crop (CC-oat), and three different OCA of wheat straw (OCA-straw), yard waste (OCA-yard), or used cooking oil (OCA-oil). The treatments, which demonstrated reduced autumn soil mineral N (SMN) concentrations after broccoli harvest, relative to the CR-control, were CR-removal, OCA-straw, and OCA-oil. Although CR-removal and OCA-straw indicated a reduced potential for autumn soil N losses in the early-broccoli system, these practices are not recommended for growers because subsequent spring wheat yield and profit margins were reduced compared to the CR- and CRN-controls. The OCA-oil reduced autumn SMN concentrations by 53 to 112 kg N ha− 1 relative to the CR-control after both early- and late-broccoli harvest, suggesting a larger potential for reduced autumn soil N losses, compared to all other treatments. No detrimental effects resulted from the OCA-oil treatment on the subsequent spring yield or grain N. The OCA-oil reduced spring wheat profit margins relative to the CR-control, like the OCA-straw and CR-removal treatments, however profit margins were similar between the OCA-oil and the CRN-control. Therefore, in areas with a high risk of environmental N contamination, growers should consider the OCA-oil practice after cole crop harvest to minimize the risk of N losses...|$|R

Trials were conducted in 1984 to obtain addi-tional information on variety performance. Conditions in the Madras test did not permit a proper evaluation of Chinese, Herz-Freza, Ackerperle, Diana, Alladin, and Petite. All were similar in yield. However, at Powell Butte the 3, 775 lb/A yield of Herz-Freza was significantly greater than the other varieties. The yield of Petite was similar in both trials but the production of seed from the other varieties was greatest at Powell Butte. Excellent seed yields were also obtained from Alladin, Frederick, Herz-Freza, and Diana at Redmond in 1983. Climatic conditions in Crook and Deschutes counties may be the most favorable for fababean production. Fababeans continue to interest Central Oregon growers because the crop is well adapted to cool climates and short growing seasons, but market development looms as a gigantic challenge. This annual legume has excellent potential for rotation with cereal crops. The greatest opportunity in our area appears to be for seed production, reseeding, or protein supplement in livestock rations. Therefore, two trials were conducted in 1984 to obtain additional information on adaptation of varie-ties.

In both microcosm and field experiments, application of herbicides affected disease development as judged by the slope of disease progress curves. Biocontrol activity of an indigenous isolate (D 1) of B. cepacia also was reduced significantly by pendimethalin and prometryn in both field experiments. Commercially available isolate (Deny®) of B. cepacia as a soil drench and as a seed treatment failed to protect cotton seedlings against R. solani-induced damping-off in both field experiments.

40|$|Current {{nitrogen}} (N) {{management strategies}} for worldwide cereal production systems {{are characterized by}} low N use efficiency (NUE), environmental contamination, and considerable ongoing debate regarding {{what can be done}} to improve N fertilizer management. Development of innovative strategies that improve NUE and minimize off-field losses is crucial to sustaining cereal-based farming. In this paper, we review the major managerial causes for low NUE, including (1) poor synchrony between fertilizer N and crop demand, (2) uniform field applications to spatially variable landscapes that commonly vary in crop N need, and (3) failure to account for temporally variable influences on crop N needs. Poor synchronization is mainly due to large <b>pre-plant</b> <b>applications</b> of fertilizer N, resulting in high levels of inorganic soil N long before rapid crop uptake occurs. Uniform applications within fields discount the fact that N supplies from the soil, crop N uptake, and crop response are spatially variable. Current N management decisions also overlook year-to-year weather variations and sometimes fail to account for soil N mineralized in warm, wet years, ignoring indigenous N supply. The key to optimizing tradeoffs amongst yield, profit, and environmental protection is to achieve synchrony between N supply and crop demand, while accounting for spatial and temporal variability in soil N. While some have advocated a soil-based management zones (MZ) approach as a means to direct variable N applications and improve NUE, this method disregards yearly variation in weather. Thus, it seems unlikely that the soil-based MZ concept alone will be adequate for variable application of crop N inputs. Alternatively, we propose utilizing emerging computer and electronic technologies that focus on the plant to assess N status and direct in-season spatially variable N applications. Several of these technologies are reviewed and discussed. One technology showing promise is ground-based active-light reflectance measurements converted to NDVI or other similar indices. Preliminary research shows this approach addresses the issue of spatial variability and is accomplished at a time within the growing season so that N inputs are synchronized to match crop N uptake. We suggest this approach may be improved by first delineating a field into MZ using soil or other field properties to modify the decision associated with ground-based reflectance sensing. While additional adaptive research is needed to refine these newer technologies and subsequent N management decisions, preliminary results are encouraging. We expect N use efficiency can be greatly enhanced using this plant-based responsive strategy for N management in cereals...|$|R

40|$|Management {{decisions}} about root zone optimization {{should not be}} limited to corn hybrid selection, because even triple-stacked hybrids with corn rootworm resistance will not produce satisfactory yields if soil structure or chemical properties limit corn growth or nutrient uptake. Growing high yield corn is possible without intensive tillage systems, as numerous studies have shown no-till yielding equal to chisel or moldboard plowing for corn following soybean. Although maintaining soil-test P and K concentrations well above critical levels is important to achieving optimum corn yields, strip-till corn has not yielded consistently higher when P and K fertilizers were deep-banded versus broadcast applied. The relative yield benefits associated with broadcast versus deep-banded application of these nutrients seems to be related to soil moisture availability in the zones of nutrient placement during growing periods when plants take up the majority of their P and K requirements. Corn roots and plant populations suffer when corn rows are positioned too close to anhydrous ammonia or urea ammonium-nitrate N sources incorporated to shallow depths. Precision guidance is very beneficial for optimum corn row positioning at least 5 inches removed from the N fertilizer zone following spring <b>pre-plant</b> N <b>application</b> at high rates.

40|$|Governing bodies {{throughout}} the world, particularly in Europe, are now implementing legislative mandates {{with the objective}} of decreasing dependence on pesticides in agriculture to increase consumer and environmental safety. In order to reduce the risks associated with pesticide applications and reduce dependency on their use, Directives will promote low pesticide-input by implementing integrated pest management (IPM), and provide the means to establish the necessary conditions and measures to employ these practices, as well as to ensure security of commercial products. One approach includes the use of biological control agents and their products as alternatives to synthetic agro-chemicals. Trichoderma spp. are widely studied fungi and are among the most commonly used microbial biological control agents (MBCAs) in agriculture. They are presently marketed as bio-pesticides, biofertilizers, growth enhancers and stimulants of natural resistance. The efficacy of this fungus can be attributed to their ability to protect plants, enhance vegetative growth and contain pathogen populations under numerous agricultural conditions, as well as to act as soil amendments/inoculants for improvement of nutrient ability, decomposition and biodegradation. The living fungal spores (active substance) are incorporated in various formulations, both traditional and innovative, for applications as foliar sprays, <b>pre-planting</b> <b>applications</b> to seed or propagation material, post-pruning treatments, incorporation in the soil during seeding or transplant, watering by irrigation or applied as a root drench or dip. Trichoderma-based preparations are marketed worldwide and used for crop protection of various plant pathogens or increase the plant growth and productivity in diverse cultivated environments such as fields, greenhouses, nurseries; in the production of a variety of horticultural, fruits, trees and ornamental crops. A survey was conducted of Trichoderma-containing products found on the international market to obtain an overall perspective of the: 1) geographical distribution, 2) product composition and identity of Trichoderma species selected, 3) contents combined with Trichoderma in the products - other microbial species or substances in the mix, 4) number of products available globally and geographically, 5) number of products registered or having use specifications, 6) product formulations and applications, 7) manufacturer claims - target use, target pests, product type and effects of applications. The largest distribution of Trichoderma bioproducts is found in Asia, succeeded by Europe, South- Central America and North America. The majority of the labels indicated fungicidal properties, but only 38 % of the marketed merchandise are registered. Ten Trichoderma species are specifically indicated, but many labels indicate a generic Trichoderma sp. or spp. mix in the list of ingredients. The most common formulation is a wettable powder, followed by granules. Generally, Trichoderma are applied to the seed or propagation material at the time of planting, then the secondary use is during plant development. On the whole, the target use is for the control of soilborne fungal pathogens such as Rhizoctonia, Pythium and Sclerotinia, and a few foliar pathogens such as Botrytis and Alternaria; whereas the minor use indication is for plant growth promotion.

JankeThe goal of {{this study}} is to clarify the {{influence}} of organic fertilizer sources on vegetable crop yield under different production systems. This research hypothesized that organic soil amendments will produce healthy and vigorous plants with similar or higher yields while improving soil organic matter levels compared to conventional amendments. Applying organic fertilizer sources can be cost-prohibitive; moreover, synchronizing timing of crop nitrogen demand with soil plant available nitrogen is essential to maximizing yield and reducing nitrogen pollution to the environment. The objectives of this study are to evaluate yield in relation to soil fertility status at different fertility rates for organic and conventional management in field and high tunnel production systems, to measure plant nutrient status in crop petioles and compare it to available mineral N levels in soil at different growing stages, and to determine the effect of nitrogen availability of organic compared to conventional fertilization on plant available nitrogen and crop yield under both systems. A latin square experimental design was conducted from 2008 to 2010 at Kansas State University Research Center in Olathe KS to evaluate an organically managed vegetable rotation of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. ‘Bush Celebrity’) and pac choi (Brassica rapa L. ‘Mei Qing’) under three fertility rates; control, low (composted poultry manure), and high (composted poultry manure and fish hydrolyzate) in contrast with conventionally managed soils under two production systems (field and high tunnel). The effect of these four contrasting systems was measured on plant and soil nutrient status. All plots had cover crops of rye during the winter and buckwheat in the summer between pac choi crops. Soil nitrate-N (NO₃-N) and ammonium-N (NH₄-N) were measured, as well as petiole sap nitrate (NO₃⁻). In tomato, additional soluble fertilizers had no direct effect on yield in both field and high tunnel. Compost application had a positive effect on organic matter. In pac choi, additional liquid fertilizer helped organic field plots obtain maximum yield. Soil mineral nitrogen were affected by production system and fertility source, but statistical significance varied by crop and stage. Petiole sap reflected treatment regimens but not necessarily soil N status at each plant stage. The study also addressed long term management practices on organic and conventional available nitrogen. An incubation study on the soil at the conclusion of the field experiment explored the relationship between N mineralization from potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) compared to Illinois Soil Nitrogen Test (ISNT) in control and <b>pre-plant</b> <b>application</b> fertility treatment for both field and high tunnel systems.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyDavid B. MengelCorn (Zea mays) is an {{important}} cereal crop in Kansas primarily used as livestock feed for cattle in the feedlots, {{and there has been}} increased use of corn for ethanol production as well. According to the USDA National Agriculture Statistics approximately 1. 7 million hectares of corn is planted each year in Kansas, with an average yield ranging from 5, 750 - 7, 750 kg ha[superscript]- 1 within the last five years (2005 - 2009). With this variability in yield and volatility of crop and fertilizer prices over that same period, it seems logical that optimum nitrogen or N rates may vary. A series of 14 field experiments were conducted across Kansas from 2006 through 2009 to address this issue. Specific experiments included: evaluating optimum N rates from side-dressing nitrogen fertilizer; timing of nitrogen <b>application,</b> <b>pre-plant</b> vs. split <b>applications</b> and normal side-dress V- 6 -V- 9 vs. late side-dress V- 14 -V- 16; N response of corn to a late side-dress of nitrogen fertilizer; and the evaluation of optical sensors for making in season N recommendations. The specific objectives of this research were to: a. Determine the optimum N application rate and timing to optimize corn grain yields in different corn producing regions in Kansas. b. Confirm or revise the current K-State soil test based N recommendation system for corn. c. Evaluate N management strategies using the GreenSeeker, Crop Circle, and SPAD meter, crop sensors. d. Develop draft GreenSeeker, Crop Circle, and SPAD sensor algorithms for producers to use. Grain corn yields were responsive to N at all but 3 sites. Grain yields obtained at the sites ranged from 3, 460 to 15, 480 kg ha[superscript]- 1. Optimum N rates varied from 0 to 246 kg N ha[superscript]- 1. This work suggests that current K-State N fertilizer recommendations for corn need revisions due to over recommendation of N. Including different coefficients for irrigated and dry land corn along with N recovery terms would create a more accurate N recommendation system that more closely reflects the results obtained in these experiments, and provide a significant improvement over the current system.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyDavid B. MengelGrain Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) {{is one of}} {{the most}} drought and stress {{tolerant}} crops grown in Kansas. For this reason, much of the sorghum is grown in high risk environments where other crops are more likely to fail or be unprofitable. Efficient sorghum cropping systems should not only produce high yields and use inputs such as nitrogen efficiently, but they should also remove as much risk as possible for a successful crop, and give farmers more flexibility in making input decisions. The price of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has increased substantially in recent years. Current retail prices for commonly used N fertilizers range from $ 0. 88 to $ 1. 50 per kilogram of N in Kansas. Thus, a farmer could easily invest $ 50 -$ 100 per hectare in N, depending on the rate of N needed and the source used. Practices which allow farmers to assess crop potential as late as possible after planting before applying costly inputs like fertilizer, can increase the potential for a profitable return on those inputs in risky environments. Currently, most sorghum growers routinely apply all the N fertilizer prior to planting, sometimes as much as 6 months prior. The current Kansas State University (KSU) nitrogen recommendation is yield goal based and performs well when the grower is able to predict yield six months or more in advance of harvest. However, yield is quite variable and difficult to predict. Because long range weather and yield predictions are not very reliable, could deferring making N application decisions until later in the season when yield can be more accurately predicted reduce risk? Can the use of active sensors provide a better estimate of yield potential and nitrogen needs sometime after planting? If they can, how late can the decision be made and how best should the fertilizer N be applied? Several studies were conducted throughout Kansas to look at the effect of N rate, N <b>application</b> timing (<b>pre-plant,</b> side dress, or combinations of the two) and method of application on sorghum yield and N use efficiency. The studies were also designed to examine the potential of using optical sensors to predict optimum N rate for post-planting applications as a means of avoiding the use of soil tests to estimate soil N contributions. The objectives of this research were: a. to validate the KSU N fertilizer recommendations for grain sorghum grown in rotation with crops such as soybeans and wheat, b. to determine the effect of both preplant and midseason N applications on the growth and yield potential of grain sorghum, and to determine the optimal timing and method for midseason N applications on grain sorghum, and, c. to assess the potential of optical sensing of the growing crop to refine N recommendations using in-season applications during the growing season. This thesis will summarize the results from the various experiments we completed to achieve these objectives. The KSU N fertilizer recommendations for grain sorghum may need some revisions. This research suggests that including coefficients relating to N use efficiency may be necessary to get more accurate N recommendations. Both pre-plant and midseason N applications increased the yield of grain sorghum whenever a response to N was observed. There was no negative effect of applying all the nitrogen midseason at 30 - 40 days after planting when compared to <b>pre-plant</b> <b>applications.</b> Injecting nitrogen fertilizer below the soil surface had higher yields than other methods of midseason N applications such as surface banding or surface broadcasting, especially when a significant rainfall event did not occur within a few days of application.

Environmental Protection Agency as the {{anthropogenic}} addition of nutrients, in addition to any natural processes, causing adverse effects or impairments to the beneficial uses of a water body {{has been identified as}} one of the most significant environmental problems facing sensitive estuaries and coastal waters. Understanding the timing of nutrient inputs into those waters through remote sensing observables helps define monitoring and mitigation strategies. Remotely sensed data products can trace both forcings and effects of the nutrient system from landscape to estuary. This project is focused on extracting nutrient information from the landscape. The timing of nutrients entering coastal waters from the land boundary is greatly influenced by hydrologic processes, but can also be affected by the timing of nutrient additions across the landscape through natural or anthropogenic means. Non-point source nutrient additions to watersheds are often associated with specific seasonal cycles, such as decomposition of organic materials in fall and winter or addition of fertilizers to crop lands in the spring. These seasonal cycles or phenology may in turn be observed through the use of satellite sensors. Characterization of the phenology of various land cover types may be of particular interest in Gulf of Mexico estuarine systems with relatively short pathways between intensively managed systems and the land/estuarine boundary. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the capability of monitoring phenology of specific classes of land, such as agriculture and managed timberlands, at a refined watershed level. The extraction of phenological information from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data record is accomplished using analytical tools developed for NASA at Stennis Space Center: the Time Series Product Tool and the Phenological Parameters Estimation Tool. MODIS reflectance data (product MOD 09) were used to compute the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, which is sensitive to changes in vegetation canopies.
