Harvey argues that postmodernity is an escape from [...] "Fordism", a term coined by Antonio Gramsci to describe the mode of industrial regulation and accumulation which prevailed during the Keynesian era of economic policy in OECD countries from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Fordism for Harvey is associated with Keynesianism in that the first concerns methods of production and capital-labor relations while the latter concerns economic policy and regulation. <b>Post-fordism</b> is therefore one of the basic aspects of postmodernity from Harvey's point of view.|$|E
50|$|Production methods {{based on}} Fordism {{are no longer}} the primary method of {{industrial}} production. There are three main driving forces behind the emergence of 'Post-Fordism.' They are the rising of new technologies, internationalization and the paradigm shift from Fordism to <b>post-Fordism.</b> Post Fordism is based on flexible production, rising incomes for polyvalent skilled workers and the service class and increased profits based on technological and other innovations. Also <b>post-Fordism</b> accumulation will be more oriented to world-wide demand, not so much on demand within a state. <b>Post-Fordism</b> is more demand than supply-driven. As a labour process, <b>post-Fordism</b> can be defined as a flexible production process based on flexible systems and an appropriately flexible workforce.|$|E

50|$|The main {{criticism}} of <b>post-Fordism</b> asserts that <b>post-Fordism</b> mistakes {{the nature of}} the Fordist revolution and that Fordism was not in crisis, but was simply evolving and will continue to evolve. Other critics believe that <b>post-Fordism</b> does exist, but coexists with Fordism. The automobile industry has combined Fordist and post-Fordist strategies, using both mass production and flexible specialization. Ford introduced flexibility into mass production, so that Fordism could continue to evolve. Those who advocate <b>post-Fordism,</b> however, note that criticism that focuses primarily on flexible specialization ignores post-Fordist changes in other areas of life and that flexible specialization cannot be looked at alone when examining <b>post-Fordism.</b> Another criticism is that <b>post-Fordism</b> relies too heavily on the examples of the Third Italy and Japan. Some believe that Japan is neither Fordist nor post-Fordist and that vertical disintegration and mass production go hand in hand. Others argue that the new, smaller firms in Italy didn’t develop autonomously, but are a product of the vertical disintegration of the large Fordist firms who contracted lower value-added work to smaller enterprises. Other criticisms argue that flexible specialization is not happening on any great scale, and smaller firms have always existed alongside mass production. Another main criticism is that we are too much in the midst to judge whether or not there really is a new system of production.|$|E
50|$|<b>Post-Fordism</b> can {{be applied}} in a wider context to {{describe}} a whole system of modern social processes. Because <b>post-Fordism</b> describes {{the world as it}} is today, various thinkers have different views of its form and implications. As the theory continues to evolve, it is commonly divided into three schools of thought: the Regulation School, Flexible Specialization, and Neo-Schumpeterianism.|$|E

5000|$|The Neo-Schumpeterian {{approach}} to <b>post-Fordism</b> {{is based upon}} the theory of Kondratiev Waves (also known as Long Waves).

5000|$|Scholars {{view this}} {{recession}} more importantly as {{a representation of}} a larger structural shift from a Fordism economic production system underpinning many North American industries, toward one of <b>Post-Fordism.</b> [...] Fordism is a system of production methods based on principles of specialized mass production technologies, aimed at capturing economies of scale. [...] However, due to rising global competition, energy crises, stagflation and recession, Fordism began to unravel. [...] Consequently, {{a new system of}} economic production, characterized by greater flexibility and the exploitation of economies of scope, known as <b>Post-Fordism,</b> began to emerge.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} characterizations of the transformations some economies have undergone. Service economy, high-tech economy, late-capitalism, <b>post-Fordism,</b> and global economy {{are among the}} most frequently used terms, having some overlaps and contradictions among themselves. Closer terms to information economy would include knowledge economy and post-industrial economy.|$|E
50|$|The {{term was}} {{originated}} by Alain Touraine and {{is closely related}} to similar sociological theoretical constructs such as <b>post-fordism,</b> information society, knowledge economy, post-industrial economy, liquid modernity, and network society. They all can be used in economics or social science disciplines as a general theoretical backdrop in research design.|$|E
50|$|The {{markers of}} this rapid change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or some {{combination}} of all of these.Information society is seen as the successor to industrial society. Closely related concepts are the post-industrial society (Daniel Bell), <b>post-fordism,</b> post-modern society, knowledge society, telematic society, Information Revolution, liquid modernity, and network society (Manuel Castells).|$|E
50|$|The {{changes in}} {{production}} with {{the shift from}} Fordism to <b>post-Fordism</b> were accompanied by changes in the economy, politics, and prominent ideologies. In the economic realm, <b>post-Fordism</b> brought the decline of regulation and production by the nation-state {{and the rise of}} global markets and corporations. Mass marketing was replaced by flexible specialization, and organizations began to emphasize communication more than command. The workforce changed with an increase in internal marketing, franchising, and subcontracting and a rise in part-time, temp, self-employed, and home workers. Politically, class-based political parties declined and social movements based on region, gender, or race increased. Mass unions began to vanish and were instead replaced by localized plant-based bargaining. Cultural and ideological changes included the rise in individualist modes of thought and behavior and a culture of entrepreneurialism. Following the shift in production and acknowledging the need for more knowledge-based workers, education became less standardized and more specialized. Prominent ideologies that arose included fragmentation and pluralism in values, post-modern eclecticism, and populist approaches to culture.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{basis of}} New Times is, {{as the name}} suggests, {{the idea that the}} 1980s and 90s represent a significant break with previous history. The transition from Fordism to <b>Post-fordism</b> is a key factor, as workers in western nations are no longer concentrated in large workplaces, but employed widely in the service and public sectors; blue collar jobs are replaced by white collar ones; and consumption is democratised to a far greater extent than previously.|$|E

Can it think up its own forms of subjugation or does it rely heavily on someone else to do this? A theoretical but nonetheless dramatic standoff is one of the outcomes of this shortcoming: while capitalism in its current incarnation cuts arts funding and starves artists out of their old neighborhoods, watching them fight like gladiators the better to learn even more strategic and cut-throat ways of surviving hard times, art {{is at the same time}} pulling the wool over capitalism’s eyes with its ridiculous and inexplicable approaches to absolutely everything." ...|$|E
50|$|Proponents of the Flexible Specialization {{approach}} (also {{known as}} the neo-Smithian approach) to <b>post-Fordism</b> believe that fundamental changes in the international economy, especially in the early 1970s, forced firms to switch from mass production to a new tactic known as Flexible Specialization. Factors such as the oil shocks of 1973, increased competition from foreign markets (especially Southeast Asia) due to globalization, {{the end of the}} post-World War II boom, and increasing privatization made the old system of mass-producing identical, cheap goods through division of labor uncompetitive.|$|E

His views are based on Neo-Liberalism or Libertarianism, promoting unregulated privatised capitalism in all aspects of architecture, planning and development.|$|E
5000|$|The Regulation {{approach}} (also {{called the}} neo-Marxist or French Regulation School), {{was designed to}} address the paradox of how capitalism has both a tendency towards crisis, change and instability {{as well as an}} ability to stabilize institutions, rules and norms. The theory is based on two key concepts. [...] "Regimes of Accumulation" [...] refer to systems of production and consumption, such as Fordism and <b>post-Fordism.</b> [...] "Modes of Regulation" [...] refer to the written and unwritten laws of society which control the Regime of Accumulation and determine its form.|$|E
5000|$|Later, {{under the}} {{inspiration}} of Gramsci, Marxists picked up the Fordism concept in the 1930s and developed <b>Post-Fordism</b> in the 1970s. Antonio and Bonanno (2000) trace the development of Fordism and subsequent economic stages, from globalization to neoliberal globalization, during the 20th century, and emphasized America's role in globalization. [...] "Fordism," [...] for Gramsci, meant routine, intensified labor to promote production. Antonio and Bonanno argue that Fordism peaked in the post-World War II decades of American dominance and mass consumerism but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on {{the people in the}} 1970s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Post-Fordism</b> {{brought on}} {{new ways of}} looking at {{consumption}} and production. The saturation of key markets brought on a turn against mass consumption and a pursuit of higher living standards. This shift brought a change in how the market was viewed from a production standpoint. Rather than being viewed as a mass market to be served by mass production, the consumers began to be viewed as different groups pursuing different goals who could be better served with small batches of specialized goods Mass markets became less important while markets for luxury, custom, or positional good became more significant. Production became less homogeneous and standardized and more diverse and differentiated as organizations and economies of scale were replaced with organizations and economies of scope.|$|E
50|$|While {{contingent}} {{labor has}} been a constant of capitalist societies since the industrial revolution, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have argued that the flexible labor force has now moved from the peripheral position it had under Fordism to a core position in the process of capitalist accumulation under <b>Post-Fordism,</b> which is thought to be increasingly based on the casualized efforts of affective, creative, immaterial labor. There is scattered empirical evidence in support of this thesis, such as the growing share of non-standard employment on the overall labor force, particularly on new hires. For example, in Western Europe, between a quarter and a third of the labor force now works under temporary and/or part-time contracts, with peaks in UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy.|$|E

50|$|Scherrer’s {{research}} interests {{lay in the}} field of international political economy, in particular the social dimensions of globalization. He contributed to the development of French Regulation Theory through an extensive study of the transition of the U.S. auto and steel industry to <b>post-Fordism</b> and through a post-structuralist inspired critique of its neglect of contingency in phases of stable capital accumulation. He introduced Gramscian insights to international political economy in Germany and coined the term ‘double hegemony’ for the interlaced linkage of the hegemony of the US-American national-state with the hegemony of an emerging international bourgeoisie. He directed numerous studies on the “Social Dimensions of International Trade” and “Trade in Services” funded by the Hans Böckler Stiftung (HBS), the Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES), the German Foreign Office, the German Parliament, the European Parliament, and the Austrian Chancellery. His most recent work is co-directing an international research project on economic inequality.|$|E

5000|$|In Italy, <b>post-Fordism</b> {{has been}} theorised {{by the long}} wave of workerism or autonomia. Major thinkers of this {{tendency}} include the Swiss-Italian economist Christian Marazzi, Antonio Negri, Paolo Virno, Carlo Vercellone, Maurizio Lazzarato. Marazzi's Capital and Language takes as its starting point {{the fact that the}} extreme volatility of financial markets is generally attributed to the discrepancy between the [...] "real economy" [...] (that of material goods produced and sold) and the more speculative monetary-financial economy. But this distinction has long ceased to apply in the post-Fordist New Economy, in which both spheres are structurally affected by language and communication. In Capital and Language Marazzi argues that the changes in financial markets and the transformation of labor into immaterial labor (that is, its reliance on abstract knowledge, general intellect, and social cooperation) are two sides of a new development paradigm: financialization through and thanks to the rise of the new economy. Marazzi offers a radical new understanding of the current international economic stage and crucial post-Marxist guidance for confronting capitalism in its newest form. Capital and Language also provides a warning call to a Left still nostalgic for a Fordist construct—a time before factory turned into office (and office into home), and before labor became linguistic. http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/capital-and-language ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{features}} of recent economic experience {{have been the}} transition to <b>post-Fordism</b> and the ageing of populations. <b>Post-Fordism</b> entails diverse production and consumption, flexible employment, privatisation and a smaller welfare state.

40|$|Abstract * In many {{theories}} of <b>post-Fordism</b> an epochal transition in capitalist societies is envisioned {{in which the}} industrial paradigm of mass production is replaced by flexible specialization. Often conjoined with this new model of industrial development are a post-Marxist politics and a postmodern culture, creating {{the impression of a}} grand economic and social realignment. It is argued that these holistic representations of industrialized social formations obscure the role of both capitalist and noncapitalist class processes in constituting contemporary societies and narrow the scope for political contestation and change. A political question Reading the growing literature on <b>post-Fordism,</b> both within geography and in the wider circles of leftist debate, I am impressed by the power of this''model of development ' to organize and illuminate our contemporary experience. This capacity on the part of post-Fordist theory testifies to the subtlety and inventiveness of its theorists, who use the concept of <b>post-Fordism</b> to explore and connect a wide variety of social processes and institutions; but it also "signals something about the intellectual concerns that have attended the birth of <b>post-Fordism</b> as a concept, an...|$|E
40|$|<b>Post-Fordism</b> {{suggests}} the world 2 ̆ 7 s economic travails are the birth-pangs of a new, post- Fordist industrial system, with implications for national industrial adjustment. The thesis {{is a study}} of post Fordism and {{the course of the}} recent industrial policy debate in Australia. It is also a critique of <b>post-Fordism</b> (and its sister doctrine 2 ̆ 7 flexible specialisation 2 ̆ 7), as an analysis of events in the world economy, and as a model of industrial development. The thesis focuses on the role and fate of the labour movement, in the recent industrial policy debate, for two reasons. First, the labour movement drove the debate over industry policy in the early 1980 s, and second, post- Fordism offers misleading prescriptions for the role the labour movement should play in industrial adjustment. Part one is devoted to exposition and critique of post-Fordism; part two surveys some of the literature on industry development and work organisation, with the question of the roles {{of the state and the}} labour movement in mind; part three is devoted to the debates in Australia around industry policy and <b>post-Fordism.</b> The thesis argues that <b>post-Fordism</b> is a flawed account of recent industrial change, and a poor guide to labour movement strategy.

40|$|Prior to {{the recent}} global crisis a {{consensus}} was emerging that <b>post-Fordism</b> had ushered in a new sexual contract, one characterized not by exclusion and containment, but by the prospecting for potential, a prospecting that located women’s labor not as a reserve for capital but as a site of vitality and possibility. The global financial crisis and ongoing recession, however, have been positioned as undoing these radical transformations in women’s labor by threatening a return of the social formations characteristic of Fordism. Yet in this essay I suggest that to understand the ongoing recession as producing such a return is to thoroughly misapprehend value production in <b>post-Fordism</b> and, in particular, to bracket {{the process of the}} folding of the economy into society. To illustrate this process, I focus on unemployment, specifically the eventful productiveness of unemployment in recessionary <b>post-Fordism.</b> Confronting this eventful productiveness necessitates not only a recognition of a material reworking of unemployment in <b>post-Fordism,</b> but also undoes the idea that the ongoing recession is linked to a return to the social formations of Fordism.
