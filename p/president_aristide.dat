In 1997 a fellow 1960s-activist Danny Goldberg, a major music industry figure heavily involved in the ACLU, became co-publisher with his father, Victor. During these years, prominent journalists such as Jack Newfield interviewed national and international leaders such as Mario Cuomo and Haiti's embattled <b>President</b> <b>Aristide</b> to bring more credibility to the growing influence of the magazine. From 2002 through 2011, Lerner's sister, Trish Vradenburg, and her husband served as co-publishers.|$|E

2500|$|As {{reported}} by the BBC, on 3 March 2004, CARICOM called for an independent inquiry into the departure of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and says it will not send peacekeepers at this time. Patterson {{said there had been}} no indication during discussions with the U.S. and France that the plan which CARICOM had put forward prior to Aristide's departure was not acceptable. [...] "In respect of our partners we can only say this, at no time in our discussions did they convey to us that the plan was unacceptable so long as <b>president</b> <b>Aristide</b> remained in office. Nor did they suggest to us anything of a nature pertaining to the conduct of <b>President</b> <b>Aristide</b> in office that would cause us to come to the judgment ourselves that he was unsuited to be the President of Haïti," [...] Mr. Patterson said. The U.S. and France have been accused of using pressure on CARICOM to not make a formal UN request for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Aristide's removal.|$|E

A detailed study on the armed rebel paramilitaries has found that these groups received vital support from a handful of Haitian elites, Dominican governmental sectors, and foreign intelligence.

2500|$|In February 2004, the {{assassination}} of gang leader Amiot Metayer sparked a violent rebellion that culminated in Aristide's removal from office. Amiot's brother, Buteur Metayer, blamed Aristide for {{the assassination}}, and used this as an argument given in order to form the National Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Haiti. Joined by other groups, the rebels quickly {{took control of the}} North, and eventually laid siege to, and then invaded, the capital. Under disputed circumstances, Aristide was flown out of the country by the U.S. with help from Canada and France on 28 February 2004. Jamaican prime minister P. J. Patterson released a statement saying [...] "we are bound to question whether his resignation was truly voluntary, as it comes after the capture of sections of Haiti by armed insurgents and the failure of the international community to provide the requisite support. The removal of <b>president</b> <b>Aristide</b> in these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent for democratically elected governments anywhere and everywhere, as it promotes the removal of duly elected persons from office by the power of rebel forces." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{international}} politicians, including {{members of}} the U.S. congress and the Jamaican Prime Minister, {{expressed concern that the}} United States had interfered with Haiti's democratic process by removing Aristide with excessive force. According to Rep. Maxine Waters D-California, Mildred Aristide called her at her home at 6:30am to inform her [...] "the coup d'etat has been completed", and Jean-Bertrand Aristide said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti's chief of staff came to his house to say he would be killed [...] "and a lot of Haitians would be killed" [...] if he refused to resign immediately and said he [...] "has to go now." [...] Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York expressed similar words, saying Aristide had told him he was [...] "disappointed that the international community had let him down" [...] and [...] "that he resigned under pressure" [...] – [...] "As a matter of fact, he was very apprehensive for his life. They {{made it clear that he}} had to go now or he would be killed." [...] When asked for his response to these statements Colin Powell said that [...] "it might have been better for members of Congress who have heard these stories to ask us about the stories before going public with them so we don't make a difficult situation that much more difficult" [...] and he alleged that Aristide [...] "did not democratically govern or govern well". Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson released a statement saying [...] "we are bound to question whether his resignation was truly voluntary, as it comes after the capture of sections of Haiti by armed insurgents and the failure of the international community to provide the requisite support.

50|$|Jean-Bertrand Aristide became Haiti's first {{democratically elected}} {{president}} on 7 February 1991 {{after a long}} history of dictatorships and a new Constitution. Even before the inauguration of Aristide, there was a failed coup in January 1991. However, Aristide was in office less than a year before he was ousted in a military coup on 30 September 1991. Although <b>President</b> <b>Aristide</b> had a short-lived presidential term, he created hope among Haitians that their conditions would improve and managed to introduce some human rights reforms. The military coup that overthrew the government of <b>President</b> <b>Aristide</b> was under the leadership of Lt. General Raoul Cédras, who had been selected by <b>President</b> <b>Aristide</b> to serve as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The United States pushed those governing in Haiti to reinstate Aristide and honor the democratic vote. A multilateral effort led to the diplomatic agreement known as the Governors Island Agreement, which was signed to achieve the return of Aristide on 3 July 1993. If successful, the process return of <b>President</b> <b>Aristide</b> by 30 October 1993. However, Cédras defaulted on the agreement. This led to a United Nations' mandate in July 1994 to use force, if necessary, to restore the democratically elected president. With an imminent US invasion planned for September 1994, Cédras left Haiti, which led to the return of <b>President</b> <b>Aristide.</b>|$|E
