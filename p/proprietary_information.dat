25|$|First, {{gum base}} is {{previously}} prepared through a melting and straining or filtering process. The formulation for gum base is <b>proprietary</b> <b>information</b> known to few individuals within each gum-producing company. Next, other ingredients such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners and flavors {{are added to}} the gum base until the warm mixture thickens like dough. The gum base mixture is heated during this mixing process in order to increase the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape the gum. Next, the gum goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut and wrap (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the extruder using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums. Next, gum is either conditioned by being sprinkled with a powdered polyol or coated via the application of subsequent layers of coating using temperature controlled coating basins before it is sent to packaging.|$|E

5000|$|Given the {{overwhelming}} reliance on support contractors, {{it is now}} necessary {{to address this question}} of authorized use under the Federal Trade Secret Act.

50|$|In other areas, {{problems}} frequently {{arise when}} Federal activities hire support contractors {{to assist them}} with executing their mission.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} current {{features}} {{of state and}} <b>proprietary</b> traveler <b>information</b> applications, elements of good design and usability, human factors issues regarding visual and cognitive distraction, and makes recommendations {{for the next generation}} of Minnesota’s traveler information application, MN 511. Traveler information systems were created to serve drivers by providing accurate information about traffic and road conditions before drivers began their trip. The advancement of cellular telephones provided a new opportunity for drivers to access traffic and road information en-route, but introduced considerable cognitive distraction on drivers navigating the complex phone trees. The evolution of traveler information systems onto smartphone applications has eased the cognitive demand previously imposed by phone tree systems, but has shifted the demand to drivers’ visual resources. The dichotomy between state-funded 511 travel <b>information</b> applications and <b>proprietary</b> traveler <b>information</b> applications is primarily determined by the features each contains. The common features included in the current <b>proprietary</b> traveler <b>information</b> applications provide insight into the opportunities for future iterations of MN 511 mobile applications. The MN 511 application can continue to improve by incorporating select features from proprietary applications, such as voice commands, route guidance, saved places, and travel time estimates, while taking into account cognitive workload and visual distraction. This is important because publicly funded traveler information applications have a greater responsibility, compared to proprietary applications, to account for distraction and ensure the safety of its users...|$|R
