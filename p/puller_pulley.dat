30|$|In the {{mechanical}} part, the float moves {{up and down}} driven by waves, <b>pulling</b> <b>pulley</b> 2 and pulley 3 to rotate in opposite directions. During the wave falling period, only pulley 2, ratchet wheel 1 and driving pulley 4 work to drive the driving pulley 6. If the rotating speed of pulley 2 is {{equal to that of}} driving pulley 4 and the wave keeps falling, the connection between pulley 2 and driving pulley 4 is maintained by ratchet wheel 1. Similarly, during the wave rising period, only pulley 3, ratchet wheel 2 and driving pulley 5 work to drive the driving pulley 6. When pulley 3 keeps pace with driving pulley 5 through ratchet wheel 2 and the driving force is continually on pulley 3, the SRG rotating speed will increase. Through this process, the wave energy is captured and converted into mechanical energy. One thing to be noted is that two ratchet wheels ensure the rotor of SRG rotates in single direction during the whole process. The torque applied on the rotor is always negative, whether wave rises or falls. The work efficiency is greatly improved, compared with that of a single-direction driven float-type wave power system, which works only when the wave is rising, or only when it is falling.|$|R
5000|$|Excessive runout {{during an}} {{arrestment}} {{is a condition}} known as a [...] "two-block." [...] This name is derived from naval parlance when all the line has been <b>pulled</b> through a <b>pulley</b> system, the two pulley blocks are touching, hence [...] "two blocked". Excessive runout {{can be caused by}} improper arresting gear settings, excess aircraft gross weight, excess aircraft engagement speed, or excess airplane thrust applied during the arrestment.|$|R
5000|$|Some firearms, {{like the}} AN-94, have [...] "hyperburst," [...] a feature in which rounds are fired in {{incredibly}} quick succession {{on the first}} two rounds (1800 rpm {{in the case of the}} AN-94). This supposedly improves armor-penetration capability. Hyperburst is performed by having the barrel slide back and receive another round in the chamber <b>pulled</b> by a <b>pulley</b> and is fired as the barrel slams at the bolt, when the first chambered round is fired when the sliding barrel is at rest, as opposed to a cam mechanism of the M16 design.|$|R

Eventually, however, the weight overcomes him and the coyote is <b>pulled</b> through the <b>pulley,</b> removing all of his chest fur (Which he gains in the next shot), and then down onto a see-saw as the safe lands next to him. Wile then slides off the rock face {{to fall into the}} canyon a fourth time, and is then smashed by the safe, leaving the coyote's torso thin and flat.|$|R

According {{to the actual}} operating environment of the de-icing robot, we analyzed the operational requirements of the robot and the control requirements of remote control system. A new wireless remote control circuit has designed based on APC 220 - 43 module implemented in design hardware and software. Experiments and the actual operation had shown that {{the reliability of the}} wireless remote control system. De-icing technology and present condition of transmission line and de-icing robot structure design De-icing technology and present condition of transmission line. Transmission line easily lead to disconnection and tower collapse accident when wire was iced heavily, which is a serious threat to the safe operation of the power system. The power industry must take measures to prevent icing. The common de-icing methods are mechanical de-icing and high-current melting ice, etc. The mechanical de-icing method is that pulley spatula method. People on the ground <b>pull</b> the <b>pulley</b> to move on line to eradicate the ice, which may cause mechanical damage for the transmission line. However, the size of current to melt the ice for the ice-melting method is not easy to grasp...|$|R
50|$|A modern war bridle {{is a thin}} cord {{run over}} the poll and then either through the mouth or under the upper lip, against the gumline of the upper incisors. In some cases, the lower loop goes around the horse's muzzle rather than under the lip. A loop is used so that it {{tightens}} on the horse's head when {{the end of the}} line is <b>pulled.</b> Sometimes a <b>pulley</b> is used to provide mechanical advantage. All designs tightens on both the poll and the lip or jaw. The war bridle is not intended for riding; it is used on the ground for management of an animal. The use of a war bridle is considered by some to be a last resort for handling an uncontrollable animal, but others claim its use constitutes animal cruelty.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to compare the effects of two {{sequences}} of resistance exercises (RE), with different in-tensities but same training volume, on post-exercise blood pressure responses. Sixteen young subjects with previous experience in RE were evaluated during three non-follow-ing days in chest press, legpress, <b>pulley</b> <b>pull</b> down, leg curl, shoulder press, and biceps curl. On the first day, the load associated with six maximal repetitions (6 RM) were deter-mined for each exercise. On the second day, three sets of 6 RM were performed (SEQ 6), with a two minute interval between the sets. On the last day, the same procedure was repeated, but using 12 repetitions with 50 % of 6 RM load (SEQ 12). Rest BP was measured before the sequences by auscultatory method. Post-exercise resting BP was measured each 10 minutes by ambulatory BP monitoring during 60 minutes. The magnitude and duration of BP variability were compared by repeated ANOVA measures followed by Tuck-ey post-hoc test (p < 0. 05). A significant reduction in dias-tolic blood pressure (DBP) was observed in the first 20 min-utes after SEQ 12, but not after SEQ 6. SEQ 12 elicited significant decline in systolic blood pressure (SBP), at least during the first 50 minutes after the exercise, while signif-icant reductions were observed in all measures after SEQ 6. There {{were no significant differences between}} the abso-lute values of DBP and SBP after both sequences. In conclu-sion: a) RE had hypotensive effects on blood pressure, main-ly SBP; b) the absolute decline of SBP seem not to be influ-enced by different interactions between workload and num-ber of repetitions; c) higher workloads seem to extend the total time of SBP post-exercise reduction; d) the number of repetitions seems to have more influence on DBP than SBP, but for a short period of time.
