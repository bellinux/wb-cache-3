5|$|In all {{of these}} {{transitive}} closure algorithms, {{it is possible to}} distinguish pairs of vertices that are reachable by at least one path of length two or more from pairs that can only be connected by a length-one path. The transitive reduction consists of the edges that form length-one <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> are the only paths connecting their endpoints. Therefore, the transitive reduction can be constructed in the same asymptotic time bounds as the transitive closure.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{was formed}} by July 1, 1919 along two {{discontinuous}} sections of its current corridor. The gap was filled in by 1927, but a second break in the routing {{was created in the}} 1930s. This second interruption in the corridor was eliminated within a year. The various <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> M-46 has followed have been straightened over the intervening years, producing the modern corridor by the 1970s. Other changes have been made to the location of the western terminus in Muskegon, but it has remained fixed in its current location since 1984.|$|E
5|$|After {{the tumultuous}} An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the early Tang career path of {{officials}} rising in {{a hierarchy of}} six ministries—with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest—was changed into a system where officials chose specialized careers within {{one of the six}} ministries. The commissions of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies. The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works. As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a hierarchy of ministries, each with different levels of prestige.|$|E
5|$|By {{combining}} {{the distance between}} the aircraft and satellite, speed, and heading with aircraft performance constraints (e.g. fuel consumption, possible speeds and altitudes), investigators generated candidate <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> were analysed separately by two methods. The first assumed the aircraft was flying on one of the three autopilot modes (two are further affected by whether the navigation system used magnetic north or true north as a reference), calculated the BTO and BFO values along these routes, and compared them with the values recorded from Flight 370. The second method generated paths which had the aircraft's speed and heading adjusted at the time of each handshake to minimise the difference between the calculated BFO of the path and the values recorded from Flight 370. A probability distribution for each method at the BTO arc of the sixth handshake of the two methods was created and then compared; 80 percent of the highest probability paths for both analyses combined intersect the BTO arc of the sixth handshake between 32.5°S and 38.1°S, which can be extrapolated to 33.5°S and 38.3°S along the BTO arc of the seventh handshake.|$|E

5|$|Dishonored {{features}} role-playing game elements, such as {{the ability}} to upgrade powers and to make moral choices with a focus on non-linear consequences. The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer Harvey Smith involved the player completing a side mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped and enslaved. Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets. Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character's abilities, rather than specific <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> are aimed at a particular gameplay style, such as hacking or sneaking. Specific elements of missions, such as changes to the color of a target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is a metric {{theory of}} gravitation. At its core are Einstein's equations, which describe {{the relation between}} the geometry of a four-dimensional, pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energy–momentum contained in that spacetime. Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> objects will naturally follow. The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{the area around}} the Old City walls was barren and undeveloped. It was only notable for the {{junction}} of <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> would become Jaffa Road and the highway to Jaffa, with the road to Hebron outside the Jaffa Gate. Among its first structures was the Hospice Saint Vincent de Paul, part of the emerging French Compound. The early building developed {{as an extension of the}} adjacent souk along the city walls at the Jaffa Gate as a quarter for merchants and artisans. It became home for commerce and residences that could not find room within the overcrowded Old City, and several of Jerusalem's prominent modern businesses, like Hotel Fast, were first built here. In 1908, the Ottoman authorities erected a clock tower above Jaffa Gate. The British removed it a decade later.|$|E

5|$|In the {{municipality}} of Atoyac de Alvarez, {{in the community}} of Cerro Prieto, 350 people were left homeless by the storm. Similarly, the <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> connect the towns of San Vicente de Jesus San Vicente and La Soledad Benítez-Paradise in this town, there were cuts in solitary vehicle traffic. In the community of La Soledad, heavy rains accompanied by hail hit 38 homes, crops and coffee grounds cultivation in the region. In Colima, 50 homes and two hotels were inundated by flood waters, leaving MXN 3million ($231,000USD) in damage. In Puebla, heavy rains produced by the outer bands of the hurricane triggered flooding that killed two people. In addition to the fatalities, 20 people were injured by the storm. In the wake of the storm, the Government of Mexico allocated roughly MXN 3million ($231,000USD) in funds which would be distributed to 96 businesses significantly affected by the storm. These funds accounted for supplies, such as refrigerators and stoves to help restart their industries.|$|E
5|$|Next to Columbia River, long {{segments}} of the 40 Mile Loop skirt the north edge of the slough watershed, while other segments such as the north–south I-205 Bike Path cross it or, {{as in the case}} of the largely unfinished Columbia Slough Trail, run through it generally along an east–west axis. The 40Mile Loop is a partly completed greenway trail around and through Portland and other parts of Multnomah County. Originally proposed by the Olmsted Brothers, architects involved in the planning for Portland's Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905, it has expanded to a projected , encircling the city and connecting parks along the Columbia, Sandy, and Willamette rivers and Johnson Creek. The parks and other public spaces in the watershed have their own pedestrian paths, some of which are also bicycle <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> connect to the 40Mile Loop. Many gaps lie between completed trail segments.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} {{electric}} fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised {{by a set}} of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is {{the same as that of}} the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.|$|E
5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E
