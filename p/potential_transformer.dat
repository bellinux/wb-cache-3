40|$|The {{ferroresonance}} or nonlinear resonance is {{a complex}} phenomenon, which may cause overvoltage in the electrical power system and endangers the system reliability and operation. The ability to predict the ferroresonance in the transformer depends on {{the accuracy of the}} transformer model used. In this paper, the effect of the new suggested ferroresonance limiter on the control of the chaotic ferroresonance and duration of chaotic transients in a <b>potential</b> <b>transformer</b> including nonlinear core losses is studied. To study the proposed ferroresonance limiter, a single phase 100 [*]VA, 275 [*]kV <b>potential</b> <b>transformer</b> is simulated.

The MU IED typically contains the logical nodes for measurement information (i.e. MMXU), sequence imbalance (i.e. MSQI), current transformer (i.e. TCTR), <b>potential</b> <b>transformer</b> (i.e. TVTR) etc. The logical nodes TCTR and TVTR are used to receive the digital current and voltage values from the CT and PT respectively. The MMXU logical node contains data objects “PhV”, “A”, “Hz” which provides information about the measured data in terms of values of phase voltage, current and frequency respectively.|$|E

This thesis {{is concerned with the}} task of defining where ferroresonance problems can exist in a 230 kV power system and determining methods for displaying safety margins between nonferroresonant and ferroresonant operating regions. Practical case studies are taken from the Manitoba Hydro 230 kV power system. The approach used in this thesis is a combination of time-domain simulation, nonlinear dynamics analysis and laboratory/field measurement analysis. One possible ferroresonant circuit occurs when an unloaded transformer is connected to a de-energized transmission line that is capacitively coupled with a parallel energized line. An example from Manitoba Hydro's 230 kV power system is investigated through EMTP simulations and field tests [JaMM 99]. Another, more typical example occurs when a wound <b>potential</b> <b>transformer</b> is [...] ...|$|E

30|$|The {{current and}} <b>potential</b> <b>transformers</b> {{located in the}} power system network provide the current and voltage {{measurements}} to the PMU {{in the form of}} analog inputs required for digital processing. To prevent the aliasing of the sampled signals, the inputs are fed through an anti-aliasing filter that limits the bandwidth of the input analog signal as per the requirements. The output of the anti-aliasing filter is further fed to an analog to digital (A/D) converter for converting it into the desired digital output which is fed into a central processing unit (CPU). The CPU computes the magnitude and the phase of the input signal using the DFT technique and time synchronizes the data using a sampling clock that is phase locked to the one-pulse-per-second provided by the GPS receiver. As the signal is time stamped, it is transmitted from the PMU to the PDC through the synchrophasor communication network.|$|R

Nanosilicate was exfoliated in a epoxy resin using our electric field dispersion process and AC insulation breakdown strength at 30 ∼ 150 oC, glass transition temperature and viscoelasticity were studied. AC insulation breakdown strength of EMNC was {{higher than that of}} EMC and that value of EMNC was far higher at high temperature. Glass transition temperature and viscoelasticity property of EMNC was higher than those of EMC at high temperature. These results was due to the even dispersion of nanosilicates among the nanosilicas, which could be observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). That is, the nanosilicates interrupt the electron transfer and restrict the mobility of the epoxy chains. Key Words: Electric fields dispersion, Epoxy microcomposites(EMC).

40|$|Abstract- Electricity {{has become}} one of the basic {{requirements}} for people and widely used for domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes. The energy billing system used nowadays are labor and time consuming. There is no proper way to know the consumer's maximum demand, usage details. This paper presents a prepaid energy meter to facilitate energy consumption measurement and to know consumer’s maximum demand. The major components are PIC microcontroller, Voltage and Current transformer, Precision rectifier, Zero Crossing Detector, Logical Circuit and GSM. This paper demonstrates the use of prepaid energy meter system. If we use this system it will be beneficial for the consumer to manage power. It is easy to operate and cost effective. Another advantage of the prepaid system is that the human errors in taking meter readings and processing bills can be reduced to a large extent. Using GSM it is easy to monitor the Energy Meter and prevent Energy theft. If any problem occurred in the system all the information are obtained through GSM.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of electrical insulators {{is one of}} the major contributors to the risk of operation outages in electrical substations, especially in coastal zones with high salinity levels and atmospheric pollution. By using the measurement of leakage-currents, which {{is one of the}} main indicators of contamination in insulators, this work seeks to the determine the correlation with climatic variables, such as ambient temperature, relative humidity, solar irradiance, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed and direction. The results obtained provide an input to the behaviour of the leakage current under atmospheric conditions that are particular to the Caribbean coast of Colombia. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and principal component analysis are utilised to determine the significant relationships among the different variables under consideration. The necessary information for the study was obtained via historical databases of both atmospheric variables and the leakage current measured in over a period of one year in a 220 -kV <b>potential</b> <b>transformer</b> insulator.

30|$|PMU device: It {{comprises}} current <b>transformers</b> (CTs) and <b>potential</b> <b>transformers</b> (PTs) {{that measure}} current and voltage magnitudes {{which are then}} converted to digital data, a microprocessor module that compiles these values, computes phasors, and synchronizes them with the coordinated universal time (UTC) standard reference used by global positioning system (GPS) receivers that acquire a time-lag based on the atomic clock of GPS satellites [23, 74, 75, 76, 77]. They measure local frequency and its rate of change, and can record individual phase voltage and current along with harmonics, negative and zero sequence values [78]. The information paints a dynamic picture of the grid at a given time. PMUs and PDCs transmit measured data as frames [79]. A 16 -bit cyclic redundancy check ensures data integrity. PDCs equipped with logging functionality use comma separated values or transient data exchange for data logs, and common format for event data exchange for event logs [80, 81]. The data transfer rate of PMUs, which determine the message processing delays and network latencies, depend greatly on the timing requirements of applications.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} was to analyze and systematize, within a {{perspective}} of theorization based on research and theoretical developments, the difficulty related to teacher education (pre and in-service) concerning professional development. The analysis is conceptually structured based on the close relation of teacher education to (1) the construction and nature of knowledge of the professional educator and (2) the sociopractical nature of teaching as a complex social function to be performed by the professional teacher to be educated. The methodology developed in this analysis was based on information from the literature available {{in the field and}} from the long course of the author’s research, intervention, policy advice and publications in this field, as well as literature and research reviews conducted by the author. The main aspects of the analysis emphasize the following: ressignification of the dualism pre-service/in-service teacher education within the richer concept of professional development; the essential relation between teacher education debate and the analysis of the teaching activity regarding professionalism; and the clarification of the teachers’ profile as a professional and its implications for the rationale of teacher education. The final considerations, for the field of teacher education, focus on the need to reinforce the concepts of professional development and professionalism as <b>potential</b> <b>transformers</b> of teacher education effectiveness and quality. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
