A preprocessor computer program was developed to incorporate Voigt structural joint damping models in a NASTRAN finite-element dynamic model. A postprocessor computer program was developed to select critical modes for low-frequency attitude control problems and for higher frequency fine-stabilization problems. The mode selection is accomplished by ranking the flexible modes based on coefficients for rate gyro, <b>position</b> <b>gyro,</b> and optical sensors, and on image-plane motions due to sinusoidal or random power spectral density force and torque inputs...|$|E

The approach uses information from an optical sensor, which employs relatively simple electronic circuits with modest digital signal pro-cessing requirements, to provide multiple line-of-sight vectors from spacecraft to another. The sensor mechanism is well suited for both near-Earth and deep space applications since it is fully independent of any external systems.

40|$|In a {{single-axis}} gyro {{a rotation}} about the input axis forces the spin axis to rotate about the output axis. The true input axis is oscillating about its nominal <b>position</b> and the <b>gyro</b> sees a varying {{component of the}} angular velocity about the nominal spin axis. This may be rectified, thereby causing a drift, if the components of angular velocity along the input and spin axes are correlated.

However, in photoelectric stabilized platform, this nutation characteristics of angular <b>position</b> flexible <b>gyro</b> has been restricting the stabilized accuracy of platform seriously. In this paper, firstly the output characteristics of a miniature flexible gyro was measured by characteristic of gyroscopic motion, four main kinds of frequency components in output characteristics was analysed. The methods were realized in the miniature flexible gyroscope in the laboratory by adopting the two measures of the secondary trap circuit and improvement of torque component. Test results showed that, the improvements made nutation frequency of gyro and envelope at 40 Hz converged fastly, and the output noise of <b>gyro</b> angular <b>position</b> was decayed to more than 15 dB.

40|$|Robust {{adaptive}} control of underwater vehicles in 6 DOF is analysed {{in the context}} of measurement noise. The performance of the {{adaptive control}} laws of Sadegh and Harowitz (1990) and Slotine and Benedetto (1990) are compared. Both these schemes require that all states are measured, that is the velocities and positions in surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and yaw. However, for underwater vehicles it is difficult to measure the linear velocities whereas angular velocity measurements can be obtained by using a 3 axes angular rate sensor. This problem is addressed by designing a nonlinear observer for linear velocity state estimation. The proposed observer requires that the position and the attitude are measured, e. g. by using a hydroacoustic positioning system for linear <b>positions,</b> two <b>gyros</b> for roll and pitch and a compass for yaw. In addition angular rate measurements will be assumed available from a 3 -axes rate sensor or a state estimator. It is also assumed that the measurement rate is limited to 2 Hz for all the sensors. Simulation studies with a 3 DOF AUV model are used to demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the adaptive control laws and the velocity state observer...|$|R

This paper evaluates a {{system designed to}} autonomously follow previously demonstrated paths in a forest environment without loading/unloading timber, a pre-step {{in the development of}} fully autonomous forwarders. The system consisted of a forwarder equipped with a high-precision global positioning system to measure the vehicle’s heading and <b>position.</b> A <b>gyro</b> was used to compensate for the influence of the vehicle’s roll and pitch. On an ordinary clear-cut forest area with numerous stumps, the vehicle was able to follow two different tracks, three times each at a speed of 1 m s- 1, with a mean path tracking error of 6 and 7 cm, respectively. The error never exceeded 35 cm, and in 90 % of the observations it was less than 14 and 15 cm, respectively. This accuracy is well within the necessary tolerance for forestry operations. In fact, a human operator would probably have a hard time following the track more accurately. Hence, the developed systems function satisfactorily when using previously demonstrated paths.

40|$|Gyroscopes {{based on}} micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) {{technology}} suffer in high-dynamic applications due to obvious g-sensitivity errors. These errors can induce large biases in the gyroscope, which can directly affect {{the accuracy of}} attitude estimation in {{the integration of the}} inertial navigation system (INS) and the Global Positioning System (GPS). The observability determines the existence of solutions for compensating them. In this paper, we investigate the observability of the INS/GPS system with consideration of the g-sensitivity errors. In terms of two types of g-sensitivity coefficients matrix, we add them as estimated states to the Kalman filter and analyze the observability of three or nine elements of the coefficient matrix respectively. A global observable condition of the system is presented and validated. Experimental results indicate that all the estimated states, which include <b>position,</b> velocity, attitude, <b>gyro</b> and accelerometer bias, and g-sensitivity coefficients, could be made observable by maneuvering based on the conditions.

40|$|Very high {{resolution}} optical space images are coming {{more and more}} into competition to classical aerial images making them more important for mapping projects. The orientation process of the dominating CCD-line scanner images taken from space {{is quite different from}} the orientation of perspective photos. Different image products like nearly original images and images projected to a plane with constant height are available, this requires corresponding orientation solutions. All optical satellites are equipped with direct sensor orientation based on a <b>positioning</b> system, <b>gyros</b> and star sensors, so they can estimate the orientation parameters. For IKONOS, QuickBird and OrbView- 3 this can be made without control points with a standard deviation of the ground coordinates in the range of 10 m and better. The orientation information is available as view direction from the scene centre or start of scene or as ephemeris and as rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). This allows the determination of the scene orientation by geometric reconstruction or bias corrected RPCs using control points. In addition approximations like 3 D-affine transformation, direct linear transformation and terrain related RPCs are in use. The accuracy of the methods is compared in relation to the number and distribution of the control points and the limitations of the approximations are investigated. The approximations of the orientations by 3 D affine transformation and direct linear transformation can only handle images projected to a plane with constant height like IKONOS Geo and QuickBird OR Standard. For original images they are not leading to acceptable accuracy. In any case they require more and three-dimensional well distributed control points. 1...|$|R
40|$|Geomatics is a {{discipline}} of collecting, processing and analysing geospatial data. Data collection is a core process of geomatics which usually adopt precise equipment to measure geospatial data. With {{the development of}} technology, a smartphone in this present era is not simply for communication; several low cost measurement devices such as Global <b>Positioning</b> System (GPS), <b>gyro</b> and camera are assembled in a smartphone. Although the devices assembled in a smartphone could not {{meet the needs of}} accuracy requirement for many geomatics applications, millions of mobile applications (Apps) can be downloaded and installed from Google Play and Apple Store freely, and a variety of sensors can be chosen for user. Considering that the popularity and convenience of a smartphone, and assuming that the accuracy of those collected data is acceptable for learning purposes, it is expected that a smartphone can be employed in geomatics for hand-on education. For example, Vespucci OSM Editor is an App to edit the OpenStreetMap on Android. The user may have the hand-on experience on GPS positioning, web services and mapping via Vespucci OSM Editor. The aim {{of this paper is to}} collect and analyze different Apps for geomatics education. The Apps are classified into four categories, namely, surveying, remote sensing, GPS and Geographic Information System (GIS).

40|$|Precise and {{accurate}} 3 D {{model of a}} road structure is the basic information which can be utilized for various purposes, such as safety measures, 3 D navigation, driving simulation, and reference data for autonomous driving. Generally, the 3 D model of a tunnel where GPS signal is not available has been constructed based on <b>positioning</b> using <b>gyro</b> sensor, however, error accumulation becomes a considerable problem {{in the case of}} long tunnels. We propose a method to obtain geometrically optimal whole structure of a tunnel:(1) Acquire a set of partial structures by static scanning using a laser range sensor, which is mounted on the roof of a survey vehicle, and align them by 3 D matching using edge feature. (2) Fix the absolute position of the data for both ends of the tunnel by GPS and align the rest data again. By applying this method, we succeeded to create the 3 D digital model of Kanaya Tunnel in New Tomei Expressway, whose length is 4. 6 km. For the comparison and evaluation of modeled tunnel, we present a system to evaluate the quality of the modeled tunnel comparing with the 2 D CAD blueprint. This system can be described as following steps:(1) Extract the boundaries both from CAD blueprint and modeled tunnel to a 2 D plane. (2) Transform the coordinate of modeled tunnel to the same coordinate as CAD blueprint. (3) Calculate the closest distance between the modeled tunnel boundaries and CAD boundaries. (4) Calculate the middle line of two data boundaries, and calculate the curvatures of both middle line, finally compare the curvature graph with the closest distance graph. We succeed creating a dense model of actual tunnel with a length of 4. 6 km by geometric process. For the error evaluation, we did the curvature calculation and closest distance calculation. The closest distance of our modeled tunnel with 2 D CAD data is about 50 centimeters on the west side, about 20 centimeters on the east side and about 4 meters around the big curve in the middle of tunnel. From this result,we have three assumptions about the error factors, which can be described as follows, the uncertainty in central part, the rotation error around the big curve during the local alignment process, and the GPS positioning errors accumulated in the simultaneous alignment. From curvature analysis, we can see that the largest error is at the central part, and the error rate is about 0. 1 percent, also the GPS points should not be fully fixed in global alignment. About our future work, we plan to increase our modeling accuracy and reduce errors at three parts. For data acquisition, we want to increase more density of our raw data, for local alignment, we want to use more other features besides edges for local alignment to reduces accumulated errors, lastly, for global alignment, we want to allow some freedom for GPS points to move slightly. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(情報理工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 情報理工学系研究科電子情報学専...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) {{community}} has discovered the enormous amount of {{information that can be}} extracted from a video camera. It can be used for collision avoidance, navigation, velocity estimation, terrain mapping, object detection and object tracking in addition to many other applications. This thesis looks into several different ways a video camera in the payload of a fixed-wing UAV can be utilized. The first part investigates a way to calculate the body-fixed velocity of the UAV with the images captured by the camera. It can be achieved with optical flow and measurements of the roll angle, pitch angle and the altitude of the UAV. The calculated body-fixed velocity {{can be used as a}} measurement in the navigation system. This thesis looks into a navigation system based on a nonlinear observer that estimates attitude, <b>position,</b> velocity and <b>gyro</b> bias. In order to estimate these states the nonlinear observer utilizes measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver and a video camera. The second part looks into moving object detection and tracking. An algorithm for detection of moving objects has been developed. It utilizes the navigation states of the UAV and optical flow in order to extract the moving objects from the images. Furthermore a tracking system based on the moving object detection algorithm has been proposed. The tracking system consists of the moving object detection algorithm, a classifier that describes each object and a discrete Kalman filter that estimates the motion of the object. The objects are tracked in the image plane and the estimates are transformed to the North-East-Down (NED) coordinate system. A fixed-wing UAV experiment has been carried out to gather images captured from an airborne UAV and collect data from an IMU and a GPS receiver. The navigation system has been evaluated offline by computer simulations based on the data collected at the experiment. The tracking system and the moving object detection algorithm have also been evaluated in computer simulations. Moving objects have been inserted into the images because moving objects did not exist in the experiment. Promising and accurate results were shown for both the navigation system and the proposed tracking system...|$|R
50|$|Stabilization qualities {{enhanced}} by placement of Kenyon gyros onto mount Helicopter mounts {{are based on}} the principle of a balanced beam that has its gimbal point (center of gravity) behind the operator’s head. The gimbal point is the exact balance point of the roll, pitch and yaw. At the front of the balanced beam is the camera and camera control. At the back of the beam are the counterweights and batteries. The camera has an additional pan and tilt axis (yaw and pitch axis). These are balanced in their own right about the sub camera tilt axis of the balanced beam. This balanced beam in itself has a certain amount of inertia and will resist minimal angular disturbances coming up the gimbal mounting frame. However, in order to achieve a further degree of stabilization, Kenyon gyro modules are added. The Kenyon gyro module is an off-the-shelf motorized flywheel in a cage with one degree of freedom. When the spinning masses (flywheels) within the Kenyon gyro housing, are activated, they add an increased inertia (synthetic) to the overall system, which improves the mount’s ability to absorb the base angular disturbances from reaching the camera. These helicopter mounts with or without Kenyon gyros, can work quite well if: the weather conditions are perfect; the helicopter has the minimum of low frequency vibration (blades have been ‘tracked’ correctly); and you have a “qualified movie pilot” in control of the ship. An operator can achieve good stability for medium focal length lenses with short duration shots at the longer end of the lens. The drawbacks of (C) systems are that the operator’s physical strength is needed to position the camera while they are hanging out the side door of the helicopter. It is hard for the operator to maneuver the camera’s line of site when they are following a subject. The Kenyon gyros will resist their camera <b>positioning,</b> as the <b>gyro</b> will consider it part of the angular base motion. Because of this interaction, the helicopter pilot must undertake most of the camera positioning; the operator will just point the camera at the subject, relying on the pilot for keeping the subject in frame.|$|R
