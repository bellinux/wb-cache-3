40|$|The {{shaping of}} a center-periphery system depends on several {{economic}} and geographical factors that interact {{on a given}} space. Besides, the degree of openness of a country's economy conditions the <b>productive</b> <b>character</b> of its regions. This essay explores the differential effects of either liberal or protectionist trade economic policies on a center-periphery system. Generally, the center tends to be industrial although, depending on the productive structure, it can be either importer or exporter, which has opposing effects on employment and revenues. Our model shows that a center can be industrial and importer if it has an exporter periphery. It specifies that, if the periphery's exports are natural resource intensive, income tends to favor the center. On the contrary, if the periphery exports labor-intensive goods, the contrary should be the case. Thus, technology and quality of exports are the main determinants of a center-periphery system. ...|$|E

I shall argue that the <b>productive</b> <b>character</b> of natural selection derives from the aggregation of individual processes in which organisms live, reproduce and die.

40|$|The rate of {{reproduction}} or fertility of the ewe in a breeding flock determines not only the number of surplus animals available for sale {{as a source of}} income but in addition, affects the scope of selection for improvement in all <b>productive</b> <b>characters.</b> The ewe's fertility therefore is a character whose economic significance is more nearly matched by its biological ramifications than other attributes of the sheep. The extensive usage of the Romney Marsh breed in New Zealand both in breeding flocks and as the basic ewe breed for meat production only adds importance to the need for higher fertility among the ewes of this breed. Although it is known that under New Zealand conditions, Romney ewes can be mated as hoggets (between four and 14 months in age) for lamb production (Apps 1953; Lewis 1959), the common practice is to delay first mating until they are on average about 18 months old. This system of flock management has a two-fold effect on improvement of fertility by mass selection. First, selection for fertility can not take place until after the first lambing and second, being a corollary of the first, the annual rate of genetic gain in fertility is reduced by the increase in generation interval. Therefore, so long as the current system of flock management remains in practice, there is an obvious need to investigate hogget characters which may be used as criteria of potential fertility at the time of selection for replacements when the ewes are less than 18 months old...|$|R

The author proposed to distinguish «Euromaydan» from «Maydan» because of a change in the rhetoric of the requirements of unsprings. And also because of biopolitical nature of these requirements, a revolutionary anti – system direction of the protest movement of «Maydan» author recommended to take a biopolitical project «multitude» of  M. Hardt and A. Negri as basis for the analysis of the mentioned phenomena. The author analyzes these terms in detail: multitude is a new social object that formed due to {{the emergence of a new}} type of production that is not material. Multitude is opposed to the classical understanding of the masses and not translated only as «plurality». In multitude the singularities (individuals) do not lose their creative and <b>productive</b> <b>character.</b> They are capable of self­organization and included into multitude thanks to conception of common rather than identity. Structure of «Euromaydan» and «Maydan» is equal to network structure multitude which is without any center. «Informational Age» (M.

40|$|The {{building}} industry acquired considerable dimensions {{as an economic}} activity during the post-war period in Greece, {{and became one of}} the main sectors of the economy. This thesis grasps the development of the {{building industry}} as an aspect of the industrialisation that took place with the initiative of foreign capital, the concomitant relative decline of the agricultural sector and the ensuing rural exodus and urban expansion. An interpretation is provided {{of the fact that the}} building industry developed along the lines of a mode approximating petty commodity rather than capitalist production proper, the decisive influence being attributed to the conditions of land ownership prevalent in Greece, while the limited size of the industry's market, confined by local boundaries, is seen as an additional factor. This system of building production, ultimately the conditions of land ownership upon which it is founded, and the system of financing it developed is seen as a mechanism distributing incomes in favour of middle and lower classes, explaining at the same time the solution of the housing problem in Greece, in spite of the absence of State intervention in this field. An interpretation is also provided of the fact that the building industry functioned as an important stimulator of the economy of the period developing an integrated basis of production amidst an industrial environment characterised by the relative absence of integration of the stages of production within the boundaries of the domestic economy. Finally, this thesis establishes both in theoretical terms and through the concrete analysis undertaken, the so far widely disputed <b>productive</b> <b>character</b> of the building industry, and its significant effects on the general socio-economic development of the country...|$|E

Research has been conducted in the screen house of Forestry Department from Faculty of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, University of Muhammadiyah Malang. The research was carried out for 5 months, from January to May 2013. Results showed that there was no interaction between planting medium treatment and mango cultivars in all parameters of germination and seedling growth. Medium treatment showed no effect on all parameters of germination and seedling growth. Sand Media + Manure + Rice husk (M 2) gave faster germination time, than the Soil Media + Manure (M 0). Soil + Manure + Compost + Manure (M 1) gave the highest value on plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf length and width, as well as on shoots length.

It was found that the types of hives, where were housed the experimental bees, all other equal conditions of maintenance and exploitation, have not had any impact on the biological process of bees overwinter. This is confirmed {{by the fact that the}} average strengthens of bee colonies in both experimental groups, being equal at the beginning of experiment (1, 78 kg in the autumn of 2010, in entry of overwinter) remained same in spring of 2011 (1, 49 kg out of the winter). Therefore, overwinter resistance of bee colonies in both groups was also identical, averaging 83. 1 %. At the same time, the hive types, tested in experiment, had a significant influence on reproduction process and development of bee colonies in high beekeeping season. Thus, the queens prolificacy from 2 nd batch with bee colonies located in vertical hives during the season, was higher compared to the Ist batch, accommodated in vertical hives, with 60 eggs/ 24 hours, or with 3. 5 % (B > 0. 95). A better prolificacy activity of queens in vertical hives can be explained, in our view, by the fact that they have a better comfort of laying, compared with those from horizontal hives. We found that in horizontal hives, queens prefer for laying the area near bee entrance and it is explained by the fact that this place is better aired and ensure the brood with sufficient oxygen. In vertical hives queens laying is more uniform and it is spread on more honeycombs. This is due to a better and uniform ventilation in entire hive, which gives enough oxygen to brood. All this, has led to an active laying of queens from vertical hives, also to a bigger amount of capped brood and as a result, essential increase of bee colony strengthens. At the beginning of first harvest (locust tree), bee colonies placed in vertical hives reclaimed at a bigger rate than those placed in horizontal hives. Regarding bee colonies strengthens, those from 2 nd batch exceeded significant, at this stage, those from 1 st batch, with 0. 33 kg or 9, 4 % (B > 0, 99). Bee colonies from vertical hives entered overwinter significantly more powerful than bees from horizontal hives, which creates premises for a stronger development and better productivity in the next beekeeping season. Due to a quicker development, bee colonies kept in vertical hives accumulated, during active season, a bigger quantity of honey in the nest. Thus, the total quantity of honey accumulated in nest, bee families maintained in vertical hives have significantly exceeded those from horizontal hives with 7. 5 kg, or 19, 1 % (B > 0. 999). Economic effect obtained at exploitation of vertical hives only from honey production is 375 MD lei, or 23. 8 euro per bee colony. Based on obtained results were made following conclusions. 1. Vertical hives compared to horizontal hives, offer to bee colony more comfortable biological conditions. 2. Maintenance of bee colonies in vertical hives ensures an increase of queens laying - 3. 5 % and of average annual strengthens of the bee colony – with 6. 0 %. 3. Use of vertical hives contributes to increasing of honey production with 19. 1 %. 4. Bee colonies exploitation in vertical hives ensures economic efficiency at least 23. 8 euro per bee colony...|$|R

Twelve promissing lines and check varieties of soybean were planted at KP Sitiung Dharmasraya on two seasons namely MT 1 from August-November 2009 and MT 2 from December to March 2010. Fertilization with a dose of 75 kg of urea was 125 kg SP 36 and 75 kg of KCl/ha, the plot size is 2. 80 m x 4. 0 m. A randomized complete block design with four replication. Variable measured were agronomic characters, yield component and yield. The results the experiment indicated that heritability of all the characters were high (50, 43 % - 95, 98 %). Only heritability of plant high at MT 1 and yield both environments was medium. The value of guess heritabilitas high on <b>productive</b> branch <b>character</b> per plant and pods per plant is supported by genetic advances and coefficient of average genetic variation is quite high and high, thus both these characters can be reference selection criteria to get productive branches per plant and pods per plant...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} research achievements on the breeding, feed, {{and nutrition}} of Japanese quail {{performed at the}} Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding, Department of Agriculture, Okayama University, between 1973 and 2008. 　The study included analysis of inbreeding depression and heterosis, which are important subjects in breeding. Secondly, the genetic parameters useful for selection were identified and the sexing of newborn chicks utilizing sex-linked inheritance was investigated. As problems related to feed and nutrition, the reduced excretion of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), the utilization of a cochineal residue, {{and the effects of}} red salmon astaxanthin, palm oil, and astaxanthin supplementation on eggs functions were investigated. 　In quail, inbreeding depression was noted in overall <b>productive</b> <b>characters,</b> and the depression was marked in reproductive characters, such as hatchability. The genetic load was calculated using the equation: －logeS＝A＋BF. On crossbreeding between highly inbred lines of Japanese quail, marked heterosis was noted in the hatchability, viability, and egg production rate. 　Analysis of early embryonic development showed that the number of mitotic cells, mitotic index, and 3 H-thymidine and 3 H-uridine uptakes were lower in the inbred embryos compared with those of hybrid embryos, indicating important metabolic differences. 　Basic information for the selective breeding of quail, heritability of characters, such as the body weight, muscle mass, skeleton, and egg characteristics were accumulated; accumulated information suggested the possibility of selective breeding with regard to these characters. 　Sexing of newborn quail chicks utilizing sex-linked inheritance was performed. Mating males of the brown line and females of the normal line, all male chicks had normal plumage colors, whereas all females had brown plumage colors, which allowed simple sexing. The supplementation of low-CP feed with essential amino acids and low-CP, low-P feed with phytase improved the growth of chicks, increased the egg production rate, and reduced N and P excretions. Phytase supplementation enhanced tibial growth in the early growth period, and reduced perosis and the mortality of chicks. When female chicks were fed a cochineal residue at 6 weeks of age, the egg production rate was similar to that of chicks fed fish meal, showing the possibility of substitution with fish meal. 　The yolk color was improved by supplementation with red salmon astaxanthin, palm oil, and astaxanthin. The yolk color improved with increases in the supplemented amounts of palm oil and astaxanthin. Astaxanthin added to feed was transferred to the egg yolk, and the antioxidative capacity improved as the amount added increased. 　To further clarify the characteristics of quail as experimental animals, and to improve their productivity as livestock, a continuation in both basic and applied research is indispensable...|$|R
