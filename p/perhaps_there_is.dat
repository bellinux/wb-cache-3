Reich-Ranicki describes the story of Hans Mayer's life as a tragic story, as the story of a person who did not find a home anywhere.|$|E
25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, <b>perhaps</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E

It cannot be 'A good deed is its own reward' as Bart got a reward he likes, {{but at the same}} time it is not 'No good deed goes unrewarded' as they never would have {{received}} anything if Homer had not written the angry letter. Lisa suggests that <b>perhaps</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not a lesson to be learned from this, to which Homer agrees as it's [...] "just a bunch of stuff that happened", though everyone agrees it has been a memorable few days.|$|E

500|$|Nathan Cocks of PC PowerPlay complained {{the need}} for {{secondary}} weapons proves frustrating: [...] "It {{is not uncommon to}} run out of the weapons needed for the job, forcing the player to engage in a tedious game of hide and seek as they scour the map in the hopes of finding another cache." [...] He wrote: [...] "In fact, tedium is a frequent bedfellow in Cannon Fodder 3", {{due to the lack of}} variety in the gameplay and mission objectives. He felt the player's vehicles to be of limited effectiveness as is the ability to split the squad. Cocks complained of the game's [...] "bargain basement production" [...] ruining the tone of the game due to low quality translations and voice acting, as well as numerous bugs causing problems with running the game, crashes, spawning and using vehicles. The reviewer acknowledged the [...] "wonderfully cartoony" [...] graphics, found the gory windscreen wipers [...] "amusing" [...] and wrote [...] "It’s all over-the-top explosive goodness and contributes a great deal to what little appeal is present." [...] Cocks summarised: [...] "Cannon Fodder 3 is the ultimate coat-tail rider [...] <b>perhaps</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some nostalgic pleasure to be taken in this but for the most part, we suggest leaving well enough alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although serial {{correlation}} {{does not affect}} the consistency of [...] the estimated regression coefficients, it does affect our ability to conduct valid statistical tests. First, the F-statistic to test for overall significance of the regression may be inflated under positive {{serial correlation}} because the mean squared error (MSE) will tend to underestimate the population error variance. Second, positive serial correlation typically causes the ordinary least squares (OLS) standard errors for the regression coefficients to underestimate the true standard errors. As a consequence, if positive serial correlation is present in the regression, standard linear regression analysis will typically lead us to compute artificially small standard errors for the regression coefficient. These small standard errors will cause the estimated t-statistic to be inflated, suggesting significance where <b>perhaps</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> none. The inflated t-statistic, may in turn, lead us to incorrectly reject null hypotheses, about population values of the parameters of the regression model more often than we would if the standard errors were correctly estimated.|$|E
2500|$|Gestalt {{psychology}} or gestaltism ( [...] "shape, form") is {{a philosophy}} of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology. Gestalt psychology {{is an attempt to}} understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies. The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking. The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception. In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception, the authors concluded that [...] "even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists, there is little theoretical coherence. What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> in fact, little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together." ...|$|E
