40|$|Purpose To {{compare the}} in vivo surface {{wettability}} of silicone hydrogel (SiHy) contact lenses <b>pre-soaked</b> overnight in different multipurpose solutions (MPS) and normal saline. Methods In this double-blinded, randomized and self-controlled study, 36 subjects were fitted with {{three pairs of}} contact lenses (senofilcon A) <b>pre-soaked</b> overnight in five different MPS and saline in a randomized order. Each pair of lenses (<b>pre-soaked</b> in two different solutions the night before) were worn for 15 min before assessment of pre-lens non-invasive tear break-up time (PL-NITBUT) using the Medmont corneal topographer (video recording). Corneal integrity was assessed using a slit lamp and a resting interval of 20 min was allowed between each pair of lenses to ensure post-lens wear corneal integrity. Results Thirty subjects completed the study. The median PL-NITBUT ranged from 2. 84 s to 3. 08 s with lenses <b>pre-soaked</b> in different MPS, compared to 2. 78 s with lenses <b>pre-soaked</b> in saline. No significant differences in PL-NITBUT were found among lenses <b>pre-soaked</b> in different solutions (p = 0. 647).

40|$|Autogenous {{shrinkage}} is {{a consequence}} of self dessication in pores of hardened cement paste and is, at high performance concrete significantly greater than that of the ordinary concretes, mainly due to low water to cement ratio. In the graduation thesis we examined the main mechanisms that cause autogenous shrinkage. It can be reduced by internal curinginternal water reservoirs. As internal water reservoirs we used <b>pre-soaked</b> expanded clay Liapor. On specimens, in which we replaced 12 % of aggregate with <b>pre-soaked</b> expanded clay, we measured shrinkage and compressive strength. The results were compared with previously performed tests on high performance concrete without additives and on high performance concrete with addition of <b>pre-soaked</b> lightweight aggregate Lehnjak.

5000|$|Cardboard or {{newspaper}} {{can be used}} as mulches. These {{are best}} used as a base layer upon which a heavier mulch such as compost is placed to prevent the lighter cardboard/newspaper layer from blowing away. By incorporating a layer of cardboard/newspaper into a mulch, the quantity of heavier mulch can be reduced, whilst improving the weed suppressant and moisture retaining properties of the mulch. However, additional labour is expended when planting through a mulch containing a cardboard/newspaper layer, as holes must be cut for each plant. Sowing seed through mulches containing a cardboard/newspaper layer is impractical. Application of newspaper mulch in windy weather can be facilitated by briefly <b>pre-soaking</b> the newspaper in water to increase its weight.|$|E

They are grown for their flower colour (usually in pastel shades of blue, pink, purple and white, including bi-colours), and for their intense unique fragrance. They are grown by gardeners for private enjoyment or for exhibition, and in the floristry trade. The large, pea-shaped seeds are sown in cold frames in Spring or Autumn. The seeds benefit from <b>pre-soaking</b> or chipping with a sharp blade. The plants are also available later in the season, as young plants or plugs. They are grown up canes, with the new shoots being regularly pinched out to promote a bushy habit and higher flower yields. Plants typically reach heights of 1-2m, with the flowers appearing in midsummer and continuing for many weeks if regularly deadheaded.|$|E

5000|$|Fiber Bragg {{gratings}} {{are created}} by [...] "inscribing" [...] or [...] "writing" [...] systematic (periodic or aperiodic) variation of refractive index into {{the core of a}} special type of optical fiber using an intense ultraviolet (UV) source such as a UV laser. Two main processes are used: interference and masking. The method that is preferable depends on the type of grating to be manufactured. Normally a germanium-doped silica fiber is used in the manufacture of fiber Bragg gratings. The germanium-doped fiber is photosensitive, which means that the refractive index of the core changes with exposure to UV light. The amount of the change depends on the intensity and duration of the exposure as well as the photosensitivity of the fiber. To write a high reflectivity fiber Bragg grating directly in the fiber the level of doping with germanium needs to be high. However, standard fibers can be used if the photosensitivity is enhanced by <b>pre-soaking</b> the fiber in hydrogen. More recently, fiber Bragg gratings have also been written in polymer fibers, this is described in the PHOSFOS entry.|$|E

Seeds were sown and left to grow for 3 weeks then treated with different concentrations of NaCl (0. 0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 mM) by top irrigation, then they left to grow further for 65 days from sowing. Plant samples were collected for some measurements: leaf area, plant height, root length, fresh and dry weight, photosynthetic pigments, carotenoids, soluble sugars, soluble proteins, total free amino acids, esterase enzyme, as well as MDA (malondialdehyde) content. Salinity reduced both fresh and dry weight in two broad bean cultivars, this reduction were more pronounced in Sakha 3 than Nobaria 3. Seed <b>pre-soaking</b> with KNO 3 resulted in enhancement of fresh and dry weight production in both cultivars especially at 40 mM NaCl. Photosynthetic pigments were substantially affected by salt treatment while the carotenoids were increased, seed <b>pre-soaking</b> with KNO 3 improved these components.

Methods: This study is a controlled observational series comprising of 1585 individuals who underwent ACL reconstruction over a 13 -year period. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon at the same hospital. Group 1 consisted of 285 patients who received pre-operative IV antibiotics without topical graft <b>pre-soaking.</b> Group 2 consisted of 1300 individuals who received IV antibiotics and graft <b>pre-soaking</b> in a vancomycin solution of 5 mg/mL. Results: In group 1, a total of four patients suffered a post-operative joint infection (1. 4 %). Three out of the four were culture positive for Staphylococcus species. The fourth was culture negative but was managed as an acute infection. Group 2 suffered no post-operative infections (0 %). Statistical analysis of the vancomycin pre-soak with IV antibiotics group, compared with IV antibiotics-alone group, revealed a significantly reduced post-operative infection rate using a Fisher’s exact test (P = 0. 0011) and Chi-square test with Yates’ correction (P = 0. 0003). Conclusions: <b>Pre-soaking</b> of hamstrings grafts with topical vancomycin reduced the rate of post-operative infection when compared to IV antibiotics alone.

40|$|In {{previous}} papers {{the mechanism}} and {{dynamics of the}} elution of gold cyanide from activated carbon have been investigated in detail. Sub processes such as the <b>pre-soaking</b> step, the degradation of cyanide, the elution of the spectator cations, the associated shift in the equilibrium of adsorption or desorption {{as a result of}} the removal of cations, the reactivation of the carbon surface, and the elution of gold cyanide have been explained quantitatively to some extent, although further work is evidently required Previous work has also shown that equilibrium conditions may be' assumed when adsorption is weak, hence when aggressive <b>pre-soaking</b> conditions have been used. However, these studies have not taken the competitive effect of base metals into account, although this is known to have an adverse effect on the efficiency of gold elution. The present study has shown quantitatively that copper has a significant effect on the recovery of gold. Nickel and silver also have a detrimental effect, but only if they are present as high loadings. In contrast, the elution of the base metals is to a large degree unaffected by the elution of gold. It is shown in this paper that the multi-component equilibrium relationship between the spectator cations and the various metal cyanides can be very complex, and perhaps ill-defined. In such circumstances it is preferable to use a non-parametric technique such as a back-propagation neural network to represent such an equilibrium relationship. Owing to the difficulty of estimating the final conditions of the <b>pre-soaking</b> step, it is not always possible to predict the exact level of equilibrium.
