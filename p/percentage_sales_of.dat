30|$|This {{hypothesis}} was corroborated by data presented in Table  7, {{which showed that}} old settler households had a higher overall percentage of male calves but a lower overall percentage of bulls. This {{could be due to}} old settler households favouring survival of male calves over female calves through better access to suckling, highlighting a need to generate cash through <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> male stock. The lower percentage of bulls confirms that more immature males exited the herd in old settler households than in new immigrant households to meet cash needs, and fits with the sale data, which shows a higher <b>percentage</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> cattle by old settler than new immigrant households.|$|R

40|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) have a fundamental {{role in the}} economic growth and job creation in almost all economies in the world. Access to finance is fundamental for the survival and growth of SMEs. However, financial constraints are considered {{to be one of the}} most important factors that impede the growth of these firms. To contribute to the understanding of the financial constraints faced by SMEs, this paper sets out to find the firm level determinants of perception of access to finance as an obstacle to the operations of Turkish SMEs. We find that size, age, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> exported and business group affiliation do not have an effect on the tendency to see access to finance as an obstacle. Audited firms are less inclined to see access to finance as an obstacle to their operations. This inclination decreases with an increase in the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> exported. Firms that have made a recent credit application have a lower tendency to see access to finance as an obstacle. This tendency is strengthened with an increase in the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> exported...|$|R

Compliance costs as a <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> turnovers, ranged from 0. 057 % of the smallest company to 0. 001 % of the largest company. Larger companies were generally found to have greater compliance costs than their smaller counterparts, but as a <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales,</b> these costs were greater for smaller corporations. This study adds to the growing body of international literature concerning the distribution of compliance costs burden. Findings from these research activities should lead to the progression of more effective and efficient tax policies and practices...|$|R
