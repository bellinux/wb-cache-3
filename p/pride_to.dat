Encouraged by Warburton's success, Paul Jackson established the Sheriff Hill Pottery in 1771 at {{the northern end of}} the turnpike road and by 1775 was advertising his earthenware in the Newcastle Journal. Jackson's pottery, which became a local centre of pottery production, attracted settlers to the area and became a source of <b>pride</b> <b>to</b> local residents.|$|E

25|$|Phaedrus {{believes}} {{that one of}} the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy’s life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught in something shameful. To get caught in something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room for a sense of <b>pride</b> <b>to</b> come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.|$|E
