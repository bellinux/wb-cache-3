5000|$|The {{class was}} ordered under {{political}} and Treasury pressure {{for a relatively}} cheap, yet modern, general purpose escort vessel which would be attractive to governments and officers of South America and Australasia -the traditional export markets of British shipyards. It was also envisaged as an out-of-area RN gunboat that would retain UK presence in those areas, {{as well as the}} Caribbean and the Gulf; essentially replacing the diesel Types Type 41, Type 61 and COSAG Type 81 with smaller crewed vessels. The RN staff disliked the idea and would have preferred, like many USN Admirals, to continue to develop steam types - in the RN's case, the Leander class, which was regarded as an especially successful and quiet anti-submarine hunter, but was seen by the politicians as dated and by the Treasury and export-oriented shipyards as too expensive to market. The development of Vosper's own export designs, the Mk 5 for Iran and the Mk 7 for Libya, increased the pressure on the Admiralty to accept this line of naval development, which seemed to offer a cheap export frigate with a range of 6,000 nm, a top speed of 37 knots, a superficially good armament of the new Mark 8 4.5 inch gun, facilities for a Westland Wasp helicopter, anti-ship missiles and two triple lightweight Seacat missile launchers. When plans for the new Libyan frigate, Dat Assawari, were finalised in 1968, the Admiralty board accepted its <b>paper</b> <b>specifications</b> were unanswerable [...] and they would have to allow the shipyards to develop a low cost fill in a/s and general purpose version for the RN that would be stretched and fully gas turbine powered rather than CODAG like the Mk 5 and Mk 7. In reality, it was a much more difficult design, with the RN requiring the extra internal weight of the Computer Assisted Action Information System (CAAIS) computer command systems and the lack of heavy diesels or a steam plant low in the hull to balance the heavy top weight of CAAIS. The fitting of Tyne gas turbines for cruising, instead of the diesels used in the Iranian and Libyan versions, meant fuel consumption and cost would be high, which was a tremendous problem for the Royal Navy in the early 1980s when the austerity of early Thatcherism, cut the Royal Navy fuel allowance and meant most frigates spent more time tied up, rather than at sea in 1980-1, and despite the smaller crew, running costs of the Type 21 were ten percent higher than the Leanders. The Type 21 would provide the shipyards with experience in building fully gas turbine powered ships and provide them with useful work for the shipyards while the Type 42 destroyer and Type 22 frigate would not be ready until the mid-to-late 1970s. As the Admiralty design board were busy with the latter, the Type 21 project was given to private shipyards Vosper Thornycroft and Yarrow. The unmistakably yacht-like and rakish lines were indicative of their commercial design. Their handsome looks combined with their impressive handling and acceleration prompted the class nickname of Porsches.|$|E

40|$|New air {{interfaces}} {{are currently}} being developed to meet the high spectral efficiency requirements of the emerging wireless communication systems. Multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) {{is seen as a}} promising candidate for the fourth-generation (4 G) cellular communication systems because it can interestingly deal with the multipath propagation at a low processing complexity. Besides spectral efficiency and power consumption, the production cost of the transceiver should also be optimized. Direct conversion radio frequency (RF) receivers are appealing because they avoid costly intermediate frequency (IF) filters. However, they imply RF IQ separation, introducing a phase and amplitude mismatch between the I and Q branches. A communication system based on MC-CDMA is sensitive to synchronization errors and front-end non-idealities because it uses a long symbol duration. The goal {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the impact of the carrier frequency offset, the sampling clock offset, and the IQ imbalance on the MC-CDMA downlink system performance, considering a receiver based on channel tracking designed to cope with high mobility conditions. It is demonstrated that part of the effects is compensated by the channel estimation and an expression of the variance of the remaining symbol estimation error is provided.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{a survey of}} mobile scanning systems for measuring the railway clearance gauge. The research was completed {{as part of the}} project carried out for the PKP (PKP Polish Railway Lines S. A., Warsaw, Poland) in 2011 – 2013. The authors conducted experiments, including a search for the latest solutions relating to mobile measurement systems that meet the basic requirement. At the very least, these solutions needed to be accurate and have the ability for quick retrieval of data. In the <b>paper,</b> <b>specifications</b> and the characteristics of the component devices of the scanning systems are described. Based on experiments, the authors did some examination of the selected mobile systems to be applied for measuring the clearance gauge. The Riegl (VMX- 250) and Z+F (Zoller + Fröhlich) Solution were tested. Additional test measurements were carried out within a 30 -kilometer section of the Warsaw-Kraków route. These measurements were designed so as to provide various elements of the railway infrastructure, the track geometry and the installed geodetic control network. This ultimately made it possible to reduce the time for the preparation of geodetic reference measurements for the testing of the accuracy of the selected systems. Reference measurements included the use of the polar method to select profiles perpendicular to the axis of the track. In addition, the coordinates selected were well defined as measuring points of the objects of the infrastructure of the clearance gauge. All of the tested systems meet the accuracy requirements initially established (within the range of 2 cm as required by the PKP). The tested systems have shown their advantages and disadvantages...|$|E
40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{capacity of}} cigarette paper {{has been reported}} to be an important parameter in relation to the self-extinguishment of cigarettes and also in relation to carbon monoxide yields. Although the diffusion capacity is routinely measured and instruments for this measurement have been available for several years, differences between measured values obtained on the same paper sample but on different instruments or in different laboratories may be substantial and may make it difficult to use these values, for example, as a basis for <b>paper</b> <b>specifications.</b> Among several reasons, deviations of temperature and pressure from standard conditions, especially within the measurement chamber of the instrument, may contribute to the high variation in diffusion capacity data. Deviations of temperature and pressure will have an influence on the gas flow rates, the diffusion processes inside the measurement chamber and consequently the measured CO 2 concentration. Generally, the diffusion capacity is determined from a mathematical model, which describes the diffusion processes inside the measurement chamber. Such models provide the CO 2 concentration in the outflow gas for a given diffusion capacity. For practical applications the inverse model is needed, that is, the diffusion capacity shall be determined from a measured CO 2 concentration. Often such an inverse model is approximated by a polynomial, which, however, is only valid for standard temperature and pressure. It is shown that relative approximation errors from such polynomials, even without temperature and pressure deviations, cannot always be neglected and it is proposed to eliminate such errors by direct inversion of the model with a comparably simple iterative method. A model which includes temperature and pressure effects is described and the effects of temperature and pressure deviations on the diffusion capacity are theoretically estimated by comparing the output of a model with and without inclusion of temperature and pressure effects. The results suggest that these effects may cause relative differences in the diffusion capacity up to 50 % for pressure and temperature ranges of practical relevanc...|$|E
