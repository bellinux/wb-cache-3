5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail <b>price</b> <b>or</b> 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E
5|$|This decree allowed {{someone who}} {{purchased}} {{a contract to}} void the contract with a payment of only 3.5 percent of the contract <b>price</b> (<b>or</b> about 1/30 the contract). Thus, investors bought increasingly expensive contracts. A speculator could sign a contract to purchase a tulip for 100 guilders. If the price rose above 100 guilders, the speculator would pocket the difference as profit. If the price remained low, the speculator could void the contract for only 3½ guilders. Thus, a contract nominally for 100 guilders, would actually cost an investor no more than 3½ guilders. In early February, as contract prices reached a peak, Dutch authorities stepped in and halted the trading of these contracts.|$|E
5|$|Jesus College (in full: Jesus College in the University of Oxford of Queen Elizabeth's Foundation) {{is one of}} {{the colleges}} of the University of Oxford in England. It is in the centre of the city, on a site between Turl Street, Ship Street, Cornmarket Street and Market Street. The college was founded by Elizabeth I on 27 June 1571 for the {{education}} of clergy, though students now study a broad range of secular subjects. A major driving force behind the establishment of the college was Hugh <b>Price</b> (<b>or</b> Ap Rhys), a churchman from Brecon in Wales. The oldest buildings, in the first quadrangle, date from the 16th and early 17th centuries; a second quadrangle was added between about 1640 and about 1713, and a third quadrangle was built in about 1906. Further accommodation was built on the main site to mark the 400th anniversary of the college, in 1971, and student flats have been constructed at sites in north and east Oxford.|$|E
