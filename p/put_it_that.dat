500|$|In an {{interview}} on 13 November, Angus Young stated that the band had experienced problems with Rudd {{earlier in the year}} when recording Rock or Bust, and that his situation had taken the band by surprise. Rudd had also missed video and photo shoots, and with reference to Rudd's future in the band, Young added, [...] "So, at this stage, it's a pretty tough call for us." [...] He also said the band would continue: [...] "He's got to sort himself out I think... At this point it's kind of a question mark.

500|$|With {{a modest}} income secured, Holst {{was able to}} marry Isobel; the {{ceremony}} was at Fulham Register Office on 22 June 1901. Their marriage lasted until his death; there was one child, Imogen, born in 1907. In 1902 Dan Godfrey and the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra premiered Holst's symphony The Cotswolds (Op. 8), the slow movement {{of which is a}} lament for William Morris who had died in October 1896, three years before Holst began work on the piece. In 1903 Adolph von Holst died, leaving a small legacy. Holst and his wife decided, as Imogen later <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> [...] "as they were always hard up the only thing to do was to spend it all at once on a holiday in Germany".|$|E

Prior {{to his death}} in 2002, Unwin himself praised the off-beat nature of The Secret Service, defending the inclusion of elements such as Unwinese dialogue as [...] "an attempt to add {{a new dimension to}} the puppet field ... It was a bit bizarre, but then aren't many new ideas a little odd at first?" [...] On the subject of the cancellation, he commented that the series was possibly [...] "a little bit before its time". Contrary to Peel and La Rivière, John Walsh of The Guardian challenges the idea that the gobbledegook devalued the series, arguing that [...] "British audiences quite like not understanding things." ...|$|E
500|$|The brief pause from {{politics}} out of national grief at Taylor's death did not abate the crisis. Texas {{had attempted to}} assert its authority in New Mexico territory, and the state's governor, Peter H. Bell, had sent belligerent letters to President Taylor. Fillmore received another such after becoming president. [...] He reinforced federal troops in the area, and warned Bell to keep the peace. By July 31, Clay's bill was effectively dead, as all the significant provisions had been deleted by amendment other than the organization of Utah Territory—one wag <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "Mormons" [...] were the only remaining passengers on the Omnibus. Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas then stepped to the fore, with Clay's agreement, proposing to break the Omnibus into individual bills that could be passed piecemeal. Fillmore endorsed this strategy, with the Omnibus to become (as it proved) five bills.|$|E

He has stated that [...] "during the process where you're supposed to be negotiating peace" [...] Israel, in fact, [...] "doubled its settlement enterprise".|$|R
500|$|Conrad {{first met}} MacFarlane while {{recording}} a [...] clip {{for the season}} five episode [...] "Prick Up Your Ears". She had watched Family Guy for years and considered Stewie her favorite character. Conrad stuck to the script and did not do any improvisation while recording for this episode. In an interview with People, she revealed that she has no plans on getting into acting, and even calls herself an [...] "awful actor" [...] and admits that she cannot memorize lines. However, she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines. Even though she enjoyed the experience, she said that [...] " [...] not really something I'm interested in." [...] She {{had to do a}} lot of research before recording, because [...] "there were a lot of facts and a lot of big words" [...] and she [...] "had to say it as if it was coming to [...] very easily." [...] Her acting coach advised her to learn the lines ahead of time so that she would [...] "really understood what [...] was talking about, it would come through a little more true." [...] MacFarlane commented on this, saying, [...] "She made an effort , so let me just <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] He ultimately praised her performance, calling it [...] "surprisingly fantastic", and said: [...] "She came in, and she'd prepared before she even arrived. She hired an acting coach, with her own money, and she nailed it. She never once complained, and it was a long session. There was a lot of dialog. Her stamina was astonishing." ...|$|E

Lansman cited the Chakrabarti Inquiry {{as an example of the}} latter.|$|E

2500|$|Mitchel was {{a critic}} of {{international}} capitalism, which he blamed for both the pending Civil War and the Great Hunger. In 1861 Mitchel wrote The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps), a jeremiad accusing the English of [...] "deliberate murder" [...] for their actions during the 1845 Irish famine. This tract did much to establish the widespread view, as Mitchel famously <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> [...] "The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the Famine." ...|$|E
2500|$|The general {{response}} was [...] "as the Westminster Review <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> Gosse's theory was 'too monstrous for belief.'" [...] Even his friend, the novelist Charles Kingsley, {{wrote that he}} had read [...] "no other book which so staggered and puzzled" [...] him, {{that he could not}} believe that God had [...] "written on the rocks one enormous and superfluous lie for all mankind." [...] Journalists later sniggered that God had apparently hidden fossils in the rocks to tempt geologists to infidelity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem with}} these {{dictionaries}} {{was that they}} tended to {{be little more than}} poorly organised and poorly researched glossaries of [...] "hard words": words that were technical, foreign, obscure or antiquated. But perhaps the greatest single fault of these early lexicographers was, as historian Henry Hitchings <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> they [...] "failed to give sufficient sense of [...] language as it appeared in use." [...] In that sense Dr. Johnson's dictionary was the first to comprehensively document the English lexicon.|$|E
60|$|The {{effects of}} Fletcher's removal were not long in following. On the morrow came the Bridport affair, and Grey's shameful conduct when, had he stood his ground, victory {{must have been}} assured the Duke's forces instead of just that honourable retreat by which Colonel Wade so gallantly saved the situation. Mr. Wilding did not mince his words in <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Grey had run away.|$|R

Colbert had earlier appeared on The Daily Show, the program immediately preceding his own on the Comedy Central lineup, but had stated that his final declaration of candidacy would be made on a [...] "more prestigious show". Subsequent to his declaration, Colbert appeared on Meet the Press on October 21, 2007, where he asserted the reality of his campaign: [...] "I'm far realer than Sam Brownback, let me <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way," [...] said Colbert.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Rafter won the US Open, {{a tournament}} that many {{expected}} Sampras to win, having won in 1995 and 1996. The win catapulted Rafter to the year-end no. 2 rankings behind Sampras. Seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe believed Rafter to be a [...] "one-slam wonder", {{since it was}} only his second career ATP title. Up to that point, Sampras was 5-1 against Rafter, and defeated Rafter three times in fall 1997 to solidify his No. 1 ATP ranking.

[...] The Thirteenth Amendment ultimately abolished slavery and removed the federal judiciary from the business of returning fugitive slaves.
