25|$|The Mostly Male Theory {{has a more}} genetic basis. Proponents of {{this theory}} {{point out that the}} {{gymnosperms}} have two very similar copies of the gene LFY while angiosperms only have one. Molecular clock analysis has shown that the other LFY <b>paralog</b> was lost in angiosperms around the same time as flower fossils become abundant, suggesting that this event might have led to floral evolution. According to this theory, loss of one of the LFY <b>paralog</b> led to flowers that were more male, with the ovules being expressed ectopically. These ovules initially performed the function of attracting pollinators, but sometime later, may have been integrated into the core flower.|$|E

500|$|The {{proteins}} of the RecA recombinase {{family of}} proteins {{are thought to}} be descended from a common ancestral recombinase. The RecA recombinase family contains RecA protein from bacteria, the Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins from eukaryotes, and RadA from archaea, and the recombinase <b>paralog</b> proteins. Studies modeling the evolutionary relationships between the Rad51, Dmc1 and RadA proteins indicate that they are monophyletic, or that they share a common molecular ancestor. [...] Within this protein family, Rad51 and Dmc1 are grouped together in a separate clade from RadA. One of the reasons for grouping these three proteins together is that they all possess a modified helix-turn-helix [...] motif, which helps the proteins bind to DNA, toward their N-terminal ends. [...] An ancient gene duplication event of a eukaryotic RecA gene and subsequent mutation has been proposed as a likely origin of the modern [...] RAD51 and DMC1 genes.|$|E

[...] MCU is an essential component of the mitochondrial membrane and sliencing MCU abolishes calcium uptake.

40|$|Homologous {{genes are}} {{classified}} into orthologs and <b>paralogs,</b> {{depending on whether}} they arose by speciation or duplication. It is widely assumed that orthologs share similar functions, whereas <b>paralogs</b> are expected to diverge more from each other. But does this assumption hold up on further examination? We present evidence that orthologs and <b>paralogs</b> are not so different in either their evolutionary rates or their mechanisms of divergence. We {{emphasize the importance of}} appropriately designed studies to test models of gene evolution between orthologs and between <b>paralogs.</b> Thus, functional change between orthologs might be as common as between <b>paralogs,</b> and future studies should be designed to test the impact of duplication against this alternative model...|$|R
50|$|Paralogous genes often {{belong to}} the same species, but this is not necessary: for example, the {{hemoglobin}} gene of humans and the myoglobin gene of chimpanzees are <b>paralogs.</b> <b>Paralogs</b> can be split into in-paralogs (paralogous pairs that arose after a speciation event) and out-paralogs (paralogous pairs that arose before a speciation event). Between-species out-paralogs are pairs of <b>paralogs</b> that exist between two organisms due to duplication before speciation, whereas within-species out-paralogs are pairs of <b>paralogs</b> that exist in the same organism, but whose duplication event happened before speciation. <b>Paralogs</b> typically have the same or similar function, but sometimes do not: due to lack of the original selective pressure upon one copy of the duplicated gene, this copy is free to mutate and acquire new functions.|$|R
2500|$|A {{series of}} gene duplications {{of a single}} {{eukaryote}} LSm gene resulted in most (if not all) of the known eukaryote LSm genes. [...] Each of the seven Sm proteins has greater amino acid sequence homology to a corresponding Lsm protein than to the other Sm proteins. [...] This suggests that an ancestral LSm gene duplicated several times, resulting in seven paralogs. [...] These subsequently diverged from each other so that the ancestral homoheptamer LSm ring became a heteroheptamer ring. [...] Based on the known functions of LSm proteins in eukaryotes and archaea, the ancestral function may have been processing of pre-ribosomal RNA, pre-transfer RNA, and pre-RNase P. [...] Then, according to this hypothesis, the seven ancestral eukaryote LSm genes duplicated again to seven pairs of Sm/LSm paralogs; LSm1/SmB, LSm2/SmD1, LSm3/SmD2, LSm4/SmD3, LSm5/SmE, LSm6/SmF and LSm7/SmG. [...] These two group of seven LSm genes (and the corresponding two kinds of LSm rings) evolved to an Sm ring (requiring RNA) and a Lsm ring (which forms without RNA). [...] The LSm1/LSm8 <b>paralog</b> pair also seems to have originated prior to the last common eukaryote ancestor, {{for a total of}} at least 15 LSm protein genes. [...] The SmD1/LSm10 <b>paralog</b> pair and the SmD2/LSm11 <b>paralog</b> pair exist only in animals, fungi, and the amoebozoa (sometimes identified as the unikont clade) and appears to be absent in the bikont clade (chromalveolates, excavates, plants and rhizaria). [...] Therefore, these two gene duplications predated this fundamental split in the eukaryote lineage. [...] The SmB/SmN <b>paralog</b> pair is seen only in the placental mammals, which dates this LSm gene duplication.|$|E

40|$|Background: Gene {{duplication}} {{is a major}} {{driver of}} evolutionary innovation as it allows for an organism to elaborate its existing biological functions via specialization or diversification of initially redundant gene <b>paralogs.</b> Gene function can diversify in several ways. Transcription factor gene <b>paralogs</b> in particular, can diversify either by changes in their tissue-specific expression pattern or by changes in the DNA binding site motif recognized by their protein product, which in turn alters their gene targets. The relationship between these two modes of functional diversification of transcription factor <b>paralogs</b> has not been previously investigated, and is essential for understanding adaptive evolution of transcription factor gene families. Findings: Based on a large set of human paralogous transcription factor pairs, we show that when the DNA binding site motifs of transcription factor <b>paralogs</b> are similar, the expressions of the genes that encode the <b>paralogs</b> have diverged, so in general, at most one of the <b>paralogs</b> is highly expressed in a tissue. Moreover, <b>paralogs</b> with diverged DNA binding site motifs tend to be diverged in their function. Conversely, two <b>paralogs</b> that are highly expressed in a tissue tend to have dissimilar DNA binding site motifs. We have also found that in general, within a paralogous family, tissue-specific decrease in gene expression is more frequent than what is expected by chance. Conclusions: While previous investigations of paralogous gene diversification have only considered coding sequence divergence, by explicitly quantifying divergence in DNA binding site motif, our work presents a new paradigm fo...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{addition}} to the recombinase Rad 51, vertebrates have five <b>paralogs</b> of Rad 51, {{all members of the}} Rad 51 -dependent recombination pathway. These <b>paralogs</b> form two complexes (Rad 51 C/Xrcc 3 and Rad 51 B/C/D/Xrcc 2), which play roles in somatic recombination, DNA repair and chromosome stability. However, little is known of their possible involvement in meiosis, due to the inviability of the corresponding knockout mice. We have recently reported that the Arabidopsis homolog of one of these Rad 51 <b>paralogs</b> (AtXrcc 3) is involved in DNA repair and meiotic recombination and present here Arabidopsis lines carrying mutations in three other Rad 51 <b>paralogs</b> (AtRad 51 B, AtRad 51 C and AtXrcc 2). Disruption of any one of these <b>paralogs</b> confers hypersensitivity to the DNA cross-linking agent Mitomycin C, but not to gamma-irradiation. Moreover, the atrad 51 c- 1 mutant {{is the only one of}} these to show meiotic defects similar to those of the atxrcc 3 mutant, and thus only the Rad 51 C/Xrcc 3 complex is required to achieve meiosis. These results support conservation of functions of the Rad 51 <b>paralogs</b> between vertebrates and plants and differing requirements for the Rad 51 <b>paralogs</b> in meiosis and DNA repair...|$|R

40|$|Results of electrophoretic {{surveys have}} {{suggested}} that hemoglobin polymorphism may be maintained by balancing selection in natural populations of house mice, Mus musculus. Here we report a survey of nucleotide variation in the adult globin genes of house mice from South America. We surveyed nucleotide polymorphism in two closely linked a-globin <b>paralogs</b> and two closely linked b-globin <b>paralogs</b> to test whether patterns of variation are consistent with a model of long-term balancing selection. Surprisingly high levels of nucleotide polymorphism at the two b-globin <b>paralogs</b> were attributable to the segregation of two highly divergent haplotypes, Hbb s (which carries two identical b-globin <b>paralogs)</b> and Hbb d (which carries two functionally divergent b-globin <b>paralogs).</b> Interparalog gene conversion on the Hbb s haplotype has produced a highly unusual {{situation in which the}} two <b>paralogs</b> are more similar to one another than either one is to its allelic counterpart on the Hbb d haplotype. Levels of nucleotide polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium at the two b-globin <b>paralogs</b> suggest a complex history of diversity-enhancing selection that may be responsible for long-term maintenance of alternative protein alleles. The alternative two-locus b-globin haplotypes are associated with pronounced differences in intraerythrocyte glutathione and nitric oxide metabolism, suggesting a possible mechanism for selection on hemoglobin function...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterized}} ectopic gene conversions in {{the genome}} of ten hemiascomycete yeast species. Of the ten species, three diverged {{prior to the}} whole genome duplication (WGD) event present in the yeast lineage and seven diverged after it. We analyzed gene conversions from three separate datasets: <b>paralogs</b> from the three pre-WGD species, <b>paralogs</b> from the seven post-WGD species, and common ohnologs from the seven post-WGD species. Gene conversions have similar lengths and frequency and occur between sequences having similar degrees of divergence, in <b>paralogs</b> from pre- and post-WGD species. However, the sequences of ohnologs are both more divergent and less frequently converted than those of <b>paralogs.</b> This likely {{reflects the fact that}} ohnologs are more often found on different chromosomes and are evolving under stronger selective pressures than <b>paralogs.</b> Our results also show that ectopic gene conversions tend to occur more frequently between closely linked genes.

50|$|In the Duplication- Degeneration- Complementation (DDC) {{model of}} subfunctionalization both gene copies {{are needed to}} perform the {{original}} ancestral function.

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{duplication}} is {{a normal}} evolutionary process. If there is no selective advantage in keeping the duplicated gene, it is usually reduced to a pseudogene and disappears from the genome. However, some <b>paralogs</b> are retained. These gene products {{are likely to be}} beneficial to the organism, e. g. in adaptation to new environmental conditions. The aim of our analysis is to investigate the properties of paralog-forming genes in prokaryotes, and to analyse the role of these retained <b>paralogs</b> by relating gene properties to life style of the corresponding prokaryotes. Results <b>Paralogs</b> were identified in a number of prokaryotes, and these <b>paralogs</b> were compared to singletons of persistent orthologs based on functional classification. This showed that the <b>paralogs</b> were associated with for example energy production, cell motility, ion transport, and defence mechanisms. A statistical overrepresentation analysis of gene and protein annotations was based on <b>paralogs</b> of the 200 prokaryotes with the highest fraction of paralog-forming genes. Biclustering of overrepresented gene ontology terms versus species was used to identify clusters of properties associated with clusters of species. The clusters were classified using similarity scores on properties and species to identify interesting clusters, and a subset of clusters were analysed by comparison to literature data. This analysis showed that <b>paralogs</b> often are associated with properties that are important for survival and proliferation of the specific organisms. This includes processes like ion transport, locomotion, chemotaxis and photosynthesis. However, the analysis also showed that the gene ontology terms sometimes were too general, imprecise or even misleading for automatic analysis. Conclusions Properties described by gene ontology terms identified in the overrepresentation analysis are often consistent with individual prokaryote lifestyles and are likely to give a competitive advantage to the organism. <b>Paralogs</b> and singletons dominate different categories of functional classification, where <b>paralogs</b> in particular seem to be associated with processes involving interaction with the environment. </p...|$|R
