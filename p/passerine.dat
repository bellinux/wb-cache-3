5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a widespread <b>passerine</b> bird species, several geographical subspecies are recognised. The treatment of subspecies in this article follows Clement et al. (2000).|$|E
5|$|Gnatcatchers are a {{group of}} small insectivorous <b>passerine</b> birds. Most are of {{generally}} undistinguished appearance, but many have distinctive songs.|$|E
5|$|Long-tailed tits are a {{group of}} small <b>passerine</b> birds with medium to long tails. They make woven bag nests in trees. Most eat a mixed diet which {{includes}} insects.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>passerines</b> contain {{several groups}} of brood parasites such as [...] the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most <b>passerines</b> are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.|$|R
50|$|There are 628 {{species of}} birds found in Bangladesh under 16 orders and 67 families, {{including}} 276 <b>passerines.</b> Resident species total 388 (including 171 <b>passerines)</b> under 16 orders and 60 families, while the remaining 240 species (including 105 <b>passerines)</b> under 10 orders and 33 families are migratory. The mammals of Bangladesh comprise 110 species of inland mammals under 12 orders and 35 families, and three species of marine mammals only from the order Cetacea.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{known as}} {{perching}} birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the <b>passerines</b> form {{one of the}} most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).The <b>passerines</b> contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most <b>passerines</b> are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.|$|R
5|$|Motacillidae is {{a family}} of small <b>passerine</b> birds with medium to long tails and {{comprises}} the wagtails, longclaws and pipits. These are slender, ground feeding insectivores of open country.|$|E
5|$|Sparrows {{are small}} <b>passerine</b> birds, {{typically}} small, plump, brown or grey with short tails and short powerful beaks. They are seed-eaters, but also consume small insects.|$|E
5|$|The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) {{is a large}} <b>passerine</b> {{bird species}} of the family Corvidae. It is a common bird found {{throughout}} much of North America.|$|E

5|$|The Emberizidae are a {{large family}} of {{seed-eating}} <b>passerine</b> birds with distinctively shaped bills. There are about 372 species worldwide, eight {{of which have been}} recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater (Entomyzon cyanotis), also colloquially {{known as}} the bananabird, is a <b>passerine</b> bird of the honeyeater family, Meliphagidae.|$|E
25|$|Clutches vary {{considerably}} in size: some larger <b>passerines</b> of Australia such as lyrebirds and scrub-robins lay {{only a single}} egg, most smaller <b>passerines</b> in warmer climates lay between two and five, whilst in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, hole-nesting species like tits can lay up to a dozen and other species around five or six.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} migratory behaviour of nocturnally migrating <b>passerines</b> and common swifts (Apus apus). Birds passing Lund (southern Sweden) and Abisko (northernmost Scandinavia) where sampled using tracking radar. The aim {{has been to}} investigate potential diverging strategies between spring and autumn migration. We have found that both <b>passerines</b> and swifts compensate for wind drift, the swifts more so than <b>passerines.</b> Such compensation for displacement by winds where found both during spring and autumn migration. At Abisko the birds exhibited an exaggerated scatter of flight directions, particularly during spring migration. We have suggested that this behavior reflects the final approach orientation and navigation of the migrants. Additionally, both swifts and <b>passerines</b> flew at higher air speeds (speed relative the air) in spring than in autumn, indicating a selection for time minimization on migration to the breeding grounds. However, we saw no indications of birds favouring tailwind conditions for their migratory flights...|$|R

40|$|Vast {{numbers of}} insects and <b>passerines</b> achieve long-distance migrations between {{summer and winter}} {{locations}} by undertaking high-altitude nocturnal flights. Insects such as noctuid moths fly relatively slowly {{in relation to the}} surrounding air, with airspeeds approximately one-third of that of <b>passerines.</b> Thus, it has been widely assumed that windborne insect migrants will have comparatively little control over their migration speed and direction compared with migrant birds. We used radar to carry out the first comparative analyses of the flight behaviour and migratory strategies of insects and birds under nearly equivalent natural conditions. Contrary to expectations, noctuid moths attained almost identical ground speeds and travel directions compared with <b>passerines,</b> despite their very different flight powers and sensory capacities. Moths achieved fast travel speeds in seasonally appropriate migration directions by exploiting favourably directed winds and selecting flight altitudes that coincided with the fastest air streams. By contrast, <b>passerines</b> were less selective of wind conditions, relying on self-powered flight in their seasonally preferred direction, often with little or no tailwind assistance. Our results demonstrate that noctuid moths and <b>passerines</b> show contrasting risk-prone and risk-averse migratory strategies in relation to wind. Comparative studies of the flight behaviours of distantly related taxa are critically important for understanding the evolution of animal migration strategies...|$|R
