5|$|After the Gdańsk Agreement, the Polish {{government}} was under increasing <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union {{to take action}} and strengthen its position. Stanisław Kania was viewed by Moscow as too independent, and on October 18, 1981, the Party Central Committee {{put him in the}} minority. Kania lost his post as First Secretary, and was replaced by Prime Minister (and Minister of Defence) Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Nine Network {{to adopt}} the nine dots, NBN Television {{retained}} its logo {{for a few years}} after aggregation. However, in 1994, NBN added nine dots into a new logo designed similarly to the Nine Network's, and also began using Nine's on-air promotion, with the NBN logo replacing Nine's. In 1997, the dots were changed to spheres.|$|E
5|$|Expectations of the {{eventual}} {{population of the}} town were revised upwards several times. The 1949 master plan had allowed for 50,000 people, but this was amended to 55,000 in 1956 after the Development Corporation had successfully resisted <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Minister for Town and Country Planning to accommodate 60,000. Nevertheless, plans dated 1961 anticipated growth to 70,000 by 1980, and by 1969 consideration was given to an eventual expansion of up to 120,000.|$|E

5|$|Following growing <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> anti-apartheid {{movement}} both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed {{the ban on}} the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990.|$|E
5|$|From the Danish {{colonization}} in the 1700s to {{the beginning}} of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at replacing Greenlandic with Danish. Of primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.|$|E
5|$|In 1285, {{increasing}} Tatar <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northeast {{had forced}} the Second Bulgarian Empire {{to come under}} the political dependence of Nogai Khan, the ruler of the Golden Horde. At the time Shishman's realm centred at Vidin was largely independent from the Bulgarian tsars in Tarnovo, though he retained a degree of loyalty to Bulgaria and maintained friendly relations with Serbia. However, in 1291 Shishman too was forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of Nogai in order to counter the increasing Serbian <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west. In the same year, the joint forces of Hungarian vassal Stephen Dragutin and Serbian king Stephen Milutin (r. 1280–1321) had managed to oust two Cuman–Bulgarian nobles and allies of Shishman, Darman and Kudelin, who were {{in control of the}} Braničevo region.|$|E

5|$|In the 2nd centuryBC, the Iazyges {{began to}} migrate {{west to the}} steppe near the Lower Dniester. One {{possible}} explanation of this was that the Roxolani, who were the Iazyges' eastern neighbors, were also migrating west, due to <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Aorsi, which {{put pressure on the}} Iazyges and forced them to migrate west as well.|$|E

5|$|It was Geoffrey Barrow's belief, {{supported}} by Donald Watt, that their decision {{was the result}} of <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> new Scottish king, Robert de Brus, who may have valued Balmyle's experience and trusted his political record.

5|$|Kapil {{initially}} did not resign {{or take a}} {{leave of}} absence, from his coaching responsibilities.

5|$|Many {{towns and}} cities began to erect war {{memorials}} after the armistice, but Manchester did not get underway until 1922. As a result of <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local branch of the Royal British Legion, the city council formed a war memorial committee, chaired by the mayor, to explore options for commemoration.

5|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ice caused Endurance {{to start}} to take on water. To prevent the ship from {{flooding}} McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ice crushing the ship though and was experienced enough {{to know when to}} stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he was put in charge of rescuing the stores from what had been The Ritz. With McNish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} Van, {{one of the}} largest cities in Turkish (Western) Armenia, Khrimian became a celibate priest (vardapet) in 1854 {{after the death of his}} wife and daughter. In the 1850s and 1860s he served as the abbot of two {{important}} monasteries in Turkish Armenia: Varagavank near Van and Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush. During this period he established schools and journals in both monasteries. He served as Patriarch of Constantinople—the most influential figure within the Ottoman Armenian community—from 1869 to 1873 and resigned due to <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman government which saw him as a threat. He was the head of the Armenian delegation at the 1878 Congress of Berlin.
