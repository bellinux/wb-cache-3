25|$|Bias {{arising out}} of a non-pecuniary {{interest}} can, like a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest,</b> result in the automatic disqualification of a judge from hearing a case. In R. v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2) (1999), the issue was whether Lord Hoffmann {{should be regarded as}} automatically disqualified from hearing an appeal by Augusto Pinochet against his extradition to Spain to stand trial for crimes against humanity. Lord Hoffmann was the Director and Chairperson of Amnesty International Charity Ltd., a company undertaking the aspects of the work of Amnesty International Ltd. which are charitable under UK law. He had no <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest</b> in the company as he was neither employed nor paid by it, but had carried out fund-raising for it. Amnesty International Ltd. was a party to the case against Pinochet. The House of Lords decided the issue in the affirmative, stating that as the fundamental principle is that a man cannot be a judge in his own cause, there is no good reason in principle for limiting automatic disqualification only to pecuniary interests.|$|E
25|$|The rule of {{necessity}} {{is perhaps the}} greatest single common law exception to the general rule that an adjudicator {{who appears to be}} biased or prejudiced must disqualify himself or herself from participating in a proceeding. The rule, which is firmly established in English, Commonwealth and American jurisdictions, has the following effect: the disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act. The rule applies regardless of whether the disqualification arguably arises from the combination of prosecutorial and judicial functions, <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest,</b> personal hostility or bias.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of necessity is {{an exception to the}} rule against bias and operates to prevent a failure of justice. According to Anwar Siraj v. Tang I Fang (1982), necessity is the greatest single common law exception to the general rule that an adjudicator who appears to be biased or prejudiced must disqualify himself from participating in a proceeding. This rule is firmly established and is to the effect that disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act. The rule applies regardless of whether the disqualification arguably arises from the combination of prosecutorial and judicial functions, <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest,</b> personal hostility or bias.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest,</b> other forms of personal interest that an adjudicator has in a decision may {{give the impression that}} he or she is biased. As the High Court stated in Re Singh Kalpanath (1992), a likelihood of bias may arise because an adjudicator (1) has already indicated partisanship by expressing opinions antagonistic or favourable to the parties before him; (2) has made known his views about the merits of the very issue or issues of a similar nature in such a way as to suggest prejudgment; or (3) has a personal relationship with the party or there is close kinship between the adjudicator and a party.|$|E

They had only a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest</b> in the abbey site and sold it the following day to William Langley, a Shrewsbury tailor. After five generations, the last of the Langley line left it in 1701 to Edward Baldwin, a Middle Temple lawyer. As he died without issue, it was passed via his sister to the Powys family.|$|E

25|$|When the {{decision-maker}} has a pecuniary {{or personal}} interest {{in relation to the}} parties in the decision, he or she will be disqualified from making the decision on the basis that there is imputed bias. If the adjudicator has a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest</b> in the case, however small the interest is, it will be enough for the decision to be set aside. As for a personal interest, if it can be shown that, for example, an adjudicator has already indicated partisanship by expressing opinions antagonistic or favourable to the parties before him, or has made known his views about the merits of the very issue or issues of a similar nature {{in such a way as}} to suggest prejudgment, or because of his personal relationship with a party, the court is likely to impute bias.|$|E

2500|$|In {{answering}} {{the central question}} {{of what constitutes a}} pecuniary or proprietary interest, the trend over time has been towards a raising of the degree of the interest that will disqualify adjudicators. In the 19th century it was held that [...] "any direct <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest,</b> however small" [...] would result in a disqualification for bias. By 1999, the courts had come to apply a de minimis exception to the degree of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest</b> required. Nonetheless, [...] "any doubt should be resolved in favour of disqualification".|$|E
2500|$|In {{considering}} whether a pecuniary or proprietary interest exists, it is irrelevant whether the decision-maker was actually biased or not when exercising {{his or her}} powers. Though it may be practically possible to exercise impartiality in such a situation, it is the appearance of justice {{that lies at the}} root of this principle of natural justice. In Dimes, certiorari was granted to quash Lord Cottenham's decree due to his <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest</b> in the outcome of the case even though, as Lord Campbell stated, [...] "o one can suppose that Lord Cottenham could be, in the remotest degree, influenced by the interest that he had in this concern". Similarly, in the Alkaff case Acting Chief Justice Terrell noted that the rule against bias applied even though, quoting the trial judge, [...] " [...] was in fact completely unbiased. He conducted his inquiry in each case methodically and exhaustively and with the most fairness and impartiality".|$|E

2500|$|C. B. Macpherson {{identifies}} {{an underlying}} {{model of the}} market underlying Anglo-American liberal-democratic political economy and philosophy in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries: persons are cast as self-interested individuals, who enter into contractual relations with other such individuals, concerning the exchange of goods or personal capacities cast as commodities, with the motive of maximizing <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest.</b> The state and its governance systems are cast as outside of this framework. This model came to dominant economic thinking in the later nineteenth century, as economists such as Ricardo, Mill, Jevons, Walras and later neo-classical economics shifted from reference to geographically located marketplaces to an abstract [...] "market". This tradition is continued in contemporary neoliberalism, where the market is held up as optimal for wealth creation and human freedom, and the states' role imagined as minimal, reduced to that of upholding and keeping stable property rights, contract, and money supply. According to David Harvey, this allowed for boilerplate economic and institutional restructuring under structural adjustment and post-Communist reconstruction. Similar formalism occurs {{in a wide variety of}} social democratic and Marxist discourses that situate political action as antagonistic to the market. In particular, commodification theorists such as György Lukács insist that market relations necessarily lead to undue exploitation of labour and so need to be opposed in toto.|$|E

2500|$|Mrs Morrell left {{an estate}} of £157,000 and made eight cash bequests of between £300 and £1,000. Cullen claims {{that in some}} of the several wills she made Adams was bequeathed large sums of money and her Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (valued at £1,500).

Despite the last codicil, Mrs Morrell's son gave Adams the Rolls-Royce which was 19 years old, and the chest of silver cutlery. After Mrs Morrell's death, he also took away an infrared lamp she had bought herself, worth £60. Adams billed Morrell's estate for 1,100 visits, costing £1,674 in total. The police estimated that Adams had visited Morrell a total of 321 times during her treatment.

2500|$|The {{prelude to}} the crisis began when Bob Day of the Family First Party {{resigned}} from the Senate on 1 November 2016 following the collapse of his business. Shortly after Day's resignation, the government {{announced that it would}} move in the Senate to refer to the High Court the matter of the validity of Day's election in July 2016 in regard to a possible breach of section 44(v) of the Constitution, which provides that a person who [...] "has any direct or indirect <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest</b> in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth" [...] (and s 44 continues) [...] "shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting" [...] as a member of either house of the Parliamentand it follows that they are ineligible to be nominated for election to either house. The basis of the complaint was that, at Day's request, his Commonwealth-funded electorate office was by lease of part of a building in Adelaide that he indirectly owned, so that the Commonwealth's payments of rent would eventually come into a bank account of his own. In April 2017, the court found that Day was not validly elected at the 2016 election and ordered that a special count of South Australian ballot papers be held in order to determine his replacement. The court announced that Lucy Gichuhi was elected in his place. The Australian Labor Party lodged a challenge, claiming that Gichuhi might still be a citizen of Kenya, hence ineligible under Constitution section 44(i) as a citizen of a [...] "foreign power". [...] On 19 April 2017 a full court of the High Court found that the objection had not been made out and declared Gichuhi elected.|$|E
