40|$|Objective. The risk of {{complications}} and deaths related to pneumococcal infections is high among high risk population (i. e. those with chronic {{diseases such as}} diabetes or asthma), despite current immunization recommendations. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the use of <b>pneumonia</b> <b>vaccine</b> in adults with and without diabetes or asthma by year of age and whether immunization practices conform to policy recommendations. ^ Methods. Data were drawn from 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Study. Age specific estimated counts and proportions of pneumonia vaccination status were computed. The association of socio-demographic factors with vaccination status was estimated from multiple logistic regression and results were presented for adults (18 - 64 yrs) and elderly (65 or older). ^ Results. Overall 12. 3 % of the adults and 61. 5 % of elderly reported ever received <b>pneumonia</b> <b>vaccine.</b> 66. 8 % of diabetics and 72. 6 % of asthmatics received the vaccine among elderly. 33. 4 % of diabetics and 21. 6 % of asthmatics received the vaccine among adults. These numbers are far away from Healthy people 2010 objective coverage rates of 90 % for elderly and 60 % for high risk adults. Though diabetes was one of the recommendations for the <b>pneumonia</b> <b>vaccine</b> still the status was less than 70 % even at older ages. Although asthma was not an indication for <b>pneumonia</b> <b>vaccine,</b> asthmatics still achieved 50 % level by an early age of 60 and reached up to 80 % at as early as 75 years. In those having both asthma and diabetes, although the curve reaches to 50 % level at a very early age of 40 yrs, it is not stable until the age of 55 and percentages reached to as high as 90 % in older ages. Odds of receiving <b>pneumonia</b> <b>vaccine</b> were high in individuals with diabetes or asthma in both the age groups. But the odds were stronger for diabetics in adults compared to those in the elderly [2. 24 CI (2. 08 - 2. 42) and 1. 32 CI (1. 18 - 1. 47) ]. The odds were slightly higher in adults than in elderly for asthmatics [1. 92 CI (1. 80 - 2. 04) and 1. 73 CI (1. 50 - 2. 00) ]. The likelihood of vaccination also differed by gender, ethnicity, marital status, income category, having a health insurance, current employment, physician visit in last year, reporting of good to excellent health and flu vaccine status. ^ Conclusion. There is a very high proportion of high risk adults and elderly that remain unvaccinated. Given the proven efficacy and safety of vaccine there is a need for interventions targeting the barriers for under-vaccination with more emphasis on physician knowledge and practice as well as the recipient attitudes. ...|$|E

Intratracheal inoculation of the challenge was superior to the intranasal or aerosol route for inducing a consistent degree of lung disease. A challenge dose of 10 (6) CFU inoculated intratracheally produced lung colonization and significant reproducible lung pathological scores in essentially all unvaccinated animals.

At the first session, baseline antibody titres were determined, before participants completed either a brisk walk around campus at > 55 % of their age-predicted heart rate maximum, or a resting control condition, for 45 min. After the intervention, all participants received a full-dose pneumococcal vaccination and a half-dose influenza vaccination. Four weeks later, participants returned for a follow up blood sample. Multivariate ANOVA revealed an increase in total antibody titres against the influenza vaccine (F((12, 106)) = 25. 76, p. 15), indicating that a 45 min brisk walk prior to vaccination did not affect antibody response to either the influenza or <b>pneumonia</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The results suggest that higher intensity exercise is necessary to augment antibody response to vaccination...|$|E

A single dose of the cell extract vaccine did not protect animals, but two doses caused a marked reduction of disease when a priming dose was given intraperitoneally, followed by a booster dose intratracheally. The correlation between the level of metabolism inhibition antibodies to M. pneumoniae in the sera of vaccinated hamsters and the degree of protection as measured by reduction of lung pathological scores and colonization was poor, indicating that seroconversion rates for metabolism inhibition antibodies are not by themselves adequate to measure the potency of M. <b>pneumoniae</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R

We investigated the efficacy of recombinant PiuA and PiaA proteins at eliciting protective immunity in mice against systemic infection with S. pneumoniae. Both recombinant PiuA and PiaA generated antibody responses that cross-reacted with each other but not with pneumolysin and reacted with identical proteins from nine different S. pneumoniae serotypes. Mice immunized with recombinant PiuA and PiaA were protected against systemic challenge to a degree similar to those immunized with an existing protein vaccine candidate, PdB (a genetically modified pneumolysin toxoid).

The other group of 600 piglets was left unvaccinated as a control. The evaluation of DWG from the time of vaccination until slaughter showed that the DWG in the vaccinated group increased by 5. 5 % (p< 0. 05). Vaccination against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae decreased significantly (p< 0. 001) pneumonic lung lesions in vaccinated pigs. In this study, we examined the effects of vaccination against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae on carcass quality, chemical composition, technological, culinary and physical properties of musculus longissimus dorsi.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the Preventive Health Achievable Benchmarks Curriculum, a multifaceted improvement intervention that included an objective, practice-based performance evaluation {{of internal medicine}} and pediatric residents’ delivery of preventive services. Method: The authors conducted a nonrandomized experiment of intervention versus control group residents with baseline and follow-up of performance audited for 2001 - 2004. All 130 internal medicine and 78 pediatric residents at two continuity clinics at the University of Alabama School of Medicine, Birmingham, participated. Performance of preventive care was assessed by structured chart review. The multifaceted feedback curriculum included individualized performance feedback, academic detailing by faculty, and collective didactic sessions. The main outcome was difference in receipt of preventive care for patients seen by intervention and control residents, comparing baseline and follow-up. Results: Charts were reviewed for 3, 958 patients. Receipt of preventive care increased for patients of intervention residents, but not for patients of control residents.

The first essay studies the effect of Medicare coverage on demand for the influenza vaccine. I use a propensity score matching estimator {{to look at the}} effect of the 1993 Medicare part B coverage of the flu shot on demand. Using data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary survey, I find that the coverage increases demand by 12. 4 %. I also find that this effect varies by smoking status and by the presence chronic respiratory illnesses such as COPD, Asthma or Emphysema. The second essay examines the effect of disease specific health shocks on risk perceptions and demand for the <b>pneumonia</b> <b>vaccine.</b> I find strong evidence of learning - individuals who experience a health shock are less likely to believe that they are not at risk of infection, conditional on prior beliefs. This change in beliefs is accompanied by a corresponding change in demand.

40|$|Abstract Background In China, the {{measles vaccine}} is offered for free whereas the pneumococcal vaccine is a for-fee vaccine. This {{difference}} {{has the potential}} to influence how caregivers evaluate whether a vaccine is important or necessary for their child, but it is unclear if models of health behavior, such as the Health Belief Model, reveal the same associations for different diseases. This study compares caregiver perceptions of different diseases (measles, pneumonia and meningitis); and characterizes associations between Health Belief Model constructs and both pneumococcal vaccine uptake and perceived vaccine necessity for pneumonia, measles, and meningitis. Methods Caregivers of infants and young children between 8  months and 7  years of age from Shanghai (n =  619) completed a written survey on their perceptions of measles, pneumonia, and meningitis. We used logistic regression models to assess predictors of pneumococcal vaccine uptake and vaccine necessity. Results Only 25. 2 % of children had received a pneumococcal vaccine, although most caregivers believed that pneumonia (80. 8 %) and meningitis (92. 4 %), as well as measles (93. 2 %), vaccines were serious enough to warrant a vaccine. Perceived safety was strongly associated with both pneumococcal vaccine uptake and perceived vaccine necessity, and non-locals had 1. 70 times higher odds of <b>pneumonia</b> <b>vaccine</b> necessity than non-locals (95 % CI: 1. 01, 2. 88).
