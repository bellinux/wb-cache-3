25|$|The {{addition}} of the TRR solved a problem with early <b>pulse</b> <b>radar</b> units. It {{is relatively easy to}} jam a conventional radar by sending out additional pulses of radio signal on the same frequency. Unless the transmitter has encoded some additional form of information in the signal, the receiver cannot determine which pulse it sent out and which is from the jammer. Note that this has no effect on the determination of the direction to the target, which is the same for both the original and jammer pulses. However, it makes the determination of range difficult or impossible. The TRR solves this problem by providing a separate ranging system on another frequency. By making the signal wide-frequency, the jammer has to likewise broadcast across a similar bandwidth, limiting the energy in any one frequency and allowing the operator to tune the receiver to find an unjammed band. Combining range from the TRR and direction from the TTR provided complete information on the target.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of digital techniques, Pulse-Doppler radars (PD) became light enough for {{aircraft}} use, and Doppler processors for coherent <b>pulse</b> <b>radars</b> became more common. That provides Look-down/shoot-down capability. The advantage of combining Doppler processing with <b>pulse</b> <b>radars</b> is to provide accurate velocity information. This velocity is called range-rate. It describes the rate that a target moves toward or away from the radar. A target with no range-rate reflects a frequency near the transmitter frequency and cannot be detected. The classic zero doppler target is one which is on a heading that is tangential to the radar antenna beam. Basically, any target that is heading 90 degrees {{in relation to the}} antenna beam cannot be detected by its velocity (only by its conventional reflectivity).|$|R

We have already proposed accurate and fast imaging algorithm as RPM (Range Points Migration), which includes estimation of the direction of arrival (DOA).

To suppress false images, this paper introduces a post-processing algorithm, which limits the search-ing range for the DOA estimation by using the initial image. The results in numerical simulations includ-ing noisy situations show that the proposed method accomplishes accurate target imaging at the order of 1 / 100 wavelength, even in curvilinear scan trajec-tory.

40|$|Abstract—Ultrawideband <b>pulse</b> <b>radars</b> are a {{promising}} technol-ogy for high-quality imaging sensors for rescue robots {{in the near}} field {{because they have the}} advantage of high range resolution. We have already proposed the accurate and fast imaging algorithm as range point migration (RPM), which employs the direction of ar-rival (DOA) with the global characteristic of the multiple observed ranges. However, this algorithm assumes the line scanning of an omnidirectional antenna and limits the imaging range. To over-come this limitation, this letter derives an extended RPM method, which accomplishes omnidirectional imaging and accurate target positioning. As a false-image-reduction scheme in this method, this letter introduces a postprocessing algorithm, which constrains the searching range for DOA estimation by using the initial RPM image. The results of numerical simulations, including noisy sit-uations, show that the proposed method accomplishes accurate and omnidirectional imaging on the order of 1 / 100 wavelength and enhances the imaging range while avoiding false images.

We have already proposed a high-speed 3 -D imaging algorithm, SEABED, which is based on a reversible transform, which is the boundary scattering transform, between the received signals and the target shape. However, the estimated image with SEABED is unstable with random noise because it utilizes a derivative of the received data. In this paper, we propose a robust 3 -D imaging algorithm with an envelope of spheres that completely resolves the instability due to derivative operations. Moreover, to enhance the resolution of estimated images, this method is combined with a direct waveform compensation method that does not sacrifice high-speed calcula-tion. Numerical simulations and an experiment confirm that the proposed method can realize fast, robust, and high-resolution 3 -D imaging for arbitrary targets.
