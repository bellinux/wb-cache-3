5000|$|Clerk {{describes}} a Cambell engine as using his cycle, as follows: [...] "It has two cylinders, respectively pump and motor, driven from cranks placed at almost {{right angles to}} each other, the <b>pump</b> <b>crank</b> leading. The pump takes in a charge of gas and air, and the motor piston overruns a port {{in the side of}} the cylinder at the out-end of its stroke to discharge the exhaust gases. When the pressure in the motor cylinder has fallen to atmosphere, the pump forces its charge into the back cover of the motor cylinder through a check valve, displacing before it the products of combustion through an exhaust port the motor piston then returns, compressing the contents of the cylinder into the compression space. The charge is then fired and the piston performs its working stroke. This is the Clerk cycle." ...|$|E
50|$|Early {{immigrants}} to the New World brought with them the technology of windmills from Europe. On US farms, particularly on the Great Plains, wind pumps were used to pump water from farm wells for cattle. In California and some other states, the windmill {{was part of a}} self-contained domestic water system, including a hand-dug well and a redwood water tower supporting a redwood tank and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouse). The self-regulating farm wind pump was invented by Daniel Halladay in 1854. Eventually, steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction, and at their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use, with capacity equivalent to 150 megawatts. Very large lighter wind pumps in Australia directly crank the pump with the rotor of the windmill. Extra back gearing between small rotors for high wind areas and the <b>pump</b> <b>crank</b> prevents trying to push the pump rods down on the downstroke faster than they can fall by gravity. Otherwise pumping too fast leads to the pump rods buckling, making the seal of the stuffing box leak and wearing through the wall of the rising main (UK) or the drop-pipe (US) so all output is lost.|$|E

Introduction: A variably loaded crank {{is one that is}} loaded and relieved at certain intervals of its path of rotation. A good example of one is a hay press, or _____ <b>pump</b> <b>crank.</b> A moment is the measure of a tendency of a force to rotate about a fixed point. It is the product of the force into the perpendicular distance from the point of rotation to the line {{in the direction of the}} acting force...|$|E

30|$|The formula {{allows the}} {{calculation}} of beam accelerations for a general case when the <b>pumping</b> unit’s <b>crank</b> does not turn at a constant angular velocity, i.e., crank angular acceleration, d 2 θ 2 /dt 2, is not zero. As seen, the calculation requires {{the knowledge of the}} crank’s velocity and acceleration patterns, i.e., the dθ 2 /dt and the d 2 θ 2 /dt 2 functions. These have to be determined previously, preferably using the iterative procedure introduced in this paper.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops {{analytical methods}} {{for the design}} of gravity-assist space- craft trajectories. Such trajectories are commonly employed by planetary science missions to reach Mercury or the Outer Planets. They may also be used at the Outer Planets {{for the design of}} science tours with multiple flybys of those planets’ moons. Recent work has also shown applicability to new missions concepts such as NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission. ^ This work is based in the theory of patched conics. This document applies rigor to the concept of pumping (i. e. using gravity assists to change orbital energy) and cranking (i. e. using gravity assists to change inclination) to develop several analytic relations with <b>pump</b> and <b>crank</b> angles. In addition, transformations are developed between <b>pump</b> angle, <b>crank</b> angle, and v-infinity magnitude to classical orbit elements. These transformations are then used to describe the limits on orbits achievable via gravity assists of a planet or moon. This is then extended to develop analytic relations for all possible ballistic gravity-assist transfers and one type of propulsive transfer, v-infinity leveraging transfers. ^ The results in this dissertation complement existing numerical methods for the design of these trajectories by providing methods that can guide numerical searches to find promising trajectories and even, in some cases, replace numerical searches altogether. In addition, results from new techniques presented in this dissertation such as Tisserand Graphs, the V-Infinity Globe, and Non-Tangent V-Infinty Leveraging provide additional insight into the structure of the gravity-assist trajectory design problem. ...|$|R
2500|$|Both ships {{had several}} {{hand-operated}} bilge pumps that {{worked like a}} modern bucket dredge, the oldest example {{of this type of}} bilge pump ever found. The pumps were also operated by what may have been the oldest crank handles yet discovered; the reconstruction of the <b>cranked</b> <b>pump</b> which was assembled from fragments, including a wooden disk and an eccentric peg, has been dismissed as [...] "archaeological fantasy".|$|R
5|$|During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In {{a letter}} to Ludovico il Moro, he claimed {{to be able to}} create all sorts of {{machines}} both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic <b>pumps,</b> reversible <b>crank</b> mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.|$|R
500|$|After 1903, a [...] {{frame with}} a longer {{overhang}} {{at the front}} end was introduced and steam reversing gear fitted. Some sources record these locomotives as X14 class, and this designation was sometimes {{used to refer to}} the longer-framed versions, but for most purposes the two sub-classes were grouped together and known as M7. The 1904/05 construction batch moved the sandboxes back to the front splasher and new items were feed water heating, single ram <b>pumps</b> and balanced <b>crank</b> axles. For the remainder of construction from the outshopping of the 105th locomotive in 1911, duplex pumps were fitted.|$|R
30|$|When the {{pumping unit}} {{is driven by}} a multicylinder engine, a high-slip, or even an ultra-high-slip (UHS) {{electric}} motor, the angular velocity of the crankshaft changes during the <b>pumping</b> cycle: the <b>crank</b> speeds up when the unit is lightly loaded and slows down as the load becomes heavier. The high accelerations/decelerations coupled with the heavy rotating masses give rise to inertial torques because of the flywheel effect; gearbox torque calculations must be appropriately modified to include these effects. In such cases, {{in addition to the}} torques normally present on the gearbox and discussed so far, articulating and rotary inertial torques must be also calculated (Gibbs 1975).|$|R
50|$|During {{the journey}} to the Concours, Hammond had to {{manually}} send coolant into his engine using a hand <b>cranked</b> <b>pump</b> (due to a broken water pump during the track day challenge). This eventually broke, and his engine seized, forcing May to tow him. After crashing into May a few times, May got fed up and abandoned him. Clarkson helped to tow Hammond despite his gearbox {{nearing the end of}} its life, and the two sabotaged May's engine bay with cheese. After the judges finished, James was awarded 74 out of a possible 150 points while Jeremy and Richard were given 23.5 and 9 respectively - the lowest scores in Concours history.|$|R
5000|$|Rotary piston and plunger <b>pumps</b> use a <b>crank</b> {{mechanism}} {{to create a}} reciprocating motion along an axis, which then builds pressure in a cylinder or working barrel to force gas or fluid through the pump. The pressure in the chamber actuates the valves at both the suction and discharge points. Plunger pumps are used in applications that could range from [...] Piston pumps are used in lower pressure applications. The volume of the fluid discharged {{is equal to the}} area of the plunger or piston, multiplied by its stroke length. The overall capacity of the piston pumps and plunger pumps can be calculated with the area of the piston or plunger, the stroke length, the number of pistons or plungers and the speed of the drive. The power needed from the drive is proportional to the pressure and capacity of the pump.|$|R
50|$|Serinettes {{are housed}} in a wooden case, {{normally}} of walnut, and typically measuring 265 × 200 × 150 mm. The instrument is played by turning a crank mounted on the front. The <b>crank</b> <b>pumps</b> a bellows to supply air to the pipes, and also turns a wooden barrel by means of gears. Driven into the barrel are brass pins and staples with which the pieces of music are encoded. Mounted over the barrel is a bar carrying wooden keys connected to valves by vertical wooden rods. As the barrel turns, the pins and staples lift the keys, in turn opening the valves to let air into the pipes, which are located {{at the rear of}} the instrument. Tunes are selected by first lifting the bar carrying the keys, then shifting the barrel along its length. This brings a different set of pins and staples in line with the keys.|$|R
2500|$|Sputnik Music {{said about}} the song {{in a review of}} The Downward Spiral, declaring that [...] "'Mr. Self Destructs cryptic {{declarations}} of the many addictions we seem to openly enjoy are jarringly poetic, and its blistering chainsaw guitars and machine gun drum loops are an outstanding example of how aggressive yet tuneful industrial music can be." [...] Rolling Stone was also positive towards [...] "Mr. Self Destruct", saying that the song [...] "the soft passages are soft chiefly in the sense of not being loud, as if there were a really great party down the street that you were wimping out on, <b>pumped</b> guitars and <b>cranking</b> boom-thwack drum machines and what not. But almost as soon as you rush to your pre-amp and squeeze in more juice, the loud comes back in, but so unimaginably loud this time that you think your speaker coils might melt, and old man Reilly in the next apartment has already started to bang his broomstick on the wall." [...] "Mr. Self Destruct" [...] was remixed five times for Further Down the Spiral (1995), including a re-work partially produced by Aphex Twin.|$|R
