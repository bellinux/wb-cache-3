40|$|Revenue sharing {{can be used}} to {{discourage}} low tax regions from competing for capital and firms with high tax regions. However, with heterogeneous regions, revenue sharing involves net transfers across regions and creates a “moral-hazard” problem - that is, regions may want to invest less in market fostering public good when the benefits are shared across nations. This paper analyzes these costs and benefits of revenue sharing. When asymmetric regions compete in capital income taxes only, we show that revenue sharing can be desirable for the high tax region if it is pushed far enough (i. e., J-curve effect), while tax harmonization is always harmful for the low tax region. When regions also compete through <b>public</b> <b>investments,</b> we find that tax competition distorts (downards) <b>public</b> <b>investments.</b> While revenue sharing discourages <b>public</b> <b>investments</b> due to moral-hazard effect, it remains beneficial in most cases. Moreover, there are new agglomeration forces resulting from <b>public</b> <b>investments</b> because the inflow of capital raises the incentive for <b>public</b> <b>investments</b> which in turn attract more capital. This leads to the possibility of policy-induced agglomeration (which is different from the classical agglomeration forces in the New Economic geography).
