25|$|Tuning load to gun {{can also}} yield great {{increases}} in accuracy, especially for standard, non-accurized rifles. Different rifles, {{even of the}} same make and model, will often react to the same ammunition in different ways. The handloader is afforded a wider selection of bullet weights than can readily be found in commercially loaded ammunition, {{and there are many}} different powders {{that can be used for}} any given cartridge. Trying a range of bullets and a variety of powders will determine what combination of bullet and powder gives the most consistent velocities and accuracies. Careful adjustment of the amount of powder can give the velocity that best fits the natural harmonics of the barrel (see accurize and internal ballistics). For ultimate accuracy and performance, the handloader also has the option of using a wildcat cartridge; wildcats are the result of shaping the cartridge and chamber themselves to a specific end, and the results <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> of velocity, energy, and accuracy. Most, but not all, reloads perform best when the powder selected fills 95% or more of the case (by volume).|$|E

After the completion of the High School Musical series in 2008, Tisdale was at first reluctant on accepting older roles because she felt [...] "you can never go backward".

When these conditions are met, {{the lawyer for the}} executive should recommend the action, even if it appears inconsistent with the letter of existing law. While acting gives both the lawyer and her client “dirty hands,” a failure to act may expose the United States to even greater risk. When the executive is unable or unwilling to meet all of these conditions, however, approving the proposed action places the lawyer in ethical peril. Part I of this Article discusses the adverse effects of detention policies on legal ethics and the integrity of the justice system. Part II uses a broader lens to describe costs to the United States 2 ̆ 7 credibility and reputation. Part III sets out <b>the</b> test for <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope,</b> and discusses two examples from history: Lend-Lease and the Cuban Missile Crisis.

A risk-averse position that avoids <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope,</b> however, can also pose dangers.
