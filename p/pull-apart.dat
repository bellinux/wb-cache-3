25|$|Mount Ararat {{lies within}} a complex, sinistral <b>pull-apart</b> basin that {{originally}} was a single, continuous depression. The growth of Mount Ararat partitioned this depression into two smaller basins, the Iğdir and Doğubeyazıt basins. This <b>pull-apart</b> basin {{is the result}} of strike-slip movement along two en-echelon fault segments, the Doğubeyazıt–Gürbulak and Iğdir faults, of a sinistral strike–slip fault system. Tension between these faults, not only formed the original <b>pull-apart</b> basin, but created a system of faults, exhibiting a horsetail splay pattern, that control the position of the principal volcanic eruption centers of Mount Ararat and associated linear belt of parasitic volcanic cones. The strike-slip fault system within which Mount Ararat located {{is the result of}} north–south convergence and tectonic compression between the Arabian Platform and Laurasia that continued after the Tethys Ocean closed during the Eocene epoch along the Bitlis–Zagros suture.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the metamorphic trajectory recorded by metapelitic migmatites {{of the upper}} part of the Hercynian lower continental crust of the Serre (southern Calabria, Italy). The relict minerals, reaction textures and phase equilibria define a clockwise P–T path. The prograde metamorphism from temperature of about 500 ◦C and pressure of 4 – 5 kbar to T< 700 ◦C and P∼ 8 kbar stabilized the assemblage Grt+Ky+Bt+Ms(Si/ 11 ox= 3. 26 – 3. 29) in the uppermost metapelites of the profile. Progressive heating led to H 2 O-fluxed and dehydration melting first of Ms, then of Bt at T< 700 ◦C in the stability field of sillimanite. This process was followed by nearly isothermal decompression producing additional melt with a transition from Grt to a Grt+Crd stability field. Further decompression caused the formation of Crd-corona around garnet. Nearly isobaric cooling led to rehydration and retrogression across the stability field of andalusite up to the stability field of kyanite. The lowermost metapelites of the studied profile have lost most of the memory of the prograde P–T path; they record decompression and cooling. High-temperature mylonites occur in which boudinage, elongation and <b>pull-aparts</b> characterize the porphyroclasts. The <b>pull-aparts</b> in the high-T mylonites are filled with low-P minerals (Crd+Spl). The Hercynian metamorphic trajectory and the microtextures are consistent with crustal thickening and subsequent extensional regime. During extension, an important tectonic denudation probably caused the isothermal decompression. Extension also occurred in post-Hercynian times as documented by <b>pull-aparts</b> in sillimanite porphyroclasts filled with chloritoid within a low-grade mylonite...|$|R

40|$|A {{conventional}} and cathodoluminescence microscopy, stable isotope, and fluid inclusion study was undertaken on normal fault zonesexposed on vertical cliffs in Tithonian limestones of the French SE-Basin. The {{aim was to}} determine the chronology of deformation, and factors controlling normal fault nucleation and evolution in carbonate rocks. Two models are proposed for fault zone development depending on the depths at which deformation takes place. At depths of 3 – 3. 5 km, incipient shear zones consist of en-e´chelon veins, filled by fibrous calcite and confined to limestone layers bounded by thin clayey interlayers. As deformation increases and the layers rotate, slip occurs along the clay-rich interlayers. A system of <b>pull-aparts</b> forms allowing displacement to increase. <b>Pull-aparts</b> are commonly filled by fibrous calcite crystals. At depths of 1. 5 – 2 km, faults initiate as small slip surfaces, early nucleating in some limestone layers. Their propagation is impeded by thin clayey interlayers, which enhances fracturing and bending of the limestone layers. As slip surfaces propagate, they overlap and can connect with one another by means of dilational jogs that are filled by large euhedral calcite crystals. In the first case, <b>pull-aparts</b> are coupled with the solution seams that reuse preexisting, rotated clay-rich interlayers. As they formed, they progressively filled and the fluid circulation remained local. In the second case, longer slip planes connect by dilation jogs, that are not immediately filled, which enhance the circulation of fluids, which show chemical variations. It appears that P/T conditions strongly control the relative role of brittle processes and solution/crystallization mechanisms, and the style of the early stages of normal faulting in the same limestone rocks. q 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|The {{most common}} {{settings}} for geothermal {{systems in the}} Great Basin region are fault terminations, fault step-overs, fault intersections, accommodation zones, displacement transfer zones, and <b>pull-aparts</b> (Faulds et al. 2006, 2011; Faulds and Hinz 2015). These are sites with inherent structural complexity, exemplified by a high local density of interconnected faults and fractures. Permeability is greater in these areas, and this is beneficial for the development and maintenance of fluid upflow pathways along faults (Faulds et al. 2006, 2013; Coolbaugh et al. 2007; Lechler and Coolbaugh 2007; Jolie et al. 2015 a, b; Siler et al. 2018).|$|R
40|$|Microtextural changes {{brought about}} by heating alkali {{feldspar}} crystals from the Shap granite, northern England, at atmospheric pressure, have been studied using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. A typical unheated phenocryst from Shap is composed of about 70 vol% of tweed orthoclase with strain-controlled coherent or semicoherent micro- and crypto-perthitic albite lamellae, with maximum lamellar thicknesses 700 °C, and after > 48 h at 700 °C, all such regions were essentially compositionally homogeneous, as indicated by X-ray analyses at fine scale in the transmission electron microscope. Changes in lamellar thickness with time at different T point to an activation energy of ~ 350 kJmol⁻¹. A lamella which homogenised after 6, 800 h at 600 °C, therefore, would have required only 0. 6 s {{to do so in}} the melting interval at 1, 100 °C. Subgrains in patch perthite homogenised more slowly than coherent lamellae and chemical gradients in patches persisted for > 5, 000 h at 700 °C. Homogenisation T is in agreement with experimentally determined solvi for coherent ordered intergrowths, when a 50 - 100 °C increase in T for An₁ is applied. Homogenisation of lamellae appears to proceed in an unexpected manner: two smooth interfaces, microstructurally sharp, advance from the original interfaces toward the mid-line of each twinned, semicoherent lamella. In places, the homogenisation interfaces have shapes reflecting the local arrangements of nanotunnels or <b>pull-aparts.</b> Analyses confirm that the change in alkali composition is also relatively sharp at these interfaces. Si-Al disordering is far slower than alkali homogenisation so that tweed texture in orthoclase, tartan twinning in irregular microcline, and Albite twins in albite lamellae and patches persisted in all our experiments, including 5, 478 h at 700 °C, 148 h at 1, 000 °C and 5 h at 1, 100 °C, even though the ensemble in each case was chemically homogeneous. Nanotunnels and <b>pull-aparts</b> were modified after only 50 min at 500 °C following the simulated ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar step-heating schedule. New features called 'slots' developed away from albite lamellae, often with planar traces linking slots to the closest lamella. Slot arrays were often aligned along ghost-like regions of diffraction contrast which may mark the original edges of lamellae. We suggest that the slot arrays result from healing of <b>pull-aparts</b> containing fluid. At 700 °C and above, the dominant defects were subspherical 'bubbles', which evolved from slots or from regions of deuteric coarsening. The small degree of partial melting observed after 5 h at 1, 100 °C was often in the vicinity of bubbles. Larger micropores, which formed at subgrain boundaries in patch perthite during deuteric coarsening, retain their shape up to the melting point, as do the subgrain boundaries themselves. It is clear that modification of defects providing potential fast pathways for diffusion in granitic alkali feldspars begins below 500 °C and that defect character progressively changes up to, and beyond, the onset of melting. 26 page(s...|$|R

25|$|As {{extension}} {{continued in}} the mid to late Jurassic, multiple <b>pull-apart</b> basins and oblique right-lateral strike-slip faulting in the eastern margin of the Exmouth Plateau continued to dominate. The simple shear stress of the Exmouth detachment fault between the base of the upper crust, and the lower crust had been reduced in the east plateau. This reduction in simple shear was in part caused by the deformation that developed series negative flower structures and half-graben systems in the west plateau. By this time, the lithospheric thinning that had been initiated in during the early Jurassic was now considerably thinner. At this period, a magmatic intrusion between the lower crystalline crest and the lithosphere been introduce, underplating this region.|$|E
25|$|Hanmer Basin {{is a small}} (10 x 20nbsp&km) <b>pull-apart</b> basin {{formed at}} the overlap between the Hope River and Conway {{segments}} of the Hope Fault.

The basin began to form in the Pleistocene and contains more than 1000 m of sedimentary fill in the main depocenter. The eastern end of the basin is currently being deformed by transpression associated with the southwestern end of the Conway segment. The destruction of the basin at its eastern end is matched by transtensional deformation at the western end that continues to enlarge the basin, giving rise to a roughly steady-state geometry. The basin fill is being constantly reworked as it is uplifted at the basin's eastern end and redeposited to the west.|$|E
30|$|Structural {{interaction}} {{areas such}} as step-overs, fault intersections, accommodation zones, displacement transfer zones, and <b>pull-aparts</b> may span many to tens of square kilometers. Within these broad zones, the most productive fluid upwelling zones are highly localized, limited to narrow zones, tens to hundreds of meters wide, along a single fault or a small subset of faults. Fluid flow zones in geothermal production wells can be confined to even smaller scales, narrower than[*]~[*] 1  m along the well path in some cases (based on publicly available data, Nevada Division of Minerals). This compartmentalization of permeability is probably controlled by lateral structural and lithologic variation within groups of faults or along discrete faults (Caine et al. 1996, 2010; Caine and Forster 1999; Fairley et al. 2003; Fairley and Hinds 2004; Sanderson and Zhang 2004; Mitchell and Faulkner 2012; Meller and Kohl 2014).

40|$|We {{document}} phyllosilicates occurrence along five shallow (exhumed from depths < 3 km) carbonate hosted extensional faults {{from the}} seismically-active {{domain of the}} central Apennines, Italy. The shallow portion of this domain {{is characterized by a}} sedimentary succession consisting of 5 - 6 km thick massive carbonate deposits overlain by 2 km thick phyllosilicate-rich deposits (marls and siliciclastic sandstones). We show that the phyllosilicates observed within the studied carbonate-hosted faults derived from the overlying phyllosilicate-rich sedimentary deposits and were involved in the faulting processes. We infer that, during fault zone evolution, the phyllosilicates downward injected into <b>pull-aparts</b> (i. e., dilational jogs) that were generated along staircase extensional faults. With further displacement accumulation, the clayey material was smeared and concentrated into localized layers along the carbonate-hosted fault surfaces. These layers are usually thin (a few centimeters to decimeters thick), but can reach also a few meters in thickness. We suggest that, even in tectonic settings dominated by high frictional strength rocks (e. g., carbonates), localized layers enriched in weak phyllosilicates can occur along shallow fault surfaces thus reducing the expected fault strength during earthquakes, possibly promoting co-seismic slip propagation up to the Earth's surface...|$|R

40|$|Lava {{flows from}} sixteen sites at Gorely Volcano, Kamchatka were sampled. Initial {{analysis}} showed high within-site scatter for NRM specimen directions. Alternating field and thermal demagnetization of specimens showed single-component magnetization indicating that specimens had not moved or were {{not exposed to}} changes in the magnetic field during acquisition of a magnetic direction. Scatter is thought to be either due to movement of the specimen with respect to the magnetic field or change in the magnetic field with respect to the specimen. Four factors were found that would contribute to scatter in specimen directions. These are 1) cooling rate, 2) range of unblocking temperatures, 3) relative time of emplacement, and 4) how the specimen moved or was affected by changes in the magnetic field. Only two sites showed that scatter was due to movement of the specimen. It appears that scatter in other sites resulted from changes in the magnetic field generated from a magma-induced electrical current due to lava flowing in the earth’s magnetic field. These changes in the magnetic field are shown to have more affect on material sampled at the surface than on material sampled at depth because massive interiors of flows showed less dispersion in specimen directions than levees or <b>pull-aparts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{geometry}} and orientation of faults are examined using several field examples of small-scale (< lm displacement) fault systems. For isotropic rocks under triaxial compression, faults normally develop in conjugate sets about the maximum compressive stress (1), with dihedral angles usually of about 50 °, as {{predicted by the}} Coulomb theory of failure. In layered rocks, the geometry of faults varies with the orientation of layering {{with respect to the}} stress field. Where 1, is approximately normal to layering or anisotropy, conjugate faults also develop symmetrically about 1. Where rocks have interbedded layers with different mechanical behaviours, however, faults tend to initiate orthogonal to the more brittle layers (i. e. originate as extension fractures sub-parallel to 1), but oblique to the less brittle layers. As the fault steps through the layering, <b>pull-aparts</b> are developed which may reduce the dihedral angle. Where 1 is oblique (c. 25 – 75 °) to anisotropy, one set of faults is developed at a high angle to layering, with another at a low angle, usually showing a ramp-flat geometry. Large dihedral angles (up to 90 °) may result and 1, does not bisect this angle. Where 1 is approximately parallel to layering, two cases can be recognized. Where 3 is approximately normal to layering, faults with layer-parallel flats and contractional ramps develop. Where 2 is approximately normal to layering, conjugate faults develop which are symmetrical about 1, the geometry resembling that in isotropic rocks. These observations are in agreement with rock deformation experiments which show the strong effect of anisotropy on fault orientation, but the observations incorporate the effects of layering of materials with different deformation characteristics. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Most {{producing}} geothermal {{fields and}} known geothermal {{resources in the}} Basin and Range province are associated with Quaternary active fault systems, within which hydrothermal fluids are presumed to circulate from depth to relatively shallow production levels through high permeability fractures. Research at the Dixie Valley field by Barton et al. (1997) indicates that hydraulically conductive fractures within the Stillwater fault zone are those that have orientations such that the fractures are critically stressed for normal shear failure under the regional tectonic stress field. In general, therefore, we might expect geothermal resources to occur in areas of high inter-seismic strain accumulation, and where faults are favorably {{oriented with respect to}} the regional strain tensor; in the case of Basin and Range normal faults, these would generally be faults striking normal to the direction of maximum extension. Expanding this hypothesis, Blewitt et al. (2003), based on preliminary, broad-scale analysis of regional strain and average fault strike in the northwestern Basin and Range, have proposed that geothermal resources occur in areas where fault-normal extension associated with shear strain is the greatest. Caskey and Wesnousky (2000) presented evidence that the Dixie Valley field occupies a 10 km-long gap between prehistoric Holocene ruptures of the fault segments on either side. Modeled maximum shear and Coulomb failure stress are high within the gap owing to the stress concentrations at the ends of the ruptures. These results suggest that a major contributing factor to the enhanced permeability at fault-hosted geothermal systems may be localized stress and strain concentrations within fault zone segments. This notion is generally consistent with the common occurrence of geothermal fields within fault offsets (<b>pull-aparts)</b> along strike-slip fault systems, where the local strain field has a large extensional component (e. g., Salton Sea and Coso). Blewitt et al. (2003) suggested that resources correlate with abrupt changes in fault orientation and with changes in the direction of extensional strain...|$|R

40|$|Damage zones show {{very similar}} {{geometries}} {{across a wide}} range of scales and fault types, including strike-slip, normal and thrust faults. We use a geometric classification of damage zones into tip-, wall-, and linking-damage zones, based on their location around faults. These classes can be sub-divided in terms of fault and fracture patterns within the damage zone. A variety of damage zone structures can occur at mode II tips of strike-slip faults, including wing cracks, horsetail fractures, antithetic faults, and synthetic branch faults. Wall damage zones result from the propagation of mode II and mode III fault tips through a rock, or from damage associated with the increase in slip on a fault. Wall damage zone structures include extension fractures, antithetic faults, synthetic faults, and rotated blocks with associated triangular openings. The damage formed at the mode III tips of strike-slip faults (e. g. observed in cliff sections) are classified as wall damage zones, because the damage zone structures are distributed along a fault trace in map view. Mixed-mode tips are likely to show characteristics of both mode II and mode III tips. Linking damage zones are developed at steps between two sub-parallel faults, and the structures developed depend on whether the step is extensional or contractional. Extension fractures and <b>pull-aparts</b> typically develop in extensional steps, whilst solution seams, antithetic faults and synthetic faults commonly develop in contractional steps. Rotated blocks, isolated lenses or strike-slip duplexes may occur in both extensional and contractional steps. Damage zone geometries and structures are strongly controlled by the location around a fault, the slip mode at a fault tip, and by the evolutionary stage of the fault. Although other factors control the nature of damage zones (e. g. lithology, rheology and stress system), the three-dimensional fault geometry and slip mode at each tip must be considered to gain an understanding of damage zones around faults. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to understand the origin of the Belize Barrier Reef and the sequence stratigraphy of the mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system. The data used consisted of 1, 400 km of conventional multichannel seismic, 1, 300 km of single-channel high resolution seismic, and information from nine wells. Conventional seismic shows elongated NNE-SSW highs and lows (Camels Basin, Camels Hump-Turneffe atoll, Gladden Basin, Glovers atoll-Lighthouse Island). The thrusted block of Camels Hump formed from buttressing of the Maya Mountains against the moving Caribbean plate during the Paleocene. Its load generated Camels Basin, whereas Gladden and Turneffe Basins formed as <b>pull-aparts.</b> The transtension produced the Turneffe and the Glovers-Lighthouse alignments whose tops as well as Camels Hump's were covered by carbonate platforms during the late Eocene/Oligocene. These carbonates were partially drowned in the early/middle Miocene. During the middle/late Miocene, tectonic enhancement of Camels Hump and Glovers highs triggered the collapse of their margins, shedding mass flow deposits. The late Pliocene/early Pleistocene sea-level fall moved the shoreline along the eastern flank of Camels Hump and in the northern Camels Basin where longshore currents redistributed the sediments. The Belize Barrier Reef became established on top of these lowstand siliciclastic coastal deposits {{in the middle of the}} Brunhes Epoch (about 0. 45 Ma). Once the barrier reef was formed, it established the modern mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system. When sea-level dropped, about 120 m during the Last Glacial Maximum (18, 000 years ago), the reef built during the previous interglacial highstand was karstified. The shelf lagoon became a fluvial plain drained by two incised valley systems. The northern fluvial system deposited a lowstand delta at the mouth of the English Cay Channel. This delta was partially reworked by longshore currents. The rise of sea-level slowed at about - 65 to - 70 m, 11, 000 to 10, 000 years ago (Younger Dryas) and is documented by a landward-stepped delta.

The deposits present several recurrent and typical field characteristics, including (1) at a regional scale, location of the mineralization in low-order structures within a 1 - to 5 -km-wide structural corridor east of a major north-northwest–striking lineament and in spatial association with the northnorthwest– striking margins of the 330 to 327 Ma Pataz batholith; (2) at the mine scale, strong lithological controls of the vein geometries and styles, the lodes occurring as fairly continuous ≤ 5 -km-long quartz veins inside or along the margins of the batholith or as branching and bedding-concordant narrow ore shoots within adjacent folded Ordovician turbidite sequences; (3) consistent orientations of veins, in particular within the batholith, where more than 80 percent of the quartz veins are emplaced in north- to northwest-striking, eastdipping, brittle-ductile deformation zones; (4) a consistent Au, Ag, As, Fe, Pb, Zn, ±Cu, ±Sb, ±Bi-Te-W metal association and a sulfide-rich paragenetic sequence, with a first stage composed of milky quartz, pyrite, arsenopyrite, and ankerite and a second stage of blue-gray microgranular quartz, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, Sb sulfosalts, electrum, and native gold, followed by barren calcite-dolomite-quartz veinlets; and (5) hydrothermal alteration of the vein wall rocks, consisting of pervasive muscovite alteration with minor chlorite, carbonate minerals, and pyrite associated with strong bleaching in plutonic rocks, and of weak muscovite and chlorite alteration in sedimentary rocks. Structural analysis of the deposits outlines four synchronous sets of mineralized fractures in the Pataz district. The predominant north- to northwest-striking, east- to northeast-dipping system, which is generally located in reactivated reverse faults, accounts for more than 80 percent of the gold resource of the district. Three subordinate systems include, in decreasing order of economic importance, (1) east-west–striking flat extensional veins, (2) bedding-concordant veinlets in east-west–striking and north-dipping to north-south–striking and east-dipping limbs of long wavelength folds in Ordovician sedimentary rocks, and (3) weakly mineralized roughly east-west–striking, sinistral vertical faults. The vein orientations of the four structural sets are compatible with a triaxial strain model, with the main shortening axis P oriented at 080 °/ 15 °, an intermediate axis oriented at 165 °/ 00 °, and a subvertical extensional T axis oriented at 255 °/ 80 °. Under these conditions, the richest ore shoots are preferentially sited in sinistral <b>pull-aparts,</b> which occur at the intersection of either north-south–striking lodes or extensional lodes with roughly east-west–striking vertical faults. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of the granodiorite-monzogranite bodies of the Pataz batholith provides good plateau ages at 329. 2 ± 1. 4 and 328. 1 ± 1. 2 Ma for biotite separates, which are similar to a published 329 Ma U/Pb age for the granodiorite. A muscovite and a biotite sample from an aplite dike yielded plateau ages at 322. 1 ± 2. 8 and 325. 4 ± 1. 4 Ma, respectively. Muscovite samples from alteration intimately associated with the gold mineralization yielded three 40 Ar/ 39 Ar spectra with low-temperature staircase-shaped patterns followed by plateau segments at 314 to 312 Ma. These ages, analytically indistinguishable at the 2 σ level, are considered to be the most probable ages for the mineralization event. Three other plateaulike ages between 305 and 288 Ma have been obtained and are interpreted to reflect partial argon loss during late fluid circulation associated with the intrusion of Late Cretaceous monzonite porphyries. The age determinations are inconsistent with a genetic link between the 314 to 312 Ma Pataz gold deposits and the 330 to 327 Ma calc-alkaline Pataz batholith, or with the 327 to 319 Ma aplite dikes, or the Late Cretaceous porphyry magmatism. Instead, the overall homogeneity of the structural, mineralogical, and geochemical characteristics of the deposits over the ≥ 160 -km-long mineralized belt and the geotectonic evolution suggest that gold mineralization is linked to a large-scale thermal event that occurred in a thickened collisional belt undergoing uplift tectonics...|$|R
2500|$|The Dead Sea Transform (DST) fault system, also {{sometimes}} referred to as the Dead Sea Rift, is a series of faults that run from the Maras Triple Junction (a junction with the East Anatolian Fault in southeastern Turkey) to the northern end of the Red Sea Rift (just offshore of the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula). [...] The fault system forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east. [...] It is a zone of left lateral displacement, signifying the relative motions of the two plates. [...] Both plates are moving in a general north-northeast direction, but the Arabian Plate is moving faster, resulting in the observed left lateral motions along the fault of approximately 107km. [...] A component of extension is also present {{in the southern part of}} the transform, which has contributed to a series of depressions, or <b>pull-apart</b> basins, forming the Gulf of Aqaba, Dead Sea, Sea of Galilee and Hula basins.|$|E
2500|$|North of the Oca Fault, {{the oldest}} {{sedimentary}} {{sequence of the}} Cocinetas Basin, the Macarao Formation, is the oldest sedimentary unit of both the higher La Guajira area (the Cocinetas Basin) {{as well as the}} lower La Guajira area. This formation was deposited in a phase that is informally called [...] "rifting", because of the formation of half grabens in the Late Eocene, though no real rifting occurred in the area. [...] Shortly after deposition, during the Early Oligocene, the Macarao Formation was heavily deformed, creating the series of hills that today still surround the Cocinetas Basin. This transtensional deformation was caused by the eastward movement of the Caribbean Plate along the South American Plate, when the Caribbean volcanic arc was located just north of the Cocinetas Basin. The main fault movement forming the <b>pull-apart</b> basin of Cocinetas was caused by the dextral Cuisa Fault, active from the Paleocene to the Eocene.|$|E
2500|$|Joe beat Jeff Jarrett at No Surrender in a [...] "Fan's Revenge Lumberjack match". After the match, he took Jarrett's NWA World Heavyweight Championship with him, telling Jim Cornette that if Jarrett or Sting (Jarrett's {{scheduled}} opponent at Bound For Glory) {{wanted the}} belt, {{they could take}} it from him. On the October 12 episode, Joe agreed to return the belt to the Jarrett-Sting winner under one condition—the winner had to agree {{to give him a}} title shot. This offer was turned down, and finally Joe was given the choice of giving back the title or be fired. Kurt Angle made his debut and got into a brawl with Joe after he again refused to give back the belt, and during the brawl, Jarrett took the belt back. At Bound for Glory on October 22, Joe defeated Raven, Brother Runt and Abyss in a Monster's Ball match. The match ended when special referee Jake Roberts performed a DDT to Raven, allowing Joe to deliver the Muscle Buster to Raven for the pinfall. Later in the night, Joe was involved in a <b>pull-apart</b> brawl with Kurt Angle after Jim Cornette announced that he would be fired if he interfered in the main event match that involved Angle as special enforcer. At Genesis, Joe lost to Angle after submitting to Angle's ankle lock. This ended his eighteen-month undefeated streak.|$|E
40|$|Understanding how faults {{initiate}} and fault architecture evolves {{is central}} to predicting bulk fault zone properties such as fault zone permeability and mechanical strength. The study of faults at the Earth’s surface and at near-surface levels is significant {{for the development of}} high level nuclear waste repositories, and CO 2 sequestration facilities. Additionally, with growing concern over water resources, understanding the impact faults have on contaminant transport between the unsaturated and saturated zone has become increasingly important. The proposal of a high-level nuclear waste repository in the tuffs of Yucca Mountain, Nevada has stimulated interest into research on the characterisation of brittle deformation in non-welded to densely welded tuffs and the nature of fluid flow in these faults and fractures. The majority of research on the initiation and development of faults has focussed on shear faults in overall compressional stress regimes. Dilational structures have been examined in compressional settings e. g. overlapping faults generating extensional oversteps, or in normal faults cutting mechanical layered stratigraphy. Previous work has shown the affect mechanical stratigraphy has on fault dip angle; competent layers have steeply dipping segments and less competent layers have shallowly dipping segments. Displacement is accommodated by shear failure of the shallow segments and hybrid failure of the steeply dipping segments. As the fault walls of the shear failure segment slip past each other the walls of the hybrid failure segment are displaced horizontally as well as vertically thus forming dilation structures such as <b>pull-aparts</b> or extensional bends. Work on truly extensional faults has been at the kilometre scale of fissure swarms in rift systems where the focus is on fault geometry and direction of fault propagation. This study examines dilational faults with offsets of centimetres to 10 ’s of meters within moderately and densely welded ignimbrite units on the caldera island of Gran Canaria, Spain. Through the investigation of fault populations within different ignimbrite units I have examined how the fault architecture changes with accumulated displacement, identified the factors controlling fault core evolution and using these observations developed a new model for the initiation and growth of dilational faults in ignimbrites. The faults in this study do not have a linear correlation of increasing fault core thickness with displacement. Fault core width varies along fault dip and the largest offset faults have the narrowest fault cores. Furthermore, the damage zone joint frequency shows a limited increase with increasing displacement and faults and joints are sub-parallel. From these observations I have developed a new model for fault initiation and evolution in which the petrophysical properties of the host rock are the primary control on fault architecture. Faults initiate on existing sub-parallel joints and grow by the incorporation of material from joint surfaces and joint bound slabs. The growth of the fault depends on the joint spacing and the competency of the host rock. In densely welded ignimbrites, joint spacing is controlled by sub-layers within the ignimbrite unit which are formed by flattening and stretching of fiamme. In moderately welded ignimbrites, fiamme and lithic inclusions in the ash matrix act as sites of joint initiation; the greater the abundance of such flaws the higher the joint frequency. Whether fault growth is promoted or inhibited depends to some extent on the competency of the material. Faults cutting ash-rich friable units have narrow fault cores regardless of displacement. This suggests that the material is easily abraded in the fault core inhibiting fracturing of the host rock and incorporation of new material. Hence host rock fabric and composition have an important influence on fault architecture in these ignimbrite units. The other influence on fault evolution is the tensile stress regime in which faulting occurs. The faults in this study form by hybrid failure and so have both vertical and horizontal displacements. The dilation of existing joints causes slip on the joints and allows material to fall into the joint forming a fault core. This work identifies distinct differences between the mechanism of dilational fault initiation and resultant fault architecture compared to that of shear faults. The observations made in this study indicate that the host rock petrophysical properties, stress regime at time of faulting (tensile or compressive) and confining pressure are primary influences on fault architecture and not displacement; contradicting the widely accepted fault thickness-displacement scaling relationship. I suggest that the architecture of dilational faults can be predicted by examining the host rock properties and using the data from this study have developed a framework that illustrates how ignimbrite host rock properties may affect deformation structures. Such frameworks for individual lithologies may be more useful in predicting fault zone properties as opposed to global scaling relationships. The results of this study have implications for conceptual models of fluid flow based on fault architectures predicted using the thickness-displacement relationship.

2500|$|In October 2005, when Japanese heavyweight superstar Kenta Kobashi made a [...] "once-in-a-lifetime" [...] {{trip to the}} United States, he {{was signed}} to two Ring of Honor shows. ROH {{officials}} selected Joe to face him in a singles match {{on the first night}} and a tag match on the second. Joe proved to be a formidable opponent for Kobashi, in a back and forth match, which Dave Meltzer again gave a five-star rating. The match {{went on to win the}} Wrestling Observer Newsletter award for [...] "Match of the Year". In 2006, Joe was one of the principal wrestlers representing Ring of Honor in their war against rival Philadelphia promotion Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW). The war culminated in a five-on-five Cage of Death match at [...] "Death before Dishonor IV". Joe helped ROH dominate in the match, until, after picking up CZW wrestler Chris Hero for one of his finishers, the Muscle Buster, he was attacked by fellow ROH wrestler Bryan Danielson. Danielson repeatedly hit his injured knee with a steel chair, forcing him to quit the match. Joe was later replaced in the match by Homicide, who went on to win the match for ROH. Joe later teamed with Homicide to fight against the Briscoes, and, like Homicide, found himself back in the ROH world title hunt. Joe, however, came up short against champion Bryan Danielson in several matches, including a match that went to a 60 Minute Draw and the final one being a cage match on December 8. At the December 9 show, Joe called out the Pro Wrestling Noah promotion, claiming [...] "Ring of Honor is right here!" [...] This was not his first encounter with NOAH; at the September 16, 2006 ROH show, after a speech by wrestling legend Bruno Sammartino, Joe got into an argument and <b>pull-apart</b> brawl with Noah star Takeshi Morishima. Subsequently a match was signed for February pitting Joe against Morishima which Joe won.|$|E
