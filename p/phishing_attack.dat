25|$|Clone {{phishing}} {{is a type}} of <b>phishing</b> <b>attack</b> whereby a legitimate, {{and previously}} delivered, email containing an attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email. The attachment or link within the email is replaced with a malicious version and then sent from an email address spoofed to appear to come from the original sender. It may claim to be a resend of the original or an updated version to the original. This technique could be used to pivot (indirectly) from a previously infected machine and gain a foothold on another machine, by exploiting the social trust associated with the inferred connection due to both parties receiving the original email.|$|E

In this research paper, I proposed a novel method to phishing email filtering by the use of end-host based anti-phishing algorithm, which is call Link Guard and content based filtering by the use of knowledge discovery by utilizing the generic characteristics of the hyperlinks in <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks.</b> These characteristics are derived by analyzing the phishing data archive provided by the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). Because {{it is based on the}} generic characteristics of <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks,</b> Link Guard can detect not only known but also unknown <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks.</b> Our experimental analysis verified that Link Guard is effective to detect and prevent both known and unknown <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> with minimal false negatives.

40|$|In recent years, {{because of}} the {{widespread}} usage of the Internet and globalization of many financial institutions, <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> targeting these financial institutions has spread wildly across the Internet and caused monetary damage towards their victims.

As a result, many text-based phishing filters are difficult to maintain and cannot flexibly adapt <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> in unfamiliar languages. In this study, a new solution in phishing detection is proposed and tested. The proposed filter employs Content-Based Information Retrieval service offered by popular online search engine in classifying phishing from non-phishing web sites. After testing the proposed filter against 200 phishing and 200 legitimate web sites, the filter achieved 99. 75 % accuracy rate and 0. 25 % false positive rate. ...|$|R

2500|$|In May 2017, a <b>phishing</b> <b>attack</b> impersonating a Google Docs sharing email {{spread on}} the Internet. The attack sent emails pretending to be someone the target knew, {{requesting}} to share a document with them. Once the link in the email was pressed, users were directed to a real Google account permissions page where the phishing software, a third-party app named [...] "Google Docs", requested access to the user's Google account. Once granted, the software received access to the user's Gmail messages and address book, and sent new fraudulent document invitations to their contacts. The <b>phishing</b> <b>attack</b> was described by media outlets as [...] "massive" [...] and [...] "widespread", and The Next Webs Napier Lopez wrote that it's [...] "very easy to fall for". One {{of the reasons the}} attack was so effective was that its email messages passed through spam and security software, and used a real Google address. Within hours, the attack was stopped and fixed by Google, with a spokesperson stating that [...] "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again". On the same day, Google updated Gmail on Android to feature protection from phishing attacks. Media outlets noticed that, while the added protection was announced on the same day as the attack, it [...] "may not have prevented this week's attack, however, as that attack involved a malicious and fake [...] "Google Docs" [...] app that was hosted on Google's own domain". In early May 2017, Ars Technica reported that [...] "at least three security researchers" [...] had raised issues about the threat, one of them in October 2011, and that the attacker or attackers behind the actual incident [...] "may have copied the technique from a proof of concept posted by one security researcher to GitHub in February". Furthermore, the report noted that Google had been repeatedly warned by researchers about the potential threat, with security researcher Greg Carson telling Ars Technica that [...] "I don't think Google fully understood how severely this could be abused, but certainly hackers did".|$|E

[9] presents a novel approach {{to protect against}} <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> using auto-updated white-list of legitimate sites accessed by the individual user. The proposed approach checks the legitimacy of a webpage using hyperlink features. Therefore, various hyperlinks (and features from the hyperlinks) from the source code of a webpage are extracted and apply to the proposed phishing detection system. Authors have performed various experiments and {{results show that the}} proposed approach is very effective in detecting and protecting against <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks.</b> Proposed approach has 86.02  % true positive rate while less than 1.48  % false negative rate. Moreover, various other types of <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> (i.e., domain name system (DNS) poisoning, embedded objects, zero-hour attack) can also be detected efficiently using the proposed approach.|$|R
40|$|Phishing is the {{combination}} of social engineering and technical exploits designed to convince a victim to provide personal information, usually for the monetary gain of the attacker.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} the increasing threat of <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> on mobile platforms. In fact, mobile phishing is more dangerous due to the limitations of mobile phones and mobile user habits. Existing schemes designed for <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> on computers/laptops cannot effectively address <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> on mobile devices. This paper presents MobiFish, a novel automated lightweight anti-phishing scheme for mobile platforms. MobiFish verifies the validity of web pages and applications (Apps) by comparing the actual identity to the identity claimed by the web pages and Apps. MobiFish has been implemented on the Nexus 4 smartphone running the Android 4. 2 operating system. We experimentally evaluate the performance of MobiFish with 100 phishing URLs and corresponding legitimate URLs, as well as fake Facebook Apps. The result shows that MobiFish is very effective in detecting <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> on mobile phones. Keywords—Mobile phones; phishing attack; security; Android I...|$|R

30|$|Unfortunately, {{the first}} of these {{findings}} suggests that the slew of <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> over the last decade may have impacted the trust that some users are placing in security cues. This could have a further impact on companies themselves in the long term, if users view online services as untrustworthy. Moreover, results suggest that when using pop-ups, perpetrators of <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> could be more successful in their objective of deceiving users. On the positive side, however, if people knew how to detect malicious links in general, they could apply the same information for preventing <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> which rely on pop-ups. Therefore, the number of cues that one would have to learn in order to correctly classify web pages does not increase when considering this new channel of <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks.</b> Overall however, it was encouraging to see that in two of the three cases, participants failed because they were more cautious than not.|$|R

40|$|Identity theft through <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks</b> {{has become}} a major concern for Internet users.

This paper aims at making the first steps towards the design and implementation of a security architecture that prevents both classical and malware <b>phishing</b> <b>attacks.</b> Our approach is based on the ideas of compartmentalization for isolating applications of different trust level, and a trusted wallet for storing credentials and authenticating sensitive services.
