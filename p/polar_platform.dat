40|$|NASA has {{selected}} a preliminary payload {{for the earth}} observing system (Eos) program to be flown in the mid-to-late 1990 s. This selection {{was based on the}} scientific guidance of various NASA Eos scientific advisory groups. The majority of the instruments have been assigned to two NASA-provided <b>polar</b> <b>platforms.</b> The payload for the NASA <b>polar</b> <b>platforms</b> consists of NASA research facility instruments, principal investigator instruments, and foreign-provided research facility instruments. The payload has been intentionally oversubscribed during the project definition phase, and will be down-selected before the execution phase begins. The measurements acquired by Eos will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the entire Earth system...|$|R
40|$|The {{instrumentation}} payloads of the Space Station <b>polar</b> <b>platforms</b> consist {{primarily of}} Earth Observing System (EOS) instruments and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) instruments. The accuracy, lifetime, and mission {{effectiveness of the}} instrumentation is adversely affected by the degradation of contamination sensitive surfaces. This paper describes the analysis and results of a study undertaken to select a propellant system for the <b>polar</b> <b>platforms</b> from a contamination standpoint, by evaluation of the potential contamination to three platforms, from three candidate propellant systems. In addition, this paper reports {{the results of a}} study which determined both the molecular and particulate contamination requirements for 37 EOS/NOAA instruments.

50|$|Columbus was {{originally}} planned {{as part of}} the Columbus program, an ESA program to develop an autonomous manned space station {{that could be used for}} a variety of microgravity experiments. The program ran from 1986 to 1991 and included three components: a Man-Tended Free Flyer (MTFF) element serviced by the Hermes shuttle, an Attached Pressurized Module (APM), and a <b>Polar</b> <b>Platform</b> (PPF). After several budget cuts and cancellation of Hermes shuttle, all that remained in the Columbus program was the APM, finally renamed to Columbus.|$|E
50|$|In November 1997 it {{announced}} that it would close the Filton site (former BAe Dynamics) in August 1999, with the planned transfer of 300 of 400 personnel and staff from Bristol to Stevenage. The Filton site specialised in scientific satellites and their computer software; projects included Ulysses, Hubble Space Telecsope Solar Arrays, Giotto, Envisat / <b>Polar</b> <b>Platform,</b> Soho and the Cluster spacecraft destroyed in the first flight of Ariane V. Over 380 staff left the Company and as a result MMS lost the ESA Prime Contract for the Rosetta spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|By 1991 the Columbus and Hermes pre-development {{activities}} were {{good enough to}} progress into full development, however profound geopolitical changes prompted examining broader international co-operation, in particular with the Russian Federation. ESA Member States approved the complete development of the Attached Pressurised Module (APM) and the <b>Polar</b> <b>Platform</b> (PPF) for Columbus, but the Man-Tended Free-Flyer (MTFF) was abandoned. The Hermes programme was reoriented into the Manned Space Transportation Programme (MSTP), and a three-year period extending from 1993 to 1995 was agreed on to define a future manned space transportation system in co-operation with Russia, including joint {{development and use of}} Mir-2.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, late 1986, NASA {{carried out a}} study into new {{configuration}} options to reduce development costs; options studied ranged {{from the use of}} a Skylab-type station to a phased development of the Dual-Keel configuration. This approach involved splitting assembly into two phases; Phase 1 would provide the central modules, and the transverse boom, but with no keels. The solar arrays would be augmented to ensure 75 kW of power would be provided, and the <b>polar</b> <b>platform</b> and servicing facility were again deferred. The study concluded that the project was viable, reducing development costs while minimizing negative impacts, and it was designated the Revised Baseline Configuration. This would have a development cost of US$15.3 billion (in FY1989 dollars) and FEL {{in the first quarter of}} 1994. This replanning was endorsed by the National Research Council in September 1987, which also recommended that the long-term national goals should be studied before committing to any particular Phase 2 design.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the initial}} plans, {{numerous}} studies and proposals were made. For development cost saving and optimization of spares provisioning during the operational phase commonality was foreseen between the flight configurations {{and to the}} space station (e.g. same computers used for all three elements, video and comms units identical to station equipment). When the complete phase C/D proposal (fixed price) was delivered end 1989 by the prime contractor MBB-ERNO {{it turned out that the}} costs were much higher than expected by ESA. The Columbus budget was trimmed slightly by canceling the smaller $145-million Eureca B platform. Hermes and Columbus would receive final approval in 1991. By this time, the cost of German unification had forced Germany to demand a 15-20% reduction in ESA 1990-2000 spending and it was becoming increasingly clear either the German-led MTFF, Italian-led APM or French-led Hermes projects would have to be cancelled. After several budget cuts, the CNES-led Hermes program was cancelled and the <b>polar</b> <b>platform</b> was contracted separately with commonality to the French satellite Helios.|$|E

40|$|Platform {{evolution}} {{studies have}} focused on developing two types of platforms: the Geostationary Platform, for use as an observatory in NASA's Mission-to-Planet-Earth (MPE) initiative, and a co-orbiting platform, for use as a branching mechanism for the Space Station Freedom manned base. In 1989, platform evolution efforts also documented existing <b>polar</b> <b>platform</b> scares for servicing and for co-orbiting platform configurations.

40|$|Infrared {{instrumentation}} on geostationary satellites is now rapidly {{approaching the}} spectral quality {{and accuracy of}} modern sensors flying on <b>polar</b> <b>platforms.</b> Currently, the core of EUMETSAT geostationary meteorological programme is the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). However, EUMETSAT is preparing for the Meteosat Third Generation (MTG). The capability of geostationary satellites to resolve the diurnal cycle and hence to provide time-resolved sequences or times series of observations {{is a source of}} information which could suitably constrain the derivation of geophysical parameters. Nowadays, also because of lack of time continuity, when dealing with observations from <b>polar</b> <b>platforms,</b> the problem of deriving geophysical parameters is normally solved by considering each single observation as independent of past and future events. For historical reason, the same approach is currently pursued with geostationary observations, which are still being dealt with as they were with polar observations. In this study we show some preliminary results on emissivity and surface temperature retrieval for SEVIRI observations, using the Kalman filter methodology (KF) and compare the retrievals with those obtained using IASI observations co-localized with SEVIRI ones using the times accumulation approach (Optimal Estimation OE). The Sahara desert was chosen as target area, and both SEVIRI and IASI data (infrared radiances and cloud mask) were acquired. The time period considered is that of July 2010 (the whole month). ECMWF analyses for the same date and target area have also been acquired, which comprise Ts, T(p), O(p), Q(p) for the canonical hours 0 : 00, 6 : 00, 12 : 00 and 18 : 00. Moreover, for the purpose of developing a suitable background for emissivity, the Global Infrared Land Surface Emissivity database developed at CIMSS, University of Wisconsin, derived by MODIS observations was used and was available from the year 2003 till 2011. Concerning the performance of the two methodologies, the retrieval of skin temperature is almost equivalent. The agreement between OE and KF is fairly good if compared with ECMWF analysis for sea surface, while for land surface, OE and KF agree fairly well with ECMWF during the night, but at midday ECMWF shows a cold bias of 10 K and more. For emissivity the comparison with the UW/BFEMIS database for the same date and location is fairly good for both methods...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} {{concern has}} been expressed about Global Change - the natural and anthropogenic alteration of the Earth's environment involving global greenhouse warming and the associated climate change, urban and regional atmospheric pollution, acid deposition, regional increases in tropospheric zone, and the decrease in stratospheric ozone. A common theme among these problems is that they all involve those tropospheric trace gases which are fundamental to the biosphere-troposphere interaction, the chemistry of the free troposphere itself, and troposphere-stratosphere exchange. The chemical species involved all have spectral signatures within the near and mid infrared that can now be measured by advanced techniques of remote-sensing infrared spectroradiometry. Such a system is the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), now in Phase B definition for the Earth Observing System (EOS) <b>polar</b> <b>platforms.</b> TES addresses these objectives by obtaining radiometrically calibrated, linewidth-limited spectral resolution, infrared spectra of the lower atmosphere using both natural thermal emission and reflected sunlight (where appropriate) in three different, but fully programmable, modes: a gobal mode, a pointed mode, and a limb-viewing mode.
