5|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, the most compelling reason against its adoption arguably being {{that it does not}} control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and <b>private</b> <b>interests,</b> and political and social interests.|$|E

40|$|We use a {{political}} economy framework to study {{differences in the}} support for explicit deposit insurance across countries. Overall, we find mixed evidence {{of the significance of}} the public and <b>private</b> <b>interest</b> theories in explaining adoption and coverage of deposit insurance. While the negative relationship between the strength of small banks in the country and the probability of adoption of deposit insurance is consistent with the public interest view, the negative relationship between the protection of creditor rights and the probability of adoption is consistent with the <b>private</b> <b>interest</b> view. Also, the result that inflation and per capita income are negatively related to the level of coverage provides support for the <b>private</b> <b>interest</b> view. Hence, the results suggests that both public and <b>private</b> <b>interest</b> theories are important in understanding cross-country differences in the support for explicit deposit insurance...|$|R

5|$|Following the Republic of the Congo's {{independence}} from Belgium in 1960, the country fell into disorder as the army mutinied. Shortly thereafter South Kasai and the State of Katanga declared {{independence from}} the Congolese government. The latter contained {{the vast majority of}} the Congo's valuable mineral resources and attracted significant mining activity under Belgian rule. Many Katangese thought that they were entitled to the revenue generated through the lucrative industry, and feared that under the new central government it would be distributed among the Congo's poorer provinces. Resulting nativist politics with support from the Belgian government and <b>private</b> <b>interests</b> such as the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) precipitated the Katangese secession.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} its life, {{there were}} plans for <b>private</b> <b>interests</b> to {{purchase}} Mir, possibly for use as the first orbital television/movie studio. The privately funded Soyuz TM-30 mission by MirCorp, launched on 4 April 2000, carried two crew members, Sergei Zalyotin and Aleksandr Kaleri, to the station for two months to do repair work with the hope of proving that the station could be made safe. This was to be the last manned mission to Mir—while Russia was optimistic about Mir future, its commitments to the International Space Station project left no funding to support the aging station.|$|E

5|$|Officially, {{the entire}} length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. As a {{practical}} matter, this name is not used on the southernmost segments of the Interstate. The American Legion was honored with the designation in 1969 in a state law that required <b>private</b> <b>interests</b> to finance the signage. Public Act174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands. Another name that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976. The designation was formally repealed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} Grade I {{building}} in North Somerset is Tyntesfield, a Victorian Gothic Revival estate near Wraxall. It {{was acquired by}} the National Trust in June 2002 after a fund raising campaign to prevent it being sold to <b>private</b> <b>interests</b> and ensure it be opened to the public. The appeal by the National Trust collected £8.2 million from the public in just 100 days and the Trust also received the largest single grant ever by the National Heritage Memorial Fund (at £17.4 million), which caused some controversy. The house is built of Bath stone, and is highly picturesque, bristling with turrets and possessing an elaborate roof.|$|E
5|$|Though Brownlee {{was no more}} {{enthusiastic}} than Reid about deficits, his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give him yet another ministerial portfolio. In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta's long-sought control over its natural resources from the federal government, and he appointed Reid Alberta's first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930. In this capacity, Reid favoured private over public ownership. He opposed calls from his own party to promote government-developed hydroelectricity projects, and viewed the provincially owned railways as a burden to the government, though they finally turned a profit in 1927. He was a leading advocate of selling them to <b>private</b> <b>interests,</b> a course that was eventually followed in 1929.|$|E

40|$|Through an {{empirical}} analysis of firms in Japan, this paper investigates {{to what extent}} the public <b>interest</b> and the <b>private</b> <b>interest</b> theories, respectively, explain the actual regulatory process. Our estimation findings are as follows. First, the explanatory power of the public interest theory is higher in non-public utility industries, while that of the <b>private</b> <b>interest</b> theory is higher in public utility industries. Second, rapidly growing industries become less regulated as they no longer need government protection. Third, highly competitive industries become more regulated so as to retain profit for individual companies. Fourth, price level has different implications among industries. The negative coefficient in non-public utility industries supports the public interest theory, while the positive coefficient in public utility industries supports the <b>private</b> <b>interest</b> theory...|$|R
5|$|In 894 Stylianos Zaoutzes, basileopator {{and leading}} {{minister}} of Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), convinced the emperor {{to move the}} Bulgarian market from Constantinople to Thessaloniki. That move affected not only <b>private</b> <b>interests</b> but also the international commercial importance of Bulgaria and the principle of Byzantine–Bulgarian trade, regulated with the Treaty of 716 and later agreements on the most favoured nation basis. The Bulgarian merchants were allowed to live in Constantinople, resided in their own colony and paid favourable taxes. The city was a major destination of trade routes from all over Europe and Asia and {{the transfer of the}} Bulgarian market to Thessaloniki cut short the direct access to goods from the east, which under the new circumstances the Bulgarians would have to buy through middlemen, who were close associates of Stylianos Zaoutzes. In Thessaloniki the Bulgarians were also forced to pay higher tariffs to sell their goods, enriching Zaoutzes' cronies.|$|E
5|$|Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in {{the later}} period of his presidency, accusing him of {{increasing}} authoritarianism and the mixing of public and <b>private</b> <b>interests.</b> In addition, {{the benefits of the}} country's growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial land lease agreement with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo, the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer viewed by the international community as a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine <b>private</b> <b>interests</b> to protect or further.|$|E
50|$|Political graft {{functions}} {{when the}} public coffer is directed to purchase goods or services from a specific <b>private</b> <b>interest</b> at a cost far above regular market rates. The <b>private</b> <b>interest</b> then siphons some of the gratuitous profits to government officials {{that are able to}} ensure that future government spending continues in the same fashion so that this lucrative relationship continues. A member of a government may misappropriate directly from government funds, but they may also make decisions benefiting their own <b>private</b> economic <b>interests</b> by using inside knowledge of upcoming government decisions to their benefit, {{in a manner similar to}} insider trading.|$|R

5|$|The provincial presidents were {{appointed}} by the national government and were, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, however, their power was intangible, varying from province to province based upon each president's relative degree of personal influence and personal character. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province {{in which they had}} no political, familial or other ties. In order to prevent them from developing any strong local interests or support, presidents would be limited to terms of only a few months in office. As the president usually {{spent a great deal of}} time away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the president had to rely on provincial and local politicians who belonged to his own political party. This interdependency created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, <b>private</b> <b>interests,</b> party goals, negotiations, and other political maneuvering.|$|E

50|$|In 1920, British {{economist}} Arthur C. Pigou wrote The Economics of Welfare.

Conversely, Pigou argues, if an industry produces a marginal social benefit, the individuals receiving the benefit have no incentive to pay for that service.
