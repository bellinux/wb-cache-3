50|$|The plow blade is {{positioned}} {{in such a}} way that the bottom edges run horizontally and the upper edges slope up and away from their crux at an angle nearly 30 degrees above horizontal. The front faces and top edges of the blade are painted safety yellow, evoking the tradition of public works. The back of the blade is painted dark gray. The <b>plow</b> <b>head</b> is suspended from the I-beam frame with a steel chain, giving it freedom to swing gently up and down. The tire is attached to the support structure with steel bolts.|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{influence}} of the random load on the V-lock chain ring for mining, the numerical simulation technology is used. The dynamic tension is obtained by using the dynamic model of the plough. The life and damage nephograms are obtained by using ANSYS Workbench. The analysis results show that the short fatigue life region of the V-lock chain ring for mining is mainly concentrated on the transition region between the medial straight edge and arc, and the fatigue damage of the link chain {{on the side of the}} motion direction of the <b>plow</b> <b>head</b> is larger than that on the other side. This link chain has strong anti-fatigue performance...|$|E

50|$|In {{the spring}} race at Talladega in 1987, Read was {{swept up in}} a massive pileup late in the race, but was uninjured. However, on his next race back at Talladega in July, on the 78th lap of the 117 lap (500 km race), Kirk Bryant spun and hit the outside wall. Read, who was behind Bryant's {{whirling}} Oldsmobile, spun through the infield grass to avoid him, but Read's car <b>plowed</b> nearly <b>head</b> on into the inside dirt bank. Read, 25, died instantly of massive head, chest, and abdominal injuries from the crash.|$|R
50|$|The {{children}} and runaway slaves hatch a plan, and the slaves {{pretend to be}} the pirates trading the children. When the slave traders board the ship, the children spill dried chickpeas onto the deck, causing them to slip and fall, while Jonathan and Nubia use gold coins as sling stones to knock them unconscious. When Venalicius tries to seize Nubia, Pulchra saves her by <b>plowing</b> her <b>head</b> into his belly. A short time later, Felix arrives in his racing yacht, accompanied by Lupus and a squad of bodyguards. They take the pirates and slave traders into custody, but Lupus shocks them all by trying to stab Venalicius {{to death with a}} knife. Felix stops him, and Lupus bursts into tears.|$|R
500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Maulbetsch joined the Ann Arbor Independents, a {{football}} team made up of Michigan [...] "varsity eligibles" [...] and [...] "townies." [...] Maulbetsch was once reportedly called upon to drive across the goal line for the Independents in {{a game in which}} a large crowd, including a farmer with his plow-horse, gathered in the end zone. [...] "Head down and legs working like piston rods, Maulbetsch <b>plowed</b> ahead until <b>head</b> struck the <b>plow</b> horse amidships. [...] Down went the horse Mauly on top of him." ...|$|R
50|$|In February 1980 CARE {{proposed}} distributing seed rice {{in addition}} to food rice. Numerous predictions of a widespread famine in Kampuchea spurred UNICEF, the Food and Agriculture Organization, ICRC, the World Food Programme, and several nongovernmental aid agencies to support the seed-distribution program. After a trial distribution of 220 tons of rice seeds at Nong Chan on March 21, World Relief and CARE each distributed 2000 tons of rice seed to over 68,000 farmers in early April. Many farmers who received seed at Nong Chan complained {{that they did not}} have the tools with which to plant the rice. World Relief, Christian Outreach and Oxfam responded in May by distributing hoe <b>heads,</b> <b>plow</b> tips, rope, fishnets, and fishhooks, as well as oxcarts. During that month 340,000 people received food and seeds at Nong Chan.|$|R
5000|$|Samora Machel {{was born}} in the village of Madragoa (today's Chilembene), Gaza Province, Mozambique, to a family of farmers. His {{grandfather}} had been an active collaborator of Gungunhana. Under Portuguese rule, his father, like most black Mozambicans, was classified by the demeaning term [...] "ind√≠gena" [...] (native). He was forced to accept lower prices for his crops than white farmers; compelled to grow labor-intensive cotton, which took time away from the food crops needed for his family; and forbidden to brand his mark on his cattle to prevent thievery. However, Machel's father was a successful farmer: he owned four <b>plows</b> and 400 <b>head</b> of cattle by 1940. Machel grew up in this farming village and attended mission elementary school. In 1942, he was sent to school in the town of Zonguene in Gaza Province. The school was run by Catholic missionaries who educated the children in Portuguese language and culture. Although having completed the fourth grade, Machel never completed his secondary education. However, he had the prerequisite certificate to train as a nurse anywhere in Portugal at the time, since the nursing schools were not degree-conferring institutions.|$|R
