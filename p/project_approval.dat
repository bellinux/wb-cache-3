2500|$|The Great Depression led to {{a greatly}} {{expanded}} government effort to encourage business. One such program was the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), established under President Herbert Hoover in 1932. [...] Harvey Couch was selected as one of seven directors on the RFC's board. [...] Couch's mission was to finance public works projects and decrease the number of unemployed Americans, which in 1932 was 13 million. [...] Because the government set strict rules in paying back the federal loans, many applicants weren't granted <b>project</b> <b>approval.</b> [...] Three large projects that did receive approval took many years to generate jobs: the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge; the waterworks system of Pasadena, California, and the Colorado River Aqueduct to Los Angeles. Overall, the RFC failed its mission to create much-needed jobs. [...] But, under Couch, small projects received funding and thousands of jobs were created {{during the winter of}} 1932-33. [...] One of the United States New Deal programs was the creation of the Public Works Administration in 1933, which was a magnification of Couch's public works sector inside the RFC.|$|E
