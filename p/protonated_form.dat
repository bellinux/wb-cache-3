5|$|Like most amines, {{dopamine}} is {{an organic}} base. As a base, {{it is generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The <b>protonated</b> <b>form</b> is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the <b>protonated</b> <b>form,</b> dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.|$|E
25|$|The {{sulfanilamide}} compound is {{more active}} in the <b>protonated</b> <b>form.</b> The drug has very low solubility and sometimes can crystallize in the kidneys, due to its first pKa of around 10. This is a very painful experience, so patients are told to take the medication with copious amounts of water. Newer analogous compounds prevent this complication {{because they have a}} lower pKa, around 5–6, making them more likely to remain in a soluble form.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most amines, indole is not basic: {{just like}} pyrrole, the {{aromatic}} {{character of the}} ring means that the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the nitrogen atom is not available for protonation. Strong acids such as hydrochloric acid can, however, protonate indole. Indole is primarily protonated at the C3, rather than N1, owing to the enamine-like reactivity of the portion of the molecule located outside of the benzene ring. The <b>protonated</b> <b>form</b> has an pKa of −3.6. The sensitivity of many indolic compounds (e.g., tryptamines) under acidic conditions is caused by this protonation.|$|E

25|$|The {{partition}} coefficient is defined at a specified temperature and, if applicable, pH of the aqueous phase. Partition coefficients {{are very important}} in pharmacology because they {{determine the extent to}} which a substance can pass from the blood (an aqueous solution) through a cell wall which is like an organic solvent. They are usually measured using water and octanol as the two solvents. Many pharmaceutical compounds are weak acids or weak bases. Such a compound may exist with a different extent of protonation depending on pH and the acid dissociation constant. Because the organic phase has a low dielectric constant the species with no electrical charge will be the most likely one to pass from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Even at pH7–7.2, the range of biological pH values, the aqueous phase may support an equilibrium between more than one <b>protonated</b> <b>form.</b> logp is determined from the analytical concentration of the substance in the aqueous phase, that is, the sum of the concentration of the different species in equilibrium.|$|E
2500|$|LAs {{are weak}} bases {{and are usually}} {{formulated}} as the hydrochloride salt to render them water-soluble. At a pH equal to the protonated base's pKa, the protonated (ionized) and unprotonated (unionized) forms of the molecule exist in equimolar amounts, but only the unprotonated base diffuses readily across cell membranes. Once inside the cell, the local anesthetic will be in equilibrium, {{with the formation of}} the protonated (ionized form), which does not readily pass back out of the cell. This is referred to as [...] "ion-trapping". In the <b>protonated</b> <b>form,</b> the molecule binds to the LA binding site {{on the inside of the}} ion channel near the cytoplasmic end. Most LAs work on the internal surface of the membrane - the drug has to penetrate the cell membrane, which is achieved best in the nonionised form.|$|E
2500|$|Nature’s {{building}} blocks contain aromatic moieties in high abundance. Recently, {{it has become}} clear that many structural features that were once thought to be purely hydrophobic in nature are in fact engaging in cation–π interactions. The amino acid side chains of phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine, are capable of binding to cationic species such as charged amino acid side chains, metal ions, small-molecule neurotransmitters and pharmaceutical agents. In fact, macromolecular binding sites that were hypothesized to include anionic groups (based on affinity for cations) have been found to consist of aromatic residues instead in multiple cases. Cation-π interactions can tune the pKa of nitrogenous side-chains, increasing the abundance of the <b>protonated</b> <b>form,</b> this has implications for protein structure and function. [...] While less studied in this context, the DNA bases are also able to participate in cation–π interactions.|$|E

[...] The carbonyl group is coplanar to the aromatic ring. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists {{are more likely to}} bind in their <b>protonated</b> <b>form.</b> Docking of a range of antagonists into a homology model of the 5-HT3 receptor binding site shows a reasonably good agreement with the pharmacophore model and supports the observed differences between species. Studies of granisetron in the binding pocket revealed that the aromatic rings of granisetron lie between W183 and Y234 and the azabiciclic ring [...] between W90 and F226. In this study another energetically favorable location of granisetron was identified, closer to the membrane, on a position that could {{be a part of a}} binding/unbinding pathway for the ligand.

2500|$|ROS are {{produced}} intracellularly through multiple mechanisms {{and depending on}} the cell and tissue types, the major sources being the [...] "professional" [...] producers of ROS: NADPH oxidase (NOX) complexes (7 distinct isoforms) in cell membranes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria convert energy for the cell into a usable form, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The process in which ATP is produced, called oxidative phosphorylation, involves the transport of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane {{by means of the}} electron transport chain. In the electron transport chain, electrons are passed through a series of proteins via oxidation-reduction reactions, with each acceptor protein along the chain having a greater reduction potential than the previous. The last destination for an electron along this chain is an oxygen molecule. In normal conditions, the oxygen is reduced to produce water; however, in about 0.1–2% of electrons passing through the chain (this number derives from studies in isolated mitochondria, though the exact rate in live organisms is yet to be fully agreed upon), oxygen is instead prematurely and incompletely reduced to give the superoxide radical (•), most well documented for Complex I and Complex III. Superoxide is not particularly reactive by itself, but can inactivate specific enzymes or initiate lipid peroxidation in its <b>protonated</b> <b>form,</b> hydroperoxyl HO. The pKa of hydroperoxyl is 4.8. Thus, at physiological pH, the majority will exist as superoxide anion.|$|E

Good correlations were found between 6 - 31 G* and MNDO bond orders and between MNDO bond orders and diatomic energy contributions. Although bond orders and diatomic energy contributions are inherently different quantities, both predict the changes in bond strengths due to protonation to be qualitatively the same. The theoretically predicted differences in bond strengths for different <b>protonated</b> <b>forms</b> clearly indicate that in peptide fragmentation schemes one should consider even those <b>protonated</b> <b>forms</b> whose formation is not preferred energetically...|$|R

Sequential formation of both mono- and doubly <b>protonated</b> <b>forms</b> of all the studied compounds was found during the acid-base titration. However, the concentration of monoprotonated form is small compared to those of the free base and doubly protonated one due to close values of protonation constants р K[a 1](Н[2]P ↔Н[3]P{+}) and рK[а 2](Н[3]P{+} ↔ Н[4]P{ 2 +}) in both ground singlet S[0] state and first excited singlet S[1] state. Different position of peripheral substituents/spacers of А (phenyls) and В (mesityls) type, which is known to have different sterical hindrances with tetrapyrrolic macrocycle, does not result in any noticeable differences in the acid-base properties.
