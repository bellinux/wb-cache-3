50|$|Fixation {{is usually}} the first stage in a multistep process to prepare a sample of {{biological}} material for microscopy or other analysis. Therefore, the choice of fixative and fixation protocol may depend on the additional processing steps and final analyses that are planned. For example, immunohistochemistry uses antibodies that bind to a specific protein target. Prolonged fixation can chemically mask these targets and prevent antibody binding. In these cases, a 'quick fix' method using cold formalin for around 24 hours is typically used. Methanol (100%) {{can also be used}} for quick fixation, and that time can vary depending on the biological material. For example, MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells can be fixed for only 3 minutes with cold methanol (-20degrees Celsius).

To investigate whether respiratory protein abundance varies with distance from the electrode, antibodies against an outer membrane multiheme cytochrome (OmcB) and cytoplasmic acetate kinase (AckA) were used to determine protein localization in slices spanning ∼ 25 µm-thick G. sulfurreducens biofilms growing on polished electrodes poised at + 0. 24 V (vs. Standard Hydrogen Electrode).

50|$|In late 1962 {{and early}} 1963, Hepler tested the newly {{developed}} procedure using a glutaraldehyde pre-fix {{followed by an}} osmium <b>post-fix</b> to study plant cell structure using an electron microscope. Building on the earlier work by Sinnott and Bloch, who had shown that wounding the existing tracheary elements in a Coleus stem induced neighboring parenchyma cells to differentiate into new tracheary elements, Hepler showed that cytoplasmic microtubules were localized specifically in the cortical cytoplasm immediately over the bands of new secondary wall thickenings. Moreover, Hepler discovered that the microtubules were oriented parallel to the cellulose microfibrils of the newly formed secondary wall thickenings. This work, along with the studies of Ledbetter and Porter and Green established the importance of cortical microtubules in controlling the alignment of cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall. Further work with Barry Palevitz showed that microtubules were involved in orienting the cellulose microfibrils in the walls of guard cells in a pattern of radial micellation that is necessary for stomatal function. Hepler, along with {{the husband and wife}} team of Dale Callaham and Sue Lancelle, developed a method to achieve rapid freeze fixation of particularly small plant cells that showed that cortical microtubules are closely associated with one another, actin microfilaments, the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{establishes}} a new property of predomains recursively defined using the cartesian product, disjoint union, partial function space and convex powerdomain constructors. We {{prove that the}} partial order on such a recursive predomain D is the greatest fixed point of a certain monotone operator associated to D. This provides a structurally defined family of proof principles for these recursive predomains: to show that one element of D approximates another, it suffices to find a binary relation containing the two elements that is a <b>post-fixed</b> point for the associated monotone operator. The statement of the proof principles is independent {{of any of the}} various methods available for explicit construction of recursive predomains. Following Milner and Tofte (1991), the method of proof is called co-induction. It closely resembles the way bisimulations are used in concurrent process calculi (Milner 1989). Two specific instances of the co-induction principle already occur in the work of Abramsky (1990, 1991) in the form of “internal full abstraction” theorems for denotational semantics of SCCS and lazy lambda calculus. In the first case <b>post-fixed</b> binary relations are precisely Abramsky's partial bisimulations, whereas in the second case they are his applicative bisimulations. The co-induction principle also provides an apparently useful tool for reasoning about equality of elements of recursively defined datatypes in (strict or lazy) higher-order functional programming languages...|$|E

40|$|Electron micrographs (EMs) {{of central}} nervous tissue perfused with {{glutaraldehyde}} and <b>post-fixed</b> with osmium tetroxide exhibit more extracellular space in superficial than in deep {{regions of the}} brain. It was postulated that {{this is due to}} the availability to the surface tissue of the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoidal space. It was assumed that in addition to the extracellular material this fluid is taken up by dendritic elements in the surface layer of the cortex during the glutaraldehyde perfusion. Indeed, dendritic structures in EMs of the surface layer of glutaraldehyde-perfused and OsO 4 -post-fixed cortex exhibited a more pronounced swelling than similar structures in deeper cortical regions, where only extracellular material was available to the dendrites. The extracellular space in such preparations consisted of narrow slits surrounding the tissue elements. These slits were formed during the post-fixation since they were not present in freeze-substituted, glutaraldehyde-perfused tissue, which showed a paucity of extracellular material. The slits were in general wider in the superficial than in the deep cortical tissue. That this difference is related to the amount of material taken up by the dendrites during the glutaraldehyde perfusion was supported by experiments in which the exposed cortical surface was flooded with Ringer's solution during the glutaraldehyde perfusion. This resulted in a ballooning of dendritic elements in the cortical surface due to the availability of an unlimited amount of fluid on the cortex. <b>Post-fixed</b> material of these flooded cortices yielded EMs with unusually wide extracellular slits around the tissue elements...|$|E
40|$|Perfusion of the {{cerebral}} cortex of mice with a 4 - 5 and 12 - 5 % hydroxyadipaldehyde (HAA) solution in a cacodylate buffer caused a biphasic {{change in the}} tissue conductivity.

Electron micrographs (EMs) of mat-erial perfused with HAA for 15 - 20 min and <b>post-fixed</b> with osmium tetroxide showed electron-transparent swollen structures, some of which could be identified as dendritic. The extracellular space consisted of 100 - 200 A slits between the tissue elements and larger spaces in bundles of small profiles (unmyelinated axons). Cortex frozen after 2 min perfusion with HAA and sub-jected to substitution in acetone containing 2 % OsO 4 at — 85 °C showed swollen (dendritic) structures and a paucity of extracellular material in accordance with the conductivity drop. Often tight junctions between the tissue elements were present. Tissue frozen after 15 - 20 min of HAA perfusion when the conductivity had increased again yielded EMs which were char-acterized by an abundance of extracellular space between the small profiles. The mitochondria in the swollen (dendritic) structures were enormously enlarged. Cortex perfused for 15 - 20 min with HAA, <b>post-fixed</b> with OsO 4 and then freeze substituted produced EMs resembling those of tissue fixed in the same way but not subjected to freeze substitution.
