5|$|After {{the first}} tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{evacuation}} warnings. Due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems, many firefighters {{never heard the}} evacuation orders. 9-1-1 dispatchers also received information from callers that was not <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> commanders on the scene. Within hours of the attack, a substantial {{search and rescue operation}} was launched. After months of around-the-clock operations, the World Trade Center site was cleared by the end of May 2002.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Department {{responded by}} sending {{personnel}} {{to analyze the}} proposed route and plan. Max Brewer, an arctic expert {{in charge of the}} Naval Arctic Research Laboratory at Barrow, concluded that the plan to bury most of the pipeline was completely unfeasible because of the abundance of permafrost along the route. In a report, Brewer said the hot oil conveyed by the pipeline would melt the underlying permafrost, causing the pipeline to fail as its support turned to mud. This report was <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> the appropriate committees of the U.S. House and Senate, which had to approve the right-of-way proposal because it asked for more land than authorized in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and because it would break a development freeze imposed in 1966 by former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.|$|E
5|$|The New York City Fire Department {{deployed}} 200 units (half of the department) to the World Trade Center. Their {{efforts were}} supplemented by numerous off-duty firefighters and emergency medical technicians. The New York City Police Department sent Emergency Service Units and other police personnel, and deployed its aviation unit. Once on the scene, the FDNY, the NYPD, and the PAPD did not coordinate efforts and performed redundant searches for civilians. As conditions deteriorated, the NYPD aviation unit relayed information to police commanders, who issued orders for its personnel {{to evacuate the}} towers; most NYPD officers were able to safely evacuate before the buildings collapsed. With separate command posts set up and incompatible radio communications between the agencies, warnings were not <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> FDNY commanders.|$|E

40|$|Asset-building {{policy is}} {{proposed}} {{as a crucial}} improvement to income replacement policies that simply subsidize short-term consumption (Sherraden, 1991). This approach may seem novel, but the Homestead Act provides historical precedent for federal involvement in promoting asset development for individuals. This one policy allowed 1. 5 million households to receive 246 million acres of land. More importantly, it provided a tangible asset that could also benefit future generations. Economic inequality may be an enduring reality. A few persons have {{large amounts of money}} and wealth, much of which they will retain <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> their children or other inheritors. Most others may have a regular income to make ends meet, but could not survive long without a paycheck. And in the latter group, only those that are prudent or fortunate might have a small amount of remaining wealth <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> their children. Still others own almost nothing, sometimes do not have enough income to survive from week to week, and often depend upon the generosity of others, leaving nothing <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> children. An important question is how public policy might affect this mix. Asset building policy is one strategy for reducing wealth inequality in that it focuses o...|$|R

The church teaches that the other “lost tribes of Israel” exist today and that the Jewish people primarily represent the descendants of the nation of Judah.|$|E
25|$|In 1400, three courtiers of King Robert II took {{advantage}} of their lord's absence to Rothesay Castle. Crossing into Cowal on a hunting trip, they encountered and raped three Lamont women. In a rage, Lamont clansmen {{caught up with the}} three courtiers and brutally murdered them. The incident was <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> the King, who punished Clan Lamont by rescinding nearly eight square miles of their lands in Strath Echaig and granting them to the Campbells.|$|E
25|$|Public Part C Medicare Advantage {{and other}} Part C health plans are {{required}} to offer coverage that meets or exceeds the standards set by Original Medicare {{but they do not}} have to cover every benefit in the same way. After approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, if a Part C plan chooses to pay less than Original Medicare for some benefits, such as Skilled Nursing Facility care, the savings may be <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> consumers by offering even lower co-payments for doctor visits.|$|E
50|$|Maisie Shiell (1916-2008) became {{involved}} in anti-nuclear issues in 1976 when public concern developed about a new uranium mine in Saskatchewan.

25|$|The early Christian monks adapted {{techniques}} {{common in}} the art of memory as an art of composition and meditation, which was in keeping with the rhetorical and dialectical context in which it was originally taught. It became the basic method for reading and meditating upon the Bible after making the text secure within one's memory. Within this tradition, the art of memory was <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> the later Middle Ages and the Renaissance (or Early Modern period). When Cicero and Quintilian were revived after the 13th century, humanist scholars understood the language of these ancient writers {{within the context of the}} medieval traditions they knew best, which were profoundly altered by monastic practices of meditative reading and composition.|$|E
25|$|On Monday May 6, 1968, St. Petersburg city {{sanitation}} workers went {{on strike}} and implemented a work stoppage at the Lake Maggiore sanitation compound. Workers expressed concern over a new pay plan implemented a month prior, that failed to produce “shared savings” that were to be <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> the workers as promised. As {{a result of these}} perceived failed promises, sanitation workers demanded a wage increase of 25-cents an hour before they would return to work. City Manager Lynn Andrews, having agreed with similar demands in the two previous strikes, asked the strikers to take the day off and come back Tuesday while claiming he was in no position to grant any wage increases.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between virulence and transmission is complex, and has important {{consequences for the}} long term evolution of a pathogen. Since it takes many generations for a microbe and a new host species to co-evolve, an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can be <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing and coughing create infectious aerosols).|$|E
50|$|Bancroft {{assisted}} Franklin and Deane by copying {{letters and}} other documents, by translating diplomatic correspondence into French or English, and by arranging for repairs, hiring crews, and buying supplies for American ships in French ports.

25|$|Wicca is {{a nature}} {{religion}} that celebrates the turning {{of the wheel}} (or {{the changing of the}} seasons). Wicca's core beliefs, principles and practices were originally outlined in the 1940s and 1950s by Gardner and Doreen Valiente, both in published books as well as in secret written and oral teachings <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> their initiates. There are many variations on the core structure, and the religion grows and evolves over time. It is divided into a number of diverse lineages, sects and denominations, referred to as traditions, each with its own organizational structure and level of centralisation. Due to its decentralized nature, there is some disagreement over what actually constitutes Wicca. Some traditions, collectively referred to as British Traditional Wicca, strictly follow the initiatory lineage of Gardner and consider the term Wicca to apply only to similar traditions, but not to newer, eclectic traditions.|$|E
25|$|Mutations of tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes that}} occur in germline cells are <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> offspring, and increase the likelihood for cancer diagnoses in subsequent generations. Members of these families have increased incidence and decreased latency of multiple tumors. The tumor types are typical {{for each type of}} tumor suppressor gene mutation, with some mutations causing particular cancers, and other mutations causing others. The mode of inheritance of mutant tumor suppressors is that an affected member inherits a defective copy from one parent, and a normal copy from the other. For instance, individuals who inherit one mutant p53 allele (and are therefore heterozygous for mutated p53) can develop melanomas and pancreatic cancer, known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Other inherited tumor suppressor gene syndromes include Rb mutations, linked to retinoblastoma, and APC gene mutations, linked to adenopolyposis colon cancer. Adenopolyposis colon cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in colon while young, leading to colon cancer at a relatively early age. Finally, inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead to early onset of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Sexting is the {{practice}} of an individual using cell phone messaging to send nude or semi-nude images of themselves to others (such as friends or dating partners). These may be <b>passed</b> <b>along</b> <b>to</b> others or be posted on the Internet. In many jurisdictions, the age of consent {{is lower than the}} age of majority, and a minor who is over the age of consent can legally have sex with a person of the same age. Many laws on child pornography were passed before cell phone cameras became common among teenagers over the age of consent and sexting was understood as a phenomenon. Because laws were created around the age of majority, teenagers who are legally able to consent to sex can be charged with production and distribution of child pornography if they send naked images of themselves to friends or sex partners of the same age. The University of New Hampshire’s Crimes Against Children Research Center estimates that 7 percent of people arrested on suspicion of child pornography production in 2009 were teenagers who shared images with peers consensually. In some countries, mandatory sentencing requires anybody convicted of such an offence to be placed on a sex offender registry.|$|E
