40|$|Abstract. Metal–hydrogen {{systems are}} of great basic and {{technological}} interest in {{connection to the}} role of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. Frequently, metal systems are involved in hydrogen purification, storage, and engines making use of this fuel. The presence of hydrogen in a metallic matrix gives rise to modifications of electrical, optical and mechanical properties. Hydrogen accumulation in metals may cause damage to the material by also <b>producing</b> <b>fracture,</b> thus limiting operating lifetime. Reducing the hydrogen permeation is an important task also for the fusion reactors: it is well known, indeed, that tritium is radioactive so that {{it is very important to}} be able to confine tritium during the nuclear fusion process. The theoretical study of permeation is thus of fundamental importance to obtain efficient barriers to permeation. Hydrogen trapping sites have a great influence on the hydrogen permeation through a slab sample. The diffusion of the hydrogen in a crystal is generally described by a parabolic partial differential equation with appropriate boundary conditions. The numerical simulation code PHM (Permeation of Hydrogen through Metals), realized for the study of the permeation of hydrogen in presence of trapping sites, is here described and utilized for the analysis of the influence of reversible and irreversible traps on the diffusion of hydrogen in a metal...|$|E
30|$|Many {{successful}} exploratory {{wells in}} the past (temperatures >  110  °C) are shallow (<  150  m), so the cost of new shallow wells is not great. The problem has been to drill into a fracture system that will produce >  6  l/s. The area underlain by fracture systems bearing hot water appears to be overlain by low-resistivity altered granite {{to a depth of}} 25 – 50  m, as shown by past geophysical surveys and the recent MT survey of Amatyakul et al. (2016). Reports from past wells are not detailed, but fractures from 18  m to 417  m are reported from wells FTGE- 14, FTGE- 15, FX- 2, and FX- 4 (Table  1). A simple strategy is to drill new wells into the low-resistivity areas to depths less than 300  m, and obtain good information from cuttings, to temperature and caliper logs to locate the fracture systems. Well design should case and cement off cold-water inflows. A budget for multiple wells is necessary because these wells are exploring for steeply dipping open fractures capable of producing water, and some wells may not encounter a <b>producing</b> <b>fracture.</b> The wells are to some extent exploratory, but they should be drilled so that they can be reamed and completed as production wells. Diameter of wells should be large enough to set a >  6  l s− 1 submersible pump. A 6 -inch (14.3  cm) well will accommodate a high-temperature submersible pump with a capacity of ~  30  l s− 1. An 8 -inch (20.3  cm) well is preferred for casing-off colder flows and for working room.|$|E

A long-offset multicomponent borehole induction resistivity tool capable of surviving the high temperatures encountered in geothermal wells has recently been developed and tested in a high temperature environment. Several characteristics of this device make it ideal for detecting <b>producing</b> <b>fractures.</b> Whereas commercial induction logging devices have strong source-receiver separations of 1 m, this device has multiple sensors with separation of 8 m, allowing for deeper penetrations {{and the ability to}} straddle fracture-induced washout zones in boreholes.

This in turn allows for accurate projection of these structures into the space between wells...|$|R

Materials and methods: 13 high-noble-alloy MC and 13 Y-TZP molar crowns veneered with porcelain were manufactured. The crowns were artificially aged before final load to fracture. Load was applied using a 7 mm diameter steel ball exerting force on the cusps with stresses directed toward the core-veneer interface. Fracture surface analysis was performed using light- and scanning electron microscopy. Results: The test design <b>produced</b> <b>fractures</b> of the veneering material rather than complete fractures. MC crowns withstood significantly (p>. 001) higher loads (mean 2155 N) than Y-TZP (mean 1505 N) crowns yet both endure loads sufficient for predictable clinical use.

40|$|Fractures of {{the keel}} bone, a bone {{extending}} ventrally from the sternum, are a serious {{health and welfare}} problem in free range laying hens. Recent findings suggest that {{a major cause of}} keel damage within extensive systems is collisions with internal housing structures, though investigative efforts have been hindered by difficulties in examining mechanisms and likely influencing factors at the moment of fracture. The objectives of this study were to develop an ex vivo impact protocol to model bone fracture in hens caused by collision, to assess impact and bird-related factors influencing fracture occurrence and severity, and to identify correlations of mechanical and structural properties between different skeletal sites. We induced keel bone fractures in euthanized hens using a drop-weight impact tester able to generate a range of impact energies, <b>producing</b> <b>fractures</b> that replicate those commonly found in commercial settings. The results demonstrated that impact energies of a similar order to those expected in normal housing were able to <b>produce</b> <b>fractures,</b> and that greater collision energies resulted in an increased likelihood of fractures and of greater severity.

Correlations were also identified between the keel and long bones with respect to both strength and bone mineral density. This is the first study able to relate impact and bone characteristics with keel bone fracture at the moment of collision.

[...] One {{formation}} mechanism proposed by Quinn and Ehlmann in 2017 was that sediment was deposited and eventually the sediment underwent diagenesis which caused a loss of volume and fractures. After erosion exposed the fractures, they were filled with minerals possibly by acid-sulfate fluids. More erosion removed softer materials and left the more resistant ridges behind.

Initial {{material}} structure, {{welding parameters}} {{as well as}} subsequent processing or loadings can drastically influence the durability of welded parts fabricated from austenitic steels or super-alloys. Metallographic analysis performed on {{a considerable number of}} TIG welded joints between parts fabricated from austenitic steels such as AISI 304, AISI 309, AISI 316 or INCOLOY 800 superalloy allowed identification of different fracture types caused by processing factors: inadequate geometry of the joint, flaws inside the joint or on the heat affected zone (HAZ). Another category of fracture causes is represented by the service conditions such as inter-crystalline corrosion or stress corrosion. The fracture mechanism has been analyzed also as in connection with the processing by mean of cold deformation that was applied after the welding.

50|$|Humerus {{fractures}} usually occur after physical trauma, falls, excess physical stress, or pathological conditions. Proximal humerus fractures {{most often}} occur among elderly patients with osteoporosis who fall on an outstretched arm. Less frequently, proximal fractures occur from motor vehicle accidents, gunshots, and violent muscle contractions from an electric shock or seizure. Other {{risk factors for}} proximal fractures include having a low bone mineral density, having impaired vision and balance, and tobacco smoking. A stress fracture of the proximal and shaft regions can occur after an excessive amount of throwing, such as pitching in baseball. Middle fractures are usually caused by either physical trauma or falls.
