25|$|Probability {{theory is}} {{the branch of}} {{mathematics}} concerned with probability. Although there are several different probability interpretations, probability theory treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it {{through a set of}} axioms. Typically these axioms formalise probability in terms of a probability space, which assigns a measure taking values between 0 and 1, termed the <b>probability</b> <b>measure,</b> to a set of outcomes called the sample space.

40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} problem of {{learning}} a data description model from a dataset containing <b>probability</b> <b>measures</b> as observations. We estimate the data description model by optimizing volume-sets of <b>probability</b> <b>measures</b> where each volume-set is defined as a set of <b>probability</b> <b>measures</b> whose representative functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) belong to an enclosing ball. We present three data description models, which are functions in a RKHS depending only on some <b>probability</b> <b>measures,</b> named support measures in analogy to support vectors. An advantage of the method is that we do not consider any particular form for the <b>probability</b> <b>measures.</b> We validate our method in the task of group anomaly detection, with artificial and real datasets...|$|R
