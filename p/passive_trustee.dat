50|$|In Bahin v Hughes the {{situation}} where a sole trustee benefited from the breach of trust was considered by High Court. In that case there were two trustees, {{one of whom was}} passive in the management of the trust, one of those trustees acted honestly but in breach of the trust terms in making an investment. The <b>passive</b> <b>trustee</b> was unsuccessful in claiming an indemnity on the basis that it had been the actions of the other trustee that had caused the breach of trust. Cotton LJ felt that {{it would be wrong to}} punish a trustee who had acted honestly more than a trustee who had failed to act at all.|$|E
5000|$|A nominee {{trust is}} an {{arrangement}} whereby {{one or more}} persons appoint a [...] "trustee" [...] to be listed on legal title, or other documents, on their behalf. The arrangement is simple and <b>passive,</b> the <b>trustee</b> is to do nothing except what they are directed to do by the beneficiaries. Technically {{it is not a}} trust but an agency arrangement, although it has been characterized as a hybrid between a traditional trust and an agency relationship. One use of the nominee trust is to avoid reporting the ownership of real estate on the public record. The deed, or other filed document lists the trustee, but not the undisclosed principals. Another use is to facilitate transfer of real property without involving the county recorder.|$|R
