Algorithms {{for determining the}} slowness vectors of reflected/transmitted <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> from the known slowness vector of the incident wave are proposed. In viscoelastic media, the slowness vectors of <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> are complex-valued, p = P + iA, where P is the propagation vector, and A the attenuation vector.

40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} the {{representation}} of wave fields in terms of superpositions of monochromatic <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> is presented for fields satisfying the inhomogeneous scalar wave equation. The discussion includes expansions of the type originally used by E. T. Whittaker involving only homogeneous <b>plane</b> <b>waves,</b> and of the type introduced by H. Weyl involving both homogeneous and inhomogeneous <b>plane</b> <b>waves.</b> Expressions for the plane-wave amplitudes for both types ofrepresentations are obtained {{in terms of the}} source function, and precise conditions under which each expansion is valid are given. It is shown that when both types of expansions are valid, the superposition of inhomogeneous <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> in the Weyl-type representation is equal to the superposition of the homogeneous <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> that propagate into a specific half-space in the Whittaker-type representation. It is shown also that in restricted space-time regions only a certain subset of the <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> in the Whittaker-type expansion contribute to the field. This result leads to a simple expression for the field valid at large distances from the source...|$|R

25|$|In reality, a {{coherent}} isotropic radiator of linear polarization {{can be shown}} to be impossible. Its radiation field could not be consistent with the Helmholtz wave equation (derived from Maxwell's equations) in all directions simultaneously. Consider a large sphere surrounding the hypothetical point source, so that at that radius the wave over a reasonable area is essentially planar. The electric (and magnetic) field of a <b>plane</b> <b>wave</b> in free space is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. So the electric field would have to be tangent {{to the surface of the}} sphere everywhere, and continuous along that surface. However the hairy ball theorem shows that a continuous vector field tangent to the surface of a sphere must fall to zero at one or more points on the sphere, which is inconsistent with the assumption of an isotropic radiator with linear polarization.|$|E
25|$|The typical way to {{consider}} polarization {{is to keep}} track of the orientation of the electric field vector as the electromagnetic wave propagates. The electric field vector of a <b>plane</b> <b>wave</b> may be arbitrarily divided into two perpendicular components labeled x and y (with z indicating the direction of travel). The shape traced out in the x-y plane by the electric field vector is a Lissajous figure that describes the polarization state. The following figures show some examples of the evolution of the electric field vector (blue), with time (the vertical axes), at a particular point in space, along with its x and y components (red/left and green/right), and the path traced by the vector in the plane (purple): The same evolution would occur when looking at the electric field at a particular time while evolving the point in space, along the direction opposite to propagation.|$|E
