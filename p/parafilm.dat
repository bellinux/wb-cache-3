50|$|A chip {{can be made}} of two coverslips. One of {{them should}} be drilled to make two hole, {{allowing}} the reagents to be injected into the flowcell. The slides should be cleaned to remove dirt. A bath sonicator is a good tool for that, 15 minutes in Isopropanol should do the trick. Next, the a channel should be made. One way of doing so is to cut <b>parafilm</b> in the center, leaving a frame of <b>parafilm</b> {{that would be used}} as a spacer between the slides. The slides should be assembled one on the other with the cut <b>parafilm</b> between them. The final step is to heat the chip so that the <b>parafilm</b> will melt and glue the slides together.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} gel extraction involves creating a folded pocket of <b>Parafilm</b> wax paper and placing the agarose fragment inside. The agarose is physically compressed {{with a finger}} into {{a corner of the}} pocket, partially liquifying the gel and its contents. The liquid droplets can then be directed out of the pocket onto an exterior piece of <b>Parafilm,</b> where they are pipetted into a small tube. A butanol extraction removes the ethidium bromide stain, followed by a phenol/chloroform extraction of the cleaned DNA fragment.|$|E
50|$|The NMR tube is then usually {{sealed with}} a {{polyethylene}} cap, {{but can be}} flame sealed or sealed with a Teflon 'Schlenk' tap or even a very small rubber septum. <b>Parafilm</b> may be wrapped around the cap to reduce solvent evaporation.|$|E

Once air bubbles have been expelled, the plunger is secured to the tube proper by <b>parafilm.</b> Ideally, the tubes are matched with the deuterated solvent used to have better spectrum resolution.|$|E
50|$|When storing {{chemical}} wastes, {{the containers}} {{must be in}} good condition and should remain closed unless waste is being added. Hazardous waste must be stored safely prior to removal from the laboratory {{and should not be}} allowed to accumulate. Container should be sturdy and leakproof, also has to be labeled. All liquid waste must be stored in leakproof containers with a screw- top or other secure lid. Snap caps, mis-sized caps, <b>parafilm</b> and other loose fitting lids are not acceptable. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Keep waste containers closed except when adding waste. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from the primary container, segregate incompatible hazardous wastes, such as acids and bases.|$|E
40|$|Stem {{cells have}} emerged as {{potentially}} useful cells for regenerative medicine applications. To fully harness this potential, {{it is important to}} develop in vitro cell culture platforms with spatially regulated mechanical, chemical, and biological cues to induce the differentiation of stem cells. In this study, a cell culture platform was constructed that used polydopamine (PDA) -coated <b>parafilm.</b> The modified <b>parafilm</b> supports cell attachment and proliferation. In addition, because of the superb plasticity and ductility of the <b>parafilm,</b> it can be easily micropatterned to regulate the spatial arrangements of cells, and can exert different mechanical tensions. Specifically, we constructed a PDA-coated <b>parafilm</b> with grooved micropatterns to induce the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells that were cultured on the PDA-coated <b>parafilm</b> exhibited significantly higher osteogenic commitment in response to mechanical and spatial cues compared to the ones without stretch.

Subsequently, the <b>Parafilm</b> was removed and the specimens were oven dried at 105  °C until constant mass was achieved. This stage was marked as day −  1. The specimens were cooled and vacuum saturated (−  20 in-Hg) with NaCl solutions at concentrations of 0, 2.8, and 5.6  mol/L (day 0). Vacuum saturation was used to accelerate chloride ion ingress, and consequently chloride binding. The specimens were covered with <b>Parafilm</b> to prevent moisture loss.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{commercial}} {{polymeric film}} (<b>Parafilm</b> M®, {{a blend of}} a hydrocarbon wax and a polyolefin) was evaluated as a model membrane for microneedle (MN) insertion studies. Polymeric MN arrays were inserted into <b>Parafilm</b> M® (PF) and also into excised neonatal porcine skin. <b>Parafilm</b> M® was folded before the insertions to closely approximate thickness of the excised skin. Insertion depths were evaluated using optical coherence tomography (OCT) using either a force applied by a Texture Analyser or {{by a group of}} human volunteers. The obtained insertion depths were, in general, slightly lower, especially for higher forces, for PF than for skin. However, this difference was not a large, being less than the 10 % of the needle length. Therefore, all these data indicate that this model membrane could be a good alternative to biological tissue for MN insertion studies. As an alternative method to OCT, light microscopy was used to evaluate the insertion depths of MN in the model membrane. This provided a rapid, simple method to compare different MN formulations. The use of <b>Parafilm</b> M®, in conjunction with a standardised force/time profile applied by a Texture Analyser, could provide the basis for a rapid MN quality control test suitable for in-process use. It could also be used as a comparative test of insertion efficiency between candidate MN formulations...|$|E

40|$|Due to the multifactor {{etiology}} of temporomandibular disorder (TMD), the precise diagnosis remains {{a matter of}} debate and validated diagnostic tools are needed. The aim was to determine the accuracy of surface electromyography (sEMG) activity, assessed in the amplitude domain by the root mean square (RMS), in the diagnosis of TMD. One hundred twenty-three volunteers were evaluated using the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders and distributed into two groups: women with myogenous TMD (n = 80) and women without TMD (n = 43). The volunteers were then submitted to sEMG evaluation of the anterior temporalis, masseter and suprahyoid muscles at rest and during maximum voluntary teeth clenching (MVC) on <b>parafilm.</b> The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the muscle activity were analyzed. Differences between groups were found in all muscles analyzed at rest {{as well as in the}} masseter and suprahyoid muscles during MVC on <b>parafilm.</b> Moderate accuracy (AUC: 0. 74 - 0. 84) of the RMS sEMG was found in all muscles regarding the diagnosis of TMD at rest and in the suprahyoid muscles during MVC on <b>parafilm.</b> Moreover, sensitivity ranging from 71. 3 % to 80 % and specificity from 60. 5 % to 76. 6 %. In contrast, RMS sEMG did not exhibit acceptable degrees of accuracy in the other masticatory muscles during MVC on <b>parafilm.</b> It was concluded that the RMS sEMG is a complementary tool for clinical diagnosis of the myogenous TMD.

40|$|There is a {{continuous}} need for thinner edible coatings with excellent barrier properties, and this requires new application methods. Electrospraying {{is known to}} yield fine droplets of size down to 20 µm, giving the potential of very thin and even coatings. A single electrospraying nozzle was used to characterise droplet formation and investigate the formation of thin films on well-defined surfaces. The experimental droplet size was successfully described {{as a function of}} operational parameters and liquid properties using scaling relations. The influence of operating parameters as nozzle height and electrostatic potential were evaluated as well. Thin film deposition was experimentally investigated for sunflower oil electro-sprayed on a highly conductive (aluminium) and insulating target surface (<b>Parafilm).</b> For both aluminium foil and <b>Parafilm</b> the droplet deposition was found to be random. For aluminium foil, being a conductive target, this was expected as repellence between droplets on the surface and new droplets is low, due to charge leakage to the ground. For <b>Parafilm,</b> droplet repellence appeared so large that droplets deposited on larger empty spots or were even pushed away from the surface.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the relationship between the flow rate of saliva and characteristics of the food. Therefore, we determined the rate of saliva secretion in 16 healthy subjects in rest and while chewing natural and artificial foods (toast with and without margarine, three sizes of breakfast cake, and <b>Parafilm).</b> We also determined the chewing rate, number of chewing cycles until swallowing, and time until swallowing. The physical characteristics of the foods were quantified from force-deformation experiments. The results showed that the average at which mechanical failure occurred (yield force) was 1. 86 ± 0. 24 N for the breakfast cake and 16. 3 ± 1. 3 N for the melba toast. The flow rates obtained without stimulation and with <b>Parafilm</b> were significantly lower (P < 0. 001) than the flow rates obtained from chewing food.

Regulation of these spatial parameters is important for controlling cell fate and cell function. While micropatterning has proved a powerful technique for understanding the impact of cell organization on cell behaviour, current methods for micropatterning cells require complex, specialized equipment that is not readily accessible in most biological and bioengineering laboratories. In addition, currently available methods require significant protocol optimization to ensure reliable and reproducible patterning.
