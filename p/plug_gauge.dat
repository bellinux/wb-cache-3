50|$|Go/no go gauges are {{encountered}} in {{all types of}} manufacturing. They may measure a physical dimension, e.g. (50 ±0.01mm), or a value such as {{the value of a}} resistor (100Ω (ohms) ±1%).A typical example is a <b>plug</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{rounding}} out {{a line of}} vacuum pumps and compressors and of creating a demand for the pumps was slow. A micrometer <b>plug</b> <b>gauge,</b> another invention of Nash's, was made and generated enough profits to keep the company afloat. In 1912, a steady demand had been found for the pumps, and {{the first floor of}} the present building on Wilson Point Road was erected. The building was designed and built entirely from his plans and figures of Nash.|$|E
5000|$|In machining, {{where the}} thou is often {{treated as a}} basic unit, 0.0001 inches can be {{referred}} to as [...] "one tenth", meaning [...] "one tenth of a thou". (The metric comparison is discussed below.) Machining [...] "to within a few tenths" [...] is often considered very accurate, and at or near the extreme limit of tolerance capability in most contexts. Greater accuracy (tolerance ranges inside one tenth) apply in only a few contexts: in <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> and gauge block manufacturing or calibration, they are typically expressed in millionths of an inch or, alternatively, in micrometres; in nanotechnology, nanometres or picometres are used.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to gauge}} blocks, these are precision-ground {{cylindrical}} bars, {{for use as}} <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> to measure hole diameters, or as parts of go/no go gauges or similar applications.|$|R
50|$|Used {{to place}} and recover {{wellbore}} equipment, such as <b>plugs,</b> <b>gauges</b> and valves, slicklines are single-strand non-electric cables lowered into {{oil and gas}} wells from the surface. Slicklines {{can also be used}} to adjust valves and sleeves located downhole, as well as repair tubing within the wellbore.|$|R
50|$|Go ring gauges {{provide a}} {{precision}} tool for production comparative gauging {{based on a}} fixed limit. Go gauges consist of a fixed limit gauge with a gauging limit based on the plus or minus tolerances of the inspected part. A go ring gauge's dimensions {{are based on the}} maximum OD tolerance of the round bar or part being <b>gauged.</b> A go <b>plug</b> <b>gauge's</b> dimensions are based on the minimum ID tolerance of the hole or part being <b>gauged.</b> The go <b>plug</b> (ID) <b>gauge</b> should be specified to a plus gaugemakers' tolerance from the minimum part tolerance. The go ring (OD) gauge should be specified to a minus gaugemakers' tolerance from the maximum part tolerance.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the right}} image, the top gauge is a thread gauge that is screwed into the part to be tested, the [...] "GO" [...] end should fully enter the part; the [...] "NOT GO" [...] end should not. The lower {{image is a}} plain <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> used to check {{the size of a}} hole; the green end is the go, and the red end is the no-go. The {{tolerance}} of the part that this gauge checks is 0.30 mm, where the lower size of the hole is 12.60 mm and the upper size is 12.90 mm, every size outside this range is out of tolerance.

5000|$|Snap gauges {{are often}} used when a large {{quantity}} of work pieces must be inspected. The snap gauge has four anvils or jaws, the first one or pair (outermost) are set using the upper limit (tolerance) of the part and the inner set adjusted to the lower limit of the part. A correctly machined part will pass {{the first set of}} jaws and stop at the second [...] - [...] end of test. In this manner, a part may be checked in one action, unlike the <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> that needs to be used twice and flipped to access the second gauge. The first go/no-go snap gage for checking thread rolls was invented in 1943 to speed production of parts during WWII.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a novel optical thread <b>plug</b> <b>gauge</b> (OTPG) for internal thread inspection using machine vision. The OTPG {{is composed of}} a rigid industrial endoscope, a charge-coupled device camera, and a two degree-of-freedom motion control unit. A sequence of partial wall images of an internal thread are retrieved and reconstructed into a 2 D unwrapped image. Then, a digital image processing and classification procedure is used to normalize, segment, and determine {{the quality of the}} internal thread. The proposed OTPG provides an orientation-free and convenient method for detecting defects such as scratches, collapses, and flaws in an internal thread. Keywords Internal thread.

5000|$|A spark <b>plug</b> gap <b>gauge</b> is a disc with {{a sloping}} edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, {{and is used}} to measure the gap. Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars. [...] Vehicles using compressed natural gas generally require narrower gaps than vehicles using gasoline.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of quality}} control was {{a sketch of}} the desired item. If the sketch did not match the item, it was rejected, in a simple Go/no go procedure. However, manufacturers soon found it was difficult and costly to make parts be exactly like their depiction; hence around 1840 tolerance limits were introduced, wherein a design would function if its parts were measured to be within the limits. Quality was thus precisely defined using devices such as <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> and ring gauges. However, this {{did not address the}} problem of defective items; recycling or disposing of the waste adds to the cost of production, as does trying to reduce the defect rate. Various methods have been proposed to prioritize quality control issues and determine whether to leave them unaddressed or use quality assurance techniques to improve and stabilize production.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:-AISI D 3 {{tool steel}} is a high-carbon, highchromium, oil-hardening tool steel that is {{characterized}} by a relatively high attainable hardness and numerous, large, chromium-rich alloy carbides in the microstructure. These carbides provide good resistance to wear from sliding contact with other metals and abrasive materials. Typical applications for D 3 tool steel include Blanking, stamping, and cold forming dies and punches for long runs; lamination dies, Bending, forming, and seaming rolls, Cold trimmer dies or rolls, Burnishing dies or rolls, <b>Plug</b> <b>gauges,</b> Drawing dies for bars or wire. In this paper the microstructure of D 3 tool steel is observed before and after heat treatment and surface roughness in D 3 is investigated after EDM. For this set of experiments three different tool electrodes are taken and the result shows the variation of Ra value with respect to discharge current.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a methodology for modelling {{the control of}} a threaded <b>plug</b> <b>gauge.</b> There had been examined works of scientists who had studied the aspects of the average thread diameter control and studied the problems of providing and {{improving the quality of}} threaded joints. At a modern machine-building enterprise, threaded gauges are important in controlling threaded joints of parts. There had been built a functional model of the caliber life-cycle. The article shows possible applications of threaded gauges and examines the method of automating the average thread diameter control on a universal three-axis measuring video microscope. The application of this method is expedient in the conditions of modern production, since that usage reduces time expenses and requirements for the operators' qualification, as well as increases the reliability {{of the results of the}} average thread diameter control...|$|E
40|$|Carbon fibre {{composites}} {{are increasingly}} being used in aircraft structures due to their superior physical and mechanical properties. The process of drilling of carbon fibre composites in aircraft manufacture is economically important since the extremely abrasive nature of the fibres limits drill life. The hole quality produced by drilling in terms of fibre pullout and matrix cracking affects the notch sensitivity of the hole. The present thesis describes an experimental and analytical study of drilling of the carbon fibre composites carried out {{with the support of}} British Aerospace (Military Aircraft Division). Full drill life testing was carried out using four low cost commercial cemented carbide drills, three of which had brazed inserts, and drill life was determined by measuring the outer drill corner wear. Hole quality was measured in terms of diametrical tolerance using accurate <b>plug</b> <b>gauges.</b> Drill forces were measured using a two component Kistler dynamometer and attempts were made to measure residual stress in the workpiece using the birefringent photoelastic technique. The hole quality was related to drill wear, cutting forces and heat generated during drilling. Independent tasks were carried out to relate cemented carbide physical and mechanical properties to wear using several standard sliding wear experiments. Three different cemented carbide tool materials were investigated in terms of cobalt layer thickness, carbide distribution and physical properties including hardness and fracture toughness. Independent sliding wear tests were performed using a Pin-on-Disc machine, lathe and machining centre. These tests allowed the materials to be ranked in terms of wear resistance when rubbing against carbon fibre composite. The fracture toughness was measured using the techniques developed by Palmqvist. The wear resistance was correlated to the physical and mechanical properties of the tool materials. Hole quality was studied experimentally using scanning electron microscopy and fibre pullout shown to be primarily dependent on the fibre-matrix interface bond strength and the intrinsic strength of the fibres. The surface morphology of the fractured fibres in areas of fibre pullout showed inultimode damage due to anisotropy of the carbon fibre composite and the dynamics of drilling. The degree and pattern of damage developed in the drilled holes was found to be highly directionally dependent. The experimental results and theoretical analysis showed that the degree of hole damage depends not only on drilling parameters but also on the material composition and the manufacturing process of the carbon fibre composite...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss a}} new type of unitary {{perturbations}} around conformal theories inspired by the σ-model perturbation of the nonunitary WZNW model. We show that the nonunitary level k WZNW model perturbed by its sigma model term goes to the unitary level -k WZNW model. When <b>plugged</b> into the <b>gauged</b> WZNW model the given perturbation results in the perturbed gauged WZNW model which no longer describes a coset construction. We consider the BRST invariant generalization of the sigma model perturbation around the gauged WZNW model. In this way we obtain perturbed coset constructions. In the case of the SU_m- 2 (2) × SU_ 1 (2) /SU_m- 1 (2) coset, the BRST invariant sigma model perturbation is identical to Zamolodchikov's Φ_(1, 3) perturbation of the minimal conformal series...|$|R
