50|$|The label Abbevillian prevailed {{until the}} Leakey family {{discovered}} older (yet similar) artifacts at Olduvai Gorge (a.k.a. Oldupai Gorge), starting in 1959, and promoted the African origin of man. Olduwan (or Oldowan) soon replaced Abbevillian in describing African and Asian <b>paleoliths.</b> The term Abbevillian is still used, {{but it is}} now restricted to Europe. The label, however, continues to lose popularity as a scientific designation.|$|R
40|$|The {{described}} stone artifacts are {{recovered from}} the 70 m-high terrace (4600 m a. s. l.) at the southeastern shore of the Siling Co on the northern Tibetan Plateau. The terrace was formed during the Interstadial period before the LGM, ca. 40 - 30 ka B. P. based on paleoenvironmental research. The <b>Paleoliths</b> from the Siling Co provide evidence for early human occupation of the northern Tibetan Plateau. They show technological and typological affinities with the European Middle Paleolithic suggesting that the early human occupation here might relate to migratory waves during the Late Pleistocene that dispersed humans across the Old World. © 2007 Science in China Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|A small <b>paleolith</b> {{was found}} in gravel at Skellingthorpe by Randall Davies and {{presented}} to the British Museum in 1922, hinting at some ancient tribe in the area. The earliest origins of the village are unknown. The area was probably marshland and woodland {{in the time of}} the Romans, and {{there is no evidence of}} any permanent settlement by the ancient Britons, although it is possible that nomadic forest or swamp dwellers occasionally passed through. Roman engineers building the canal now called the Foss Dyke would have been in the vicinity [...] This is evidenced by the discovery of a Roman bowl in the parish, an image of which now features on the village sign. Other Roman-era discoveries have been made: a copper alloy bell was found to the east of the village in Main Drain, and thirteen coins (dated to the third or fourth century) were unearthed in 1978.|$|E

The paper {{deals with the}} development of this discipline of science from methodology of in situ works over evaluation of measured data to practise presentation and confrontation the results with reality. These could be documented at a number of examples from problems of open and bastion settlements, necropolises, sacred and castle architecture, municipal historical centres, productive equipment atc...|$|E
40|$|Jingchuan human fossil, {{found in}} Gansu Province in 1976, {{was given a}} {{preliminary}} report in 1984, but questions remained concerning the age and character of the fossil. We conducted field investigation at Jingchuan in May of 2006 to examine the stratum yielding the human fossil and to obtain sediment samples for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. Three samples collected from different stratigraphic levels at the fossil locality yielded OSL dates of 15, 48 and 7. 9 thousand years ago (ka), respectively. Taking stratum study, mammalian fossils and <b>paleoliths</b> into consideration, the OLS date of 15 - 48 ka {{appears to be more}} close to the true age of Jingchuan cranium. There is no distinct difference between the fossil cranium and modern craniums in terms of the traits analyzed, so the relatively modern traits of the Jingchuan cranium do not contradict with its age. Principal components analysis shows that the Jingchuan cranium may be somewhat primitive. © 2010 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with changes in settlement strategy of the hunther-gatherer communities throughout late <b>paleolith</b> and mesolith. The aim of the thesis is to present the changes of settlement strategy in the relation to the sharp changes in natural environment {{at the turn of}} the pleistocene and holocene period. The thesis examines this issue in a wider context of Bohemia, whereas particular locations of the sites are illustrated on the example of Sloupnice region. In the region of Eastern Bohemia, we can verify through observation our postulate that the mesolithic locations had changed significantly, in comparison to late paleolithic, because usually the sites with late paleolithic settlement show no signs of mesolithics settlement (exceptions notwithstanding). The thesis presents a base for creation of a predictive model of appearance of preneolithic settlement, using a Geographic Information Systems. The work also includes phenomenological observation of the landscape, enhancing our insight about hunther-gatherer landscape. As an example of possible public presentation of this research, the final chapter describes a proposal of a footpath with informational boards on the topic of this thesis...|$|E
