50|$|Contact with oils in mango leaves, stems, sap, {{and skin}} can cause {{dermatitis}} and anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals. Those {{with a history}} of contact dermatitis induced by urushiol (an allergen found in poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac) may be most at risk for mango contact dermatitis. Cross-reactions may occur between mango allergens and urushiol. During the primary ripening season of mangoes, contact with mango plant parts is {{the most common cause of}} <b>plant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in Hawaii. However, sensitized individuals are still able to safely eat peeled mangos or drink mango juice.|$|E
40|$|Background: Plants are {{ubiquitous}} {{in nature and}} are essential for human life, though some do have detrimental effects. In India, there are various indigenous and foreign plants that are well known to cause dermatitis, Parthenium hysterophorus being the foremost. Aims of the Study: To study the clinical features of patients presenting with <b>plant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and evaluate plant allergen series patch test results. Materials and Methods: 50 patients with suspected <b>plant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> were evaluated regarding evolution of dermatitis, precipitating factors and contact with various plants. 31 patients (62 %) complained of photo sensitivity and 24 (48 %) had involvement of sun-exposed areas. Our provisional diagnoses included allergic contact dermatitis in 16, air borne contact dermatitis in 9, phytophotodermatitis in 7, photodermatitis in 6, airborne contact dermatitis to other causes in 4, phytodermatitis in 3. Patients were patch tested with Indian standard series of allergens as well as plant allergen series consisting of common allergenic plants of local flora in and around Manipal and also with plants strongly suspected by the patient. 35 tested positive with maximum positives (26 patients, i. e., 52 %) to Parthenium hysterophorus (Compositae). Results: The result of patch testing was correlated with the history and clinical examination and relevance established. Conclusions: Majority of the patients with clinically suspected <b>plant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> belonged to 3 rd or 4 th decade and Parthenium was the leading plant allergen Sensitization to Leguminosae plants and Hopea ponga, seen in 9 cases, have not been reported earlier in literature...|$|E
40|$|Forty-seven {{cases of}} {{suspected}} <b>plant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> were patch tested with extracts of various plants. Twenty-six showed positive patch tests {{to one or}} more plant antigens. Parthenium sensitivity was observed in nine cases. Trianthema monogyna, Carissa, carandus, Amaranthus viridis, Amaranthus spinosus, Euphorbia hirta, Euphorbia thymibolia, Salvia plebia, lantana camera and pennisetum typhoides were other important plants founds to be responsible for contact sensitivity.

40|$|Objective: To {{summarize}} evidence {{regarding the}} effectiveness, efficacy, {{and safety of}} off-label azathioprine use in dermatology. Data Sources: We searched the MEDLINE (1950 - 2009), EMBASE (1980 - 2009), and CENTRAL (1996 - 2009) databases on October 9, 2009. The main search terms were azathioprine and its synonyms. No restrictions were imposed regarding publication date. Only articles in English, French, German, or Dutch were included. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials, cohorts, and case series concerning the use of azathioprine in an off-label dermatologic setting were independently assessed for eligibility by 2 coauthors. The search retrieved 3870 articles, and 148 articles were selected for detailed review. Data Extraction: Forty-three articles matching the inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed for methodologic quality by 2 reviewers independently, including an evaluation of components associated with biased estimates of treatment effect. Data Synthesis: High-quality evidence (level A) was found for a moderate therapeutic effect in severe atopic dermatitis. Evidence of moderate quality (level B) was found for efficacy in parthenium <b>dermatitis</b> (an airborne <b>plant</b> allergen contact <b>dermatitis),</b> bullous pemphigoid, chronic actinic dermatitis, and leprosy type 1 reaction. Furthermore, favorable therapeutic effects existed for erythema multiforme, lichen planus, and pityriasis rubra pilaris, although the quality of evidence was low (level C). Conclusions: A strong clinical recommendation was given for azathioprine in atopic dermatitis. Conclusions regarding safety in an off-label setting {{could not be reached}} because of scarce and incomplete data (level C evidence). Long-term registries and prospective studies could add to the existing evidence and provide legal support for off-label drug use in dermatology. Arch Dermatol. 2011; 147 (4) : 474 - 48...|$|R
40|$|A {{hitherto}} unrecognized {{cause of}} contact dermatitis in California is the widely cultivated plant known as Algerian ivy. This plant, which grows in California (and its close relative, English ivy) causes a dermatitis {{which is similar}} to although milder than that caused by poison oak. Dermatitis from this cause occurs most frequently when persons who have become sensitive to it by previous contact trim the plant back in the spring after its seasonal spurt of growth. For persons whose occupations require repeated contact with the <b>plant,</b> <b>dermatitis</b> from this cause is an occupational hazard. Dermatitis from this plant is easily diagnosed by means of a simple patch test...|$|E
40|$|Parthenium {{dermatitis}} is an immuno-inflammatory disease {{caused by}} Parthenium hysterophorus {{and is the}} commonest cause of <b>plant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in India. It is caused by airborne dry and friable plant particles including trichomes, {{and the most important}} allergens responsible for allergic contact dermatitis are sesquiterpene lactones. The combined type IV and type I hypersensitivity to parthenium has been recently postulated. In sensitized individuals, it can cause a spectrum of clinical patterns, such as classical airborne pattern, chronic actinic dermatitis-like presentation, mixed pattern dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, widespread dermatitis, and other rare patterns. There is definite trend towards change from airborne pattern to chronic actinic pattern in natural history of parthenium dermatitis. Contact sensitivity to parthenium is everlasting, and hence the disease runs a chronic course with exacerbation during summers. Patch testing with acetone or aqueous plant extract is the simplest way of confirming parthenium contact allergy. Management includes avoiding contact with allergen, managing dermatitis with topical corticosteroids/tacrolimus, and other immunosupressives like azathioprine. In future, we expect parthenium dermatitis to become less prevalent due to rapid urbanization and possible development of new biological methods to eradicate the parthenium. Genetic factors associated with susceptibility to parthenium dermatitis need to be studied...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patch {{testing is}} a {{definitive}} tool for diagnosing {{allergic contact dermatitis}} (ACD). It reveals the prevalence and trends of contact sensitization in the community, thereby {{paving the way for}} better standard series. There is paucity of large series of patch-tested patients from India. Aim: To report the 9 -year patch-test data from a single general dermatology centre in North India. Methods: Consecutive patients presenting with signs/symptoms of suspected ACD were patch tested from May 1997 to April 2006. The Indian Standard Series was used. Parthenium was tested only in selected patients and cetrimide and chloroxylenol were added to the series. Results: In total, records of 1000 patients (566 male, 434 female) were analyzed, yielding 1155 positive reactions in 590 (59 &#x 0025;) patients. Footwear dermatitis was the commonest suspected diagnosis, followed by ACD to medicaments, cosmetic dermatitis and <b>plant</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Out of the allergens that were tested in all the patients, positivity to nickel was the commonest (12. 9 &#x 0025;), followed by potassium dichromate (11. 1 &#x 0025;) neomycin (7 &#x 0025;), mercaptobenzthiazole (6. 6 &#x 0025;), nitrofurazone (6 &#x 0025;), colophony (5. 7 &#x 0025;), fragrance mix (5. 5 &#x 0025;) and cobalt chloride (5. 4 &#x 0025;). However, parthenium was the commonest allergen based on the proportion of patients tested with it (14. 5 &#x 0025;). In men, potassium dichromate (30 &#x 0025;) was the commonest sensitizer and in women, nickel (43 &#x 0025;) was the commonest to show patch-test positivity. Conclusion: Our study revealed higher prevalence of footwear and medicament dermatitis in comparison to existing data. Allergy to antiseptics is significant in our patients. Further collaborative studies involving patients from other parts of India are required to have an overall view of ACD in India...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of ethnopharmacological, phytochemical and biological activities investigations on Opilia celtidifolia (Guill. & Perr.) Endl. ex Walp (Opiliaceae), Cola cordifolia(Cav.) R. Br. (Sterculiaceae), and Erythrina senegalensis DC (Fabaceae), three plants used in traditional medicine in Mali to cure various types of diseases. The first part of this thesis deals with the results of ethnopharmacological surveys performed to identify the traditional uses of these plants. These studies covered different areas of Mali (Siby Dioila, Kolokani, Dogonland, and Koutiala) and their results showed extended uses of the plants. O. celtidifolia was mostly identified by traditional healers as an anti malaria, appetizer, and anti <b>dermatitis</b> <b>plant</b> and C. cordifolia was reported to cure gastritis, skin inflammation, wounds, malaria, high blood pressure, overweight and other diseases as well. The ethnopharmacological information of E. senegalensis was related mostly to amenorrhoea, bilharzias and other types of infections, malaria and jaundice. The fidelity level among traditional healers from the same area about the most reported diseases was calculated. A high healer agreement (75 %) was found about the use of O. celtidifolia against dermatitis in Siby, against malaria in Dioila (61 %), and abdominal pain (54 %) in the same area. The use of E. senegalensis against amenorrhoea meets 21 % of agreement between Dioila and Kolokani. The second part of this thesis {{presents the}} results of structural and immunological properties investigations of pectic polysaccharide fractions isolated from the water 50 ˚C extract of O. celtidifolia and C. cordifolia. These plants were previously reported to be used to treat internal and external chronic wounds. It is known from the literature that the plants which are used against wounds and other immune related diseases in traditional medicine are likely to contain immunomodulatory compounds, and polysaccharides are largely reported to be responsible of these activities. Two acidic polysaccharide fractions were isolated from the leaves extract of O. celtidifolia,Oc 50 A 1 and Oc 50 A 2. They showed, strong complement fixing ability, the ICH 50 values were 0. 5 and 0. 9 g/ml respectively; nitric oxide release ability from activated macrophages, a concentration of 100 g/ml induced the release of about 7. 3 M of NO. The fractions induced 14 and 24 % respectively of proliferation of T cells at 50 g/ml and moderate B cell activation property at 100 g/ml as well. Analysis of the monosaccharide composition of Oc 50 A 1 and Oc 50 A 2 showed the presence of arabinose (26. 7 and 13. 2 %), galactose (31. 5 and 28 %) and galacturonic acid (5. 3 and 7. 8 %) respectively. The Yariv test confirmed the presence of arabinogalactan type II in both fractions. Structural analyses did also show the presence of terminal and 1 - 4 linked galacturonic acid and terminal and 1 - 2 linked rhamnose. Endo-polygalacturonanase treatment was performed to isolate the heavily substituted parts of the polysaccharides. These parts contained the same monosaccharides in similar proportion, and showed stronger dose dependent complement fixing activity and also stimulated macrophages to release nitrite oxide. A pectic polysaccharide Cc 50 - 1 with a molecular weight between 1000 and 2000 kDa was isolated from C. cordifolia. Monosaccharide composition and linkages analysis showed the presence of unusual type of monomers. 20 % of terminally and 3 -linked 2 -O-methyl galactose, 18 % of terminally linked 4 -O-methyl glucuronic acid and 2 % of 2 -O-methyl fucose were identified. These monomers seem to be linked to a RGI like backbone composed of 20 % of 2, 3 - and 2, 4 -linked rhamnose almost equal amount, which alternate with 24 % of 4 -linked galacturonic acid some of which also carry side chains. This polysaccharide showed low complement fixing ability with an ICH 50 value of 480 g/ml. Viscosity measurement gave a Huggins constant value of K´= 1. 2 which indicated the presence of aggregated particles when Cc 50 - 1 is dissolved in water based solvents. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, results of phytochemical and biological investigations on low molecular weight compounds isolated from E. senegalensis are presented. A new pterocarpan named Erybraedin F and six known ones, erybraedin A, C, D, eryvarin K, phaseollin and shinpterocarpin and a flavone, carpachromene were isolated from the dichloromethane extracts of the root and stem bark. The pterocarpans showed 15 -lipoxygenase enzyme inhibition activity. The IC 50 values ranged between 32 and 82 M. Erybraedin D (IC 50 < 32) was stronger enzyme inhibitor than quercetin (IC 50 = 42 M). Erybraedin A, D, C and eryvarin K also showed positive inhibition results on Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds is in good agreement with literature data. These compounds although reported before in the genus Erythrina are for the first time here reported in the species E. senegalensis and the first time reported to have 15 -LO inhibition activity...|$|R
