25|$|Once Baekeland's {{heat and}} {{pressure}} patents expired in 1927, Bakelite Corporation faced serious {{competition from other}} companies. Because molded Bakelite incorporated fillers to give it strength, it tended {{to be made in}} concealing dark colors. In 1927, beads, bangles and earrings were produced by the Catalin Company, through a different process which enabled them to introduce 15 new colors. Translucent jewelry, poker chips and other items made of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> were introduced in the 1930s or 1940s by the Catalin Company under the Prystal name. The creation of marbled <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> may also be attributable to the Catalin Company.|$|E

25|$|The major uses of phenol, {{consuming}} {{two thirds}} of its production, involve its conversion to precursors for plastics. Condensation with acetone gives bisphenol-A, a key precursor to polycarbonates and epoxide resins. Condensation of phenol, alkylphenols, or diphenols with formaldehyde gives <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins,</b> a famous example of which is Bakelite. Partial hydrogenation of phenol gives cyclohexanone, a precursor to nylon. Nonionic detergents are produced by alkylation of phenol to give the alkylphenols, e.g., nonylphenol, which are then subjected to ethoxylation.|$|E
40|$|After {{blending}} the triblock copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide-b-propylene oxide-b-ethylene oxide) (PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO) with novolac-type <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin,</b> Fourier transform {{infrared spectroscopy}} {{revealed that the}} ether groups of the PEO block were stronger hydrogen bond acceptors for the OH groups of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> than were the ether groups of the PPO block. Thermal curing with hexamethylenetetramine as the curing agent resulted in the triblock copolymer being incorporated into the <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin,</b> forming a nanostructure through a mechanism involving reaction-induced microphase separation. Mild pyrolysis conditions led to {{the removal of the}} PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO triblock copolymer and formation of mesoporous <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin.</b> This approach provided a variety of composition-dependent nanostructures, including disordered wormlike, body-centered-cubic spherical and disorder micelles. The regular mesoporous novolac-type <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> was formed only at a phenolic content of 40 – 60 wt %, the result of an intriguing balance of hydrogen bonding interactions among the <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> and the PEO and PPO segments of the triblock copolymer...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it has been}} {{reported}} that <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> treatment is effective in preventing biodeterioration, improving the mechanical properties, as well as the dimensional stability of the timber [3 – 6].

Not much research has been conducted to investigate the effect of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> impregnation into wood with a thickness greater than veneer, such as lamina. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> impregnation into wood with a thickness greater than veneer, as it was predicted that the use of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> treatment to improve the properties of timber would increase rapidly in the near future [7].|$|R

25|$|Amber can be {{classified}} into several forms. Most fundamentally, {{there are two types}} of plant resin with the potential for fossilization. Terpenoids, produced by conifers and angiosperms, consist of ring structures formed of isoprene (C5H8) units. <b>Phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> are today only produced by angiosperms, and tend to serve functional uses. The extinct medullosans produced a third type of resin, which is often found as amber within their veins. The composition of resins is highly variable; each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes. There is also a separate classification of amber gemstones, according to the way of production.|$|E

The results indicated the following: (1) The optimal added amount of organic ester should be 25 wt. %- 30 wt. % of alkaline <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> and it must be above 20 wt. %- 50 wt. % of the organic ester hydrolysis amount. (2) High-speed ester A (propylene carbonate) has a higher curing speed than 1, 4 -butyrolactone, and they were both used as high-speed esters. Glycerol diacetate is not a high-speed ester in alkaline <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> although it was used as a high-speed ester in ester cured sodium silicate sand; glycerol diacetate and glycerol triacetate can be used as medium-speed esters in alkaline <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin.</b> (3) High-speed ester A, medium-speed ester B (glycerol triacetate) and low-speed ester C (dibasic ester, i. e., DBE) should be used below 15 ìC, 35 ìC and 50 ìC, respectively. High-speed ester A or low-speed ester C should not be used alone but mixed with medium-speed ester B to improve the strength of the resin sand.
