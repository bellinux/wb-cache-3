40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{innovation}} is to use microstrain gauges to monitor minute changes in temperature along with material properties of the metal cans and pouches used {{in the construction of}} <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cells.</b> The sensitivity of the microstrain gauges to extremely small changes in temperatures internal to the cells makes them a valuable asset in controlling the hazards in <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cells.</b> The test program on <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cells</b> included various cell configurations, including the pouch type configurations. The thermal properties of microstrain gauges have been found to contribute significantly as safety monitors in <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cells</b> that are designed even with hard metal cases. Although the metal cans do not undergo changes in material property, even under worst-case unsafe conditions, the small changes in thermal properties observed during charge and discharge of the cell provide an observable change in resistance of the strain gauge. Under abusive or unsafe conditions, the change in the resistance is large. This large change is observed as a significant change in slope, and this can be used to prevent cells from going into a thermal runaway condition. For flexible metal cans or pouch-type <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cells,</b> combinations of changes in material properties along with thermal changes can be used as an indication for the initiation of an unsafe condition. <b>Lithium-ion</b> <b>cells</b> have a very high energy density, no memory effect, and almost 100 -percent efficiency of charge and discharge. However, due to the presence of a flammable electrolyte, along with the very high energy density and the capability of releasing oxygen from the cathode, these cells can go into a hazardous condition of venting, fire, and thermal runaway. Commercial <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cells</b> have current and voltage monitoring devices that are used to control the charge and discharge of the batteries. Some <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cells</b> have internal protective devices, but when used in multi-cell configurations, these protective devices either do not protect or are themselves a hazard to the cell due to their limitations. These devices do not help in cases where the cells develop high impedance that suddenly causes them to go into a thermal runaway condition. Temperature monitoring typically helps with tracking the performance of a battery. But normal thermistors or thermal sensors do not provide the accuracy needed for this and cannot track a change in internal cell temperatures until it is too late to stop a thermal runaway...|$|R

40|$|In this program, two {{different}} approaches were undertaken {{to improve the}} role of electrolyte at low temperature performance - through the improvement in (i) ionic conductivity and (ii) interfacial behavior. Several different types of electrolytes were prepared to examine the feasibil. ity of using these new electrolytes in rechargeable <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cells</b> in the temperature range of + 40 °C to - 40 °C.

50|$|If {{overheated}} or overcharged, Li-ion batteries {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture. In extreme cases this {{can lead to}} leakage, explosion or fire. To reduce these risks, many <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cells</b> (and battery packs) contain fail-safe circuitry that disconnects the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range of 3-4.2 V per cell. or when overcharged or discharged. Lithium battery packs, whether constructed by a vendor or the end-user, without effective battery management circuits are susceptible to these issues. Poorly designed or implemented battery management circuits also may cause problems; it is difficult to be certain that any particular battery management circuitry is properly implemented. <b>Lithium-ion</b> <b>cells</b> are very susceptible to damage outside the allowed voltage range that is typically within (2.5 to 3.65) V for most LFP cells. Exceeding this voltage range, even by small voltages (millivolts) results in premature aging of the cells and, furthermore, results in safety risks due to the reactive components in the cells. When stored for long periods the small current draw of the protection circuitry may drain the battery below its shutoff voltage; normal chargers may then be useless since the BMS may retain a record of this battery (or charger) 'failure'.

This thesis focuses on the several advanced developments that are taking place in the field of advanced sensors and monitoring of lithium-ion batteries, and what the aims are of the research projects demonstrating the key goals, benefits, and advancements. Fundamental research allowed understanding <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cells,</b> and how cells can be affected with different conditions. The experimental measurements taken were temperature and strain with the use of sensors. The sensors used to measure the strain was with strain gauges and the temperature with 2 different types of sensor analogue and digital.

The results have shown the characteristics during charge and discharge, and the homogeneous temperature across the cell. The results show the homogeneous temperature can be affected but it was not an incredibly large difference. The expected behaviour can be seen throughout the test results; however, the behaviour during the beginning of each charge showed an endothermic cooling effect taking place due to the chemical reaction, whereas during discharge it was exothermic. The results have shown that an active battery management system to function with the temperature sensors would be beneficial, allowing for advancements in <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>cell</b> technology. Overall, the results show the experimental tests have been successful with different sensors, especially with monitoring the temperature change...|$|R
