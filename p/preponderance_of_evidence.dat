5|$|Finally, the Supreme Court {{majority}} {{upheld the}} validity of {{another aspect of the}} law as enacted by Congress: that the government could assume that a potentially expatriating act had been performed voluntarily and that any claim that a person had acted under duress was up to the person involved to establish by <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{then turned}} {{its attention to}} the question of a standard of proof in loss-of-citizenship cases. Terrazas had argued and the 7th Circuit had agreed that the 14th Amendment, as interpreted in Afroyim, had left Congress without any constitutional authority to set the standard of proof for intent to relinquish citizenship at a level any lower than one of clear and convincing evidence. The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a standard of <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> (more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of US citizenship were involved.|$|E
25|$|This is {{also the}} {{standard}} of proof used when determining eligibility of unemployment benefits for a former employee accused of losing the job through alleged misconduct. In most US states, the employer must prove this case with a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E

25|$|Tort law is {{different}} from criminal law in that: (1) torts may result from negligent as well as intentional or criminal actions and (2) tort lawsuits have a lower burden of proof such as <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. Sometimes a plaintiff may prevail in a tort case even if the person who allegedly caused harm was acquitted in an earlier criminal trial. For example, O. J. Simpson was acquitted in criminal court of murder but later found liable for the tort of wrongful death.|$|E
25|$|In {{the vaccine}} court, as in civil tort cases, {{the burden of}} proof is a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> but while in tort cases, this is met by expert {{testimony}} establishing a rigorous scientific case, in the vaccine court, the burden is met with a three prong test: the petitioner must present a biological theory of harm, a logical sequence of events connecting the vaccine to the injury, and establish an appropriate time frame in which injury occurred; the petitioner must also show that there is not another biologically plausible explanation for the injury.|$|E
25|$|The Freedmen {{were listed}} on the Dawes Rolls. Some {{descendants}} can prove by documentation in other registers that they had ancestors with Creek blood. The Freedmen had been listed on a separate register, regardless of their proportion of Creek ancestry. This classification did not acknowledge the unions and intermarriage {{that had taken place}} for years between the ethnic groups. Prior to the change in code, Creek Freedmen could use existing registers and the <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> to establish qualification for citizenship, and were to be aided by the Citizenship Board. The Creek Freedmen have challenged their exclusion from citizenship in legal actions which are pending.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court {{took the}} case and heard oral {{argument}} almost a year later. It handed down its decision early in 1977. On the jurisdictional question, Rehnquist held that although the school district had been created by state law, it was primarily a local entity and thus {{beyond the reach of}} the Eleventh Amendment, its first ruling in that area in 86 years. The Court did not, however, decide the question of whether Doyle had been fired legally, since there were other incidents suggesting he had difficulties in his relationships with students and fellow teachers which the district had introduced into the record. Instead, it remanded the case to the district court, ordering it to require the district to show by a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that Doyle would have been fired regardless if he had not contacted the radio station. The school district was later able to do so, and in 1982 the Sixth Circuit upheld that decision.|$|E
500|$|Justice Thurgood Marshall {{rejected}} the majority's decision that an intent {{to give up}} citizenship could be established merely by a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> Arguing that [...] "the Court's casual dismissal {{of the importance of}} American citizenship cannot withstand scrutiny," [...] he said that he [...] "would hold that a citizen may not lose his citizenship in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that he intended to do so." ...|$|E
500|$|Vance v. Terrazas, [...] was a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that established that a United States citizen cannot have {{his or her}} citizenship taken away unless {{he or she has}} acted with an intent to give up that citizenship. [...] The Supreme Court overturned portions of an act of Congress which had listed various actions and had said that the performance of any of these actions could be taken as conclusive, irrebuttable proof of intent to give up U.S. citizenship. [...] However, the Court ruled that a person's intent to give up citizenship could be established through a standard of <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> (i.e., more likely than not) — rejecting an argument that intent to relinquish citizenship could only be found on the basis of clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence,</b> {{also known}} as balance of probabilities, is the {{standard}} required in most civil cases and in family court determinations solely involving money, such as child support under the Child Support Standards Act. It is also {{the burden of proof}} of which the defendant must prove affirmative defenses or [...] mitigating circumstances in civil or criminal court. In civil court, aggravating circumstances also only have to be proven by a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence,</b> as opposed to beyond reasonable doubt (as they do in criminal court).|$|R

500|$|The Chicago Police Department had {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} Burge through its Office of Professional Standards (OPS). Known as the Goldston Report (September 28, 1990) for its lead investigator, this internal report determined that [...] "the <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> is that abuse did occur {{and that it was}} systematic." [...] The report [...] "listed the names of fifty alleged victims of torture and brutality, the names of detectives who had been involved, and stated: 'Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end'." [...] The 1990 report was never publicly released, as it was customary to keep such internal investigations private unless and until prosecution took place. But it was the basis of the process of the Police Department's suspension, hearing and firing of Burge in 1991-1993.|$|E

50|$|Huddleston appealed his {{conviction}} to the Sixth Circuit. That court initially reversed the conviction {{because the government}} had not proven by clear and convincing evidence that Huddleston had known that either the televisions or the appliances had been stolen, and thus that those incidents were not admissible against Huddleston in his trial on the videocassette charges. After the Sixth Circuit decided in a different case that courts should prove similar acts <b>evidence</b> by a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence,</b> it upheld Huddleston's conviction because it concluded that the evidence regarding the televisions had been proven by a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{district}} court appointed a special master {{to investigate the}} case. The special master recommended that the case be dismissed because the employees did not establish by a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> {{a violation of the}} Act. [...] The special master concluded that walking time was not traditionally held to be compensable working time in the industry, that the employees had produced no reliable evidence to determine how much time they had lost, and that the employees had not shown that they were forced to wait until starting time.|$|E
2500|$|At 5:00p.m. on Thursday, September 9, CBS News {{released}} a statement saying the memos were [...] "thoroughly investigated by independent experts, and we are convinced of their authenticity", and stating, [...] "this report was not based solely on recovered documents, but rather on a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> including documents that were provided by unimpeachable sources, [...] ".

2500|$|Archaeologists {{said that}} because of Kennewick Man's great age, there was {{insufficient}} evidence to connect him to modern tribes. The great age of the remains makes this discovery scientifically valuable. [...] As archaeologists, forensic specialists, and linguists differed about whether the adult male was of indigenous origin, the standing law, if conclusively found by a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> to be Native American, would give the tribe of the geographic area where he was found a claim to the remains. [...] New evidence could still emerge in defense of tribal claims to ancestry, but emergent evidence may require more sophisticated and precise methods of determining genetic descent, given {{that there was no}} cultural evidence accompanying the remains.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> is the {{standard}} of proof used for immunity from prosecution under Florida's controversial stand-your-ground law. The defense must present its evidence in a pre-trial hearing, show that the statutory prerequisites have been met, and then request that the court grant a motion for declaration of immunity. The judge must then decide from the <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> whether to grant immunity. This is a far lower burden than [...] "beyond a reasonable doubt," [...] the threshold a prosecutor must meet at any proceeding criminal trial, but higher than the [...] "probable cause" [...] threshold generally required for indictment.|$|R

40|$|The paper takes {{a closer}} look at the role <b>of</b> {{knowledge}} and <b>evidence</b> in legal theory. In particular, the paper examines a puzzle arising from the evidential standard <b>Preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Evidence</b> and its application in civil procedure. Legal scholars have argued since at least the 1940 s that the rule <b>of</b> the <b>Preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Evidence</b> gives rise to a puzzle concerning the role <b>of</b> statistical <b>evidence</b> in judicial proceedings, sometimes referred to as the Problem <b>of</b> Bare Statistical <b>Evidence.</b> While this puzzle has led to the development of a multitude of accounts and approaches in the legal literature, I argue here that the problem can be resolved fairly straightforwardly within a knowledge-first framework...|$|R
2500|$|Brandeis, however, {{discovered}} that earlier Supreme Court cases limited {{the rights of}} contract when the contract had [...] "a real or substantial relation to public health or welfare." [...] He therefore decided {{that the best way}} to present the case would be to demonstrate through an abundance of workplace facts, [...] "a clear connection between the health and morals of female workers" [...] and the hours that they were required to work. To accomplish this, he filed what has become known today as the [...] "Brandeis Brief." [...] It was a much shorter than traditional briefs, yet included more than a hundred pages of documentation, including social worker reports, medical conclusions, factory inspector observations, and other expert testimonials, which together showed a <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that [...] "when women worked long hours, it was destructive to their health and morals." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{problems}} with Dershowitz's {{heavy reliance on}} Morris. The first is that Morris is hardly the left-wing peacenik that Dershowitz makes him out to be, which means that calling him as a witness in Israel's defense is not very helpful to the case. The more important problem {{is that many of}} the points Dershowitz cites Morris as supporting—that the early Zionists wanted peaceful coexistence with the Arabs, that the Arabs began the 1948 War to destroy Israel, that the Arabs were guilty of many massacres while the Israelis were scrupulous about protecting human rights, and that the Arabs fled at the behest of their leaders rather than being ethnically cleansed by the Israel Defense Forces—turn out to be based on a partial reading or misreading of Morris's books.

2500|$|For centuries, {{scientists}} had debated between two possible theories of light: {{was it a}} wave or did it instead comprise a stream of tiny particles? [...] By the 19th century, the debate was generally considered to have been settled {{in favor of the}} wave theory, as it was able to explain observed effects such as refraction, diffraction, interference and polarization. James Clerk Maxwell had shown that electricity, magnetism and light are all manifestations of the same phenomenon: the electromagnetic field. Maxwell's equations, which are the complete set of laws of classical electromagnetism, describe light as waves: a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Because of the <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> in favor of the wave theory, Einstein's ideas were met initially with great skepticism. Eventually, however, the photon model became favored. One of the most significant pieces of evidence in its favor was its ability to explain several puzzling properties of the photoelectric effect, described in the following section. Nonetheless, the wave analogy remained indispensable for helping to understand other characteristics of light: diffraction, refraction and interference.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{defines the}} <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> {{standard}} and establishes it as a benchmark, optimal under certain idealized conditions.

Concerning the definition <b>of</b> <b>preponderance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence,</b> a distinction is made between standards based on probability of guilt and standards based on the evidence. It is stressed that the latter does not include ex ante information concerning the offender’s type, and should hence not be associated with a probability of guilt in a Bayesian sense. 1...|$|R
