5|$|A 1TB Forza Motorsport 6 bundle was {{released}} on September 15, 2015, which features blue-colored hardware with racing stripes and a push-button start-inspired design around the <b>power</b> <b>button,</b> and customized hardware sound effects.|$|E
5|$|Several {{problems}} were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported {{issue is that}} the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested {{that this is a}} hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the <b>power</b> <b>button</b> making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have been fixed by software updates.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} models, the handheld has two VGA (0.3-megapixel) digital cameras. The {{first is}} on the internal hinge and points toward the user; the second {{is on the}} outer casing and faces away from the user. The SD card slot is also new, set behind a cover on the right side. While the DS Lite used a switch, the DSi, like the original Nintendo DS, features a button to power on or off. The button has extra functions and unlike the original's <b>power</b> <b>button,</b> it {{is located on the}} bottom-left side of the touchscreen. Brightness and volume controls are on the left side; five brightness settings—one more than on the DS Lite—are available. The headset port is on the bottom.|$|E

5|$|The HTC One (codenamed and retroactively called M7) is a touchscreen-based Android {{smartphone}} designed, developed, {{and manufactured}} by HTC. The smartphone was unveiled on 19 February 2013 at press events in New York City and London and is HTC’s seventh flagship smartphone. It is {{the successor to}} the company’s 2012 flagship model, the One X—which was critically acclaimed, but commercially unsuccessful {{due in part to}} insufficient marketing efforts. To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a unibody aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom image sensor and the ability to automatically generate montages of media, an updated version of HTC’s Sense user experience, BlinkFeed—an aggregator of news and social network content, and an electronic program guide app with the ability to serve as a universal remote via an IR blaster located in the device’s <b>power</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
5|$|The camera app {{includes}} a new shooting mode known as Zoe (alluding to the zoetrope), which captures a short video alongside each photo taken. Individual frames {{can be saved}} from the clip, while the frames {{can also be used}} with other editing features such as Sequence Shot (which superimposes multiple frames into a composite image). Photos taken in Zoe mode are also displayed with animated thumbnails in the gallery. The Highlights feature can automatically generate a montage video from photos and videos with multiple theme and soundtrack options. The resulting video can be exported, or posted online through the HTC Share service (where they are accessible for 30 days). A television guide app is also provided, which incorporates remote control functionality via an infrared blaster hidden in the One’s <b>power</b> <b>button,</b> show recommendations powered by Peel, and the ability to display show reminders as stories on BlinkFeed. An updated music app now {{includes a}} visualizer and support for on-screen lyrics. An updated version of the Get Started feature (as introduced by HTC One X+) allows users to perform initial setup for their One via a web-based service, while a new Sync Manager allows data to be migrated from iOS device backups or HTC devices with Android 4.0 and higher. As with all devices in the One series, 25GB of Dropbox storage is available free for two years. Using NFC, the One can also share content between other compatible Android devices with Android Beam, and conduct mobile payments where compatible systems (such as FeliCa in Japan) are available.|$|E
25|$|System Management Controller is {{a custom}} Apple chip that {{controls}} various {{functions of the}} computer related to power management, including handling the <b>power</b> <b>button,</b> management of battery and thermal sensors, among others. It also plays {{a part in the}} protection scheme deployed to restrict booting macOS to Apple hardware (see Digital Rights Management below).|$|E
5|$|On April 28, 2014, Apple {{initiated}} an out of warranty recall {{program to}} replace any failing <b>power</b> <b>buttons</b> of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.|$|R
5000|$|Instant <b>power</b> off <b>button</b> {{in a hole}} (needed a thin metal tool to press) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{download}} mode allows {{to directly}} write data to partitions via USB, e.g., to the recovery partition. In order {{to trigger the}} download mode on the Galaxy S 4, the Volume Down and <b>Power</b> <b>buttons</b> must be pressed. We used the tool Heimdall [34] to write the BMA via the USB interface to the device’s recovery partition in this mode.|$|R
25|$|The blue LEDs {{also show}} how much battery power {{remains on the}} Wii Remote. By {{pressing}} any button, besides the <b>power</b> <b>button</b> while the controller is not being used to play games, {{a certain number of}} the four blue LEDs will light up, showing the battery life: four of the LEDs flash when it is at, or near, full power. Three lights flash when it is at 75%, two lights when at 50%, and one light flashes when there is 25% or less power remaining.|$|E
25|$|The 350-16 had an {{interesting}} bug where, occasionally, the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS just didn't start. The solution was {{to turn on the}} machine at the mains and hold down the <b>power</b> <b>button</b> for 30 seconds, at which point it would normally start. It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350-40, which had a different PSU.|$|E
25|$|The Nintendo 3DS input {{controls}} {{include the}} following: a round nub analog input called the Circle Pad, a D-pad, four face buttons (A, B, X, Y), bumper buttons (L, R), a HOME button, START and SELECT buttons, and a <b>POWER</b> <b>button.</b> It {{also features a}} dedicated volume slider and a wireless switch, which turns on or off wireless communications. The touchscreen can be interacted with either the user's finger or a stylus bundled with the handheld. There is also a six-axis motion sensor, which includes a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. Through the Circle Pad Pro accessory the system has access to a second Circle Pad and trigger buttons (ZL, ZR).|$|E
2500|$|The tablet {{portion of}} the Transformer Book Duet is [...] thick with a 13.3 inch [...] touch screen {{available}} in 1366×768 or 1920×1080 resolution. The back of the screen is a rubberized black plastic, with the volume and <b>power</b> <b>buttons</b> embedded at the top right of the lid. It has a detachable black chiclet keyboard with a key to switch between Windows and Android.|$|R
40|$|Today’s datacenters {{are often}} built {{of a large}} number of {{commodity}} hardware components. A number of common tasks including operating system installation, hardware and OS–level troubleshooting require low-level control of the machines’ console and <b>power</b> <b>buttons,</b> yet local physical access is not only impractical and error–prone but often impossible. We report on the approach used at CERN for low—level remote management of more than 9000 machines in multiple datacenters...|$|R
500|$|On April 28, 2014, Apple {{initiated}} an out of warranty recall {{program to}} replace any failing <b>power</b> <b>buttons</b> of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost. On August 23, 2014, Apple announced {{a program to}} replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that [...] "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" [...] which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.|$|R
500|$|To {{accommodate}} the larger physical {{size of the}} iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the <b>power</b> <b>button</b> {{was moved to the}} side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility. The iPhone 6 features a 6.91Wh (1810mAh) battery, while the iPhone 6 Plus features an 11.1Wh (2915mAh) battery. Unlike the previous model, the rear-facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device, and has a slight [...] "bulge" [...] around the lens.|$|E
500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. The rear cover is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The <b>power</b> <b>button</b> contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of the buttons on the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on the bezel (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on the bezel were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie when the phone is held. Alongside the <b>power</b> <b>button,</b> the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, and turned off by double-tapping on the status bar or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". When the phone is off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E
500|$|Apple {{unveiled}} {{fourth generation}} 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models during a press event at their headquarters on October 27, 2016. The models introduced the Touch Bar, a multi-touch enabled OLED strip {{built into the}} top of the keyboard in place of the function keys. They include a sapphire-glass covered Touch ID sensor at the right end of the Touch Bar which doubles as a <b>power</b> <b>button.</b> The models also introduce a [...] "second-generation" [...] butterfly mechanism keyboard that provided more travel than the first iteration implemented on the Retina MacBook. The 13-inch model has a trackpad that is 46% larger than its predecessor while the 15-inch model has a trackpad twice as large as the prior generation.|$|E
50|$|The {{handheld}} features four lettered buttons (X, Y, A, B), a directional pad, and Start, Select, and <b>Power</b> <b>buttons.</b> On {{the top of}} {{the device}} are two shoulder buttons, a game card slot, a stylus holder and a power cable input. The bottom features the Game Boy Advance game card slot. The overall button layout resembles that of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System controller. When using backward compatibility mode on the DS, buttons X and Y and the touchscreen are not used as the Game Boy Advance line of systems do not feature these controls.|$|R
500|$|The Nintendo DSi's {{design is}} similar to that of the second DS iteration, the Nintendo DS Lite. It is {{approximately}} 12 percent shorter (...) than the Nintendo DS Lite when closed, but slightly wider and lighter. The DSi has two [...] TFT-LCD screens— larger than those of previous models—that are capable of displaying 262,144 colors. The touch sensitive lower screen accepts input from the included stylus. The handheld features four lettered buttons (X, Y, A, B), a directional pad, and Start, Select, and <b>Power</b> <b>buttons.</b> Two shoulder buttons, a game card slot, and a power cable input are placed under the console's hinge. The included AC adapter (WAP-002) is not compatible with any other DS model.|$|R
50|$|The Nintendo Switch {{home screen}} has battery, {{internet}} and time {{information in the}} top right corner, and below it is a grid showing downloaded games and cartridge games. Underneath that it has shortcuts to the Nintendo eShop, settings, a <b>power</b> off <b>button</b> and more.|$|R
500|$|Like the Wii, the DSi has {{upgradeable}} firmware, {{and features}} a menu interface that displays applications as selectable icons. The seven primary icons represent [...] "Card Software", [...] "Nintendo DSi Camera", [...] "Nintendo DSi Sound", [...] "Nintendo DSi Shop", [...] "DS Download Play", [...] "PictoChat", and [...] "system settings"; additional applications may be downloaded from the DSi Shop. Icons {{are set in}} a grid navigable with the stylus or D-pad, and may be re-arranged via drag-and-drop. The <b>power</b> <b>button</b> can either soft reset the console, returning it to the main menu, or shut it down. Game cards may be hot swapped when the console is set to the main menu, allowing players to switch game cards without shutting down.|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{generation}} MacBook Pro was announced on October 27, 2016. It replaced the function keys with an interactive, multi-touch [...] "Touch Bar" [...] and a Touch ID sensor {{integrated into the}} <b>Power</b> <b>button.</b> The 15-inch notebook started at $2,399, compared to $1,999 for the previous iteration. On 5 June 2017, Apple upgraded the internals of the MacBook Pro, such as enhanced Iris Plus and AMD Radeon graphics, Kaby Lake processors, and added memory. Additionally, the 13-inch MacBook Pro now comes with a 128GB storage option (down from the base 256GB storage) with a lowered starting price of $1299. All other configurations of the MacBook Pro have the same price as last year, barring the incremental upgrades in processors and graphics.|$|E
500|$|Activision and Konami, who had {{previously}} worked together {{to make sure that}} the Guitar Hero series meets with Konami's patents on music games, developed an arcade console version of the game, titled Guitar Hero Arcade, distributed to arcades in early 2009. [...] The game is completely based on the Guitar Hero III gameplay, but reducing some of the features such as the use of the Whammy bar, Star <b>Power</b> <b>Button</b> (Star Power may only be activated by lifting the Guitar) and Practice Modes, but keeping the ability to download new songs for the cabinet from the Internet. The arcade game has come under some scrutiny by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), who believe the use of the game in arcades is equivalent to [...] "public performances" [...] and seek additional fees to be paid by operators of the game.|$|E
5000|$|The G3's {{exterior}} {{incorporates a}} scratch-resistant [...] "metallic skin"—consisting of polycarbonate finished {{to look and}} feel like brushed metal; despite being branded as [...] "metallic", the G3's exterior does not use actual metal. The finishing is intended primarily to improve grip, {{and to make the}} rear casing less susceptible to fingerprint smudging. The G3 is available in black, white, gold, burgundy, and violet color finishes. Design elements from the G2 are retained by the G3, such as its rear-mounted volume and <b>power</b> <b>buttons.</b> In comparison to the G2, the buttons were given a flatter design with a new, rounded shape. The G3 features a 5.5 in, 1440p quad HD IPS LCD display—the first major [...] "global" [...] smartphone to use such a display. As with the G2, the G3 was designed with minimal screen bezels to ensure a compact form.|$|R
5000|$|PhoneArena {{gave the}} device {{a score of}} 6.5 out of 10. The review noted that {{the small size of}} the device meant that it was easy to hold, and the volume and <b>power</b> <b>buttons</b> were easy to press with tactile feedback. The 3.5 inch display was criticized for its low size and resolution, causing the web {{browsing}} to be [...] "rather uninspiring", and the Sense 4.0 user interface [...] "doesn't look all that pretty" [...] at the screen resolution. Performance was relatively slow due to the entry level processor and 512 MB of RAM, and only 1 GB of the 4 GB of internal storage was accessible for the user. The 5 MP camera was fixed focus but very fast for capturing both photos and videos, and pictures were usually underexposed and noisy in auto shooting mode.|$|R
500|$|Further {{interface}} behavior {{changes are}} made on the April 2014 [...] "Windows 8.1 Update", which are oriented towards non-touch environments (such as desktop and laptop PCs) that use a keyboard and mouse, and improve integration between Windows Store apps and the desktop. When a mouse is in use, the Desktop is shown on startup by default, the Start screen uses context menus instead of a toolbar {{across the bottom of}} the screen for manipulating tiles, an autohiding title bar with minimize and close buttons is displayed within apps at the top of the screen, the taskbar can display and pin apps alongside desktop programs and be accessed from within apps, and visible search and <b>power</b> <b>buttons</b> are added to the Start screen. In non-touch environments, the default image viewer and media player programs were changed back to Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Player in lieu of the Xbox Video and Photos apps.|$|R
500|$|The Retina Display MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} design of the {{previous}} generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys. The most apparent body changes are a thinner chassis and a display with a redesigned hinge and thinner bezel and the removal of the internal optical drive. The <b>power</b> <b>button</b> is moved from the upper right corner of the chassis onto the keyboard, taking the place of the optical disc eject button. At [...] thick, the 15-inch model is 25percent thinner than its predecessor. The model name is no longer placed {{at the bottom of the}} screen bezel; instead, it is found on the underside of the chassis, similar to an iOS device. It is the first Macintosh laptop to not have its model name visible during normal use, as every prior laptop had its model name on the screen bezel or keyboard.|$|E
500|$|RedOctane {{developed}} a new guitar controller for World Tour. [...] The unit is approximately 25% larger than previous controllers, making it closer {{to the size of}} a real guitar. [...] The new controller includes a longer whammy bar and places the Star <b>Power</b> <b>button</b> directly below the strum bar, improving the access of these features. [...] The strum bar itself was made quieter and longer. [...] The neck of the guitar is detachable, similar to the Gibson Les Paul controller for Guitar Hero III, but the connector has been hardened to avoid connection issues experienced with the previous unit. [...] The neck of the guitar features a touch-sensitive pad just toward the body end from the normal five fret buttons. [...] The player can use either the fret buttons or the touch pad to play regular notes. [...] The pad also allows the player to play notes via tapping or via [...] "tap strumming" [...] similar to the slap bass method for bass guitar, and to alter the pitch of sustained notes. [...] Guitar tracks feature notes connected by a semi-transparent purple line, (except for the Wii and PlayStation 2 version, in which semi-transparent gems replace this purple line) called [...] "Slider Gems"; the player can play these notes by sliding their fingers up and down the touch pad or by tapping the fret buttons without strumming. [...] The touchpad can also be used for sustained and staccato notes in the music studio feature while recording guitar, and is used for finer control over loops when recording other instruments.|$|E
500|$|The Verge {{gave the}} HTC One an 8.3 out of 10; {{aside from the}} {{positioning}} of its <b>power</b> <b>button</b> and navigation keys, which {{were considered to be}} hard to reach, its hardware design was praised for having a [...] "totally unique and somehow still understated" [...] look, while its 1080p display was considered {{to be one of the}} sharpest displays on a smartphone—although not bright enough to be seen properly in direct sunlight. In combination with its stereo speakers, the One was considered a good phone for viewing videos and playing games, while its call quality was judged as being sufficient. In regards to performance, the HTC One was considered to be [...] "an impressively powerful phone across the board" [...] due to its high scores on various benchmark tests. Its camera received mixed reviews; while it had better low-light performance than its competitors as advertised, the One’s photos were criticized for looking [...] "soft and mushy" [...] due to extensive post-processing and only looked relatively good at the smaller sizes applied by services such as Facebook and Instagram. The Zoe features were considered unique and useful, but the HTC Share service was panned for being [...] "kind of like Vine, except [...] your clips only last a few months and no one’s ever going to use it." [...] The One was also criticized for its [...] "decidedly average" [...] battery life, and for some of the [...] "unintuitive" [...] design changes that HTC made to the Android UI.|$|E
5000|$|The Palm Pre {{suffered}} from numerous quality issues. The slider mechanism felt loose and could cause wiggle, {{an issue that}} {{became known as the}} [...] "Oreo Twist" [...] by users. Palm aimed to address the issue with the Pre Plus, making the slider mechanism stronger. The curved plastic screen seemed delicate, sometimes cracking from being in a pocket, and there were reports of faulty headphone jacks. On the Palm Pre Plus characters sometimes appeared twice when typing, although the user has only hit the key once. Many reviews noted the poor build quality of the phones. In Engadget's second open letter to Palm, they cited [...] "hardware issues which plagued the Pre, with no outward acknowledgment or rush to correct." [...] They added, [...] "We've seen countless reports, read too many blog posts to recall, and heard all sorts of horror stories about broken sliders, <b>power</b> <b>buttons</b> that stop functioning, the [...] "Oreo cookie" [...] effect, and more. Hell, even our first review unit broke!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Multiple Sonos {{devices in}} a single {{household}} are connected to each other wirelessly or through a wired ethernet network or a mixture of the two. The Sonos system creates a proprietary AES-encrypted peer-to-peer mesh network, known as SonosNet. This allows for each unit to play any chosen input and if desired share it as synchronized audio {{with one or more}} other chosen zones. A single ZonePlayer or ZoneBridge must be wired to a network for access to LAN and Internet audio sources when using this feature, or when creating a 3.1/5.1 surround setup. [...] SonosNet 2.0 integrates MIMO on 802.11n hardware, providing a more robust connection. Sonos does not implement wake-on-wireless technology, instead requiring that every Sonos player or bridge constantly maintains a wireless connection, even when in standby mode or connected by cable. Sonos devices do not have <b>power</b> <b>buttons,</b> and the company claims that each speaker consumes 4-8W in idle/standby.|$|R
