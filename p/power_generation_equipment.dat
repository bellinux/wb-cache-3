25|$|In 1909, {{engineers}} for Great Falls Power Co. proposed building dams at Rainbow Falls (Rainbow Dam) and the Great Falls (Ryan Dam), {{and a third}} dam (Cochrane Dam) {{between the}} other two in a canyon of the Missouri River. In 1914, Montana Power considered raising the height of Black Eagle Dam to increase its power generation capacity. In 1916, much of the Boston and Montana smelter plant {{was replaced by a}} modern copper and zinc smelter, and a wire and cable manufacturing plant was added. But Black Eagle Dam, even with upgrades to its turbines and other <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> <b>equipment,</b> still only generated about three MW of electricity. More power was required. By the early 1920s, the needs of the city of Great Falls had outstripped Black Eagle Dam's ability to generate electricity, and the smelter was planning a new electrolytic zinc manufacturing plant that would require 10 MW of power. By 1925, the north powerhouses were seriously outdated.|$|E

40|$|The {{integrated}} coal-gasification combined-cycle {{approach is}} an efficient process for producing electric power from coal by gasification, followed by high-temperature removal of gaseous impurities, then electricity generation by gas turbines.

40|$|Recently, a {{rapid growth}} of {{generation}} from renewable energy resources, e. g., wind and solar energies, has been witnessed worldwide. Renewable energy offers a number of great appeals due to its sustainability, environmentally friendliness, and as a low-cost resource for the future electricity production. This sector {{is expected to continue}} growing with more installed capacity. Although this sector offers a number of advantages, a large penetration of this sector may result in an unfavourable impact on the system security and reliability. As a result, it has become necessary to include the investigation of such impact in the analyses. This paper primarily focuses on the TTC calculation of a power system with a large penetration of wind <b>power</b> <b>generation.</b> As is known, the impact of the wind <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> is mainly attributed to its uncertain generation output strongly depending on the wind speed. To analyze such impact, the model of wind <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> system is required.

The uncertainty of the forecast demand, forecast generation output from the wind <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> system, <b>equipment</b> unavailability, and fault locations is fully realized and integrated into the calculation by means of a probabilistic method, Monte Carlo simulation.
