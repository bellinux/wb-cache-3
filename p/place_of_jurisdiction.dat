In the 1870s, Dresdner Bank acquired smaller regional institutes and several banks.

Before 1969, it was worn instead of the mozzetta over the rochet by any bishop outside his <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> A symbol of prelacy, but also of limitation, it was therefore always worn by auxiliary bishops (who were never in their own dioceses), by an archbishop only when outside of his province, and by a bishop only when outside of his diocese. Within their own areas of jurisdiction they wore the mozzetta instead. The mantelletta was also worn by cardinals (who wore it under the mozzetta) only when {{in the city of}} Rome, {{as a symbol of the}} cardinal's rank throughout the church (hence they wore only the mozzetta even outside their own dioceses), but in deference to the pope's authority when in his home diocese (thus the only place where they wore the mantelletta).|$|E

40|$|AIM - This {{qualitative}} study expands on female problem gambling by examining short online narratives written by Finnish women. Problem gambling is analysed within the familial context {{in order to}} discover gendered roles and practices, and in relation to substance use and abuse in women’s lives. DESIGN - Two sets of qualitative data were used in this study. The first set was collected from two online discussion forums, and the second set was extracted from an online counselling service data in 2008. Chosen messages formed short narratives of women’s problem gambling trajectory (51 cases). The data were analysed {{in accordance with the}} content analysis method. RESULTS - Women had started gambling either in adolescence or in adulthood. Most of the women played on slot machines or gambled online. The lack of coping skills, stressful events in life and troubled relationships made the women more vulnerable to gambling harms and other addictions. In some couples, partners were either drinking or gambling. This made the women’s lives even more complicated, because they could not count on their partners’ help and support. The women tried to hide the consequences of their problem gambling for fear of losing their significant others. CONCLUSIONS - Female gambling and female problem gambling are complex concepts influenced by social, cultural and political factors. This study has shown in its limited framework that female problem gambling is related to the gambling environment, the social acceptance of gambling and the regulation of gambling operations within the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction...</b>|$|E

500|$|But, Bollman {{held that}} venue for the Neutrality Act charges was {{improper}} in the District of Columbia. First, the Court rejected locus delicti venue (without reaching {{the question of}} whether such could exist outside of a U.S. state). [...] "hat no part of this crime was committed in the district of Columbia is apparent. It is therefore the unanimous opinion of the court that they cannot be tried in this district." [...] Second, the Court rejected statutory venue under section 8 the Crimes Act of 1790 (as permitted by Article Three for crimes not committed within a state). The Court held that the Territory of Orleans was not a place that triggered the alternative venue provisions of the Crimes Act. The Court held that the statutory term [...] "any <b>place</b> out <b>of</b> the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> any particular state" [...] applied only to [...] "any river, haven, bason or bay, not within the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> any particular state," [...] and only in [...] "those cases there is no court which has particular cognizance of the crime." ...|$|R
5000|$|Section 14 also re-enacted {{the venue}} {{provision}} of § 8 of the Crimes Act of 1790, with minor changes in wording.

[...] The 1825 wording appeared to ratify the holding of Ex parte Bollman, which had held that the Territory of Orleans—in which federal territorial courts were constituted—was not a place eligible for alternate venue under the 1790 Act.|$|R
