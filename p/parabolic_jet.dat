40|$|This {{study has}} been mainly {{motivated}} to assess computationally and theoretically the conditional moment closure (CMC) model and the transient flamelet model for the simulation of turbulent nonpremixed flames. These two turbulent combustion models are implemented into the unstructured grid finite volume method that efficiently handles physically and geometrically complex turbulent reacting flows. Moreover, the parallel algorithm has been implemented to improve computational efficiency {{as well as to}} reduce the memory load of the CMC procedure. Example cases include two turbulent CO/H 2 /N 2 jet flames having different flow timescales and the turbulent nonpremixed H 2 /CO flame stabilized on an axisymmetric bluff-body burner. The Lagrangian flamelet model and the simplified CMC formulation are applied to the strongly <b>parabolic</b> <b>jet</b> flame calculation. On the other hand, the Eulerian particle flamelet model and full conservative CMC formulation are employed for the bluff-body flame with flow recirculation. Based on the numerical results, a detailed discussion is given for the comparative performances of the two combustion models in terms of the flame structure and NOx formation characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A jet in {{crossflow}} with an {{inflow ratio}} of 3, {{based on the}} maximum velocity of the <b>parabolic</b> <b>jet</b> profile, is studied numerically. The jet is modeled as an inhomogeneous boundary condition at the crossflow wall. We find two fundamental frequencies, pertaining to self-sustained oscillations in the flow, using full nonlinear direct numerical simulation (DNS) {{as well as a}} modal decomposition into global linear eigenmodes and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes; a high frequency which is characteristic for the shear-layer vortices and the upright vortices in the jet wake, and a low frequency which is dominant in the region downstream of the jet orifice. Both frequencies can be related to a region of reversed flow downstream of the jet orifice. This region is observed to oscillate predominantly in the wall-normal direction with the high frequency, and in the spanwise direction with the low frequency. Moreover, the steady-state solution of the governing Navier–Stokes equations clearly shows the horseshoe vortices and the corresponding wall vortices further downstream, and the emergence of a distinct counter-rotating vortex pair high in the free stream. It is thus found that neither the inclusion of the jet pipe nor unsteadiness is necessary to generate the characteristic counter-rotating vortex pair...|$|E
40|$|Several {{numerical}} {{experiments are}} {{performed in a}} nonlinear, multi-level periodic channel model centered on the equator with different zonally uniform background ﬂows which resemble the South Equatorial Current (SEC). Analy- sis of the simulations focuses on identifying stability criteria for a continuously stratiﬁed ﬂuid near the equator. A 90 m deep frontal layer is required to destabilize a zonally uni- form, 10 ◦ wide, westward surface jet that is symmetric about the equator and has a maximum velocity of 100 cm/s. In this case, the phase velocity of the excited unstable waves {{is very similar to}} the phase speed of the Tropical Instability Waves (TIWs) observed in the eastern Paciﬁc Ocean. The vertical scale of the baroclinic waves corresponds to the frontal layer depth and their phase speed increases as the vertical shear of the jet is doubled. When the westward surface <b>parabolic</b> <b>jet</b> is made asymmetric about the equator, in order to simu- late more realistically the structure of the SEC in the eastern Paciﬁc, two kinds of instability are generated. The oscilla- tions that grow north of the equator have a baroclinic nature, while those generated on and very close to the equator have a barotropic nature. This study shows that the potential for baroclinic instabil- ity in the equatorial region can be as large as at mid-latitudes, if the tendency of isotherms to have a smaller slope for a given zonal velocity, when the Coriolis parameter vanishes, is compensated for by the wind effect...|$|E

40|$|Black-hole and neutron-star X-ray {{binaries}} exhibit compact radio jets, {{when they}} are in the so called quiescent, hard, or hard intermediate states. The radio spectrum in these states is flat to slightly inverted. It is widely accepted that the energy distribution of the electrons, in the rest frame of the jet, is a power law with index p. A power-law energy distribution of the electrons in the jet is sufficient to explain the flat to slightly inverted spectrum emitted by the jet from radio to near infrared wavelengths, but is it necessary? Contrary to what our thinking was decades ago, now we know that the jets originate in the hot inner flow around black holes and neutron stars. Thus, we have investigated the spectrum that is emitted by a thermal jet with kT in the range 100 - 250 keV. We have computed the emitted spectrum from radio to near infrared using either a thermal distribution of electrons or a power-law one. We have found that <b>parabolic</b> <b>jets</b> with a thermal distribution of electrons give inverted spectra with alpha in the range 0 - 0. 4, while jets with a power-law distribution of electrons give inverted spectra with alpha in the range 0 - 0. 2. The rest of the parameters are kept the same in the two cases. The break frequency, which marks the transition from optically thick to optically thin synchrotron emission, is comparable for the two electron energy distributions. Our conclusion is that, contrary to common belief, {{it is not necessary to}} invoke a power-law energy distribution of the electrons in a jet to explain its flat to slightly inverted radio spectrum. A relativistic Maxwellian produces similar spectra. Thus, the widely invoked corona around black holes in X-ray binaries may actually be the jet.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the detailed inner jet structure of M 87 using the Very Long Baseline Array data at 2, 5, 8. 4, 15, 23. 8, 43, and 86 GHz, especially {{focusing on the}} multi-frequency properties of the radio core at the jet base. First, we measured a size of the core region transverse to the jet axis, defined as W_ c, at each frequency ν, and found a relation between W_ c and ν as W_ c(ν) ∝ν^- 0. 71 ± 0. 05. Then, by combining W_ c(ν) and the frequency dependence of the core position r_ c(ν), which was obtained by our previous study, we have constructed a collimation profile of the innermost jet W_ c(r) down to 10 Schwarzschild radii (R_ s) from the central black hole. We found that W_ c(r) smoothly connects with the width profile of the outer edge-brightened, <b>parabolic</b> <b>jet,</b> and then follows a similar radial dependence down to several tens of R_ s. Closer to the black hole, the measured radial profile suggests a possible change of the jet collimation shape from the outer parabolic one, in which the jet shape tends to become more radially-oriented. This {{could be related to}} a magnetic collimation process or/and interaction with surrounding materials at the jet base. The present results shed light on the importance of higher-sensitivity/resolution imaging studies for M 87 at 86, 43 and also 22 GHz, and should be examined more rigorously.

40|$|The {{structure}} and {{dynamics of the}} M 87 jet from sub-milli-arcsec to arcsecond scales are continuously examined. We analysed the VLBA archival data taken at 43 and 86 GHz to measure the size of VLBI cores. Millimeter/sub-mm VLBI cores are considered as innermost jet emissions, which has been originally suggested by Blandford & Königl. Those components fairly follow an extrapolated parabolic streamline {{in our previous study}} so that the jet has a single power-law structure with nearly five orders of magnitude in the distance starting from the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH), less than 10 Schwarzschild radius (r_ s). We further inspect the jet parabolic structure as a counterpart of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) nozzle in order to identify the property of a bulk acceleration. We interpret that the <b>parabolic</b> <b>jet</b> consists of Poynting-flux dominated flows, powered by large amplitude, nonlinear torsional Alfvén waves. We examine the non-relativistic MHD nozzle equation in a parabolic shape. The nature of trans-fast magnetosonic flow is similar to the one of transonic solution of Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind; the jet becomes super-escape as well as super-fast magnetosonic at around ∼ 10 ^ 3 r_ s, while the upstream trans-Alfvénic flow speed increases linearly {{as a function of the}} distance at ∼ 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 3 r_ s. We here point out that this is the first evidence to identify these features in astrophysical jets. We propose that the M 87 jet is magnetically accelerated, but thermally confined by the stratified ISM inside the sphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH potential, which may be a norm in AGN jets.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} the {{extended}} jet model of Potter and Cotter {{to model the}} simultaneous multiwavelength spectra of six Compton-dominant blazars. We include an accelerating parabolic base transitioning to a slowly decelerating conical jet with a geometry set by observations of M 87 and consistent with simulations and theory. We investigate several jet models and find that the optically thick to thin synchrotron break in the radio spectrum requires the jet to first come into equipartition at large distances along the jet, consistent with the observed transition from parabolic to conical at 105 Rs in the jet of M 87. We confirm this result analytically and calculate the expected frequency core-shift relations for the models under consideration. We find that a <b>parabolic</b> <b>jet</b> transitioning to a ballistic conical jet at 105 Rs, which starts in equipartition and becomes more particle dominated at larger distances, fits the multiwavelength data of the six blazars well, whilst an adiabatic equipartition conical section requires very large bulk Lorentz factors to reproduce the Compton dominance of the blazars. We find that all these blazars require high power (> 1039 W), high bulk Lorentz factor (> 20) jets observed close {{to the line of}} sight (< 2 {ring operator}) as we expect from the blazar sequence and consistent with the results from Paper II. The inverse-Compton emission in our fits is due to inverse-Compton scattering of high-redshift cosmic microwave background photons at large distances along the jet due to the high bulk Lorentz factors of the jets. We postulate a new interpretation of the blazar sequence based on the radius of the transition region of the jet (where the jet is brightest in synchrotron emission) scaling linearly with black hole mass. © 2013 The Authors.

40|$|We {{develop a}} variational {{principle}} that extends {{the notion of}} a shearless transport barrier from steady to general unsteady two-dimensional flows and maps defined over a finite time interval. This principle reveals that hyperbolic Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) and <b>parabolic</b> LCSs (or <b>jet</b> cores) are the two main types of shearless barriers in unsteady flows. Based on the boundary conditions they satisfy, parabolic barriers are found to be more observable and robust than hyperbolic barriers, confirming widespread numerical observations. Both types of barriers are special null-geodesics of an appropriate Lorentzian metric derived from the Cauchy [...] Green strain tensor. Using this fact, we devise an algorithm for the automated computation of parabolic barriers. We illustrate our detection method on steady and unsteady non-twist maps and on the aperiodically forced Bickley jet. Comment: Submitted to Physica...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the structure and}} dynamics of the M 87 jet based on multi-frequency VLBI observations and MHD jet theories. Millimeter VLBI cores are considered as innermost jet emissions. The jet structure up to ~ 105 rs {{is described as a}} parabolic streamline, indicating the lateral expansion under a confinement by the stratified ISM. Thus, the jet collimation maintains in five orders of magnitude in the distance starting from the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH), less than 10 rs. We here examine the <b>jet</b> <b>parabolic</b> structure in order to identify the property of a bulk acceleration; observed sub-to-superluminal motions indicate an MHD acceleration from non-relativistic to relativistic regimes.

40|$|A quasigeostrophic, two-layer, b-plane channel {{model is}} used to {{investigate}} the dynamics of baroclinic wave packets. A series of experiments are performed in which an unstable flow is maintained by lower-level Ekman friction and radiative relaxation toward a temperature profile that corresponds to a broad <b>parabolic</b> upper-level <b>jet.</b> The final statistically steady state achieved in each experiment is found {{to depend on the}} magnitude of the hyperdiffusivity n 0 and the supercriticality, which is controlled by b. The most important qualitative difference in such states between experiments is found to be {{the degree to which a}} waveguide in the upper level is found to develop. The mechanism for this upper-level waveguide development is the mixing effect of the eddies at the flanks of the jet, which leads to a strong potential vorticity gradient at the center of the channel, with well-mixed regions to the north and south. Two distinct regimes with different qualitative behavior are observed and illustrated by two particular ex-periments. In the first regime strong hyperdiffusivity inhibits the development of the waveguide. Steady wave packets are shown to stabilize the background flow upstream by increasing the meridional shear of the jet. This upstream stabilization is argued to be a mechanism for packet maintenance in this regime. In the second regime the diffusivity is lower, and a well-developed upper-level waveguide results. The wave packets in this regime are unsteady and are shown to stabilize the background flow at, and slightly upstream of, their maxima. Wav...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} axisymmetric relativistic jets with a toroidal {{magnetic field}} and an ultrarelativistic equation of state, {{with the goal of}} studying the lateral structure of jets whose pressure is matched to the pressure of the medium through which they propagate. We find all self-similar steady-state solutions of the relativistic MHD equations for this setup. One of the solutions is the case of a <b>parabolic</b> <b>jet</b> being accelerated by the pressure gradient as it propagates through a medium with pressure declining as p(z) ∝ z^- 2. As the jet material expands due to internal pressure gradients, it runs into the ambient medium resulting in a pile-up of material along the jet boundary, while the magnetic field acts to produce a magnetic pinch along the axis of the jet. Such jets can be in a lateral pressure equilibrium only if their opening angle θ_j at distance z is smaller than about 1 /γ, where γ is the characteristic bulk Lorentz-factor at this distance; otherwise, different parts of the jet cannot maintain causal contact. We construct maps of optically thin synchrotron emission from our self-similar models. We suggest that the boundary pile-up may be the reason for the limb-brightening of the sub-parsec jet of M 87. We find that if the synchrotron emissivity falls with the distance from the jet axis, the polarization fraction rises toward the edge, as seen in 3 C 273 and Mkn 501. Projection effects and the emissivity pattern of the jet have a strong effect on the observed polarization signal, so the interpretation of the polarization data in terms of the geometry of magnetic fields is rather uncertain. For example, jets with {{toroidal magnetic field}}s display the `spine-sheath' polarization angle pattern seen in some BL Lac objects. Comment: 23 pages, including 1 color figure and 4 b/w figures.

40|$|Despite its {{importance}} as a canonical two-dimensional flow, the laminar wall jet {{has not been}} extensively studied using modern computational fluid dynamic methods. The plane laminar wall jet with a specified velocity profile at the jet exit is numerically investigated. In these types of flows in which the flow field evolves to its self-similar behavior, {{the location of the}} dimensionless hydrodynamic virtual origin is carefully investigated and expressed as a function of Reynolds number for uniform and <b>parabolic</b> <b>jet</b> profiles. The local skin friction coefficient is observed to converge to the analytical self-similar solution at downstream locations. Since no analytical solution exists for the temperature field in either the developing or self-similar regions of this problem, the thermal solution is investigated for both isothermal and isoflux boundary conditions at the wall. The dimensionless thermal virtual origin is correlated as a function of Reynolds number. The Nusselt number dependence on Prandtl number, Reynolds number and the downstream location are obtained for both jet profiles and wall boundary conditions. The turbulent wall jet is experimentally investigated for jet Reynolds number varying between 6000 and 10000. The effect of the free stream on the wall jet film cooling effectiveness and on the local heat transfer are investigated for blowing ratio varying between 2. 4 to infinity. The local Nusselt number dependence on Reynolds number and on the downstream location is identified and the obtained results are correlated for the various considered blowing ratios. The forcing effect reveals a dramatic reduction in the film cooling effectiveness which is more pronounced {{in the absence of a}} free stream flow. The Nusselt number decreases with increasing forcing amplitude and frequency in the vicinity of the jet exit, however, at further downstream locations an inflection point is observed in the Nusselt number decay with the streamwise direction which results in a larger Nusselt number value than the one observed in the unforced case. The inflection point is not seen in the presence of a free stream flow...|$|E
40|$|The {{velocity}} {{field of the}} M 87 jet from milli-arcsecond (mas) to arcsecond scales is extensively investigated together with new radio images taken by EVN observations. We detected proper motions of components located at between 160 mas from the core and the HST- 1 complex for the first time. Newly derived {{velocity field}}s exhibits a systematic increase from sub-to-superluminal speed in the upstream of HST- 1. If {{we assume that the}} observed velocities reflect the bulk flow, we here suggest that the M 87 jet may be gradually accelerated through a distance of 10 ^ 6 times of the Schwarzschild radius of the supermassive black hole. The acceleration zone is co-spatial with the <b>jet</b> <b>parabolic</b> region, which is interpreted as the collimation zone of the jet (Asada & Nakamura 2012). The acceleration and collimation take place simultaneously, which we suggest a characteristic of magnetohydrodynamic flows. Distribution of the velocity field has a peak at HST- 1, which is considered as the site of over-collimation, and shows a deceleration downstream of HST- 1 where the jet is conical. Our interpretation of the velocity map in the M 87 jet gives a hypothesis in AGNs that the acceleration and collimation zone of relativistic jets extends over the whole scale within the sphere of influence of the supermassive black hole.

40|$|The {{current level}} of {{physical}} understanding of dust combustion phenomena is still in a rudimentary state compared with the understanding of gas combustion processes. The reason for such a lack of fundamental understanding is partially based on the complexity of multiphase combustion and the enormous diversity of chemical-physical properties of heterogeneous combustible mixtures but {{is largely due to}} difficulties in the experimental investigation of dust combustion. The influence of gravity on a dust suspension is the main reason. First of all, when particulates (either solid particles or liquid droplets) with a characteristic size of the order of tens of microns are suspended, they rapidly settle in the gravitational field. To maintain a particulate suspension for a time duration adequate to carry out combustion experiments invariably requires continuous convection of particulates at or in excess of the gravitational settling velocity. Of necessity, this makes the experiments turbulent in character and makes it impossible to study laminar dust flames. For particle sizes of the order of microns a stable laminar dust flow can be maintained only for relatively small dust concentrations (e. g., for low fuel equivalence ratios) at normal gravity conditions. High dust loading leads to gravitational instability of the dust cloud and to the formation of recirculation cells in a dust suspension in a confined volume, or to the rapid sedimentation of the dense dust cloud as a whole in an unconfined volume. In addition, many important solid fuels such as low volatile coal, carbon, and boron have low laminar flame speeds (of the order of several centimeters per second). Gravitational convection that occurs in combustion products due to the buoyancy forces disrupts low speed dust flames and, therefore, makes observation of such flames at normal gravity impossible. The only way to carry out 'clean' fundamental experiments in dust combustion over a wide range of dust cloud parameters is in a gravity-free environment. Access to the microgravity environment provided by the use of large-scale drop towers, parabolic flights of aircraft and rockets, and shuttle and space station orbits has permitted now to proceed with a systematic program of dust combustion microgravity research. For example, the NASA-Lewis drop tower and a Lear <b>jet</b> <b>parabolic</b> flight aircraft were used by Ross et al. and by Berlad and Tangirala for experiments with Iycopodium/air mixtures. The Japan Microgravity Center drop shaft (JAMIC) where a microgravity condition of 10 (exp - 4) g for 10 s is available, was recently used by Kobayashi, Niioka et al. for measuring flame propagation velocities in polymethyl methacrylate dust/air suspensions. Microgravity dust combustion experiments were started at McGill University in the early 90 's under the sponsorship of the Canadian Space Agency. Several generations of dust combustion platforms permitting dust combustion microgravity experiments to be carried out on board a parabolic flight aircraft (KC- 135, NASA) have been designed and tested. The experimental data and experience gained from this research allowed us to design and build in a current phase of this program the microgravity apparatus for the visual observation of freely propagating constant pressure laminar dust flames. Quenching distances in aluminum dust suspensions have been measured {{in a wide range of}} dust cloud parameters in ground-based experiments and in recent microgravity experiments (KC- 135 parabolic flights, Houston, February 1995) ...|$|R
