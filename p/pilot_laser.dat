The intelligent system furthermore interprets the correlated laser beam parameter responses and proposes appropriate measures for preventive maintenance.

40|$|Quality of {{the laser}} {{processing}} depends on many factors, such as overall configuration {{of the laser}} workstation, control methods used {{and quality of the}} laser beam. Although lasers used in material processing are typically high energy lasers, light beam still needs to be focused in order to achieve higher energy density and smaller final spot size. This paper presents an application of sliding mode to the laser autofocusing system. Autofocusing system consists of photodiode as the measurement element, focusing lens and <b>pilot</b> <b>laser</b> beam. Photodiode is saturated and measurement is done in the nonlinear region of the responsivity curve. Problem of limited knowledge about the photodiodes behavior in this region is solved through sliding mode minimization algorithm. Verification of the proposed method is done experimentally...|$|E

Typically, the height and depth of the surface is monitored with devices tracking changes to ultrasound, infrared, or visible light aimed at the engraving surface. These devices, known as pilot beams or <b>pilot</b> <b>lasers</b> (if a laser is used) help guide the adjustments made to the lens of the laser in determining the optimal spot to focus on the surface and remove material effectively.|$|R

Basing on this the principal explanations of robot guided laser beam guidance systems are introduced. By the help of a <b>pilot</b> <b>laser</b> processing cell, concisting of an industrial robot and a laser beam guidance system, which has been built up at IPA, the different components are investigated for relevant parameters. e. g. kinematics, workingspace, path speed, pointing conformities.

40|$|THz {{radiation}} {{covers a}} portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is very hard to investigate. Visible and radio frequencies are well studied and relatively easy to generate. The energy of photons with frequencies in the visible spectrum is of the same order of magnitude of atomic transitions. Exploiting the process of stimulated emission it is possible to create a laser that emits photons in the visible spectrum. Radio waves can be generated by alternating electrical current. In the region between visible and radio waves a common radiation sources are of Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCL) sources that actually require cryogenic temperatures. This makes the investigation of THz frequencies very difficult. This is unfortunate, since THz radiation has the potential for many applications. The energy of vibrational and rotational transitions of many atoms and molecules falls in this spectral range. This allows the use of THz radiation to identify atoms and molecules. Another possible application is in airport security where a non intrusive method of identification of illegal substances is required, or in industry to monitor production. Using radiation in THz range in microscopy appears unfeasible at the first glance. Diffraction limit imposes that an optical microscope employing THz radiation would be unable to have a resolution lower then 0. 61 λ/n, with λ being the THz wavelength and n being the index of refraction. This means that details smaller then 100 µm cannot be easily unveiled. This limit holds for microscopes that use far field radiation. In this work we demonstrate a novel THz near field optical microscopy technique in which a QCL source is simultaneously used as source and detector in the self-mixing configuration. We used a scattering-type Scanning Near Field Microscope (SNOM) by Neaspec GmbH. Self-mixing interferometry is a measurement technique that makes use of the coherence properties of a laser beam and of the high sensitivity of interferometric detection. In this technique the laser beam is reflected from an object back inside the laser. The reflected light and the generated light interferes inside the laser cavity, causing changes in the optical mode and the laser voltage. Those changes are monitored and recorded by lock-in amplification. In this work we describe the optical setup in details, together with the alignment procedures {{such as the use of}} the <b>pilot</b> <b>laser</b> for the crude alignment and the use of the self mixing signal itself for the finer alignment. As application of this novel instrument we probed 2 D nanomaterials. In particular, we investigated black phosphorus, tin selenide (SnSe) and tin diselenide (SnSe 2). In order to be able to change the carriers density inside those materials, influencing their response to the THz radiation, we fabricated several field effect transistor devices (FETs) for each material. The fabrication process was performed inside the facilities of Laboratorio NEST - National Enterprise for nanoScience and nanoTechnology. The fabrication procedures such as substrate preparation, mechanical exfoliation, SEM image acquisition, transistor design, electronic beam lithography, reactive ion etching, evaporation, lift-off, atomic layer deposition and bonding are described. The setup for electrical characterization of the produced FETs is presented. The final scans acquired by the self-mixing SNOM setup are presented and discussed. For devices of each material the topography maps, the THz scans and the electrical characteristics are provided...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Corneal {{confocal}} microscopy (CCM) is a rapid non-invasive ophthalmic technique, {{which has}} been shown to diagnose and stratify the severity of diabetic neuropathy. Current morphometric techniques assess individual static images of the subbasal nerve plexus; this work explores the potential for non-invasive assessment of the wide-field morphology and dynamic changes of this plexus in vivo. Methods In this <b>pilot</b> study, <b>laser</b> scanning CCM was used to acquire maps (using a dynamic fixation target and semi-automated tiling software) of the central corneal sub-basal nerve plexus in 4 diabetic patients with and 6 without neuropathy and in 2 control subjects. Nerve migration was measured in an additional 7 diabetic patients with neuropathy, 4 without neuropathy and in 2 control subjects by repeating {{a modified version of the}} mapping procedure within 2 - 8 weeks, thus facilitating re-identification of distinctive nerve landmarks in the 2 montages. The rate of nerve movement was determined from these data and normalised to a weekly rate (µm/week), using customised software. Results Wide-field corneal nerve fibre length correlated significantly with the Neuropathy Disability Score (r = - 0. 58, p 0. 05 for all). The rate of corneal nerve migration was 14. 3 ± 1. 1 µm/week in diabetic patients with neuropathy, 19. 7 ± 13. 3 µm/week in diabetic patients without neuropathy, and 24. 4 ± 9. 8 µm/week in control subjects; however, these differences were not significantly different (p = 0. 543). Conclusions Our data demonstrate that it is possible to capture wide-field images of the corneal nerve plexus, and to quantify the rate of corneal nerve migration by repeating this procedure over a number of weeks.

ALS has become important in creating Digital Terrain Models (DTM) with high precision at a far lower cost to other methods. Shoalhaven City Council employed ALS in May 200 I for the purpose of obtaining detailed survey information within budgetary constraints. The aim Was to determine the effectiveness of using ALS for coastal and environmental management by testing the accuracy of ground level points against traditionally surveyed points. Coastal Acid Sulfate Soils are widespread throughout the Australian low- lying coastal areas. Shoalhaven City Council has received funding {{to improve the quality of}} affected land and waterways withing this hotspot. In groundwater conditions has lead to the development of management works.

40|$|The new welding technique, "SHADOW - {{stepless}} {{high speed}} accurate and discrete one pulse welding", is introduced. SHADOW means {{the use of}} a single pulse to generate a quasi continuous weld of several millimeters in length. The processing time is defined by the pulse duration of the pulsed laser. At present, a state-of-the-art laser is capable of a maximum pulse duration of 20 ms. The variation of the laser power depending on time is a vital capability of the pulsed laser to adapt the energy deposition into the workpiece (pulse shaping). Laser beam welds of several watch components were successfully performed. Similar metals like crowns and axes made out of stainless steel have been welded using pulsed laser radiation. Applying a series of about 130 single pulses for the crown-axis combination, the total energy accumulates to 19. 5 J. The use of the SHADOW welding technique reduces the energy to 2. 5 J. While welding dissimilar metals like stainless steel and brass, the SHADOW technique has even more advantages. Gearwheels made out of brass have been joined to axes made out of stainless steel. Common pulse mode welding generates a considerable amount of contamination but SHADOW welding drastically reduces the contamination and the distortion. Laser beam welding of copper has a low process reliability due to the high reflection and high thermal conductivity.

Methods: LSCI measurements of liver microcirculation were performed on ten patients undergoing liver resection. Measurements were made during apnea with and without liver blood inflow occlusion. Hepatic blood flow was assessed by subtracting zero inflow signal from the total signal. Zero inflow signal was obtained after hepatic artery and portal vein occlusion. Perfusion was expressed in laser speckle perfusion units, and intraindividual and interindividual variability in liver perfusion was investigated using the coefficient of variability. Results: Hepatic microcirculation measurements were successfully made in all patients resulting in analyzable speckle contrast images.
