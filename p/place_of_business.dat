5|$|Pain {{consolidated}} much of {{his power}} in Shropshire and Herefordshire at Bridgnorth Castle, often using that site as a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> in preference to Shrewsbury, which had previously been the main centre of business for his predecessors as sheriff. As well as Waleran, Pain imprisoned a Welsh hostage there in 1128, Llywelyn ab Owain, the nephew of Maredudd ap Bleddyn, ruler of the Welsh principality of Powys. Besides Bridgnorth, Pain used his possession of Ludlow Castle to consolidate his power in the Welsh Marches. During Henry's reign, the Welsh border was a zone of frequent raids and conflict between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E
5|$|The Rialto Grain and Securities Company, whose {{principal}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was in St. Louis, Missouri, {{was under}} investigation by the Postmaster for mail fraud. The Postmaster had received two complaints and forwarded them for investigation on November 7, 1902. State courts were also investigating complaints from investors against Rialto. Hugh C. Dennis, the President of Rialto, and other officers had been criminally indicted, but (at the time of Burton's indictment) none had been convicted. As of Burton's indictment, Dennis had been once acquitted in federal court and four indictments were pending against him in state courts. For a time, Rialto's offices had been closed due to a judicial attachment by its creditors.|$|E

5|$|The {{house was}} built in 1878 for Theodore Waters Foster, born on May 19, 1847, to Chauncey Foster and Ophelia Remington. He was educated in Pawtucket and joined the Rhode Island Cavalry in 1863. He served in the American Civil War under Nathaniel P. Banks in the Red River Campaign. In 1873, he formed a jewelry-manufacturing {{partnership}} with Walter E. White and Samuel H. Baily, named White, Foster & Company. After White retired in 1878, the company was renamed Foster & Bailey. During this time, Foster constructed the house and lived in it {{for a period of}} four years, commuting to his <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> in Providence, Rhode Island. Foster would continue to be successful in his jewelry manufacturing business and his son, Theodore Clyde Foster, would succeed him upon his death in 1928. In 1882, Theodore Foster sold the home to George W. Payne, the owner of the G. W. Payne & Company.|$|E

25|$|On 24 September 1766, customs {{officials}} in Boston, with a deputy sheriff, searched merchant Daniel Malcom's home, {{which was also}} his <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> They claimed the authority {{to do so by}} a writ of assistance issued to customs official Benjamin Hallowell, and the information of a confidential informant. Malcom allowed them to search, but denied them access to a locked cellar, arguing {{that they did not have}} the legal authority to break it open. According to {{customs officials}}, Malcom threatened to use force to prevent them from opening the door; according to Malcom and his supporters, his threat specified resisting any unlawful forced entry.|$|E
25|$|Druggist Edward Stabler {{was elected}} the first {{librarian}} and the library's first location {{is believed to}} have been housed in his apothecary shop. James Kennedy was elected the second librarian, and the library moved to his residence and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Kennedy sold books from his personal collection to the Library Company. Those books and other bought from two local merchants formed the foundation of the subscription library. The first catalog of the library's collection was published in 1797. The collection grew over time, bolstered in part by the fact that some members paid their dues in books. Most members were initially men, although records exist showing some women were members as early as 1798. One noted female member in 1817 was Mary L.F. Custis, wife of George Washington Parke Custis.|$|E

For Astor, he built the brig Fox in 1809 and the ship Hannibal in 1810. Fox in particular was noted for her great speed thanks to the streamlined hull form Eckford designed for her, making the trip from Calcutta, India, to New York City in only 90 days – a record that would stand for 40 years – and making the round trip from New York to Calcutta and back in only seven months and 14 days. It was the speed of his ships thanks to their revolutionary hull form that gained Eckford great fame in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Facebook, Inc. v. StudiVZ Ltd. was {{a federal}} lawsuit filed on July 18, 2008, by Facebook, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against StudiVZ Ltd., a UK company with its {{principal}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> in Germany. StudiVZ had launched a website which was {{alleged to be}} visually and functionally similar to Facebook's site. Facebook filed a similar lawsuit the same day in the German regional court of Stuttgart and an additional related lawsuit on November 19, 2008, in the German regional court of Cologne. In May 2009 the Court in California issued an order indicating its view that Germany was the more appropriate forum for the dispute, but withheld issuing a final order on the question until further review of the issues of personal jurisdiction could be addressed. The parties subsequently settled the California case, but continued the litigation in Germany in which the regional court of Cologne held that StudiVZ did not violate any intellectual property rights held by Facebook.|$|E
25|$|The Anglo-Oriental {{building}} has solid tower-like features flanking the corner entranceways {{in addition to}} vertical and horizontal Art Deco patterns and lines. The vertically banded front elevation of the building, which is held between two towers, contrasts with the horizontal bands of the two side wings. The tall, first floor windows of the Anglo-Oriental Building have individual concrete canopies, while the second floor is treated as a narrow band which appears to recede due to the deep, continuous overhang above the windows and the darker shade of Shanghai plaster. An internal open courtyard was roofed over for air-conditioning in the 1960s. During the 1941 Japanese invasion, the building {{was used as a}} police station. After World War II, the building served many uses. From 1986 to 1988, the architect Chen Voon Fee renovated the Anglo-Oriental Building and it was converted into Mahkota College, a private college partnered with Boston University. From 1995 to 2005, the Anglo-Oriental Building became a property of Ekran Berhad and it served as the corporate headquarters until 1 January 2005, where the second floor housed the principal <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> of the company. It was then that the present name – Wisma Ekran (House of Ekran) was established.|$|E

25|$|Wonga {{was founded}} by Errol Damelin (chief {{executive}} officer) in October 2006 and he linked up with software engineer Jonty Hurwitz in January 2007. Both Damelin and Hurwitz had previous internet start-up experience; neither had any experience of retail banking. When the company first started looking for funding, potential investors saw the short-term, small-loans business as an unprofitable, risky backwater. After being denied funding by UK banks, Wonga secured venture capital through Balderton Capital. The first <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was in a shared office space in St. John's Wood, London. After a year of software development a beta website was launched in 2007. In interviews, Damelin {{has said that the}} goal was to disrupt the short-term credit industry by providing transparency, exact control of amount and payment date, immediate access to funds, and no faxing or emailing documents. The business model of lending only to those who could pay back reliably, as opposed to the much wider catchment practice of payday loans required an algorithm that could fully determine risk in an automated manner – something they had difficulty developing in the early stages. To get funds directly to customer's bank accounts as quickly as possible, co-operation from leading banks was required. Banks were reportedly dismissive of Wonga's plan saying they would not be totally satisfied with customer identity without physical documentation.|$|E
