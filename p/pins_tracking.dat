30|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis {{remains a}} common {{complication}} {{with the use}} of external fixators [35, 36]. Quoted incidences range from 11.3 to 100  % [37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Fortunately, the majority of these infections are minor and easily treated with local <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care and oral antibiotics [42]. Intra-operative pin insertion methods that emphasize low energy insertion and a standardized post-operative <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care protocol {{have been shown to be}} effective in reducing the incidence and severity of pin tract sepsis [43]. These strategies should be instituted for all patients who undergo external fixator application. In our series, only one patient developed a major <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection that required removal of the external fixator. Ten patients had minor <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis that responded to local treatment and oral antibiotics. It is interesting to note that HIV infection had no influence on the incidence or severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis, while five out of six patients who smoked developed <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis is {{a common}} {{complication}} of circular external fixation. HIV status has been implicated as an independent risk factor {{for the development of}} <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection and has been cited as a reason not to attempt complex limb reconstruction in HIV-positive patients. This retrospective review of patients treated with circular external fixators looked at the incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis in HIV-positive, HIV-negative and patients whose HIV status was unknown. The records of 229 patients, 40 of whom were HIV-positive, were reviewed. The overall incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis was 22.7  %. HIV infection did not affect the incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis (p =  0.9). The severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis was not influenced by HIV status (p =  0.9) or CD 4 count (p =  0.2). With the employment of meticulous pin insertion techniques and an effective postoperative <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care protocol, circular external fixation can be used safely in HIV-positive individuals.|$|R
30|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> {{infection}} {{decreases the}} stability of the pin–bone interface. Conversely, instability of the fixator pin–bone construct can lead to half-pin loosening and infection [3]. It is a common misconception that pin loosening only results from <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection when in actual fact pin loosening is often the initiating event resulting in <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis.|$|R
30|$|The use of meticulous pin {{insertion}} {{techniques and}} {{the implementation of}} an evidence-based <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care protocol can {{reduce the incidence of}} <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis with circular external fixation in reconstructive surgery to approximately 25  % [4]. Our results compare favorably to previously published figures with an overall <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis incidence of 22.7  % (52 out of 229) observed in this series.|$|R
30|$|This article aims to {{highlight}} the factors {{associated with an increased}} risk of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> complications, reviews the literature and proposes a protocol for effective external fixator <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care.|$|R
3000|$|Major <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infections, Checketts grade 4 and above, {{should be}} managed in theatre {{in order to}} allow {{adequate}} debridement of the <b>pin</b> <b>tracks.</b> Morgan-Jones [37] recommends arthroscopic debridement of major <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection to remove all necrotic debris. Bibbo [2] [...] on the other hand, uses the Versajet Hydrosurgery system (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN) to debride infected pin sites after which the wound edges are freshened and closed with nylon or polypropolene sutures.|$|R
30|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis {{is often}} the first {{clinical}} manifestation of a vicious cycle of pin loosening and sustained pin site infection. It is a misconception that <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis result in pin loosening; pin loosening is more often the inciting event that leads to pin site infection [14, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Failure of the pin–bone interface can have catastrophic consequences and may lead to failure of the reconstruction and, ultimately, limb ablation in some. A meticulous approach to pin and wire insertion combined with a structured protocol of pin site care {{has been shown to}} decrease the incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis [4, 20, 21]. Certain patient factors may, however, influence the incidence and severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis. Poor diabetic control and HIV infection have both been implicated as independent risk factors for the development of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection [7, 15, 22, 23, 24].|$|R
30|$|Several {{factors have}} been implicated in the {{development}} of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis [4, 21]. They include frame design and biomechanics, pin and wire insertion techniques, point of commencement of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care and the specific care protocol employed [7, 8, 12, 13, 40]. Strategies to reduce <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis should include measures aimed at optimization of these factors. Some non-modifiable risk factors have also been associated with pin site infection. These include diabetes mellitus and HIV infection [7, 15, 22, 23, 24].|$|R
30|$|This {{retrospective}} review aims {{to compare}} the rate and severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients treated with circular external fixators. The research proposal was reviewed {{and approved by the}} local ethics committee. An extensive literature review revealed this current study to be the largest yet {{to compare the}} incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. It is currently also the only study investigating the effect of HIV infection on the incidence and severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis with the use of circular external fixators.|$|R
30|$|The {{appropriate}} time to commence <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care vary greatly {{in the literature}} with published times ranging from 24  h to 10  days [2, 3, 5, 10, 27, 28, 29, 31]. The frequency of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> cleaning also differ, with authors suggesting once daily [6, 27], twice daily [3, 4], weekly [27, 33] or ‘when required’ [28].|$|R
30|$|The {{most common}} {{complication}} was <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection (82 %). There was no {{consensus in the}} literature regarding how to manage <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection of the wires and half pins of the external fixators [24]. Hydroxyapatite-coated pins may reduce the rate of infection; however, we used hydroxyapatite-coated half pins in only three patients due to financial reasons.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, while <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis is {{a common}} {{complication}} {{with the use of}} circular external fixators, we did not find that the incidence or severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis was influenced by HIV infection or degree of immune compromise. This finding should not preclude the use of circular external fixators for complex trauma and limb reconstruction in HIV-positive individuals.|$|R
30|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> {{infection}} is an inherent problem in external fixation. There were 58 <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infections. There were three cases of osteomyelitis, but all in open fractures. Forty-three pin infections were managed successfully with antibiotics, while in 15 (7 patients) the pin {{had to be}} replaced. In the three cases of osteomyelitis, intravenous antibiotic treatment was combined with debridement of all necrotic tissue. All infections eventually resolved.|$|R
30|$|A {{retrospective}} {{review was}} undertaken and the variables recorded included patient demographics, HIV status, CD 4 count {{and use of}} antiretroviral medication, indications for circular fixation, type of external fixator used, <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> complications and treatment of these complications. Results were analyzed using the independent t test, one-way ANOVA test and the Kruskal–Wallis H test to ascertain whether HIV infection had any effect on the incidence or severity on <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis.|$|R
30|$|Pin track-associated {{complications}} {{are almost}} universal findings {{with the use}} of external fixation. These complications are catastrophic if it leads to the failure of the bone–pin interface and could lead to pin loosening, fracture non-union and chronic osteomyelitis. Strategies proposed for the prevention and management of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> complications are diverse and constantly changing. Prevention of external fixation <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection is a complex and ongoing task that requires attention to detail, meticulous surgical technique and constant vigilance.|$|R
30|$|Four minor {{complications}} occurred. A functional {{range of}} motion of the adjacent joints was achieved {{in all but one}} patient with a residual equinus contracture of five degrees. Minor <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection (Checketts and Otterburn grade 2 and 3) was experienced in three cases and necessitated the removal of the offending wire in one of these patients [18]. The incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis did not appear to differ from a previous study involving circular fixation [19].|$|R

30|$|HIV {{infection}} {{has prompted}} many orthopedic and trauma surgeons {{to avoid the}} use of circular external fixators {{for the purpose of}} limb reconstruction in HIV-positive patients. Norrish and Harrison published the first data comparing <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection with the use of monolateral external fixators in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients [22, 24, 39]. They reported on 13 HIV-positive and 34 HIV-negative patients and found significantly more infections requiring pharmaceutical or surgical intervention in the HIV-positive group. Our results differ in that we could show no correlation between the incidence or severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis and HIV status. Our results do correlate with the findings of no correlation between CD 4 count and the severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection in HIV-positive patients. The low patient numbers and wide CD 4 range could explain the apparent lack of relationship and more research is required.|$|R
30|$|We {{advocate}} that <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care is restarted {{as soon as}} {{pin site}} infection is identified. This includes twice daily cleaning of the pin–skin interface with a chlorhexidine solution and absorbent dressings if excessive exudate is encountered. A course of oral antibiotics aimed at Staphylococcal infection is prescribed for 7 – 10  days. Checketts grade 3 infections are admitted for intravenous antibiotics and in-hospital <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care and limb elevation. If these infections do not respond adequately, the involved pins or wires are removed or exchanged.|$|R
30|$|Complications {{included}} <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> {{infection in}} 46 segments, radial nerve palsy which recovered completely in 2 patients, fracture of the regenerate in 7 cases and premature {{consolidation of the}} regenerate in one case.|$|R
30|$|Another {{important}} {{preventative measure}} involves post-operative limb elevation. We advocate limb elevation whenever {{the patient is}} not actively mobilizing. This reduces oedema around the pins and creates the optimal environment for rapid healing of the <b>pin</b> <b>tracks</b> [2].|$|R
30|$|External {{fixation}} is {{an essential}} component of the modern orthopaedic surgeon’s armamentarium and is widely used in traumatology and reconstructive surgery. This treatment modality is unfortunately associated with the almost universal complication of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection [1, 2].|$|R
30|$|Five {{patients}} (33.33  %) developed superficial <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> {{infections that}} started 1 week after slab removal {{and at the}} beginning of active ROM; this was managed simply by pure alcohol and oral antibiotics, as shown in Table  1.|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{complications}} such as <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection, deep infection, compartment syndrome, mal-union and deformities, {{the results}} of the present study are comparable with other studies by Lal and Bhan, Dehao et al., Eren et al. and Tiwari et al. [19, 20].|$|R
30|$|In {{cases of}} osteomyelitic <b>pin</b> <b>tracks</b> with a {{sizeable}} cavity following debridement, these cavities {{can either be}} treated by leaving a 2 -mm antibiotic bead in the track [3] or by using antibiotic-impregnated absorbable calcium-sulphate pellets to back-fill these tracks [2].|$|R
30|$|Active {{and passive}} {{mobilization}} of the adjacent joints was started on second post-operative day. Ambulation and partial weight-bearing was {{started on the}} 2 nd or 3 rd post-operative day depending on pain, bone quality and patient compliance. Distraction at the corticotomy site was started between the 7 th and 14 th day at rate of 1  mm/day (0.25  mm every 6  h). <b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> dressings were of sterile gauze and normal saline. At the time of discharge, patients were educated to deliver <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care, perform distraction and physiotherapy for joint mobilization and muscle strengthening. Regular follow-up every 4  weeks was done. Checks on <b>pin</b> loosening, <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infections were carried out and radiographs obtained. The fixator was dynamised once clinical (the absence of deformity or abnormal mobility, the ability to walk and stand on the operated leg without pain) and radiological (3 or more cortices on two orthogonal views) union was declared [16]. After dynamisation, if the patient could weight bear without pain, the fixator was removed as an outpatient procedure under sedation. The operated extremity was protected with functional cast brace for 4  weeks after removal of the fixator.|$|R
30|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis {{remains a}} common {{complication}} {{with the use}} of external fixators [7, 15]. Quoted incidences range from 11.3 to 100  % [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Mostafavi reported a 71  % incidence of pin site infection in reconstructive surgery [11].|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} benefits {{of stainless steel}} (SS) to titanium (Ti) on reducing <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> irritation/infection and <b>pin</b> loosening during external fracture fixation. Methods: A tibial gap osteotomy was created in 17 sheep and stabilized with four Schanz screws of either SS or Ti and an external fixation frame. Over the 12 week observation period, pin loosening was assessed by grading the radiolucency around the pins and measuring the extraction torque on pin removal at sacrifice. Irritation/infection was assessed with weekly clinical <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> grading. A histological analysis of the tissue adjacent to the pin site was made to assess biocompatibility. Results: A statistically non-significant trend for less bone resorption around Ti pins was found during the early observation period. However, at sacrifice, {{there was no difference}} between the two materials. Also, there was no difference in the extraction torque, and there was similar remodeling and apposition of the bone around the pins. A statistically non-significant trend for more infection about SS pins at sacrifice was found. Histology showed a slightly higher prevalence of reactionary cells in SS samples, but was otherwise not much different than around Ti pins. Conclusions: There is no clinically relevant substantial advantage in using either SS or Ti pins on reducing pin loosening or <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> irritation/infection...|$|R
40|$|Very {{often the}} <b>track</b> <b>pins</b> of {{heavy-loaded}} track-type machines have insufficient fatigue safety margin, which causes their frequent breakage. One {{of the most}} rational solutions {{of the problem is}} the use of the high-temperature thermomechanical treatment of hot-rolled tubular billets for <b>track</b> <b>pins.</b> The analysis of the investigation results and engineering developments shows the possibility of improving the performance characteristic of hollow items (shafts, axis <b>pins,</b> <b>track</b> <b>pins</b> for a caterpillar mover, torsion suspensions of an undercarriage, etc.) by combining the thermomechanical treatment strengthening, various methods for improving the quality of the surface of tubular billets and the application of developed technological schemes in the factories producing tubular billets and items with diameter of Ø 10 ÷ 60 mm and the parameters of safety margin, precision and roughness required for the durability of the items...|$|R
30|$|The only {{complications}} encountered {{during the}} treatment period were minor <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infections. One half pin developed a Checketts and Otterburn stage II infection that responded to oral antibiotics [16]. The tensioned wire developed a stage III infection at a late stage of treatment. The wire was removed without further complications.|$|R
30|$|There {{was some}} sort of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> {{infection}} in 46 cases (82 %) which usually responded to broad-spectrum oral antibiotics (first-generation cephalosporin) for one week and increasing the frequency of dressings. Parenteral antibiotics were required in 31 segments. The infected wire or half pin was removed in the outpatient clinic in five segments during the course of treatment.|$|R
30|$|Complications that {{occurred}} during the treatment period were graded according to Paley’s working classification as problem, obstacle or true complication [18]. True complications were divided as minor or major. In this study, all patients had one or more <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infections which resolved with regular <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> dressing and antibiotics (problem). Post-operative joint stiffness resolved completely in 10 patients with physiotherapy. Fifteen patients had <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infections which required the removal of the pin and or insertion of a new pin (obstacle). True complications presented in the form of joint stiffness. Twenty-two patients had joint stiffness prior to commencement of treatment and showed no improved in range of movement at the end of treatment despite intensive physiotherapy. Two patients who were non-compliant with the post-operative physiotherapy programme developed joint stiffness at the end of treatment period. Eight patients had an axial deformity of greater than 7 degrees. Infection was eradicated in all but 1 patient who refused further treatment. Limb length inequality of greater than 2.5 cm was seen in 10 patients at the end of treatment period. These patients, despite counselling, were non-compliant for the distraction schedule given; they were satisfied with the length achieved and wanted no further distraction. There was one refracture at the docking site after mobilization, and this was managed non-operatively. No patient had premature consolidation, complex regional pain syndrome, persistent oedema or neurovascular complications on completion of treatment.|$|R
30|$|A {{subgroup}} {{analysis of}} the HIV-positive patients (n =  40) was undertaken. Mean CD 4 count was 347.4  cells/mm 3 (D ±  162.4, range 82 – 682  cells/mm 3) and 25 (62.5  %) patients were receiving HAART. Our data showed that CD 4 count had no influence on either the incidence (p =  0.57) or severity (p =  0.21) of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis in the HIV-positive group.|$|R
30|$|We have however noted a {{small number}} of cases of {{chlorhexidine}} sensitivity resulting in skin irritation and weeping <b>pin</b> <b>tracks.</b> This finding is supported by Davies who reported a 17.6  % incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to prolonged skin contact with a strong antiseptic solution [10]. Fortunately, this usually resolves through the substitution of chlorhexidine with a mild soap and water solution for pin site care.|$|R
30|$|All {{patients}} were evaluated as excellent (using Paley’s functional criteria) except one with DF who developed a foot drop from sciatic nerve injury after initial surgery of tumour excision; this was treated by pantalar arthrodesis. Complications encountered included <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infections in 6 patients which was treated by oral antibiotics, residual shortening in 8 patients and diminished joint motion due to knee arthrodesis in one patient.|$|R
40|$|AB Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the benefits of a new Anodic Plasma Chemical calcium-phosphate (APC-CaP) surface treatment on reducing <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection and <b>pin</b> loosening in comparison to anodized titanium (Ti) during external fracture fixation. Methods: A tibial midshaft, transverse, 6 -mm gap osteotomy was created in 17 adult female Swiss alpine sheep. The tibia was stabilized with an external fixator and 4 Schanz screws of Ti or APC-CaP-treated Ti. The sheep were examined during a 12 -week observation period. Infection was assessed with weekly clinical <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> grading and microbiologic assessment at sacrifice. Pin loosening was assessed by grading for radiolucency on biweekly radiographs and by measuring extraction torque on pin removal. In vivo bending stiffness measurements were performed to determine gap healing. A qualitative histologic assessment of the tissue adjacent to pin sites was also performed. Results: A trend (P = 0. 056) for less infection around APC-CaP pins was found at 6 weeks, but the strength of this difference diminished with time. Significantly more radiolucency was found around Ti pins after 8 (P = 0. 011) and 12 (P 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 001) weeks. At all pin sites, the extraction torque for APC-CaP pins was higher than for Ti pins (P = 0. 007). No difference in the progression of gap healing was found. Histology showed bone growth at the implant surface in the form of distance osteogenesis for Ti and contact osteogenesis for APC-CaP. Conclusions: This study has shown that the APC-CaP surface improves the clinical performance of Ti pins with respect to pin loosening and <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection...|$|R
