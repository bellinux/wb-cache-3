5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia was a {{challenge}} for the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay. Due {{to the fact that}} Dyer had been a resident in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to challenge for the Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's nose {{at the start of the}} eighth, putting Kay down for a count of eight. When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor could find no evidence and Kay retained his belt.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} two matches, Kazushi faced in Braga a consistently aggressive opponent, with the luta livre practitioner landing effective muay thai knees and kicks until Sakuraba <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> The Japanese wrestler continued his signature guard assault, but also outstruck Braga in his last standing segment before taking him down again and lock an armbar for the tap out.|$|E
25|$|In late 1941 {{and early}} 1942, {{he came into}} contact with the {{resistance}} circle about Carl Friedrich Goerdeler. Bolz readily declared {{that he would like to}} take over a ministerial post in the new government after Hitler was overthrown. Goerdeler <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> as Culture Minister in the cabinet that he foresaw having to put together. Among other things, this would have meant that Bolz would be taking Goebbels's place.|$|E

25|$|At Atlanta, Earnhardt Jr. {{came home}} with another third-place finish and at Las Vegas, he {{finished}} fourth, scoring his third Top 5 finish after taking two tires during green flag pit-stops with 30 laps to go. At Phoenix, he had his worst finish of the year, with a last place finish after a tire-blowout. At Auto Club, he finished 6th. At Martinsville, he also ran inside the Top 20 until a tire-blowout made him {{get involved in a}} massive pileup that destroyed the front end of his car. Because of this crash, he would go on to finish 36th. At Texas, he narrowly was beaten by Kevin Harvick for second place. At Bristol, he ran as high as third until a loose wheel <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> two laps down. Although he never got them back, he was able to bring home a 16th-place finish only two laps down. At Richmond, he ran in the Top 10 all day until he and Tony Stewart made contact but managed to finish 14th.|$|E
25|$|Peter {{weighed in}} at 241 pounds, two pounds lighter than their first fight. Klitschko {{came in at}} a career heavy of 247 pounds. Peter started the fight very aggressively and caught Klitschko with a good left hook in the opening minute, {{although}} Klitschko ended the round well. Peter was caught with three hard right-hands in the second round, one of which seemed to stun him. Peter tried to duck under the Klitschko jab, but was being tied up on the inside. After four rounds, the fight became one-sided in Klitschko's favour. Peter's right eye was closing and he was taking heavy punishment. After the ninth round, Peter's trainer Abel Sanchez said he would give him one more round. Emmanuel Steward also implored Klitschko to be more aggressive. Peter swung wildly in the tenth and Klitschko <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> with a concussive combination. Referee Robert Byrd did not start a count and waved the fight off, awarding Klitschko the win by knockout. Klitschko, however, was set to fight Dereck Chisora on 11 December, but the fight was later called off on 8 December due to Klitschko tearing a muscle in his abdomen.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} Blonds {{dropped the}} titles, the team was again {{temporarily}} split up. Austin and Pillman both claimed that it was for political reasons. Austin was given a singles push challenging Dustin Rhodes for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. After Pillman finally recovered, he and Austin had a few more matches together taking on teams such as Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio, Scorpio and Ron Simmons, Simmons and Ice Train, and jobber tag team Frankie Rowe and Jimmy Rogers. The Blonds also confronted The Nasty Boys and Missy Hyatt during an interview after The Nasty Boys had won the titles from Anderson and Roma. The Blonds last match as a team {{took place on the}} October 30, 1993 episode of Saturday Night. After the Blonds had defeated a jobber tag team, Col. Rob Parker (who had just become Austin's new manager) came to ringside to congratulate Austin (and not Pillman) on winning the match. Pillman took exception to Parker snubbing him. Parker brought up Pillman's bad leg and said if he was a race horse, he would <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> Pillman attacked Parker, which in turn led to Austin attacking and turning on Pillman, turning Pillman face and the Blonds broke up for the third and final time.|$|E

25|$|In August 1989, Ethel meets a {{new love}} {{interest}} named Reggie Thompson (John Rutland). He invites {{her to go}} on a coach trip to Clacton for a dancing competition. Ethel is so excited that she shows Reggie a saucy nightie she has bought for the trip. When Dot, Marge Green (Pat Coombs) and Mo Butcher (Edna Doré) find out about the trip, they decide to go as well. Reggie arranges dancing partners for them and the ladies practise hard at the community centre for months before the trip. But upon arriving on holiday, Ethel grows disappointed in Reggie when he starts to show interest in another woman named Gladys. On the night of the dancing competition, Ethel finds that Reggie has run off with Gladys and she has no partner in the grand ballroom except for her 'little Willy'. In 1992, Ethel's adored pug Willy succumbs to old-age and she has to make the heart-breaking decision to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> Regulars at The Queen Victoria pub raise money to buy Ethel a new dog, but she refuses to accept it, saying Willy is irreplaceable. By the mid 1990s Ethel is seen much less frequently. She is seen occasionally however, usually when a big event is occurring or to celebrate Christmas and New Year with her old friends on the Square. After 1997 Ethel is not seen in Walford for three years, although she is mentioned often, particularly by Dot, who will often visit her off-screen in her sheltered housing.|$|E
500|$|Ramírez Treviño and El Gringo vied for {{the control}} of the drug trade {{operations}} in Reynosa, but the former had taken the overall command of the Gulf Cartel and had committed himself to kill anyone that he considered his enemy, which included El Gringo. In order to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down,</b> Ramírez Treviño ordered his men to [...] "erase everything and [...] everyone that had ties El Gringo", thereby creating a single structure among the cartel's commanders. With the help of the Sinaloa Cartel, Ramírez Treviño was planning to oust El Gringo for reportedly failing to stay low-profile in Reynosa, and for considering him a [...] "bloodthirsty" [...] leader. In addition, he distrusted El Gringo because he had ties with his rival Juan Mejía González (El R1). Stratfor indicates that the infighting between both men might have triggered after El Gringo allegedly betrayed the Gulf Cartel and started working with Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (El Lazca), the deceased leader of the rival Los Zetas cartel. Intelligence reports indicate that the infighting between Ramírez Treviño and El Gringo left at least 60 dead throughout the state of Tamaulipas in March 2013, particularly in Miguel Alemán and Camargo, Tamaulipas.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{earliest}} Stooge two-reelers (and occasionally the later ones), the Larry character frequently indulged in utterly nutty behavior. Fine would liven up a {{scene with a}} random improvised remark or ridiculous action. In the hospital spoof Men in Black (1934), Larry, dressed as a surgeon and wielding a large kitchen knife, chortles: [...] "Let's pluck him... and see if he's ripe!" [...] In Disorder in the Court (1936), a tense courtroom scene is interrupted by Larry breaking into a wild Tarzan yell. Of course, after each of his outbursts, Moe would gruffly <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> According to Fine's brother, Fine developed a callus {{on one side of}} his face from being slapped innumerable times by Moe.|$|E
2500|$|The Biblical {{narrative}} portrays Jeremiah {{as being}} subject to additional persecutions. After Jeremiah prophesied that Jerusalem would {{be handed over}} to the Babylonian army, the king's officials, including Pashur the priest, tried to convince King Zedekiah that Jeremiah should be put to death because he was discouraging the soldiers as well as the people. Zedekiah answered that he would not oppose them. [...] Consequently, the king's officials took Jeremiah and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> into a cistern, where he sank down into the mud. [...] The intent seemed to be to kill Jeremiah by allowing him to starve to death in a manner designed to allow the officials to claim to be innocent of his blood. [...] A Cushite rescued Jeremiah by pulling him out of the cistern, but Jeremiah remained imprisoned until Jerusalem fell to the Babylonian army in 587BC.|$|E

2500|$|A {{little over}} {{a month after the}} birth, a copy of the baby's disputed second birth {{certificate}} dated October 11, 2006 was made public showing she was renamed and registered as Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern on October 9, 2006. From September 7, 2006 to October 11, 2006 the baby was in the records as [...] Hannibel Rose Stern. After the birth of her daughter, according to G. Ben Thompson, a former boyfriend of hers who is a real-estate developer in South Carolina, Smith wanted to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> as the father on the birth certificate, but he refused. [...] Thompson also was not convinced the baby was his because he had a vasectomy. Although Stern is named as the father on the earlier certificate, attorney Dion Smith Jr. signed his name where Stern's signature should have been. This discrepancy made the birth certificate invalid so that it could be possible for a new birth certificate to be asked for and a DNA test sought to determine the father's identity. In April 2007 following the official results of the paternity test, Birkhead changed his daughter's surname to his last name, renaming her Dannielynn Hope Marshall Birkhead.|$|E
