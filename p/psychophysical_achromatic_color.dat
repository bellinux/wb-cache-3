40|$|AbstractSimultaneous {{contrast}} {{refers to}} the respective whitening or blackening of physically identical image regions surrounded by regions of low or high luminance, respectively. A common method of measuring {{the strength of this}} effect is <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> matching, in which subjects adjust the luminance of a target region to achieve an <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> match with another region. Here I present psychophysical data questioning the assumption—built into many models of <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> perception—that <b>achromatic</b> <b>colors</b> are represented as points in a one-dimensional (1 D) perceptual space, or an absolute <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> gamut. I present an alternative model in which the <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> gamut corresponding to a target region is defined relatively, with respect to surround luminance. Different <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> gamuts in this model correspond to different 1 D lines through a 2 D perceptual space composed of blackness and whiteness dimensions. Each such line represents a unique gamut of <b>achromatic</b> <b>colors</b> ranging from black to white. I term this concept gamut relativity. <b>Achromatic</b> <b>color</b> matches made between targets surrounded by regions of different luminance are shown to reflect the relative perceptual distances between points lying on different gamut lines. The model suggests a novel geometrical approach to simultaneous contrast and <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> matching in terms of the vector summation of local luminance and contrast components, and sets the stage for a unified computational theory of <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> perception...|$|R

40|$|The {{perception}} of <b>achromatic</b> <b>colors</b> {{is an important}} aspect of CRT <b>color</b> appearance. <b>Achromatic</b> <b>colors</b> are important for practical reasons such as image color balance and as fundamental components of chromatic adaptation and color constancy research. Data on <b>achromatic</b> <b>colors</b> is absolutely essential for applying CIE colorimetry to CRT-hardcopy matching. For example, the CIELAB formulas require the specification of the tristimulus values of white. Unfortunately, psychophysical data on the {{perception of}} <b>achromatic</b> <b>colors,</b> including white, in CRT-hardcopy matching situations is not readily available in the literature. The purpose of this research was to investigate factors that affect the perception of <b>achromatic</b> <b>colors</b> in CRT and hardcopy images viewed in a desktop environment. Four psychophysical experiments were performed in this research. In these experiments, three observers made judgements of <b>achromatic</b> <b>colors</b> on a CRT monitor and in hardcopy images in isolated and matching situations. The color of image balance and ambient illumination in the laboratory was varied between 2700 K tungsten and 6000 K daylight-fluorescent. The results show that chromatic adaptation was controlled almost totally by the CRT image. Adaptation to tungsten was found to be incomplete. When adaptation was incomplete, the chromaticities of <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> judgements fell into two categories similar to Bartleson 2 ̆ 7 s type I and II, where type II show higher color constancy. Judgements {{were more likely to be}} of type II when surface color attributes were present in the CRT image and when the observers were instructed to consider the CRT colors in surface mode. When the images contained more illuminant attributes, the results resembled type I. Hardcopy always produced type II results...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEdge {{integration}} {{refers to}} a hypothetical {{process by which the}} visual system combines information about the local contrast, or luminance ratios, at luminance borders within an image to compute a scale of relative reflectances for the regions between the borders. The results of three <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> matching experiments, in which a test and matching ring were surrounded by one or more rings of varying luminance, were analyzed in terms of three alternative quantitative edge integration models: (1) a generalized Retinex algorithm, in which <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> is computed from a weighted sum of log luminance ratios, with weights free to vary as a function of distance from the test (Weighted Log Luminance Ratio model); (2) an elaboration of the first model, in which the weights given to distant edges are reduced by a percentage that depends on the log luminance ratios of borders lying between the distant edges and the target (Weighted Log Luminance Ratio model with Blockage); and (3) an alternative modification of the first model, in which Michelson contrasts are substituted for log luminance ratios in the <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> computation (Weighted Michelson Contrast model). The experimental results support the Weighted Log Luminance Ratio model over the other two edge integration models. The Weighted Log Luminance Ratio model is also shown to provide a better fit to the <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> matching data than does Wallach's Ratio Rule, which states that the two disks will match in <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> when their respective disk/ring luminance ratios are equal...|$|R

In a two-alternative forced-choice task thirty observers judged the brightness of achromatic neon figures. The results suggest that assimilation of <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> inside and/or outside of the illusory figures cannot explain the brightness effects seen in <b>achromatic</b> neon <b>color</b> spreading.

40|$|A {{common-sense}} assumption concerning {{visual perception}} states that brightness and darkness cannot coexist {{at a given}} spatial location.

The results of many previous psychophysical studies suggest, by contrast, that <b>achromatic</b> <b>colors</b> are represented as points in a color space composed {{of two or more}} perceptual dimensions.

40|$|How do induced {{brightness}} and darkness signals from local and remote surfaces interact {{to determine the}} final <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> percept of a target surface? An emerging theory of <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> perception posits that {{brightness and}} darkness percepts are computed by weighting and summing the induction signals generated at edges in a scene. This theory also characterizes how neighboring edges interact to modulate the gain of brightness and darkness signals induced from one another. Here we assess evidence for this edge integration theory by means of computational modeling and a psychophysical experiment. We quantitatively show how local and remote edge induction signals in disk-ring displays give rise to either contrast or assimilation effects. Spatial integration of same-polarity edge signals supports a contrast effect, whereas integration of opposite- polarity signals supports an assimilation effect, particularly when the remote induction signal is much stronger than the local induction signal. The results confirm a key prediction of edge integration theory, namely, that strong assimilation effects can lead subjects to ignore the polarity of local edge information when setting <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> matches. The conditions necessary for strong assimilation effects are also associated with greater difficulty in setting matches, suggesting that caution is required when interpreting matching data in terms of gain control. We describe several avenues for further study of contrast, assimilation, and gain control...|$|R

Color is salient design element that can influence people's behaviours and emotions {{in the interior}} space, it can also trigger specific physical and psychological responses in human beings. Therefore, its proper use in the interior space can lead to positive outcomes such as creating a healthier environment. In that regard, this research examines the effect of chromatic and <b>achromatic</b> <b>color</b> schemes on color-emotion associations in children in the interior space of a general classroom. The goal {{of this study is}} determining whether the responses caused by color are strong enough to create a positive or negative emotion in a child. Furthermore, saturation maybe more effective than hue in determining whether a color is calming or exciting, in addition, children prefer brighter and more saturated colors to less saturated ones. In that sense, high and low saturated blue, high and low saturated red as chromatic colors and high and low saturated grey and white were selected as <b>achromatic</b> <b>colors.</b> This study was conducted on eighty preschool children with 5 years of age, from two private preschools in Ankara, Turkey. Photographic simulations were used as the tool to create different views of the classrooms and the children were asked to match each view to one facial expression representing anger, sadness, neutral and happiness. The results indicated that classrooms with high saturated blue, low saturated red and white as the wall colors elicited positive emotions in the child while the rest were associated with either negative emotions or no emotions at all. by Donya Dalirnaghdeh.
