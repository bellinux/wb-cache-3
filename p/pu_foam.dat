[...] This {{is of particular}} interest in the area of polyurethane coatings, where light stability is a critical factor and is the main reason that aliphatic isocyanates are used in making polyurethane coatings. When <b>PU</b> <b>foam,</b> which is made using aromatic isocyanates, is exposed to visible light, it discolors, turning from off-white to yellow to reddish brown. It has been generally accepted that apart from yellowing, visible light has little effect on foam properties. This is especially the case if the yellowing happens on the outer portions of a large foam, as the deterioration of properties in the outer portion has little effect on the overall bulk properties of the foam itself.|$|E

The raw materials of PU, polyol and isocyanate, are conventionally derived from petroleum. Bio-based polyols are promising substitutes for petrochemical polyols due to their sustainability. This project studied water-blown polyurethane (<b>PU)</b> <b>foams</b> made from soy-polyols. The flexible bio-based <b>PU</b> <b>foams</b> were successfully produced by mixing petroleum polyol and commercial soy-polyols with different hydroxyl numbers and functionalities. The effect of hydroxyl number and functionality of soy-polyols, and the effect of tin catalyst, cross-linker levels and isocyanate index on foam properties were identified. Water-blown rigid polyurethane (<b>PU)</b> <b>foams</b> were made from 0 - 50 % soy-phosphate polyol (SPP) and 2 - 4 % water as the blowing agent. The effects of water content and isocyanate index on physical properties of SPP <b>PU</b> <b>foams</b> were investigated. Low density soy-polyol based rigid <b>PU</b> <b>foams</b> were modified with different concentrations of glass microspheres and nanoclay. The physical properties, especially the mechanical properties, were studied.

The individual models were coupled together using suitable surrogate models within MoDeNa framework. To validate the proposed model 9 foam samples were prepared using different recipes, their morphology was characterized and their thermal conductivity was measured. The difference between experimental and predicted values was comparable to experimental error.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{disadvantages}} of rigid polyurethane (PU) foams is its low thermal resistance, high flammability and high smoke production. Greatest advantage of this thermal insulation material is its low thermal conductivity (λ), which at 18 - 28 mW/(m•K) is superior to other materials. To lower the flammability of PU foams, different flame retardants (FR) are used. Usually, industrially viable are halogenated liquid FRs but recent trends in EU regulations {{show that they are}} not desirable any more. Main concern is toxicity of smoke and health hazard form volatiles in <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> materials. Development of intumescent passive fire protection for foam materials would answer problems with flammability without using halogenated FRs. It is possible to add expandable graphite (EG) into <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> structure but this increases the thermal conductivity greatly. Thus, the main advantage of <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> is lost. To decrease the flammability of PU foams, three different contents 3 %; 9 % and 15 % of EG were added to <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> formulation. Sample with 15 % of EG increased λ of <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> from 24. 0 to 30. 0 mW/(m•K). This paper describes the study where <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> developed from renewable resources is protected with thermally expandable intumescent mat from Technical Fibre Products Ltd. (TFP) as an alternative to EG added into PU material. TFP produces range of mineral fibre mats with EG that produce passive fire barrier. Two type mats were used to develop sandwich-type PU foams. Also, synergy effect of non-halogenated FR, dimethyl propyl phosphate and EG was studied. Flammability of developed materials was assessed using Cone Calorimeter equipment. Density, thermal conductivity, compression strength and modulus of elasticity were tested for developed PU foams. <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> morphology was assessed from scanning electron microscopy images...|$|E

It has been suggested that <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> may contain trace amounts of residual toluene diisocyanate (TDI) monomers and present a health risk. To address this concern, the exposure scenario and health risks posed by sleeping on a <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> mattress were evaluated. Toxicity benchmarks for key non-cancer endpoints (i. e., irritation, sensitization, respiratory tract effects) were determined by dividing points of departure by uncertainty factors. The cancer benchmark was derived using the USEPA Benchmark Dose Software. Results of previous migration and emission data of TDI from <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> were combined with conservative exposure factors to calculate upper-bound dermal and inhalation exposures to TDI as well as a lifetime average daily dose to TDI from dermal exposure. For each non-cancer endpoint, the toxicity benchmark was divided by the calculated exposure to determine the margin of safety (MOS), which ranged from 200 (respiratory tract) to 3 × 106 (irritation). Although available data indicate TDI is not carcinogenic, a theoretical excess cancer risk (1 × 10 − 7) was calculated.

The compressive, flexural, and tensile properties of MWNTs-PU foams were improved by 24, 30 and 30 %, respectively, as compared with the neat <b>PU</b> <b>foam.</b> The greatest enhancements on compressive and flexural properties were shown at the 0. 5 wt % MWNT loading, while the highest tensile stress enhancement of <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> was shown at 1 wt % MWNT loading...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} on the thermal and mechanical properties of rigid polyurethane (<b>PU)</b> <b>foam</b> from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste (of plastic drinking bottles) was conducted. The PET waste was glycolysed with ethylene glycol prior to blending with palm based-polyol (PKO-p). This blend was then reacted with 2, 4 -methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) at {{a ratio of}} 1 : 1 to form the <b>PU</b> <b>foam.</b> The incorporation of the glycolysed PET (g-PET) into the PKO-p was studied at 50, 70 and 100 % w/w loading. <b>PU</b> <b>foam</b> prepared from 100 % w/w g-PET (without PKO-p) resulted in PU with high glass transition temperature and mechanical strength. This water-blown foam has molded and core densities of 182 kg m- 3 and 179 kg m- 3, respectively, with maximum compressive stress and modulus at 396 kPa and 1920 kPa, respectively. An initial enthalpy value of 3164. 8 cal g- 1 and a glass transition temperature of 65 ºC were observed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Flexible {{polyurethane}} (<b>PU)</b> <b>foams</b> {{were prepared}} by replacing commercial petroleum-based polyether polyol with palm oil-based polyol up to 50 wt%. Palm oil was converted to polyol by transesterification reaction with glycerol using calcium oxide as a catalyst. <b>PU</b> <b>foams</b> were then prepared from reaction between mixtures of palm oil-based polyol and petrochemical polyols with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) using water as blowing agent. The morphology and physical-mechanical properties including apparent density, indentation hardness, compressive deflection coefficient or support factor, tensile strength, and tear {{strength of the}} prepared foams were characterized and compared to those of reference foam prepared using only conventional petrochemical polyols. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the cellular structures of all the prepared foams were semi-open and the cell size decreased with higher amount of palm oil-based polyol. The apparent densities and the compressive deflection coefficient of the <b>PU</b> <b>foams</b> increased with the increasing amount of palm oil-based polyol, while the indentation hardness showed the opposite tendency. Furthermore, the obtained foam modified with palm oil-based polyol of 20 wt % {{were found to have}} the highest tensile and tear strengths...|$|R
40|$|In bone tissue reconstruction, {{the use of}} {{engineered}} constructs {{created by}} mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that differentiate and proliferate into three-dimensional porous scaffolds is an appealing alternative to autologous and heterologous bone grafts. Scaffolds considered in this work are represented by polyurethane (<b>PU)</b> <b>foams.</b> Two <b>PU</b> <b>foams</b> (EC- 1 and EC- 2) were synthesized and characterized for morphology, mechanical properties and in vitro interaction with the osteoblast-like cell line MG 63 and MSCs from human bone marrow. EC- 1 and EC- 2 showed similar densities (0. 20 g cm^ 3) with different morphologies: EC- 1 showed a more homogeneous pore size (average diameter = 691 um) and distribution, with a 35...|$|R
50|$|Mixed physical/chemical {{blowing agents}} {{are used to}} produce {{flexible}} <b>PU</b> <b>foams</b> with very low densities. Here both the chemical and physical blowing are used in tandem to balance each other out with respect to thermal energy released and absorbed, minimizing temperature rise. Otherwise excessive exothermic heat because of high loading of a physical blowing agent can cause thermal degradation of a developing thermoset or polyurethane material. For instance, to avoid this in polyurethane systems isocyanate and water (which react to form carbon dioxide) are used in combination with liquid carbon dioxide (which boils to give gaseous form) {{in the production of}} very low density flexible <b>PU</b> <b>foams</b> for mattresses.|$|R
