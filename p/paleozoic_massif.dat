50|$|Besides being {{considered}} by some the westernmost tip of the Pyrenees (rivalling with the coastal mountain Jaizkibel), it stands out as a distinctive range of rocky prominences and gullies, otherwise uncommon. The conspicuous formations of Aiako Harria consist of a <b>Paleozoic</b> <b>massif</b> {{with some of the}} oldest materials cropping out currently in the Basque Country. Later orogeny pushed a mass of igneous rocks to the surface, so metamorphosing the superficial Paleozoic materials as it tore its way out of them, which yielded the present day granitic landscape.|$|E
40|$|An {{intriguing}} paradox in European tectonics is {{that present}} intracontinental seismicity {{seems to be}} broadly distributed, whereas past deformation was restricted to sedimentary basin areas. These basins were created by repeated Mesozoic rifting and later affected by pervasive Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary inversion. We propose that the change from localized deformation to distributed seismicity reflects changes in strength due to an interplay between Neogene thermal perturbations by mantle plumes and stress-induced intraplate deformation. As a result, inversion tectonics in the North Sea Basin area ceased and gave way to lithospheric folding, which is most pronounced in onshore <b>Paleozoic</b> <b>massif</b> areas. Thermomechanical models demonstrate that this important transition in the mode and distribution of intraplate deformation {{can be explained by}} a strength reversal resulting from the combined effects of changes in Moho depth due to the transition from rifting to inversion and heating by mantle plumes. © 2005 Geological Society of America...|$|E
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{profiles of}} 24 rivers of 3 rd to 5 th order have been analyzed {{in order to}} recognize the regional tectonic differentiation pattern of the Ardenne, a <b>Paleozoic</b> <b>massif</b> of NW Europe. Data collected exclusively from 1 / 25, 000 topographic maps were used to define a set of parameters related to the geometry of the profile and proxies for river bedload and drainage area. Validation of the proxy defined for the bedloadrdischarge ratio demonstrates its potential use for inter-river comparison based on its value at the river mouth; it is however inadequate to estimate the ratio changes along a given stream course. This proxy has been computed to estimate the portion accounted for by hydrodynamic factors in the river bed profiling. Thus, outliers to the correlation function linking it to the river bed gradient have been considered as undergoing other influences, principally of lithologic or tectonic origin. Most indicative of the computed profile parameters are those related to the concavity of the profile. Four more or less regional longitudinal profile types are recognized which are partly determined by differential tectonic movement. The combined analysis of all the parameters confirms the current uplift of the NE Ardenne and points to a subsidence of the Namur area with respect to its SW and SE surroundings. Whether periglacial or tectonic in origin, the Upper Pleistocene lowering of a local base-level has also been identified in the Famenne. Another conclusion {{of this study is}} that in order to evidence tectonic influences and to avoid any misinterpretation in a region of complex geologic and geomorphic history and moderate tectonic activity, it is essential to consider a number of parameters and to consider their significance within the framework of detailed geologic setting and morphogenetic history.

40|$|Clastic sediments of {{the early}} (?) to late Jurassic (Oxfordian) San Cayetano Formation of western Cuba are {{interpreted}} to reflect syn-rift sedimentation coeval with the breakup of Pangaea. This sedimentary unit is the oldest known in the Guaniguanico Mountains and Cuba. U-Pb SHRIMP dating of 19 detrital zircon grains from two samples of San Cayetano micaceous sandstone provided concordant ages ranging from 398 to 2479 Ma. The oldest zircon population is of Paleoproterozoic age (2479 – 1735 Ma), but most zircons have early Mesoproterozoic and Grenvillian ages (1556 – 985 Ma), whereas still younger ages are Pan-African (561 Ma), Ordovician (451 Ma) and early Devonian (398 Ma). We discuss the possible origin of these zircons and conclude that the most likely source terrain(s) are Precambrian and early <b>Paleozoic</b> <b>massifs</b> in northern South America (Colombia and/or Venezuela) and the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. This is compatible with paleogeographic reconstructions of the Caribbean that imply that sediments of the San Cayetano Formation were still part of the disintegrating supercontinent Pangea in pre mid-Oxfordian time.

40|$|The Paleozoic stratigraphic {{succession}} in the Catalonian Coastal Ranges {{spans the}} interval from Cambrian(?) to Carboniferous, {{with only one}} break, separating the pre-Carboniferous part of the sequence from the Carboniferous. The oldest rocks exposed form a sequence of schists, fine grained sandstones, gneisses (laminar pre-Hercynian intrusions), marbles, orto- and para-amphibolites and calcsilicate rocks. comparison with other localities iuggests an Early Cambrian age (or perhaps in part older). Upwards the sequence becomes more monotonous andconsists only of schists (or slates where themetamorphic grade is lower) and thin fine-grained sandstone layers (Cambrian-Ordovician). Still higher in the sequence, an altemation of greywackes and slates is found, with interlayered mud-supported conglomerates at its lower part and acid volcanic rocks which occur throughout the whole sequence. This part of the sequence has provided the oldest faunas known in the Catalonian Coastal Ranges, which indicate the Caradoc. Finally, in its uppermost part, the Ordovician sequence contains some thin limestone layers that contain Ashgill faunas. The Silurian, from Llandovery to Lower Ludlow, consists of black graptolitic shales with dolerite sills, whilst the upper Ludlow, Pridolian and Devonian consist of nodular limestones and marls withpelagic and hemipelagic faunas. The youngest Devonian faunas found correspond in general to the Emsian. The existence of a gap at this point of the sequence suggests the possibility {{that part of the}} Devonian could have been eroded. The Carboniferous is characterized by a thick culm sequence (Visean to Westphalian?), resting on thin chert and limestone layers (Tournaisian and Visean).

40|$|The Moroccan passive margin {{has been}} the {{objective}} {{of a variety of}} studies to investigate the petroleum potential and to locate play systems in the offshore and partly onshore Agadir-Essaouira basin. These basins are largely dependent on the structural development of Atlas mountains, being characterised by different phases of tectonic rifting, regional shortening and differential exhumation and subsidence patterns. The evolution of salt-cored anticlines in the Western High Atlas are possibly a key in understanding the tectonic history of the area especially {{in the context of the}} observed vertical movements. This study has the aim to provide additional information on timing and evolution of salt-cored anticlines in the Western High Atlas, to get a better understating of folding mechanisms related to vertical movements in the hinterland. Their role in controlling sedimentation pathways is investigated, since the basin links the <b>paleozoic</b> <b>massifs</b> as a sediment source and the offshore as sediment sink system. A new modeling technique was applied to two salt-cored anticlines, the Jbel Amsittene and the Imouzzer anticline, combining remote sensing geological and structural data, integrated in a 3 D structural modeling environment (Gocad). This allows for the extraction of the thickness distribution for the identification of pre-Alpine locations of sediment depocenters. Further, the tectonic history of folding, using 2 D section balancing (Move) and 3 D unfolding and strain analysis (Gocad), is investigated. In a small field study, the large scale modeling results are compared to small scale field observations. Salt and folding mechanisms in the context of the geological setting and history are discussed and their impact on Jurassic to Early Cretaceous sediment pathways are outlined. The expression of folding on the sea-floor and the impact of the presence of pre-orogenic anticlines on the Alpine folding processes are debated. The results suggest Early to Middle Jurassic salt activities potentially initiated by pre-orogenic exhumation in the hinterland and subsidence towards the offshore, resulting in a hydraulic head gradient causing salt flow. Another scenario are pre-orogenic phases of tectonic shortening or salt flow by increased thermal activities. The topography that was created certainly controlled the sediment distribution of passive margin sands into the offshore basin. Jurassic salt mobilisation also had an impact on the Alpine-folding process which might have resulted in a connection of smaller isolated salt diapirs leading to a variety of strike orientations of folds in the basins.

40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{deals with}} the {{long-term}} geomorphology of the <b>Paleozoic</b> Ardenne–Oesling <b>massif</b> of S Belgium and the landforms that currently attest the very long persistence and high resistance to erosion of landscape elements created as far back in time as the Lower Cretaceous in a region of predominantly continental regime and constant low to moderate elevation since the Permian. We first present recent results regarding the antiquity of kaolinic weathering mantles preserved in four sites on or close to the plateau surfaces characteristic of the Ardennian landscape, showing that they record at least three main weathering phases, namely in the Early Cretaceous (extending in the early Late Cretaceous), the Late Paleocene, and the Early Miocene. Then, having provided a working definition of the erosion surface and listed criteria helping recognize them in the landscape, {{we focus on the}} Hautes Fagnes massif, the highest NE part of the Ardenne–Oesling. We describe the geometric and sedimentary evidence that allow one to recognize a succession of four erosion surfaces formed during the Cretaceous and the Cenozoic and reconstruct the morphogenetic evolution of the area that responded to the variable interplay of the marine transgression-regression, climatic, and tectonic controls. Finally, we present the few estimates of long-term denudation rates available for the Ardenne massif, fission track and cosmogenic nuclide studies both suggesting Cenozoic denudation rates in the order of a few 10 m/Myr, and comment on their compatibility with field observations...|$|R
40|$|The "Celica-Lancones" forearc Basin of Southern Ecuador and Northern Peru {{is located}} between the <b>Paleozoic</b> Amotape-Tahuin <b>Massif</b> {{to the west}} and NW and the {{continental}} volcanic arc to the east and SE. The study of nine sections and exhaustive sampling of the poorly fossiliferous, mainly clastic Cretaceous deposits of the Basin allowed us to define five distinct series, which display two depositional periods. The first period corresponds to the development of an Early(?) and Middle Albian carbonate shelf, interrupted during Late Albian times by the creation of a tectonically generated trough filled by turbidites of Late Albian-Coniacian age. Geological mapping indicates that this "Celica-Lancones Basin s. s. " includes distinct tectonic units, characterized by distinct early Late Cretaceous stratigraphic series and separated by major faults. These units can be grouped into two main paleogeographic domains. The southeastern one comprises mainly volcaniclastic deposits, whereas the northwestern domain exhibits quartz-rich deposits. Between Early Coniacian and Middle Campanian times, the "Celica-Lancones Basin s. s" forearc trough was deformed and eroded {{as a result of the}} Late Cretaceous "Peruvian" tectonic phase. The second period corresponds to the latest Cretaceous, during which a new forearc basin was created (Paita-Yunguilla Basin), which is much wider and strikes obliquely with respect to the Celica-Lancones Basin. The sediments of the Paita-Yunguilla Basin exhibit a comparable succession of Campanian-Maastrichtian age throughout the area and conceal the tectonic juxtaposition of the early Late Cretaceous tectonic units. The occurrence of thick Early(?) Maastrichtian coarse-grained conglomerates and breccias express a new significant tectonic event. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{pioneering}} studies of Van der Voo [Tectonophysics 7 (1969) 5] and Van der Voo and Boessenkool [J. Geophys. Res. 78 (1973) 5118], paleomagnetism of Permo-Triassic redbeds and volcanics from the Western Pyrenees has furnished important contributions for delineating the Mesozoic {{boundary between the}} Iberian and Eurasian plates. In this paper, we present a new paleomagnetic study focussed on Triassic red beds (23 sites) of the <b>Paleozoic</b> Basque <b>Massifs</b> (PBM). The {{aim of this study}} is to complement previous studies done in those massifs to better constrain the complex kinematics of the Western Pyrenees. Two stable magnetic components have been isolated: (1) a dual polarity, pre-folding magnetisation carried by specular hematite; and (2) a secondary, normal polarity component also carried by hematite. Our data confirm both the origin and the rotation pattern of the primary remanence described in previous works. Nevertheless, field tests performed on the secondary component do not confirm the earlier interpretations by Schott and Peres [Tectonophysics 156 (1988) 75] as they indicate a synfolding nature of the remagnetisation instead of a post-folding origin. We consider that the secondary component is better explained if a Cretaceous age is considered. The presence of such remagnetisation in the western Pyrenees strengthens the widespread occurrence of similar remagnetisation events reported in northern Iberia in connection with the extensional tectonic events that occurred during Cretaceous times. A comparison of the rotations recorded by the Triassic component and by the remagnetisation indicate that the Paleozoic units underwent variable tectonic rotations before the remagnetisation was acquired, most likely in connection with the counterclockwise rotation of Iberia with respect to Eurasia. These results favour that the Mesozoic plate boundary between the Iberian and Eurasian plates was a wide domain of distributed deformation and therefore contradict previous interpretations claiming for a discrete plate boundary...|$|R
40|$|Sardinia is a {{major centre}} of {{diversity}} of Anchusa, but the systematics, phylogenetic relationships and conservation status of the taxa endemic to the island are still poorly known mainly because of their remarkable rarity. We present a study on these endemics {{based on the results}} of field research focusing on the distribution, the number and size of the populations, the characteristics of the habitat and the factors of threat. Combined with observations on aspects of reproductive biology, on wild populations and cultivated plants, we evaluate the conservation status of the taxa and propose Red List IUCN categories of vulnerability. Original descriptions, nomenclatural types and karyological data are added. The following Anchusa taxa are endemic to Sardinia: A. capellii, A. crispa ssp. crispa, A. crispa ssp. maritima, A. formosa, A. littorea, A. sardoa and A. montelinasana sp. nov. The latter is described, based on the discovery of a morphologically distinct entity on a mountain in southwest Sardinia. Anchusa littorea was found at a single site after c. 25 years fromthe last record and 7 years ofunsuccessfulfield research; this species is at the brink of extinction due to the extremely reduced size of the only remaining population. Our complete collection of taxa allowed an analysis of phylogenetic relationships based on DNA sequences from the ITS 1 ribosomal genome. In spite of the low variation, this marker produced Maximum Parsimony and Neighbour-Joining phylograms suggesting that the group is monophyletic and that the split between the two clades of the mountain and coastal endemics has been a key evolutionary event. We assume the three mountain species to be relict schizoendemics ancestral to the coastal taxa, and the <b>Paleozoic</b> siliceous <b>massifs</b> of central and south Sardinia as the centre of origin of the group...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Neogene times, {{the whole}} Mediterranean Sea {{was the center}} of an intense magmatic activity. This post-collisional {{magmatism}} produced a large amount of volcanic edifices through the Alpine belts, together with some intrusives. These plutonic bodies can be associated with skarn-type mineralization, well-known in Elba Island or Serifos Island (Cyclades), where they are generally exhumed by detachment faults. In Morocco, the plutons hosted by the Beni Bou Ifrour massif are connected to the biggest skarn-type iron concentrations of the country (production > 60 Mt, reserves ≈ 25 Mt). The purpose of this work is to explain the late uplift of this massif and subsequent exhumation of the intrusives. As a final product of the Africa-Eurasia plate convergence since ca. 70 Ma, the Rif Mountains constitute the westernmost segment of the Mediterranean Alpine belts. In the oriental part of this range, volcanic summits and <b>Paleozoic</b> to Mesozoic <b>massifs</b> outcrop in the surrounding Mio-Pliocene plains. The Beni Bou Ifrour massif, in the Nador province, consists in a dome-shaped folded Mesozoic series (Domerian to Barremian) affected by a slight epizonal regional metamorphism (ca. 14 - 12 Ma), dislocated by Neogene NE-SW faults and eventually sealed by upper Miocene transgressive sediments. The hosted intrusives (7. 58 ± 0. 03 Ma; Duggen et al., 2005) are the plutonic equivalents to the potassic calc-alkaline lavas (andesites mainly) from the surrounding "satellite" volcanic massifs. They turn out to stand in higher topographic position than the younger shoshonitic lavas of the neighboring Gourougou stratovolcano (6. 12 ± 0. 01 Ma; Duggen et al., 2005). Previous studies have attributed this uplift to the action of normal faults (pull-apart basins; Guillemin & Houzay, 1982), thrusting (Kerchaoui, 1985; 1995) or even of a caldeira resurgence (El Bakkali, 1995). To discriminate against those exhumation mechanisms, field work has been performed, coming along with new cross-sections to illustrate the geometry of the Beni Bou Ifrour massif. A paleomagnetism campaign was conducted, to determine if the plutonic intrusions have been tilted since their emplacement. Apatite fission tracks and 40 Ar- 39 Ar dating allow us to estimate the exhumation age of the igneous bodies, and therefore add chronological constraints to the tectonic model. Geochemical study has also been performed on the magmatic rocks, and added to an extensive dataset (El Bakkali, 1995; Kerchaoui, 1995; Duggen et al., 2005). The existence of a magmatic chamber below the Beni Bou Ifrour dome will thus be discussed. Once established, the tectonic model of the Beni Bou Ifrour massif will help to precise the emplacement of the mineralized bodies and to integrate the iron-skarn metallogenesis within the structural evolution of the Rif orogenic segment...|$|R
