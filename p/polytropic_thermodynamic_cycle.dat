40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to study the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycles</b> in an inertance tube pulse tube refrigerator (ITPTR) by means of CFD method. The simulation results show that gas parcels working {{in different parts of}} ITPTR undergo different <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycles.</b> The net effects of those <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycles</b> are pumping heat from the low temperature part to the high temperature part of the system. The simulation results also show that under different frequencies of piston movement, the gas parcels working in the same part of the system will undergo the same type of <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>cycles.</b> The simulated thermal cycles are compared with those thermodynamic analysis results from a reference. Comparisons show that both CFD simulations and theoretical analysis predict the same type of thermal cycles at the same location.
