2500|$|The V20 Camry {{originated}} {{from a time}} at Toyota when considerable cost and attention to detail was engineered into its cars such as high-quality materials and build quality to transcend the competition. Sedans retained the V10's rear quarter glass; however, the styling is less angular than before. To appease export customers, styling {{lost some of its}} Japanese legacy in its transition to a more Americanized design, with a softer and sleeker silhouette. Toyota designed the body with aerodynamics in mind, with performance of [...] for the sedan. V20 also features headlamps and a grille that are sculptured into a gently curved hood that partially conceal the windscreen wipers, wind splitters up the ends of the windscreen, near-flush glass, and a third door seal to close the gap between the body and window frames. Body dimensions were largely unchanged from the previous model, including an identical wheelbase, although length increases [...] Basic sub-skin hardware is also closely related, including the platform and the fully independent suspension with a strut and a coil spring at each corner and an anti-roll bar at each end. Noise isolation is improved by mounting the rear suspension on a subframe akin to the Toyota Celica (T160) that had now switched to Camry-based mechanicals. As before, the braking package encompasses ventilated discs up front, conventional drums in the rear, upgraded to rear discs in some cars. The braking system has a tandem-type booster and diagonally divided hydraulic circuits. Wagons receive a load-sensing <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> that grants greater braking pressure when laden and prevents wheel lockup under light payloads. Entry-level V20 wheel size increases from 13 to 14inches.|$|E
50|$|A <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> is a valve {{that relies}} on the statics to supply a reduced {{pressure}} to an output line.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{example is}} where spring load applies a {{reducing}} force {{so that the}} output pressure is reduced. <b>Proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> are frequently used in cars to reduce the brake fluid pressure to the rear brakes.|$|R
50|$|The {{fire started}} before dawn on February 1, 1997, at Aisin Seiki Co.'s Factory No. 1 in Kariya, Japan. The {{cause of the}} fire was {{reportedly}} unknown. The factory produced brake fluid <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> (P-valves) which help prevent skidding by controlling the pressure on rear brakes, and {{are used in the}} braking system of all Toyota vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} system consists of unequal length control arms with forged aluminium arms and cast aluminium uprights, coil springs and anti-roll bars on both axles. Dampers are either fixed-rate {{and set up}} for handling or [...] "Skyhook" [...] adaptive. The Skyhook system uses aluminium-bodied gas dampers, allowing automatic and continuous damping rate adjustment by means of <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A brake <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> {{was fitted}} to all 4 and 6 {{cylinder}} Centuras from factory {{to compensate for}} weight transfer during braking [...] When the car [...] "nose-dived" [...] under heavy braking, a mechanical link connected to the <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> reduced the brake pressure on the rear wheels, {{to prevent them from}} locking up and causing {{the back of the car}} to slide around. This was typical of many European cars of the time but uncommon in Australian cars.|$|E

5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{configuration of}} the Arena consists {{of a combination of}} independent MacPherson strut suspensions from a saloon car at the front, and torsion beam, leaf sprung suspensions at the rear. Other modifications include the use of a rigid rear axle, an uprated front stabiliser bar, and 14" [...] front ventilated discs and 9" [...] rear drum brakes with load sensing <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> (LSPV), optimised weight distribution and the use of reinforced high profile tyres. Lotus Engineering provided additional ride and handling enhancements.|$|R
2500|$|The Boeing 737 was deiced with {{a mixture}} of heated water and monopropylene glycol by American Airlines, under a ground service {{agreement}} with Air Florida. That agreement specified that covers for the pitots/static ports and engine inlets had to be used, but the American Airlines employees did not comply with those rules. [...] Two different operators—who chose widely different mixture percentages—deiced the left and right sides of the plane. Subsequent testing of the deicing truck showed that [...] "the mixture dispensed differed substantially from the mixture selected" [...] (18% actual vs. 30% selected). The inaccurate mixture {{was the result of the}} replacement of the standard Trump nozzle, [...] "…which is specially modified and calibrated, with a non-modified, commercially available nozzle." [...] The operator had no means to determine if the <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> were operating properly because no [...] "mix monitor" [...] was installed on the nozzle.|$|R
50|$|A <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{pressure}} to the rear brakes under heavy braking. This limits the rear braking to reduce the chances of locking up the rear brakes, and greatly lessens the chances of a spin.|$|E
5000|$|... 124 Sport Coupés were modern in chassis {{and engine}} design. Braking was via four 9" [...] disc brakes with a front/rear weight-sensitive <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve.</b> It {{also had a}} sealed cooling system, viscous fan clutch and a toothed timing belt for the twin-cam motor, the first mass-produced engine to feature this {{instead of the usual}} chain-drive.|$|E
50|$|Safety wise, the Proton Juara came {{equipped}} with a reinforced body structure with anti-intrusion bars, as well as front ventilated disc brakes and rear drum brakes respectively.

5000|$|A heavily {{redesigned}} [...] "Type 2" [...] variant (internally designated Typ 53B) {{went on sale}} in 1981, {{although it}} remained on the A1 platform. The second generation Scirocco, still assembled on behalf of Volkswagen by Karmann of Osnabrück (in the same factory as the first generation Scirocco), was first shown at the 1981 Geneva Salon in March that year. Designed by Volkswagen's own internal design team, the new car featured increased front and rear headroom, increased luggage space {{and a reduction in}} the coefficient of drag. One unique feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined [...] "SCIROCCO" [...] script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.|$|R

50|$|More complaints, accidents, injuries, and {{lawsuits}} ensued, including cars which {{had actually been}} modified according to the recall and cars from the 1981 model year, causing NHTSA to pressure GM for further action, preferably a recall of all 1.1 million vehicles in the 1980 model year for replacement of both the <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> and the linings and drums. GM, however, responded in 1983 with a voluntary recall of only all manual transmission vehicles of that year and the very earliest automatic transmission cars, a total of fewer than 250,000, including those in the first recall. NHTSA responded by suing GM, demanding a recall of the entire 1980 model year, claiming the company had known {{as far back as}} 1978 of the cars' dangerous tendency to lock the rear brakes but had provided misleading and incomplete answers to NHTSA's investigation. In 1987, however, the presiding judge dismissed the suit, ruling that NHTSA had filed it prematurely and without the proper procedure of developing conclusive evidence and holding investigative hearings, relying mainly on anecdotal evidence. NHTSA had logged 4,282 complaints, including 1,417 accidents, 427 injuries and 18 fatalities.|$|R

50|$|During the {{production}} {{life of the}} Comanche, six different transmissions were offered, manufactured by Aisin, Chrysler, and Peugeot. Aisin provided the AX-4 (four-speed), AX-5 and AX-15 (five-speed overdrive) manual transmissions, along with the AW-4 four-speed automatic that was used beginning in 1987. This is the same Warner transmission used in early- to mid-1990s Toyota 4Runners with the 3.0 and some 22re 4wd. The AX-15 was phased in to replace the Peugeot BA-10/5 five-speed {{that had been used}} from 1987 until mid-1989 behind the 4.0 L I6 engine. The Comanche came equipped with a weight sensing rear brake <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Pumps: Majority {{of systems}} utilize two {{two-cylinder}} piston pumps, {{one for each}} buffer, combining the output of both in a mixing chamber. Some simpler systems use a single peristaltic pump which draws both buffers from separate reservoirs through a <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> and mixing chamber. In either case the system allows the fraction of each buffer entering the column to be continuously varied. The flow rate can go from a few milliliters per minute in bench-top systems to liters per minute for industrial scale purifications. The wide flow range makes it suitable both for analytical and preparative chromatography.|$|E

50|$|Suspension was {{as on the}} Primula. At {{the front}} it {{consisted}} of A-arms and an upper transverse leaf spring, which doubled both as upper link and an anti-roll bar, {{as well as providing}} the attachment point for double-acting hydraulic dampers; at the rear there was a beam axle on longitudinal semi-elliptic leaf springs, plus double-acting hydraulic dampers.Steering was by means of a rack and pinion mechanism positioned beneath the transverse leaf spring and behind the engine.The braking system comprised four disk brakes, front-rear split hydraulic circuits, a vacuum servo and <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> on the rear axle.|$|E

50|$|On the VTX1800, Honda updated its linked braking feature, {{instead of}} having the usual {{separate}} hand and foot brakes, the hand brake operated two-thirds of the front pistons while the foot operated the other third in front and all the rear via a <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve.</b> The induction system was Honda's programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) system using a Manifold Air Pressure (MAP) sensor in the small throttle areas until the standard throttle position sensor (Alpha N) took over at greater throttle opening values. The VTX1800 also had an emission control system that utilized air injection and catalytic converter controlled by the ECU to reduce hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen to levels surpassing emissions standards.|$|E
5000|$|These <b>proportions</b> vary as <b>valves</b> or slides are operated; {{the above}} numbers are for {{instruments}} with the valves open or the slide fully in.

40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{drivability}} and increase safety {{a major part}} of Scania’svehicles is fitted with a retarder. The retarder is a complementary brake system that assists the vehicles mechanical brakes. When running a retarder some oil leakage can occur. The main source to the leakage is oil sump ventilation but there is also some contribution from the solenoid valve block that controls the retarder. Test results from the test rig shows that with rather simple methods the oil leakage in form of oil mist can be captured. The efficiency of for instance concept 1 with half the volume and a chicane interior was as high as 99 to 100 %. For the concept 2 with the expanded metal filter the efficiency was in the order of 96 to 100 %. From testing it has also become clear {{that there is a problem}} to feed the oil back into the oil sump. Initial tests shows that the retarder is rather sensitive regarding the placing of the feedback channel. It is considered that the best option is to only use the feedback channel that enters the internal drain of the retarder. Measurements show that the airflow in the tube from the accumulator could reach velocities up to 67 m/s. It is considered that the best solution is to have two separate chambers, one for the accumulator and one for the oil sump ventilation, the safety <b>valve</b> and the <b>proportion</b> <b>valve.</b> The reason for this is that the combination of oil in a chamber together with high airflow from the accumulator is disastrous and the retarder leaks far worse compared to original. The conclusion is therefore that it is important to separate air from the accumulator from places where oil can occur. Tests also revealed that the size of an external volume is not of any great importance when it comes to colleting oil. There was no significant difference in between of using a volume of 0. 64 l or 0. 19 l. However regarding overfilling it is favorable to have a larger volume since this increases the retarder’s capability to withstand oil leakage when it is overfilled...|$|R
60|$|In a Young Specimen, {{with its}} capitulum, {{together}} with the peduncle, only 1/10th of an inch long, the scuta, terga, and carina are very large in <b>proportion</b> to the <b>valves</b> of the lower whorl. The latter project more, and are externally more pointed, as in the genus Pollicipes. The rostrum is well developed; the infra-median latera, in proportion, are the least of all the valves. The carina is straight and pointed, and not, relatively to the scuta, quite so long. The scuta are rather broader in proportion to their length, which would naturally follow from less having been added to their apices,--these valves at first growing only downwards. The membrane covering and connecting the valves is furnished with long thin spines.|$|R
5000|$|The six {{cylinder}} engines were {{fitted with}} a new Carter carburetor. A vacuum operated “Fuel Pacer” was offered as an option, the device using a flashing light to assist the driver in avoiding fuel wastage. This light was initially on the right-hand guard, but was later fitted to the instrument panel. Additional safety features included a pressure <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> in the rear brake circuit, power-boosted brakes and hazard warning lights. Indicator, headlight dipping, headlight flashing and windscreen wiper controls were now housed in a steering column stalk.

50|$|Because the DIRAVI {{system is}} much more {{sensitive}} than conventional systems, {{something must be done}} to prevent the driver over-controlling at high speeds. This is the job of the heart shaped centring cam inside the unit. A pressure loaded piston with a roller on the end runs against the edge of this cam. This pressure comes from a centrifugal governor <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> driven from the gearbox (on manual gearboxes - on automatic gearboxes the gearbox's internal governor pressure controls the centring pressure). At low speeds, the centring piston pressure is 290 psig, to provide a light degree of self centring when parking etc. Proportionally the self centring pressure rises to a maximum of about 800 psig. at 80 km/h, at which self centring forces become a maximum, stiffening the steering but not excessively so.|$|E

50|$|Honda’s first street {{motorcycle}} with {{a combined}} braking system (then called Unified Braking) was the 1983 GL1100. This system was derived from a 1970s RCB1000 world endurance race bike. Honda made several variations of the LBS system with differing levels of complexity and integration. The Honda CBR1000F and CBR1100XX and VFR800 featured what Honda called LBS II (now called Dual CBS), a system where both levers would activate both brakes through a system of secondary pistons and proportioning/delay valves. One front brake caliper was connected to a secondary master cylinder, and the caliper was allowed to rotate slightly to apply pressure to the piston in that secondary master cylinder. Braking force was translated into pressure that {{was sent to the}} rear brake cylinder. Only the two outer pistons in the front brake calipers were directly activated by the brake lever; the center piston received pressure from the rear pedal via the <b>proportioning</b> and delay <b>valve.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of valvulotomes during in situ bypass surgery. DesignA randomized prospective blinded study. Materials and methodsThirty PAD patients scheduled for infrainguinal greater saphenous vein bypass were randomized to use of adjustable or fixed valvulotomes for valve destruction. Valvulotomy was performed after construction of the proximal anastomosis. The efficacy of valve destruction was determined by angioscopy after completion of the distal anastomosis by a separate blinded examiner. ResultsA total of 123 valves were evaluated, 61 after use of an adjustable and 62 with a fixed valvulotome. There was no difference (p=. 88) in number of retained valves {{between the two groups}} (n= 16, 17, respectively). The majority of incompletely destroyed valves were found in the proximal parts of the graft (46 %, 13 out of 28). The primary patency at 30 days was 100 and 79 %, respectively, p=. 09).

40|$|Background—Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) {{remains the}} leading cause of {{acquired}} heart disease in children worldwide. No therapeutic agent has been shown to alter the clinical outcome of the acute illness. Immunological mechanisms appear {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of ARF. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a proven immunomodulator, may benefit cardiac conditions of an autoimmune nature. We investigated whether IVIG modified the natural history of ARF by reducing the extent and severity of carditis. Methods and Results—This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluated IVIG in patients with a first episode of rheumatic fever, stratifying patients by the presence and severity of carditis before randomization. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 1 g/kg IVIG on days 1 and 2 and 0. 4 g/kg on days 14 and 28, or they received a placebo infusion. Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic evaluation was performed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 26, and 52 weeks. Fifty-nine patients were treated, of whom 39 had carditis (including 4 subclinical) and/or migratory polyarthritis (n 539). There was no difference between groups in the rate of normalization of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or acute-phase proteins at the 6 -week follow-up. On echocardiography, 59 % in the IVIG group and 69 % in the placebo group had carditis at baseline. There was no significant difference in the cardiac outcome, including the <b>proportion</b> of <b>valves</b> involved, or in the severity of valvar regurgitation at 1 year.
