40|$|AIM: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the scope of practice, lesion {{occurrence}} and utilisation of referral-based hospital and private practice oral medicine and oral pathology (OMP) services in Australia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of patients referred to a hospital (n= 500) and private (nbequals; 1104) OMP clinic were audited. For each patient, the following parameters were recorded: age, gender, source of referral, reason for referral, site of lesion/condition if applicable, medical and drug history, diagnostic services utilised, clinical and histopathological diagnoses rendered, medications prescribed and further treatment required. RESULTS: A majority of the referrals were generated by general dental practitioners. The most commonly seen problems were epithelial hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis, oral candidosis, oral lichen planus, xerostomia, recurrent aphthous ulcers and burning mouth syndrome. OMP specialists requested diagnostic imaging for 13 % of hospital and 9. 42 % of <b>private</b> <b>patients,</b> diagnostic biopsies were required for 18. 4 % of hospital and 19. 3 % of <b>private</b> <b>patients,</b> blood tests were ordered for 14. 4 % of hospital and 12. 13 % of <b>private</b> <b>patients,</b> while medications were prescribed for approximately 36 % of hospital and 51 % of <b>private</b> <b>patients.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to detail the scope of practice, lesion occurrence and utilisation of services offered by OMP specialists in Australia. The demand for OMP services is strong...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the pattern of}} presenting visual acuities at an eye center in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Study Design: Retrospective chart review Methods: A retrospective review of patient records attending a private referral eye center providing services for company patients {{and the general public}} in the region. Information was obtained from computerized medical records of 6533 patients who attended the center for various eye concerns in a 5 -year period (January 1998 to December 2002). Results: A total of 6533 patients were seen in this 5 -year period of which 2472 (37. 8 &#x 0025;) were company patients and 4061 (62. 2 &#x 0025;). were <b>private</b> <b>patients.</b> There were 3879 males (59. 4 &#x 0025;) and 2654 females (40. 6 &#x 0025;). A visual acuity of 6 / 6 or better was seen in 50. 8 &#x 0025; of the patients. In 76. 6 &#x 0025; of patients, a visual acuity of 6 / 18 or better was recorded. There were 21. 4 &#x 0025; of patients in the low vision group. Bilateral blindness occurred in 2. 1 &#x 0025; of patients. Monocular blindness occurred in 3. 7 &#x 0025; of patients. Low vision occurred in 16. 9 &#x 0025; of company patients and 24. 1 &#x 0025; of <b>private</b> <b>patients.</b> Bilateral blindness occurred in 0. 9 &#x 0025; of company patients and 2. 7 &#x 0025; of <b>private</b> <b>patients,</b> while monocular blindness occurred in 1. 2 &#x 0025; of company patients and 5. 2 &#x 0025; of <b>private</b> <b>patients.</b> The main ocular problems were refractive error, glaucoma, conjunctivitis, headaches, ocular trauma, retina and related pathologies, cataract, uveitis, pterygium and corneal problems. Conclusion: The incidence of low vision and blindness is high in the oil-producing area of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Low vision and blindness were more common in <b>private</b> <b>patients</b> than in company patients...|$|R
