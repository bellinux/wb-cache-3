40|$|In this Master’s Thesis, {{different}} methods for calculating thermal rating of industrial gear units are introduced. Thermal rating is calculated by estimating <b>power</b> losses and <b>cooling</b> <b>power</b> of the gearbox. Calculation methods for power losses introduced {{in this work}} are mostly standardized methods, {{which are based on}} work done by European researchers, universities and research centers. Background for calculation of <b>cooling</b> <b>power</b> is presented by using simplified equations for heat transfer. To find a suitable calculation method for <b>power</b> losses, <b>cooling</b> <b>power</b> and thermal rating of Santasalo Gear’s gear units, three different types of gears were calculated. Calculations were done with {{different methods}} and results were compared and discussed. It was shown that calculated values for <b>power</b> loss, <b>cooling</b> <b>power</b> and thermal rating vary significantly between different methods. Conclusion was, that calculation of thermal rating according to standard ISO/TR 14179 - 2 is suitable for Santasalo’s gear units, but the accuracy and reliability should be confirmed with test runs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Data centers contain IT, <b>power</b> and <b>cooling</b> infras-tructures, each {{of which}} is {{typically}} managed independently. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach that couples the management of IT, <b>power</b> and <b>cooling</b> infrastructures to improve the efficiency of data center operations. Our approach considers application per-formance management, dynamic workload migration/consolidation, and <b>power</b> and <b>cooling</b> control to “right-provision ” computing, <b>power</b> and <b>cooling</b> resources for a given workload. We have implemented a prototype of this for virtualized environments and conducted experiments in a production data center. Our experimental results demonstrate that the integrated solution is practical and can reduce energy consumption of servers by 35 % and cooling by 15 %, without degrading application performance.
