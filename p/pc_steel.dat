40|$|Performance of {{different}} tunnel lining materials under internal blast loading is compared {{in the present}} study through three-dimensional nonlinear finite element analyses. A tunnel in sandy soil has been considered for the analyses. The performance of single layered steel plate, plain concrete (<b>PC)</b> slab, <b>steel</b> fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) slab, sandwich steel-dytherm foam-steel (SDS) panel and steel-polyurethane foam-steel (SPS) panel linings under blast loading have been examined. For material modelling, Drucker-Prager plasticity for soil, Johnson-Cook plasticity for steel, concrete damaged plasticity for concrete, SFRC and crushable-foam plasticity for foams have been used. Strain rate dependent material parameters have been used for all lining materials and soil. Internal blast loading of 10 kg TNT has been simulated using the pressure-time curve obtained through CFD-calculations. The resulting displacements at soil-lining interface have been evaluated.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of {{prestressing}} on impact resistance of concrete beams using two types of PC tendons are discussed based on experimental results. The PC tendons {{used in this study}} are Aramid Fiber Reinforced Plastic (AFRP) rods and <b>PC</b> <b>steel</b> strand. Impact load is applied on the center of each concrete beam by free falling of a 200 kgf steel weight. The results obtained from the impact tests are 1) {{the effects of}} prestressing on impact resistance of concrete beam varies with tendon properties, 2) the maximum reaction forces due to impact loads are slightly larger then the ultimate static capacity and 3) the shock absorbing energy would be useful as an index of impact resistances of concrete beams...|$|E

Impact test is conducted using 3, 000 kg steel weight and applying single loading method with maximum 30 m high dropping. The results obtained from this study are as follows: 1) ductility of the beams can be improved by increasing shear-bending capacity ratio; 2) impact-resistant capacity can be increased arranging normal rebars in two levels; and 3) using high-strength <b>PC</b> <b>steel</b> rebars instead of normal rebars, not only impact resistant capacity can be most effectively increased but cracks can be dispersed over entire beam...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedIn this NSF {{sponsored}} research project, {{an innovative}} hybrid steel precast concrete column (<b>PC)</b> and <b>steel</b> beam (S) moment resisting system was proposed and studied. The proposed hybrid PCS beam-column frame is structurally {{unique in that}} its system continuity and toughness is solely provided by the post-tensioning force of beam-column connection. The proposed PCS system is also economically efficient due to the mixed use of precast concrete and steel beam. Compared with conventional steel structure, PCS system has lower material cost while better dynamic characteristics. Compared with conventional reinforced concrete system, PCS frame is lighter, lesser labor cost and faster construction speed.; To validate the use of hybrid PCS special moment resisting frame in moderate to high seismic regions, a capacity-based design methodology was developed and applied to design of prototype building. The effectiveness of the proposed design approach was also examined through large scale quasi-static testing of beam-column-footing subassembly.

30|$|Six {{full-scale}} {{prestressed concrete}} (<b>PC)</b> I-beams with <b>steel</b> fibers were tested to failure in this work. Beams were cast without any traditional transverse steel reinforcement. The main {{objective of the}} study was to determine the effects of two variables—the shear-span-to-depth ratio and steel fiber dosage, on the web-shear and flexural-shear modes of beam failure. The beams were subjected to concentrated vertical loads up to their maximum shear or moment capacity using four hydraulic actuators in load and displacement control mode. During the load tests, vertical deflections and displacements at several critical points on the web in the end zone of the beams were measured. From the load tests, it was observed that the shear capacities of the beams increased significantly due to the addition of steel fibers in concrete. Complete replacement of traditional shear reinforcement with steel fibers also increased the ductility and energy dissipation capacity of the PC I-beams.|$|R

A hybrid composite frame system combines the economy of precast concrete structures with the constructability of steel frame structures, including erection speed. Novel composite frames will ultimately maximize the efficiency of structural design and facilitate construction. This paper presents hybrid precast frames, which are precast composite frames based on a simple connection between precast concrete columns and beams. The hybrid precast frames designed to resist gravity loading consist of PC columns, <b>PC</b> beams, and <b>steel</b> inserted in the precast members.

The advanced processes, such as ozonation followed by granular activated carbon or ultrafiltration, yield changes in chemical properties of the treated water {{in addition to the}} improvement of water quality. The changes in water chemistry could affect the kinetics of disinfectant decay within the water distribution system. In addition, decay behaviors using various pipe materials were investigated with water that underwent advanced treatments. The permeate from ultrafiltration generally shows lower decay rate constants than that of effluents from ozonation + granular activated carbon adsorption. The differences were especially obvious for so-called unreactive pipe coupons such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), polycarbonate (<b>PC),</b> and stainless <b>steel.</b> Reactive pipe materials, such as cast iron and copper, had almost 10 times higher rate constants than the unreactive pipes, regardless of the applied treatment processes.

40|$|The main kind of {{deterioration}} in marine Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures and other infrastructures is steel bar corrosion due to cracks in concrete surfaces, {{which leads to}} the reduction of the load carrying capacity, ductility, and structural safety. It seems that steel fibers can reduce and delay the cracking, and increase the flexural strength and ductility of marine RC structures. To do so, in marine atmosphere and the tidal zone of the Oman Sea and fresh water, the flexural behavior of beams containing Plain Concrete (<b>PC),</b> Concrete with <b>Steel</b> fiber Reinforcement (SFRC), RC, Concrete with Steel fiber, and bar Reinforcement ((R+S) C) at 28, 90 and 180 days were determined. Beams were 99 un-cracked and pre-cracked beams, with dimensions of 200 × 200 × 750 mm. Based on results and at 180 days, the flexural strength and toughness of pre-cracked (R+S) C beams were 22 %– 43 % higher than the pre-cracked RC beams. The effect of steel fiber on the increment of load capacity and the toughness of pre-cracked RC beams were approximately the same. By addition of steel fiber to un-cracked RC beams, load capacity and toughness were increased up to 20 %. The load capacity and toughness in marine atmosphere and tidal zone were approximately 15 % lower than the fresh water condition...|$|R
30|$|The thermal {{expansion}} coefficient of the constructional steel was usually taken as 1.2  ×  10 − 5 /°C {{in most of the}} design codes. The {{thermal expansion}} coefficient for the steel cable or strand varied slightly from that of the constructional steels. 1.15  ×  10 − 5 /°C was used in ASCE standard (1996). In Eurocode 3 (1993) and Japanese Steel Structure Association (1994), this coefficient was specified as 1.2  ×  10 − 5 /°C for the steel material. In AISC (1994), the {{thermal expansion coefficient}} for the steel strand was taken as(11.09  +  0.0062 T) ×  10 − 6 /°C. In Fib Model 2010 (International Federation for Structural Concrete 2010), the coefficient of thermal expansion for steel was taken as 10  ×  10 − 6 /°C for the temperature range between −  20 and 180  °C. However, these specifications have limitations on the thermal expansion coefficient of steel, and they were not applicable to the steel strand under combined low temperatures to about −  180  °C and different prestressing levels. Thus, it is still of interest to perform the experimental studies on the steel strand to obtain the necessary information on their thermal expansion behaviours under different low temperature levels and prestressing levels. The information obtained in this study will offer basic information as the inputting data for the analysis on the structural behaviours of the RC or <b>PC</b> structures with <b>steel</b> strand under combined low temperatures and different loading scenarios. These studies would definitely contribute to the design of the RC or PC structures with these steel strands at different low temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Polymer Concrete (PC) is one {{of three}} types of {{polymers}} in concrete that was introduced in the 1950 s and has had many successful civil engineering applications. PC is recognized in the industry as a mix of aggregate and polymer resin with no Portland cement. PC has been favoured over conventional Portland cement concrete when special characteristics such as low permeability, high adhesion, and/or high durability for service in aggressive (e. g. chemical) environments are required. In this research, a new generation of PC incorporating Multi-Walled Carbon Nano-Tubes (MWCNTs) was produced and its mechanical properties were investigated. Four mixes of PC with 0. 0 (neat), 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 % MWCNTs, respectively, were prepared using low modulus polysulfide epoxy mixed with fine and coarse aggregate, or fine aggregate only. PC incorporated fine and coarse aggregate in the mixes, while PC overlays incorporated fine aggregate only. Test protocols included investigating the mechanical properties of PC, examining the bond strength of the <b>PC</b> overlays with <b>steel</b> and microstructural characterization of epoxy-MWCNTs nanocomposite. iv Investigation of the static mechanical properties of PC included identifying the effect of MWCNTs on compressive strength, flexural strength, and shear strength, as well as creep behavior of PC under axial sustained loads. We also examined the dynamic response of PC using Charpy impact and low-velocity impact tests. Furthermore, the bond strength between <b>steel</b> plates and <b>PC</b> overlays was evaluated. This included performing the pull-off and slant shear tests. Moreover, four-point bending fatigue test was performed to examine the fatigue strength of PC overlays under cyclic traffic loads. Finally, microstructural and thermal stability of epoxy incorporating MWCNTs was evaluated using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The test results emphasized that MWCNTs altered the microstructure of the epoxy and increased the crosslinking between epoxy groups significantly. This lead to improving the mechanical properties of PC and PC overlays. Significant improvements were also observed in bond strength with steel, impact strength and fatigue strength. It is believed that using MWCNTs can produce a new generation of PC with much improved performance for bridge deck overlays and for panels used for blast protection. STC.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in the thesis primarily focuses on problems that are characteristic for thin layers of concrete exposed to imposed loads. More specific, the work aims at investigating, or rather finding ways to evaluate the efficiency of steel fibres as regards the limitation of crack widths in concrete under restrained conditions. To fulfil the ambitions a test method was developed in which concrete toppings {{were placed on the}} upper face of a bottom slab that constituted a stiff foundation. The toppings were then exposed to temperature loads that successively resulted in both the formation of vertical cracks in the concrete as well as horizontal cracks along the interface to the substructure. A total number of eight tests divided into two series were then performed using the proposed technique of testing. At each such occasion two toppings were tested simultaneously, one Plain Concrete (<b>PC)</b> and one <b>Steel</b> Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) specimen. In this way a comparative evaluation of the influence of steel fibres was facilitated. Results showed that end hooked steel fibres, in amounts of 30 to 60 kg/m 3, in most cases reduced the maximum widths of appearing cracks substantially although the reinforcement ratios were not sufficient to get completely crack free structures. It is also clear from the experiments that the effect to some extent was influenced by the properties of the interface {{in the sense that the}} fibre contribution seemed to increase as the bond quality became poorer. A series of restrained shrinkage tests were also performed primarily for the sake of verification. Within the frames of this study a total of eight half- scale toppings, four with a depth of 6 cm and four with 12 cm depth, were cast on the surface of an old concrete floor. Both plain and steel fibre reinforced concrete specimens were included in the series. Also, for comparison reasons some conventional steel bar reinforced toppings were produced as well. After an initial curing period of three days the specimens were exposed to one-sided drying that successively resulted in the development of visible cracks. From a crack limiting point of view it was concluded that steel fibres were at least as effective as the steel bar mesh, although it was clear that none of the alternatives were adequate for the purpose of achieving crack-free structures. However, the main reason as to why the effect of reinforcement was not as pronounced as anticipated was believed to be that the bond proved to be insufficient. In particular, considering that the ends of the toppings were fastened to the floor by means of expanding bolts this resulted in a too severe load situation. Regarding the influence of the depth it was shown that cracks appeared at a considerably earlier stage for the thin toppings. At the end of the measuring period the cracks were also considerably wider. This was explained as being a result of the considerably faster rate of desiccation experienced for a thin layer. A simple linear elastic Finite Element analysis was also conducted to verify the effect of the sectional depth in addition to the influence of the concrete creep on the development of stresses in the concrete. Results from this study showed that stresses are substantially reduced due to creep effects. It was further shown that the progress of tensile stresses in the concrete is somewhat slower for a thicker section, mainly due to the slower shrinkage strain development.
