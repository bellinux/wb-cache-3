60|$|It {{might be}} {{supposed}} {{at first sight}} that when the exchange is unfavorable, or, in other words, when bills are at a premium, the premium must always amount to a full equivalent {{for the cost of}} transmitting money. But a small excess of imports above exports, or any other small amount of debt to be paid to foreign countries, does not usually affect the exchanges to {{the full extent of the}} cost and risk of transporting bullion. The length of credit allowed generally permits, on the part of some of the debtors, a <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> and in the mean time the balance may turn the other way, and restore the equality of debts and credits without any actual transmission of the metals. And this is the more likely to happen, as there is a self-adjusting power in the variations of the exchange itself. Bills are at a premium because a greater money value has been imported than exported. But the premium is itself an extra profit to those who export. Besides the price they obtain for their goods, they draw for the amount and gain the premium. It is, on the other hand, a diminution of profit to those who import. Besides the price of the goods, they have to pay a premium for remittance. So that what is called an unfavorable exchange is an encouragement to export, and a discouragement to import. And if the balance due is of small amount, and is the consequence of some merely casual disturbance in the ordinary course of trade, it is soon liquidated in commodities, and the account adjusted by means of bills, without the transmission of any bullion. Not so, however, when the excess of imports above exports, which has made the exchange unfavorable, arises from a permanent cause. In that case, what disturbed the equilibrium must have been the state of prices, and it can only be restored by acting on prices. It is impossible that prices should be such as to invite to an excess of imports, and yet that the exports should be kept permanently up to the imports by the extra profit on exportation derived from the premium on bills; for, if the exports were kept up to the imports, bills would not be at a premium, and the extra profit would not exist. It is through the prices of commodities that the correction must be administered.|$|E

40|$|We use a game {{theoretical}} framework {{to analyze the}} intraday behavior of banks with respect to settlement of interbank claims in a real time gross settlement setting. We find that the game played by banks depends upon the intraday credit policy of the central bank and that it encompasses two well-known game theoretical paradigms: the prisoner's dilemma and the stag hunt. The former arises in a collateralized credit regime where we confirm the result of earlier literature that banks {{have an incentive to}} postpone payments when daylight liquidity is costly and that this is socially inefficient. The latter arises in a priced credit regime where we show that the <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> can be socially efficient...|$|R
50|$|In 1991 President Callejas {{managed to}} give the {{appearance}} of having reduced the overall fiscal deficit, a requirement for new credit. The deficit decrease, however, was mostly an accounting device because it resulted from the <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> external <b>payments</b> to the Paris Club debtors and eventually would be offset by pressure to raise public investment. During 1991, loan negotiations with multilateral and bilateral lending institutions brought Honduras US$39.5 million in United States development assistance, US$70 million in balance-of-payments assistance in the form of cash grants, and US$18.8 million in food aid.|$|R
25|$|Smith quickly {{ran into}} trouble with the new Navy contracts. Firstly, his bid of $374,000 per ship for the three destroyers proved too low. Delays in {{delivery}} of specialty steel for the ships meant <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> Navy <b>payments</b> which were made on a milestone basis. Furthermore, the Navy design proved too ambitious, as the ships' hulls were too light to absorb vibrations caused by the powerful engines. As a result, the USS Bainbridge was subjected to more Navy trials than any other warship, {{and by the time}} the vessels were finally delivered in 1902, Smith had lost a total of $180,000 on the three destroyer contracts.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, most central banks, {{concerned}} about settlement risks inherent in payment netting systems, have implemented real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. Although RTGS systems can significantly reduce settlement risk, they require greater liquidity to smooth nonsynchronized payment flows. Thus, central banks typically provide intraday credit to member banks, either as collateralized credit or priced credit. Because intraday credit is costly for banks, how intraday liquidity is managed has become a competitive parameter in commercial banking and a policy concern of central banks. This article uses a game-theoretical framework to analyze the intraday liquidity management behavior of banks in an RTGS setting. The games played by banks depend on the intraday credit policy of the central bank and encompass two well-known paradigms in game theory: "the prisoner's dilemma" and "the stag hunt. " The former strategy arises in a collateralized credit regime, where banks {{have an incentive to}} delay payments if intraday credit is expensive, an outcome that is socially inefficient. The latter strategy occurs in a priced credit regime, where <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> can be socially efficient under certain circumstances. The author also discusses how several extensions of the framework affect the results, such as settlement risk, incomplete information, heterogeneity, and repeated play.

40|$|The {{period of}} {{economic}} transformations {{which started in}} Poland at the early 1990 has revealed a number of weaknesses and maladjustments of enterprises, particularly those state owned, to the market economy demands. The Polish legislator, aiming at eliminating the adverse results of those phenomena {{as well as the}} causes of their occurrence, has introduced a number of legal acts establishing different institutions operating at different levels, among them the restructuring and recovery of financial management in enterprises. The aim of both is to restore the ability of businesses to compete in the market,and improve their financial condition. These aims can be realized with the help of selected legal instruments. The most important are those of tax character. They can be of different kinds though they are mainly associated with activities aiming to regulate tax obligations, such as: renouncement of a tax obligation, cancellation of the tax in arrears, <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>payment</b> deadlines, or installment plans.

5000|$|During {{the second}} year of Videnov's term, Bulgaria {{experienced}} a severe economic crisis and declining quality of living standard. One element of this was the grain crisis. In mid-1996, the first reports appeared that the country's grain reserves were near complete depletion due to excessive exports, and bread did actually become scarce for some time in the winter of 1996-1997. At the same time, the <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> interest on Bulgaria's foreign debt, which had been negotiated by the Filip Dimitrov government (Union of Democratic Forces, UDF) in 1992, ran out and no further postponement was granted despite Bulgaria' continuing inability to pay. The government also failed to negotiate a loan to relieve the situation. This decreased the country's credit rating and initiated the destabilization of the finance system. In a short period of time, more than half of Bulgaria's commercial banks went bankrupt, with {{hundreds of thousands of people}} losing their savings, while the so-called [...] "credit millionaires" [...] profited enormously from the situation because their immense debts to the banks were reduced to nothing. Simultaneously, inflation skyrocketed, with the lev's value plummeting from 70:1 USD in early 1996 to 3,000:1 in early 1997, causing a sharp decline in purchasing power. According to the Bulgaria-based Institute for Market Economics, the hyperinflation was caused by the government's inept finance policy. Videnov himself blamed the Bulgarian National Bank's incompetent actions, and abuses committed during the previous coalition government headed by Lyuben Berov. Despite its initial refusal in order to save its reputation during the presidential elections campaign in 1996, the government was forced by the crisis to accept eventually the currency board proposed by the International Monetary Fund, a decision that was officially implemented by the next government in July 1997.|$|R

40|$|Context: <b>Postponement</b> <b>of</b> first {{pregnancy}} {{is known to}} be associated with a variety of interdependent factors such as age, education, income, occupation, religion, caste, and cash incentives. This paper examines the relationship and effects of some of these factors on <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> first pregnancy among newly married couples in Satara district. Objective: To study the interdependency of age, years of schooling, income, and cash incentive on <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> first pregnancy among newly married couples. Materials and Methods: This study employed quasi-experimental study design. Duly trained multipurpose workers interviewed husbands and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) interviewed the wives; preferably in separate rooms using pretested semi-open proforma. Statistical analysis was done using STATA® version 12 statistical software. Results: Out of 1, 355 participants; 704 couples successfully postponed first pregnancy by 2 years, but 651 couples could not do so. Participants were significantly successful in postponing pregnancy by 569. 13 vs. 353. 89 days for controls. Age and education of female participants were significantly associated with <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> first pregnancy; while age, education, and income of male participants were not associated with postponement. Conclusions: Higher age, more education, and higher income appear to be associated with acceptance <b>of</b> <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy and appear to be acting synergistically in both male and female participants as compared to nonparticipants...|$|R
