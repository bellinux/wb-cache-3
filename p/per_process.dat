2500|$|ClearType in WPF {{supports}} sub-pixel positioning, natural advance widths, Y-direction anti-aliasing {{and hardware}} acceleration. WPF supports aggressive caching of pre-rendered ClearType text in video memory. The {{extent to which}} this is supported {{is dependent on the}} video card. DirectX 10 cards will be able to cache the font glyphs in video memory, then perform the composition (assembling of character glyphs in the correct order, with the correct spacing), alpha blending (application of anti-aliasing), and RGB blending (ClearType's sub-pixel color calculations), entirely in hardware. This means that only the original glyphs need to be stored in video memory once per font (Microsoft estimates that this would require 2MB of video memory per font), and other operations such as the display of anti-aliased text on top of other graphics including video can also be done with no computation {{effort on the part of}} the CPU. DirectX 9 cards will only be able to cache the alpha-blended glyphs in memory, thus requiring the CPU to handle glyph composition and alpha-blending before passing this to the video card. [...] Caching these partially rendered glyphs requires significantly more memory (Microsoft estimates 5MB <b>per</b> <b>process).</b> Cards that don't support DirectX 9 have no hardware-accelerated text rendering capabilities.|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} countries cassava starch is produced mostly rurally using artisan methods through wet-way processes that consume {{as much as}} 37 m³ of water <b>per</b> <b>processed</b> ton. In comparison, the little industrial production consumes 5 m³ of water <b>per</b> <b>processed</b> ton. These waste waters, highly contaminated, are usually discharged in to the rivers without any treatment. With the aim of industrializing the cassava flour production, CIAT and CLAYUCA are developing an alternative dry technology, environmentally sustainable, to produce enriched flour as a starch substitute. The intention is to separate the starch enriched flour (44 mum). The use of an inversely operated cyclone (related to the conventional operation) showed good potential in terms of efficiency and economy. In this paper we propose pressure drop (deltap), fines (< 44 mum) recovery efficiency (eta), and fines recovery quality (q), as main functional parameters to characterize the apparatus. Results show that deltap, eta, and q only depend on gas velocity (v g) and on the feed solid concentration (c). The h and q magnitudes, approximately 60 and 80 % respectively, demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} technique. Potential improvements merit further exploration...|$|R

30|$|In a {{data center}} with {{heterogeneous}} servers, the servers {{with the highest}} computing capacity, which {{is defined as the}} maximum number of tasks a sever can process in parallel, are the most preferred servers in the assignment of tasks. This server may provide a lower energy expenditure <b>per</b> <b>processed</b> task (or bytes). In this case, the optimization problem can be interpreted as a greedy-assignment scheme. For this, it is considered that the central scheduler sorts the servers based on their energy efficiency, and assigns tasks to the most energy-efficient servers first and it then continues to allocate tasks to the second most efficient servers on the list, and so on, until no task remains or else, servers’ queues are full.|$|R
