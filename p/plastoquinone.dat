This study aims to investigate the anti-diabetic activity of S. serratifolium and its major constituents through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B), α-glucosidase, and ONOO−-mediated albumin nitration. S. serratifolium ethanolic extract and fractions exhibited broad PTP 1 B and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC 50, 1. 83 ~ 7. 04 and 3. 16 ~ 24. 16 µg/mL for PTP 1 B and α-glucosidase, respectively). In an attempt to identify bioactive compounds, three <b>plastoquinones</b> (sargahydroquinoic acid, sargachromenol and sargaquinoic acid) were isolated from the active n-hexane fraction of S. serratifolium. All three <b>plastoquinones</b> exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory activity against PTP 1 B in the IC 50 range of 5. 14 – 14. 15 µM, while sargachromenol and sargaquinoic acid showed dose-dependent inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase (IC 50 42. 41 ± 3. 09 and 96. 17 ± 3. 48 µM, respectively).

25|$|In fully {{developed}} chloroplasts, prolonged exposure to light increases {{the activity of}} the oxidase.

Similar to its role in carotenoid synthesis, its oxidase activity may prevent the over-reduction of photosystem I electron acceptors and damage by photoinhibition. A recent analysis of electron flux through the photosynthetic pathway shows that even when activated, the electron flux plastid terminal oxidase diverts is two orders of magnitude less than the total flux through photosynthetic electron transport. This suggests that the protein may play less of a role than previously thought in relieving the oxidative stress in photosynthesis.|$|E

40|$|In higher plants, the Ndh complex reduces <b>plastoquinones</b> and is {{involved}} in cyclic electron flow around photosystem I, supplying extra-ATP for photosynthesis, particularly under environmental stress conditions. Based on plastid genome sequences, the Ndh complex would contain 11 subunits (NDH-A to -K), but homologies with bacterial complex indicate the probable existence of additional subunits. To identify missing subunits, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) NDH-H was His tagged at its N terminus using plastid transformation. A functional Ndh subcomplex was purified by Ni 2 + affinity chromatography and its subunit composition analyzed by mass spectrometry. Five plastid encoded subunits (NDH-A, -H, -I, -J, and -K) were identified as well as three new subunits (NDH-M, -N, and -O) homologous to cyanobacterial and higher plant proteins.

25|$|The enzyme is {{also thought}} {{to act as}} a safety valve for stress {{conditions}} in the photosynthetic apparatus. By providing an electron sink when the <b>plastoquinone</b> pool is over-reduced, the oxidase is thought to protect photosystem II from oxidative damage. Knockouts for Rubisco and photosystem II complexes, which would experience more photodamage than normal, exhibit an upregulation of plastid terminal oxidase. This effect is not universal because it requires plants to have additional PTOX regulation mechanisms. While many studies agree with the stress-protective role of the enzyme, one study showed that overexpression of PTOX increases the production of reactive oxygen species and causes more photodamage than normal. This finding suggests that an efficient antioxidant system is required for the oxidase to function as a safety valve for stress conditions and that it is more important during chloroplast biogenesis than in the regular functioning of the chloroplast.|$|E
25|$|Chloroplasts {{have their}} own genome, which encodes a number of {{thylakoid}} proteins. However, {{during the course of}} plastid evolution from their cyanobacterial endosymbiotic ancestors, extensive gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the cell nucleus took place. This results in the four major thylakoid protein complexes being encoded in part by the chloroplast genome and in part by the nuclear genome. Plants have developed several mechanisms to co-regulate the expression of the different subunits encoded in the two different organelles to assure the proper stoichiometry and assembly of these protein complexes. For example, transcription of nuclear genes encoding parts of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by light. Biogenesis, stability and turnover of thylakoid protein complexes are regulated by phosphorylation via redox-sensitive kinases in the thylakoid membranes. The translation rate of chloroplast-encoded proteins is controlled by {{the presence or absence of}} assembly partners (control by epistasy of synthesis). This mechanism involves negative feedback through binding of excess protein to the 5' untranslated region of the chloroplast mRNA. Chloroplasts also need to balance the ratios of photosystem I and II for the electron transfer chain. The redox state of the electron carrier <b>plastoquinone</b> in the thylakoid membrane directly affects the transcription of chloroplast genes encoding proteins of the reaction centers of the photosystems, thus counteracting imbalances in the electron transfer chain.|$|E

Alteration to the NDH complex in fruit changed the climacteric, ripening-associated metabolites and transcripts as well as fruit shelf life. Metabolic processes in chromoplasts of ripening tomato fruit were affected in OrrDs, as mutant fruit were yellow-orange and accumulated substantially less total carotenoids, mainly b-carotene and lutein.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the absence}} of PSII, non-photochemical {{reduction}} of <b>plastoquinones</b> (PQs) occurs following NADH or NADPH addition in thylakoid membranes of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The nature of the enzyme involved in this reaction has been investigated in vitro by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence increase in anoxia and light-dependent O 2 uptake {{in the presence of}} methyl viologen. Based on the insensitivity of these reactions to rotenone, a type-I NADH dehydrogenase (NDH- 1) inhibitor, and their sensitivity to flavoenzyme inhibitors and thiol blocking agents, we conclude to the involvement of a type-II NADH dehydrogenase (NDH- 2) in PQ reduction. Intact Chlamydomonas cells placed in anoxia have the property to produce H 2 in the light by a Fe-hydrogenase which uses reduced ferredoxin as an electron donor. H 2 production also occurs in {{the absence of}} PSII thanks to the existence of a non-photochemical pathway of PQ reduction. From inhibitors effects, we suggest the involvement of a plastidial NDH- 2 in PSII-independent H 2 production in Chlamydomonas.

2500|$|The other pathway, non-cyclic photophosphorylation, is a {{two-stage}} process involving {{two different}} chlorophyll photosystems. Being a light reaction, non-cyclic photophosphorylation {{occurs in the}} frets or stroma lamellae. First, a water molecule is broken down into 2H+ + 1/2 O2 + 2e− by a process called photolysis (or light-splitting). The two electrons from the water molecule are kept in photosystem II, while the 2H+ and 1/2O2 are left out for further use. Then a photon is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments surrounding the reaction core center of the photosystem. The light excites the electrons of each pigment, causing a chain reaction that eventually transfers energy {{to the core of}} photosystem II, exciting the two electrons that are transferred to the primary electron acceptor, pheophytin. The deficit of electrons is replenished by taking electrons from another molecule of water. The electrons transfer from pheophytin to <b>plastoquinone,</b> which takes the 2e− from Pheophytin, and two H+ atoms from the stroma and forms PQH2, which later is broken into PQ, the 2e− is released to Cytochrome b6f complex and the two H+ ions are released into thylakoid lumen. The electrons then pass through the Cyt b6 and Cyt f. Then they are passed to plastocyanin, [...] providing the energy for hydrogen ions (H+) to be pumped into the thylakoid space.

Depending on the physiological status of algae, flash illumination was found to induce either a fast (t 1 / 2 ≈ 300 ms) or slow (t 1 / 2 ≈ 3 s) transient inhibition of oxygen uptake. Based {{on the effects of}} the mitorespiratory inhibitors myxothiazol and salicyl hydroxamic acid (SHAM), and of propyl gallate, an inhibitor of the chlororespiratory oxidase, we conclude that the fast transient is due to the flash-induced inhibition of chlororespiration and that the slow transient is due to the flash-induced inhibition of mitorespiration. By measuring blue-green fluorescence changes, related to the redox status of the pyridine nucleotide pool, and chlorophyll fluorescence, related to the redox status of <b>plastoquinones</b> (PQs) in C. reinhardtii wild type and in a photosystem I-deficient mutant, we show that interactions between photosynthesis and chlororespiration are favored when PQ and pyridine nucleotide pools are reduced, whereas interactions between photosynthesis and mitorespiration are favored at more oxidized states.

Using a long-term depletion of PG from pgsA mutant cells, we could induce a decrease not only in PSII but also in PSI activity. Simultaneously with the decrease in PSI activity, dramatic structural changes of the PSI complex were detected.
