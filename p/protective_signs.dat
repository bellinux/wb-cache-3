International humanitarian law makes no distinction between medical personnel who are members of the armed forces (and who hold military ranks) and those who are civilian volunteers. All medical personnel are considered non-combatants under international humanitarian law because of their humanitarian duties, and they may not be attacked and not be taken as prisoners of war; hospitals and other medical facilities and transports identified as such, whether they are military or civilian, may not be attacked either. The red cross, the red crescent and the red crystal are the <b>protective</b> <b>signs</b> recognised under international humanitarian law, and are used by military medical personnel and facilities for this purpose. Attacking military medical personnel, patients in their care, or medical facilities or transports legitimately marked as such is a war crime. Likewise, misusing these <b>protective</b> <b>signs</b> to mask military operations is the war crime of perfidy. Military medical personnel may be armed, usually with service pistols, for the purpose of self defense or the defense of patients.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Protective</b> <b>signs</b> are symbols to be {{used during}} an armed {{conflict}} to mark persons and objects {{under the protection of}} various treaties of international humanitarian law (IHL).

The form, shape and color of these signs are defined by the rules of IHL. Usually, they are easy to draw in order to make even an improvised use as easy as possible, and they were chosen to be as concise, recognizable and visible as possible under all circumstances.|$|E

Murray, an African American artist from Mitchell, Georgia. The goal of this dissertation is to explore J. B. Murray’s production of protective scripts and spirit figures. Murray created art works {{that served as the}} conduit for spiritual healing or protection between his God, his ancestral energies and the recipients or viewers of his work. Protection through writing is both an Islamic and indigenous African tradition. Art Historians, after seeing Murray’s work, called it masterful art. It is my contention that Murray possessed knowledge that, unbeknownst to him or his ancestors, was passed along to him by his African ancestors. This knowledge is also seen in the work of other African and African American artists in this dissertation, which shows continuity across a wider group as opposed to just one artist. Finally, a parallel is draw with African protector and healer, Serigne Bousso, from Touba, Senegal. Murray’s experience of visions and protective and healing work parallels the experience of Serigne Bousso within the last 30 years. This parallel is significant in making the connection between Murray, in Georgia, and the possible West African source for his knowledge of visions and <b>protective</b> <b>signs.</b> College of Arts and SciencesIntroduction [...] History of African and African American writing systems, signs and spirit figures [...] J.

50|$|Despite {{the length}} of these documents, they were found over time to be incomplete. In fact, {{the very nature of}} armed {{conflicts}} had changed with the beginning of the Cold War era, leading many to believe that the 1949 Geneva Conventions were addressing a largely extinct reality: on the one hand, most armed conflicts had become internal, or civil wars, while on the other, most wars had become increasingly asymmetric. Moreover, modern armed conflicts were inflicting an increasingly higher toll on civilians, which brought the need to provide civilian persons and objects with tangible protections in time of combat, thus bringing a much needed update to the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. In light of these developments, two Protocols were adopted in 1977 that extended the terms of the 1949 Conventions with additional protections. In 2005, a third brief Protocol was added establishing an additional <b>protective</b> <b>sign</b> for medical services, the Red Crystal, {{as an alternative to the}} ubiquitous Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems, for those countries that find them objectionable.|$|R
50|$|When {{carrying}} out their humanitarian function during armed conflicts, medical personnel are protected persons under international humanitarian law, and are entitled {{under the laws}} of war to carry out their work without being inhibited; they may not be attacked, harmed, taken as prisoners of war or persecuted in any way; deliberately attacking or hindering medical personnel from performing their humanitarian work is a serious war crime. The same protection extends to buildings and vehicles identified as part of the medical service. The Army Medical Service uses the red cross as a <b>protective</b> <b>sign</b> recognised under {{the laws of war}}; the sign is used on buildings and vehicles and may be worn on armbands as needed. Personnel are issued identity cards identifying them as protected persons under the Geneva Conventions. Although personnel of the Army Medical Service are members of the armed forces and hold military ranks, they are considered non-combatants under international humanitarian law and thus enjoy protection and neutrality because of their humanitarian duties. The status of medical personnel as protected persons goes back to the 1864 Geneva Convention and was repeated in the subsequent Geneva Conventions of 1906 and 1929. It is currently set forth in the First, Second and Fourth Geneva Conventions of 1949, their additional protocols and is recognised under customary international humanitarian law, specifically by rules 25 and 26.|$|R
25|$|Kuwait <b>signed</b> <b>protective</b> {{treaties}} with Britain in 1899 and 1914 and Qatar signed a treaty in 1916. These treaties, {{in addition to}} the earlier treaties signed by the Trucial States and Bahrain, were aimed suppressing piracy and slave trade in the region. Acts of piracy in the Persian Gulf desisted during this period. By the 20th century, piracy had become a marginal activity, mainly due to the increasingly widespread use of steamships which were too expensive for freebooters to finance.|$|R
