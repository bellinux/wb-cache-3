40|$|The Abstract The aim of {{my thesis}} {{is to find}} and {{describe}} the problematic aspects of the determination of parenthood. I chose four areas of the determination of parenthood, {{which can lead to}} various complications - assisted reproduction, surrogacy, secret childbirths and anonymous births. In the first chapter of the thesis I deal with the legal aspects of the determination of parenthood. I examine mandatory determination of maternity and various assumptions <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> With the development of relations in the society and of the reproductive medicine, there emerge possibilities doubting the traditional legal principles of the determination of parenthood. Mother is not always certain anymore and there are five <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> in the Czech legal order nowadays, compared to the traditional three. The second chapter is devoted to the issue of assisted reproduction. Assisted reproduction is a modern and rapidly developing area of medicine that allows infertile couples to have their own child. It is a medical specialty that requires a broad legal framework to prevent its abuse. At the end of a successful medical procedure a new life is coming into existence and such area must be regulated. The third chapter, entitled Surrogacy, builds on the previous chapter. Surrogacy is often discussed area of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Comparison of {{legislation}} concerning {{the establishment and}} determination of parentage in the Czech Republic and the Kingdom of Belgium SUMMARY The purpose of my thesis is to compare two different, yet somehow similar systems of civil law. Reason for choosing this particular topic (creation of filiation) is because I consider it a very important moment in life of every individual. My thesis is composed of eight chapters, each of them dealing with {{different part of the}} main topic. Each chapter is also divided into three parts, each of them studies one particular legislation, because not only this thesis compares Czech and Belgian law, but also examines differences between Czech current legislation (mainly law concerning familial relations and marriage) and future one - the Civil Code which will take effect from 1. 1. 2014. Chapter one is destined to present main reasons and the interest of law on the definition and regulation of the notion "family". Part one describes the problematic from the view of Czech law, part two deals with the same theme, but by Belgian law. Chapters two and three both examinate the issue of determination of motherhood, including problematics of surrogate mothers. In fourth chapter, also subdivided into three parts, I concentrate on legal <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> and on possible ways [...] ...|$|R

[...] This quote comes from Mansfield's appellate decision in [...] The primary legal question in the case was not this preexisting principle, which applies only to children [...] "born after marriage", but rather whether the child had been born before the marriage. The question was whether statements the child's parents allegedly made before their deaths could be introduced {{as evidence that the}} child had been born before their marriage and was thus illegitimate. Mansfield ruled to admit the testimony against the child's legitimacy and grant a new trial. The term [...] "Lord Mansfield's Rule" [...] is often used in a slightly different sense to denote the principle still applied in several jurisdictions that marriage creates a conclusive <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> a husband's <b>paternity</b> <b>of</b> his wife's child.|$|R

In Part III, I will explore the unnecessary injection of race into trials involving the statistics of DNA matching, even when race is entirely irrelevant to the particular case. Next, in Part IV, I will discuss how courts use race- and gender-based statistics to reduce damages in tort cases for women and racial minorities, and silently assert that past racism and sexism will continue. In the final section, I will examine how judges have improperly allocated the risk of error in cases such as securities fraud, so as to reward those who have attempted to manipulate stock prices illegally...|$|R

40|$|Parenthood - basic {{questions}} {{in the light of}} Czech and French law The purpose of the thesis is to analyse some {{basic questions}} of parenthood in the framework of Czech and French law. The author tries to compare chosen Czech juridical institutes with the same institutes of French law and to point out their common roman-law bases. On the one hand the family is an institute relatively stable, {{but on the other hand}} much influenced by the development of society. Some particular juridical institutes of family law which are dealt here are very ancient. But even they are confronted with sociological, cultural and scientific changes being under way in society. The thesis is composed of six chapters, each of them dealing in detail with different aspects of parenthood. Chapter One is introductory and defines the general notion of family and its historical and social development. Chapter Two compares two great historical civil-law codifications of 19 th century - Austrian ABGB (starting point of future Czech family law) and French Code civil. Third Chapter is very extensive; it deals with the question of parenthood and its determination, including <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> maternity and <b>paternity</b> in both systems of law.

40|$|The {{reason why}} I chose the issue <b>of</b> {{determination}} <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> as {{a topic of}} my thesis {{is the fact that}} most of us will meet with this institute during our lifetime. The aim of this thesis is to analyze and describe the institute <b>of</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> especially in the view of the applicable legislation. The thesis is composed of eight chapters. Chapter One deals with family and parenthood and defines the basic terms, sucha as the biological, social and legal parenthood. Chapter Two is subdivided into two parts and focuses on the legislation <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> Part One describes the historical development of parenthood, part Two briefly describes the source of law witch contains the current legislation. The next chapter concerns the determination of maternity, which is closely connected to the institute <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> Chapter Three, apart from the applicable legislation, also includes a subchapter about hidden birth and a subchapter that documents surrogacy. The following chapter already concentrates on the current Czech legislation <b>of</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> which is included in the civil code. This chapter consists of six parts that closely describe various possibilities <b>of</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> in the Czech republic.

5000|$|There is no {{requirement}} that the recogniser actually be the biological father. In fact, if the child already has a legal father (by the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> or by prior recognition) the biological father may {{not be allowed to}} recognise their own biological child unless the legal father voluntarily denies fatherhood; a child may only have one legal father.

50|$|The {{legal status}} of an {{unmarried}} father differs greatly from country to country. Without voluntary formal recognition of the child by the father, in most cases {{there is a need}} of due process of law in order to establish paternity. In some countries however, unmarried cohabitation of a couple for a specific period of time does create a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> similar to that of formal marriage. This is the case in Australia. Under what circumstances can a paternity action be initiated, the rights and responsibilities of a father once paternity has been established (whether he can obtain parental responsibility and whether he can be forced to support the child) as well as the legal position of a father who voluntarily acknowledges the child, vary widely by jurisdiction. A special situation arises when a married woman has a child by a man other than her husband. Some countries, such as Israel, refuse to accept a legal challenge of paternity in such a circumstance, {{in order to avoid the}} stigmatization of the child (see Mamzer, a concept under Jewish law). In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman, granting him right of contact with the twins, despite the fact that the mother and her husband had forbidden him to see the children.|$|E
40|$|Every {{state and}} the District of Columbia use {{voluntary}} acknowledgments of paternity. Created pursuant to federal law, the acknowledgment is signed by the purported biological parents and establishes paternity without requiring court involvement. Intended to be a “simple civil process” to establish paternity where the parents are unmarried, the acknowledgment is used by state governments to expedite child support litigation. But federal policy and state laws governing the acknowledgments do not sufficiently protect the interests of those men who have signed acknowledgments and who subsequently discover that they lack genetic ties to the children in question. A signatory who learns {{that he is not}} the child’s biological father and who wishes to challenge the validity of the acknowledgment must navigate a difficult process for relief. The very act of signing an acknowledgment may subsequently prevent him from offering any scientific evidence of the absence of a biological connection to the child. As a result, he may be obligated to pay child support for years on the basis of that erroneous paternity acknowledgment, and a parent-child relationship may be imposed even if it is not in the child’s best interests. Using the District of Columbia as a model to highlight the need for procedural reform, this Article examines the federal and D. C. legislation that created voluntary acknowledgments of paternity as well as the process for either rescinding or challenging their validity. The Article then analyzes the practical implications of these processes and discusses why the presumptive weight of the acknowledgment, a conclusive <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> is problematic. In particular, the Article questions the need for a conclusive <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> a difficult evidentiary burden for a challenger to overcome, and whether the conclusive <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> runs afoul of constitutional protections. Finally, the Article offers possible solutions to improve the establishment process...|$|E
