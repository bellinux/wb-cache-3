5|$|In July 1997 the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> {{called a}} ceasefire. On 10 October 1997 a <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> General Army Convention {{was held in}} Falcarragh, County Donegal. At the convention, <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> Quartermaster General Michael McKevitt—also {{a member of the}} 12-person <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> Executive—denounced the {{leadership}} and {{called for an end to}} the group's ceasefire and to its participation in the Northern Ireland peace process. He was backed by his partner and fellow Executive member Bernadette Sands McKevitt. The two dissidents were outmanoeuvred by the leadership and were left isolated. The convention backed the pro-ceasefire line, and on 26 October McKevitt and Sands McKevitt resigned from the Executive along with other members.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA {{initially}} took {{small amounts}} of materiel from <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> arms dumps {{under the control of}} McKevitt and other former <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> members, including the plastic explosive Semtex, Uzi submachine guns, AK-47 and AK-74 assault rifles, handguns, shotguns, detonators, and timing devices. The defection of senior <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> members also gave the RIRA the ability to manufacture home-made explosives and improvised mortars, including the Mark 15 mortar capable of firing a 200lb shell.|$|E
5|$|The bombing {{caused a}} major outcry {{throughout}} the world, and the Irish and British governments introduced new legislation {{in an attempt}} to destroy the organisation. The RIRA also came under pressure from the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA,</b> when <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> members visited the homes of 60 people connected with the RIRA and ordered them to disband and stop interfering with <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> arms dumps. With the organisation under intense pressure, which included McKevitt and Sands-McKevitt being forced from their home after the media named McKevitt in connection with the bombing, the RIRA called a ceasefire on 8 September.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{aspects of}} the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> {{campaign}} are covered in the following articles: ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Long War" [...] {{during the}} <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> armed {{campaign}} against the British Army during the Troubles.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, MacManus {{attended}} {{the funeral of}} Jim Lynagh, one of those killed in the Loughall ambush. In 1988, {{at the age of}} 18, he joined the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> Sligo Brigade.|$|R
5|$|After the Omagh bombing, the RIRA {{leadership}} {{were unwilling}} to launch a full-scale campaign in Northern Ireland due {{to the possibility of}} civilians being killed. Instead they decided to launch a series of attacks in England, in particular London, which they hoped would attract disenchanted <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> members to join the RIRA. On 1 June 2000 a bomb damaged Hammersmith Bridge; a symbolic target for Irish republican paramilitary groups. The bridge had been targeted by the Irish Republican Army on 29 March 1939 as part of its Sabotage Campaign, and by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> on 24 April 1996.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA {{also has}} a {{political}} wing, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement (formerly the 32 County Sovereignty Committee), led by Francis Mackey. The RIRA is distinct from the Continuity IRA, another <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> splinter group founded in 1986, although the two groups {{have been known to}} co-operate at a local level. The <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> has been hostile to the RIRA and issued threats to RIRA members, and in October 2000 was alleged to be responsible for the fatal shooting of Belfast RIRA member Joe O'Connor according to O'Connor's family and 32 County Sovereignty Movement member Marian Price.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} of the Agreement (formally {{referred to as the}} Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1978, {{after the}} <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> La Mon {{restaurant}} bombing, the hospital treated {{many of the}} injured.The blast created a fireball, killing twelve people and injuring thirty more, {{many of whom were}} severely burnt.|$|R
50|$|The Harrow School bombing {{happened}} on 24 October 1974, when the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> Balcombe Street Gang bombed Peterborough Cottage, a three-storey former caretaker's {{house in the}} grounds of Harrow School. A warning was given {{and there were no}} deaths or injuries.|$|R
25|$|The {{battle was}} the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> first major action during the Troubles {{and was a}} {{propaganda}} victory for the organization. It presented itself as having successfully defended a vulnerable Catholic enclave from armed loyalist mobs. Loyalists, however, argue that the IRA lured them into a carefully prepared trap.|$|R
5|$|In November 1997 McKevitt {{and other}} dissidents held {{a meeting in}} a {{farmhouse}} in Oldcastle, County Meath, and a new organisation, styling itself Óglaigh na hÉireann, was formed. The organisation attracted disaffected <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> members from Derry and the republican stronghold of South Armagh, as well as Dublin and Belfast cities and Counties Limerick, Tipperary, Louth, Tyrone, Monaghan and Kerry.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{began to}} re-arm and recruit after August 1969. In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA.</b> Both were {{supported}} {{by the people of}} the Free Derry area. Meanwhile, relations between the British Army and the nationalist community, which were initially good, deteriorated. In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops. The government introduced internment on 9 August 1971, and in response, barricades went up once more in the Bogside and Creggan. This time, Free Derry was a no-go area, defended by armed members of both the Official and <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA.</b> From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army, and the Provisionals began a bombing campaign in the city centre. As before, unarmed 'auxiliaries' manned the barricades, and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police.|$|E
5|$|The deaths led {{to public}} {{mourning}} and {{protests against the}} <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA.</b> Pressure to act precipitated a political crisis for the government of Northern Ireland, {{which led to the}} resignation of Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Chichester-Clark. The British Army raised the minimum age needed to serve in Northern Ireland to 18 in response to this incident. In 2010 a memorial was dedicated to the three soldiers near to where they were killed in north Belfast.|$|E
2500|$|... 26 August 2013: It was {{alleged that}} the PIRA were {{responsible}} for planting two mortars along the border in South Armagh. Gardaí claimed the primed devices were intended as a warning by the IRA to the PSNI to cease disrupting the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> smuggling and diesel laundering businesses along the border.|$|R
50|$|Some {{dissident}} republican political groups, such as Republican Sinn Féin (which {{was established}} by a split from Sinn Féin, and no longer has {{a connection to the}} party) and the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, support political violence against the British security forces. Thus, they oppose the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> 1994 ceasefire.|$|R
5000|$|... 26 August 2013: It was {{alleged that}} the PIRA were {{responsible}} for planting two mortars along the border in South Armagh. Gardaí claimed the primed devices were intended as a warning by the IRA to the PSNI to cease disrupting the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> smuggling and diesel laundering business along the border.|$|R
5|$|Downing Street leads off the {{south-west}} end of Whitehall, {{just above}} Parliament Street. It {{was named after}} Sir George Downing, who built a row of houses along the street around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number of terrorist attacks, the road was {{closed to the public}} in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> fired mortars from a van parked in Whitehall towards No.10, one of which exploded in the gardens.|$|E
5|$|In May 1974 unionists {{called a}} general strike to protest against the Sunningdale Agreement – an attempt at power-sharing, setting up a Northern Ireland Executive and a {{cross-border}} Council of Ireland, which {{would have given the}} Government of Ireland a voice in running Northern Ireland. During that strike on 17 May, the UVF carried out the Dublin and Monaghan car bombings, which killed 33 civilians. The <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> were suspected by British police of bombing two pubs in the English city of Birmingham the following November, resulting in 21 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Officers found {{a firing}} range inside a disused wine cellar {{being used as}} an {{underground}} bunker, and seized weapons including an assault rifle, a submachine gun, a semi-automatic pistol and an RPG-18 rocket launcher. An earlier version of the rocket launcher, the RPG-7, {{had been in the}} possession of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> from as early as 1972, {{but this was the first}} time the RPG-18 had been found in the possession of a paramilitary organisation in Ireland. Among those convicted were Alan Ryan, who was on bail for possession of a loaded revolver at his home in Dublin.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Heubeck's {{tenure at}} Ulsterbus {{coincided with the}} height of The Troubles in Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s, with public {{transport}} being a prime target of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> bombing campaign. Heubeck was well-known at the time for personally boarding buses and removing hoax bombs himself to keep the buses running to schedule.|$|R
5000|$|The power-sharing Executive and Assembly were {{suspended}} in 2002, when unionists withdrew following [...] "Stormontgate", a controversy over allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont. There were ongoing tensions about the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> failure to disarm fully and sufficiently quickly. IRA decommissioning {{has since been}} completed (in September 2005) {{to the satisfaction of}} most parties.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the hunger strikes, Sinn Féin, which had become the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> {{political}} wing, began to contest elections {{for the first time in}} both Northern Ireland (as abstentionists) and in the Republic. In 1986, Sinn Féin recognised the legitimacy of the Irish Dáil, which caused a small group of members to break away and form Republican Sinn Féin.|$|R
5|$|Primarily {{starting}} in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded {{to take into account}} the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA.</b> Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA has {{a command}} {{structure}} {{similar to the}} <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA,</b> with a seven-member Army Council consisting of a chief of staff, quartermaster general, director of training, director of operations, director of finance, director of publicity, and adjutant general. The rank-and-file members operate in active service units of covert cells to prevent the organisation from being compromised by informers. As of June 2005, the organisation {{is believed to have}} a maximum of about 150 members, according to a statement by the Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of the ceasefire the RIRA began to regroup, {{and by the end}} of October had elected a new leadership and were planning their future direction. In late December Irish government representative Martin Mansergh held a meeting with McKevitt in Dundalk, in an attempt to convince McKevitt to disband the RIRA. McKevitt refused, stating that members would be left defenceless to attacks by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA.</b> In 1999 the RIRA began preparations for a renewed campaign, and in May three members travelled to Split in Croatia to purchase arms, which were smuggled back to Ireland. On 20 October, ten people were arrested when Gardaí raided a RIRA training camp near Stamullen, County Meath.|$|E
5000|$|... 1998 - present Dissident Irish Republican {{campaign}} [...] - [...] Declaration {{of peace}} at the Good Friday Agreement {{did not prevent}} splinter Republican groups from taking the law into their own hands, contrariwise to orders from the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> high command. Perhaps the last manifestation of the physical force philosophy in current Irish history. Groups included 'Real IRA', and 'New Provos'.|$|R
25|$|When Jack Lynch, the Taoiseach and friend, {{announced}} his retirement, and future rise owed to Haughey, Aiken refused to serve. Haughey was a shrewd, but corruptible campaigner: running {{a gang of}} 500 businessmen out of Gresham's Hotel, Dublin {{to raise funds for}} his cause. Haughey's support for the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> bombing war was eventually exposed as in defiance of Aiken's warnings and persistent advice.|$|R
50|$|However he {{reversed}} this {{defeat in}} the 2001 general election. Along with Jeffrey Donaldson (MP) and the Rev. Martin Smyth (MP), Burnside became {{an outspoken critic of}} his party leader, David Trimble's support for the Good Friday Agreement, arguing that the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> slow pace of decommissioning its arms meant that Sinn Féin, the political wing of the IRA, {{should not be allowed to}} serve in the power-sharing government.|$|R
5|$|Other groups, on {{both the}} unionist side and the {{nationalist}} side, participated in violence and a period known as the Troubles began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict. Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed direct rule. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> and multi-party talks, the Good Friday Agreement was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.|$|E
5|$|After {{the border}} reopened, the British {{government}} reduced the {{military presence in}} Gibraltar by closing the naval dockyard. The RAF presence was also downgraded; although the airport officially remains an RAF base, military aircraft are no longer permanently stationed there. The British garrison, which had been present since 1704, was withdrawn in 1990 following defence cutbacks {{at the end of}} the Cold War. A number of military units continue to be stationed in Gibraltar under the auspices of British Forces Gibraltar; the garrison was replaced with locally recruited units of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, while a Royal Navy presence is continued through the Gibraltar Squadron, responsible for overseeing the security of Gibraltar's territorial waters. In March 1988 a British military operation against members of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> (PIRA) planning a car bomb attack in Gibraltar ended in controversy when the Special Air Service shot and killed all three PIRA members.|$|E
5|$|The British Iron and Steel Research Association was {{originally}} established at No.11 Park Lane in June 1944, an institution responsible {{for much of}} the automation of modern steelmaking. It has since moved to No.24 Buckingham Gate. The contact lens pioneer, Keith Clifford Hall held a practice at No.139, later expanding to No140, from 1945 to 1964. The site of his practice is now commemorated by a green heritage plaque. The film and stage actress Anna Neagle lived at Alford House on Park Lane between 1950 and 1964 with her husband Herbert Wilcox; the location of which is now marked with a green heritage plaque. The hotel trade continued to prosper; construction of the London Hilton on Park Lane at 22 Park Lane began in 1960 and opened in 1963 at a construction cost of £8m (now £). On 5 September 1975, a <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA</b> bomb exploded at the hotel, killing two people and injuring over 60. The blast also damaged neighbouring properties.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> Balcombe Street Gang (nicknamed {{that because}} they were caught at the Balcombe Street siege in late 1975) had been bombing targets {{in and around the}} London area since October 1974 including, the Guildford pub bombings on 5 October and the Woolwich pub bombing on 7 November. Seven people were killed from these two bombings alone (5 British {{military}} personnel & 2 civilians) and almost 100 people were injured.|$|R
50|$|The Irish Government {{began its}} clampdown against the IRA {{in that same}} year. On 19 November the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> Chief of Staff, Sean MacStiofain was arrested in Dublin and {{immediately}} went on a hunger and thirst strike. The same month, a controversial amendment to the Offences Against the State Act, giving the Garda Síochána special powers {{to deal with the}} IRA and other subversives was brought before Dáil Éireann.|$|R
25|$|The Provisionals {{maintained}} {{the principles of}} the pre-1969 IRA; they considered both British rule in Northern Ireland and the government of the Republic of Ireland to be illegitimate, insisting that the <b>Provisional</b> <b>IRA's</b> Army Council was the only valid government, as head of an all-island Irish Republic. This belief was based on a series of perceived political inheritances which constructed a legal continuity from the Second Dáil (see also Irish republican legitimatism).|$|R
