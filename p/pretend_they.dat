25|$|In August 2016 Sky News was criticised after {{allegedly}} paying €2,000 to a {{group of}} Romanians to <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> were part of an eastern European gang selling guns to terrorists in Syria. The Romanians were arrested by Romanian DIICOT and confessed that they were paid by Sky News journalist Stuart Ramsay to <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> were gun traffickers. The guns featured in the report were legally owned and were hunting weapons. Sky News stands by the story.|$|E
25|$|The next day, on 6 November, {{people kept}} protesting, {{although}} in fewer numbers (6,000 in Bucharest and several thousands in other cities). The president told the civil representatives {{that he will}} come incognito {{to talk to people}} in the streets, indirectly hinting that if they want true change they need to keep asking for it so the politicians can't <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> don't understand what is asked of them.|$|E

He had chosen Taipei as the final {{stopover}} when he learned the Philippines had severed diplomatic ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan). This made him feel more secure; the Taiwan government could <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> {{were not aware of}} his presence. There would also be a couple of Taiwanese friends accompanying him. From Taipei he flew to Manila on then Taiwan's flag carrier China Airlines Flight 811.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{rather than}} {{treating}} the essay as an honest {{analysis of a}} painful, complex issue, critics accused the AJC of stifling the debate. Such hysteria makes intellectuals look spoiled, thin-skinned and brittle. Best-selling authors like Noam Chomsky or billionaires like George Soros ritualistically applaud their own bravery and <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> are lonely voices when joining the trendy intellectual pile-on against Israel. How it {{is that people who}} viciously criticize Israel and Zionism, who lecture the Jewish world about tolerating diverse opinions, suddenly cannot stomach vigorous debate when they are criticized? Nothing in the AJC essay advocates hate laws, suppressing free speech, shunning, or any other intimidation. Professor Rosenfeld did what thinkers are supposed to do – identify, catalogue, analyze, explain, and challenge.|$|E
25|$|Loung and her brother, eleven-year-old Kim, {{and her two}} sisters, nine-year-old Chou and four-year-old Geak, {{remained}} in Ro Leap with their mother until May 1977. During this time, they avoided starvation {{with the help of}} Meng and Khouy, who brought them what little food they could from their work camp, and by Kim, who risked his life late at night by stealing corn from the crops guarded by the soldiers. In May, agitated by screams in the night and the sudden disappearance of a neighboring family, Ay Ung sent Kim, Chou, and Loung away from Ro Leap with instructions to <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> were orphans and never to come back. Kim separated from his sisters, while Loung and Chou found a nearby children's work camp where their guise as orphans was accepted. In time, Loung and Chou gained strength with improved food rationing, and in August 1977, Loung, now seven years old, was assigned to a training camp for child soldiers, and was forced to leave her sister Chou behind.|$|E
500|$|Under Fellini's {{agreement}} with his producers, any budget overruns {{would have had}} to come out of his own pocket, cutting into any profit potential there might be. When it became clear that there would not be enough funding to finish the picture, Fellini stated that Ponti and De Laurentiis took him to lunch and assured him that they would not hold him to it: [...] "Let's <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> were a joke. Buy us a coffee and we'll forget about them." [...] According to Quinn, however, Fellini was able to obtain this indulgence only by agreeing to film some pickup shots for Attila that Francisci, the director of record, had neglected to complete.|$|E

500|$|At [...] "The Three Pigeons" [...] inn, it is a {{good day}} for some: the miser Boomblehardt has been out {{collecting}} rents from his tenants, and Sergeant Klooque, hero of Johannesburg, has just arrived at the inn on leave and may now flirt with any lady he chooses, without the need to <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> are his relatives to get around his tyrannical Colonel. However, it is not a good day for Martha, the landlady of the inn: staying there is a strange old lady, a mischievous fairy, who refuses to pay or to leave, and who needs neither food nor water. This is substantially cutting into Martha's profits. She enlists Boomblehardt and Klooque, the cowardly farmer Peter, and her extremely shy niece, Pipette, to help solve this problem.|$|E
500|$|In 1898 {{and again}} in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and {{wrote a book about}} his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, {{enabling}} the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. [...] "For example, when they boarded a yacht they would <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.|$|E
500|$|John A. Williams {{wrote in}} his 1965 book, This Is My Country Too, {{that he did not}} believe [...] "white {{travelers}} have any idea of how much nerve and courage it requires for a Negro to drive coast to coast in America." [...] He achieved it with [...] "nerve, courage, {{and a great deal of}} luck," [...] supplemented by [...] "a rifle and shotgun, a road atlas, and Travelguide, a listing of places in America where Negroes can stay without being embarrassed, insulted, or worse." [...] He noted that black drivers needed to be particularly cautious in the South, where they were advised to wear a chauffeur's cap or have one visible on the front seat and <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> were delivering a car for a white person. Along the way, he had to endure a stream of [...] "insults of clerks, bellboys, attendants, cops, and strangers in passing cars." [...] There was a constant need to keep his mind on the danger he faced; as he was well aware, [...] " [...] people have a way of disappearing on the road." ...|$|E

500|$|Ian, Rachel and Geraldine join Rebecca and Carl. Geraldine {{says that}} the room is {{normally}} locked, but Rebecca rebukes her. Stuart rejoins the group after using the toilet. As the group talk, Mark and his wife, Liz, enter the bedroom, unaware of the people hiding in the wardrobe. The pair talk candidly before beginning foreplay and lying down on the bed. Geraldine shouts to alert them, {{and those in the}} wardrobe <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> did not hear Mark and Liz's conversation. Mark and Liz reluctantly enter the wardrobe. As the doors close, Rachel's boyfriend Lee enters the room, but as the wardrobe has become more cramped, Stuart and Lee hide under the bed and Ian moves to the en suite bathroom. Stuart and Carl argue, and it is revealed that Carl has a fear of intimacy. When [...] "Stinky" [...] John enters the room, both those in the wardrobe and under the bed claim there is no room, so he hides behind a curtain. Jeremy enters the room and tells Rebecca he is going to pick up another guest from the train station, but as he turns to leave he mistakenly calls her [...] "Rachel". Andrew, Rebecca's father, enters and becomes annoyed when he sees people hiding in different places. He forces Jeremy, Stuart, Lee and Stinky John into the wardrobe with everyone else and follows them in.|$|E
500|$|Orci came up {{with the}} idea to start the episode in a church's confessional, while the ambered scene on the bus was {{originally}} scripted to take place on a subway; one of the writers felt the bus [...] "let you see more of the city". Early in the show's creation the writers were trying to figure out what Fringe could be, and ultimately chose [...] "big crazy event" [...] at the start of each episode that would catapult its plot and drive its characters. They felt the bus scene essentially achieved this. When creating the scene on the bus when the gas canister is released, the crew sat on a bus that was really driving through the streets of New York City; director Frederick Toye called the shooting [...] "Student film style, run and gun". To shoot the three scenes of the bus in the tunnel, the crew looked at a variety of locations before choosing a tunnel near the United Nations headquarters on the east side of Manhattan. As it was a busy area, they had to shoot at night and then attempt to make it appear to be daytime, as the scenes were set during the day. They had a limited schedule to shoot all three scenes, and despite never having seen the tunnel before, the production crews had 8–9 hours to quickly set up the massive set and leave enough time to shoot the scenes before dawn approached. To simulate being encased in amber, the actors had to <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> were frozen.|$|E

2500|$|Adding a {{particule}} was one way {{for people}} of non-noble origins to <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> were nobles. In the 19th century wealthy commoners buying nobility titles were derisively called Monsieur de Puispeu, a pun on depuis peu meaning [...] "since recently". Similarly, during the French Revolution, when being associated with the nobility was unfashionable and even risky, some people dropped the de from their name, or omitted the mention of their feudal titles (see image).|$|E

Upon release, the remake of the original 2006 French film Mon frère se marie received largely negative reviews. In his review for The New York Post, Lou Lumenick stated that [...] "the brutally unfunny, cringe-worthy The Big Wedding provides ample opportunities for Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon and Robin Williams to embarrass themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{appearance}} by Little River Band, scheduled for 12 January 2015 on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, was cancelled after complaints from earlier members concerning its promotion as a 40th anniversary performance. Permission for any songs written by Birtles, Briggs, Goble or Shorrock was refused. “We’ve just {{had enough of}} it,” Original Lead singer Glenn Shorrock said. “They’ve been living off our coat-tails for years.” [...] "They are promoting a newly recorded album of their own material, or whatever material they have got.

2500|$|Mytton was {{apparently}} {{seen by the}} committee as sharing Denbigh's brusqueness and arrogance. In January 1645 committee members Robert Clive, Andrew Lloyd, Thomas Hunt and Robert Charlton wrote to William Brereton to solicit help for their plan to retake Shrewsbury. They said that Mytton [...] "carries himself crossly towards us on all matters," [...] and proposed not to inform him of the plan, but to <b>pretend</b> <b>they</b> were making an attempt on the nearby village of Atcham - a plausible target, as it commanded important bridges where Watling Street crossed the River Severn and River Tern.

However, the crucial first entry to the town was made by a tiny shock force under William Reinking, a Dutch professional soldier employed by the Wem committee, which was admitted into the town by a sympathiser.
