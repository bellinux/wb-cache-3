40|$|Background: Educational {{intervention}} {{represents an}} essential element of care for cancer patients; while several single institutions develop their own patient education (PE) programs on cancer, little information is available on the effective existence of PE programs at the level of research and care institutes. In Italy such institutes- Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico- are appointed by the Ministry of Health, and 11 (Cancer Research & Care Istitute-CRCI) of the 48 are specific for cancer on the basis of specific requirements regarding cancer care, research and education. Therefore, they represent an ideal and homogeneous model through which to investigate PE policies and activities throughout the country. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess PE activities in Italian CRCI. Methods: We carried out a survey on PE strategies and services through a questionnaire. Four key points were investigated: a) PE as a cancer care <b>priority,</b> <b>b)</b> activities that are routinely part of PE, c) real involvement of the patients, and d) involvement of healthcare workers in PE activities. Results: Most CRCI (85 %) completed the survey. All reported having ongoing PE activities, and 4 of the 11 considered PE an institutional activity. More than 90 % of CRCI organize classes and prepare PE handouts, while other PE activities (e. g., Cancer Information Services, mutual support groups) are less frequently part of institutional PE programs.

40|$|Prevention of genital herpes is {{a global}} health <b>priority.</b> <b>B</b> 5, a {{recently}} identified ubiquitous human protein, was proposed as a candidate HSV entry receptor. The current studies explored its role in HSV infection. Viral plaque formation was reduced by ∼ 90 % in human cells transfected with small interfering RNA targeting B 5 or nectin- 1, an established entry receptor. However, the mechanisms were distinct. Silencing of nectin- 1 prevented intracellular delivery of viral capsids, nuclear transport of a viral tegument protein, and release of calcium stores required for entry. In contrast, B 5 silencing {{had no effect on}} these markers of entry, but inhibited viral protein translation. Specifically, viral immediate early genes, ICP 0 and ICP 4, were transcribed, polyadenylated and transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, but the viral transcripts did not associate with ribosomes or polysomes in B 5 -silenced cells. In contrast, immediate early gene viral transcripts were detected in polysome fractions isolated from control cells. These findings are consistent with sequencing studies demonstrating that B 5 is eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit m (eIF 3 m). Although B 5 silencing altered the polysome profile of cells, silencing had little effect on cellular RNA or protein expression and was not cytotoxic, suggesting that this subunit is not essential for host cellular protein synthesis. Together these results demonstrate that B 5 {{plays a major role in}} the initiation of HSV protein translation and could provide a novel target for strategies to prevent primary and recurrent herpetic disease...|$|E

Few studies {{have been carried out}} to identify the concerns associated with coming to terms with a mastectomy and cancer diagnosis among women eligible for a mastectomy only. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore Taiwanese women 2 ̆ 7 s experience about facing a mastectomy and to determine their deliberations before agreeing to a recommended mastectomy. Methods: Ten women who had undergone a mastectomy participated, with 3 undergoing individual interviews and 7 participating in a focus group. Findings during the interviews guided the focus group. Results: Content analysis revealed 4 themes through the women 2 ̆ 7 s narratives of the decision-making experience when a mastectomy was recommended. These included (a) surviving is a <b>priority,</b> (<b>b)</b> fulfilling responsibility, (c) coming to terms with postsurgery alternatives, and (d) making arrangements. Conclusion: The experience surrounding the decision to undergo a mastectomy among Taiwanese women may be complicated by survival concerns, the meanings of the breast, and a feeling of an uncontrolled daily life. Cultural beliefs ensured that women were fulfilling their expected social roles and always thinking about significant others first. Implications for Practice: Recognizing women 2 ̆ 7 s private concerns with sensitivity and supporting women to balance their own needs and assigned social responsibilities are important considerations for women undergoing a mastectomy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Immunization against {{influenza}} {{is considered an}} essential public health intervention to control both seasonal epidemics and pandemic influenza. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are five key policy and three key programmatic issues that decision-makers should consider before introducing a vaccine. These are (a) public health <b>priority,</b> (<b>b)</b> disease burden, (c) efficacy, quality and safety of the vaccine, (d) other inventions, (e) economic and financial issues, (f) vaccine presentation, (g) supply availability and (h) programmatic strength. We analyzed the body of evidence currently available on these eight issues in the WHO Western Pacific Region. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Studies indexed in PubMed and published in English between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2010 from the 37 countries and areas of the Western Pacific Region were screened for keywords pertaining to the five policy and three programmatic issues. Studies were grouped according to country income level and vaccine target group. There were 133 articles that met the selection criteria, with most (90 %) coming from high-income countries. Disease burden (n = 34), vaccine efficacy, quality and safety (n = 27) and public health priority (n = 27) were most frequently addressed by studies conducted in the Region. Many studies assessed influenza vaccine policy and programmatic issues {{in the general population}} (42 %), in the elderly (24 %) and in children (17 %). Few studies (2 %) addressed the eight issues relating to pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The evidence for vaccine introduction in countries and areas in this Region remains limited, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that do not currently have influenza vaccination programmes. Surveillance activities and specialized studies can be used to assess the eight issues including disease burden among vaccine target groups and the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccine. Multi-country studies should be considered to maximize resource utilization for cross-cutting issues such as vaccine presentation and other inventions...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to understand college stressors among undergraduate business students and to propose recommendations for an innovative academic advising program to help students deal with college stressors associated with their academic, extra-curricular, social, career, and personal lives. Guiding questions for the study included (a) How do academic advisors describe the college stressors in undergraduates’ daily lives? (b) To what extent do academic advisors feel equipped with advising strategies to help students deal with college stressors? and (c) What kinds of training and other resources do advisors suggest for improving their capacity to address students’ stressors? To collect data, the study relied on the qualitative method of one-on-one interviews with six academic advisors of a business school in a large urban university located in the Northeast. The study was guided by Crookston’s (1971) notion of ‘developmental advising’. 	The major findings {{of the study were}} that (a) College stressors (grades, major selection, careers, competitive nature of students, peer pressure, freshmen transition, time management, homesickness and parental pressures) and students struggle with those, (b) Academic advisors are uniquely positioned and well-equipped with skills to help students to deal with stressors, and (c) The advising model put in place by the Executive Director of the business school at the university of study does not allow advisors to help students deal with stressors. Using these findings, the researcher formulated a set of recommendations to improve academic advising. These included (a) Make developmental advising an organizational <b>priority,</b> (<b>b)</b> Restructure the organization to reflect the commitment to developmental advising, (c) Introduce programs and activities that can help students develop as whole persons and excel personally, professionally and academically, and (d) Implement Five C’s of academic advising in recruitment of academic advisors...|$|E
40|$|The University of South Dakota Archaeology Laboratory, {{with the}} support of the Missouri River Institute, {{conducted}} an airborne magnetic survey of the Missouri National Recreational River for the US Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District, (contract #DACW 45 - 01 -P- 0267, supervised by Rebecca Latka, Project Manager, Missouri National Recreational River). The primary goal was to identify buried or submerged cultural resources along the past and present Missouri River channel. The Principal Investigator was Brian Leigh Molyneaux, PhD. TerraQuest Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, an international specialist in airborne geophysical surveys, acquired the total field magnetic data between November 27 and December 12, 2001. CGI Controlled Geophysics Inc., Thornhill, Ontario, Canada, processed the raw flight data. ENW Services, Denver, Colorado, geophysical consultant, contributed survey design, oversight, post-acquisition data processing, geophysical interpretation, and base map creation. The results indicate that the Missouri River Valley has an active geomagnetic response suggesting significant variability in the basement geological units. Prominent features include numerous anomalies within a generally high geomagnetic background in the Yankton area, several northeasterly striking linear anomalies crossing the river valley at Vermillion and Burbank, South Dakota, and an isolated, large circular anomaly on the floodplain opposite Ponca State Park, Nebraska. ENW filtered out the response due to geology using a process that favored short-wavelength anomalies of a size and shape consistent with cultural sources then isolated a scatter of anomalies with reference to the flight path. The Archaeology Laboratory created a GIS for the project and conducted a base-map analysis of each anomaly. The basemaps consisted of a series of Corps of Engineers maps drawn in 1881, a series of Missouri River Commission maps drawn in 1892, the most recent USGS 7. 52 ̆ 7 Quadrangles (as DRGs), and the most recent digitized aerial photographs (DOQQ). Of the 119 anomalies isolated, 99 proved to be above-ground structures or features associated with extant farmsteads or agricultural activity, 12 were Priority A anomalies (primary targets for further investigation), and 8 were <b>Priority</b> <b>B</b> anomalies (less distinctive but still worthy of investigation).

40|$|This study?s {{purpose was}} to glean a {{comprehensive}} list of the leadership challenges faced and strategies utilized during campus crisis and tragedy. It also sought to examine the goals of leadership at different phases of a crisis, aspects of leadership focused on, and recommended leadership practices to follow. A typology was created to identify appropriate crises. The typology classified crises as (a) institution as victim, (b) natural disaster, or (c) institution having legal liability. Fourteen interviews were conducted at eight schools. Interview transcripts were segmented into units for analysis. These data units were coded, grouped into categories, and named as themes. Once all themes were identified, overarching themes established the findings. Eight major challenges were identified for campus leaders during crisis: (a) leading {{in spite of a}} loss of control, (b) coping with deficient, inadequate, or non-existent technical and human crisis response measures or systems, (c) evaluation of leadership decisions occurring almost simultaneously to leadership actions, (d) altering operations and relationships, (e) managing transitions within the life of the crisis, (f) communicating about the crisis, (g) dealing with multiple constituency groups, and (h) dealing with longterm effects. Ten categories of strategies were identified: (a) making safety the <b>priority,</b> (<b>b)</b> leading planning and policy development, (c) garnering resources, (d) leading intentional communications efforts, (e) clarifying the leadership infrastructure, (f) accepting responsibility for crisis leadership, (g) modifying the leadership approach, (h) framing the crisis for others, (i) leading the healing process, and (j) leading efforts to learn from the crisis.

Leadership challenges evolve through predictable stages, invoking a broad range of leadership skills and concepts. During crisis, campus leaders focus on collaborative, symbolic, and logistical leadership. Sharing a common orientation during crisis is facilitative in the decision-making process. Policy development is a powerful means of bringing structure to a chaotic situation and of demonstrating an ethic of care. Findings from this study provided not only an overview of leadership challenges and strategies during campus crisis, but insight into a variety of crisis types, and practical application strategies for university administrators...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} written to {{estimate}} the effect improvement in the logistic planning would have on risk of offshore crane and lifting operations. The effect of logistic planning has on the safety has been modeled {{as a part of}} influencing factors that may lead to incidents. All influencing factors have been evaluated to be able to estimate how much influence the planning has on the logistic chain. The logistic chain has been analyzed, and several bottlenecks in the logistic chain were found. These are: Lack of available space on installation deck Information availability IT software The measures chosen to be implemented are: Load carrier optimization Implementation of software programs Restriction on <b>priority</b> <b>B’s</b> The measures have a direct impact on the planning. By implementing software programs to visualize cargo and RFID (Radio frequency identification) to log the location of cargo, information availability is estimated to have a great improvement. New available technology like this will reduce the barriers between disciplines and the information availability would increase. Restriction of <b>priority</b> <b>B’s</b> {{to reduce the number of}} unnecessary calls is important since it interferes with the original planning and therefore shortens the time personnel are able to plan ahead. Information availability is the way this paper ties IPL to this paper. It describes the benefits of cooperation between personnel and the availability of information. By including new software it was estimated 30 % increase of information availability, this would lead to a reduction of 5 % of incidents during crane and lifting operations. It should also prove beneficial in financial terms, however that was not the focus of this paper. The 5 % improvement is the overall improvement taken into account all influencing factors, such as training and procedure compliance and therefore is a significant result. By reducing "unforeseen cargo", such as priorities, will have a direct impact on the planning and give a reduction of approximately 5 %of incidents, while cargo utilization will provide a reduction of 3, 5 %. If all measures were implemented and followed up a risk reduction of approximately 16 % would be expected which is significant due to crane and lifting operation have a low frequency but high consequence. Integrated planning is a necessity to both reduce priorities, implementation of software tools and load carrier optimization to be reality. The need for cooperation between all the personnel in the logistic chain is critical for such measures to be realized. </p...|$|R

The basic immediate requirements could be summarized in: • The infrastructure should provide the primitives needed by NPTL to support the following POSIX tags: – TPS: thread priority scheduling – TPI: priority inheritance in mutexes – TPP: priority protection in mutexes Or simply: anything that is needed for soft-real time support. • The implementation should support robust mutexes similar to those of Solaris. • The implementation should provide equivalent features at the kernel level for use by drivers and subsystems. With this in mind, we aimed to satisfy the following detailed requirements: 1. mutexes and conditional variables must work according to real-time expectancies (a) All operations (lock, unlock, priority promotion and demotion, etc [...] .) should be deterministic in time, and O(1) when possible (except of course, for waits). (b) The order of lock acquisition by waiters (in mutexes) and wake up (in conditional variables) has to be determined by the scheduling properties of each blocked task/thread. (c) Minimization of priority inversion (given the importance of this item, it will be treated in its own section) : i. lock stealing: in SMP systems, during on the acquisition of the lock a lower priority thread can steal the lock from a higher priority thread. ii. when a high priority thread A is waiting for a lower <b>priority</b> owner <b>B</b> to relinquish the mutex and B is preempted by a medium priority thread C. A. <b>priority</b> protection <b>B.</b> <b>priority</b> inheritance 2. Robustness: when a mutex owner dies, the mutex switches to a dead-owner state and the first waiter gets ownership with a special error code. 3. Uncontested locks/unlocks must happen without kernel intervention. 4. Deadlock detection As well, in order to provide the benefits of this infrastructure to all the levels of a Linux system, it must be possible to use it not only by the user space code, but also by the kernel code. 1. 1 The real time expectancies Real-time is all about being deterministic, so all algorithm execution times need to be as predictable or bounded as possible. Using O(1) algorithms helps with this 2...|$|R
