50|$|CUORE is a scaled-up {{version of}} CUORE-0, hosted {{in a new}} {{custom-built}} cryostat capable of supporting a detector with a mass of approximately one ton. It contains 988 5×5×5 cm3 crystals, with 741 kg TeO2 (206 kg of 130Te). The new cryostat was constructed from extremely radiopure materials aims to improve on the sensitivity of CUORE-0 by an order of magnitude. A large Roman lead shield {{will be used to}} shield the detectors as well. There is a 73-ton octagonal shield outside of the cryostat, constructed of lead and borated <b>polyethlene,</b> {{to reduce the number of}} environmental gamma rays and neutrons reaching the detector. Due to the large number of discrete detectors, cosmic ray muons can be easily excluded by rejecting events that occur simultaneously in multiple detectors.|$|E
50|$|The first {{construction}} phase for the Ra's Lanuf petrochemical complex began during April 1987. Rasco contracted Hemijska Industria Pancevo (HIP) (Yugoslavia) {{to manage}} the complex. During {{the first two years}} production was well below capacity. It began increasing in 1989 and by 1994 operated at about 85% of capacity. The operation was impacted by UN sanctions, specifically Security Council Resolution 883 of November 11, 1993, which banned Libya from importing refinery equipment. Performance improved after the UN suspended sanctions in April 1999. The ethylene cracker was closed for a four-week maintenance in May 1999. The second phase was scheduled to finish in 1994, with Monenco as manager. However, the venture ran into numerous obstacles. In 1985, Tecnimont won a $50 million management contract, but when the contract expired in 1990, Rasco appointed Monenco. In October 1989, the first contract was awarded to a consortium consisting of Energoinvest, HIP, INA-Project and Brown & Root. In 1990, Brown & Root ended its participation and was replaced by Technip. In February 1991, Hyundai Engineering and Construction was awarded a $200 million contract for the <b>polyethlene</b> unit, with John Brown Engineering acting as sub-contractor. Included in the contract was a hydrogen and ethylene purification unit. By the end of 1992, Uhde GmbH (German subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp) won the contract. In 1993, Rasco terminated the construction contract due to the consortia failure to fulfill its terms.|$|E

Although polymerization initiated by such macro-initiators was found to be quite slow, well-defined conjugates of poly(ethylene oxide) -block-poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) and <b>poly(ethlene</b> oxide) -block-poly(beta-benzyl-L-aspartate) with polydispersity indexes as low as 1. 05 were prepared.

Narrow elongated trenches, grouped together {{over a wide}} area, are lined with a heat-absorbing black liner. The heat-absorbing liquid is kept separate from the thermal energy removing fluid by means such as clear polyethylene material. The covering for the pond may be a fluid or solid. If the covering is a fluid, fire fighting foam, continuously generated, or siloons are used to keep the surface covering clean and insulated. If the thermal energy removing fluid is a gas, a fluid insulation layer contained in a flat <b>polyethlene</b> tubing is used to cover the pond.

40|$|Nanosized ZnO (n-ZnO) were {{prepared}} by a wet-chemical method. The polymer-based composite electrolyte films were obtained using solvent casting method {{by the addition}} of nanosized ZnO particles to <b>polyethlene</b> oxide (PEO) and anhydrous lithium perchlorate (LiClO 4). SEM were used to characterize the dispersion of n-ZnO in (PEO) (16) LiClO 4 /n-ZnO composite films. DSC were used to characterize the T-m, T-g and crystallinity of composite films. The ion conductivity of composite polymer electrolyte was measured by AC impedance method. The results indicate that by addition of 10 wt% n-ZnO particles, the ionic conductivity at room temperature of the (PEO) (16) LiClO 4 is enhanced by forty times, which is attributed to the content and dispersion of n-ZnO particles. In addition, the interface between n-ZnO and polymer play a certain role in enhancing conductivity of the polymer electrolyte...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{this study}} is to {{construct}} a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model (FEM) of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) knee including bones, collateral ligaments and total knee prosthesis. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image data of normal knee joint are imported into MIMICS software. The 3 D models of bones and collateral ligaments are respectively reconstructed from CT and MRI image data. Then the reconstructed models are registered and fused together based on external landmarks. The virtual osteotomy and total knee prosthesis implantation are performed to establish the 3 D model of TKA knee. Ultimately, A elaborate 3 D FEM of TKA knee including anatomical structures and total knee prosthesis is obtained by meshing the 3 D model of TKA knee and setting material properties, loading and boundary conditions. The obtained von Mises stress on the <b>polyethlene</b> insert confirms to the clincial mechanical distribution characteristics after TKA. The 3 D FEM of TKA knee retains the integrity and accuracy in the anatomical features and provides a foundation for accurate research on the TKA knee biomechanical behaviors...|$|E
40|$|The aqueous biphasic {{extraction}} (ABE) {{process for}} soil decontamination involves the selective partitioning of solutes and fine particulates between two immiscible aqueous phases. The biphase system {{is generated by}} the appropriate combination of a water-soluble polymer (e. g., <b>polyethlene</b> glycol) with an inorganic salt (e. g., sodium carbonate). Selective partitioning results in 99 to 99. 5 % of the soil being recovered in the cleaned-soil fraction, while only 0. 5 to 1 % is recovered in the contaminant concentrate. The ABE process is best suited to the recovery of ultrafine, refractory material from the silt and clay fractions of soils. During continuous countercurrent extraction tests with soil samples from the Fernald Environmental Management Project site (Fernald, OH), particulate thorium was extracted and concentrated between 6 - and 16 -fold, while the uranium concentration was reduced from about 500 mg/kg to about 77 mg/kg. Carbonate leaching alone was able to reduce the uranium concentration only to 146 mg/kg. Preliminary estimates for treatment costs are approximately $ 160 per ton of dry soil.

40|$|The {{effect of}} pellets of {{prosthesis}} materials on free radicals were examined using {{electron spin resonance}} spectrometry. Pellets used were titanium, alumina, ziruconia, an alloy of cobalt with chromium and <b>polyethlene.</b> These pellets were implanted in the abdominal skin and thigh muscle tissue of rats. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation at 1, 3, 20 hours and 2 and 4 weeks after implantation and subcutaneous and muscle tissues were dissected. Hydroxyl radicals and carbon centerd radicals were analyzed as spin adducts of spin trap, 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline-N-oxide. Hydroxyl and carbon centered radicals in the skin and muscle tissues were increased 1 - 3 hours after the implantation of these materials and these changes were almost recovered to the normal level 20 hours after the implantation except for alumina and ziruconia in the muscle. However, hydroxyl radicals and/or carbon centered radicals were increased in the skin 4 weeks after the implantation of zirconia, titanium, an alloy of cobalt with chromium and polyetylene. These {{results suggest that the}} subacute stage after the implantation of particles of prostheseis materials into the skin and muscle tissues induces the generation of free radicals and than these free radicals may produce tissue damage...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{electrical}} properties of flame resistant polyethylene insulating systems, the electric conduction of chlorinated polyethylene(CPE), chlorinated paraffin(CPA), decabromodiphnylether(DBDPE) and their blends with low density polythylene(LDPE) is studied. The electric conductivity σ of CPE decreases as the halogen content ■ increases from 30 wt% to 40 wt%. This is likely due to {{a decrease in the}} mobility of ion because of an increase in internal viscosity. In CPE-LDPE blends, σ sharply increases with increasing ■ and the dielectric relaxation is observed in the ultra low frequency region, being due to an interfacial polarization of CPE and LDPE. These results can be understood by the proposed model where the blend has a two phase structure of CPE and LDPE and a part of CPE forms a conduction path. In CPA-LDPE blends, σ decreases with increasing ■. DBDPE-LDPE blends show a slight increase in σ with increasing ■. The electric conduction of CPA-LDPE and DBDPE-LDPE blends is likely due to the transport of the carrier supplied from CPA and DBDPE through LDPE, respectively. This is supported by an observation of distribution of CPA or DBDPE with an X-ray scanning microanalyser. All the data is replotted against ■ and a comparison is made between various <b>polyethlene</b> insulating systems...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{find out}} whether a newly {{designed}} big cup nitinol stent is suitable for treatment of patients with gastric outlet obstruction resulting from gastric cancer. METHODS: The new stent is composed of a proximal big cup segment (20 mm in length and 48 - 55 mm in diameter), a middle part (60 mm in length and 20 mm in diameter) covered by a polyethylene membrane and a distal sphericity (20 mm in length and 28 mm in diameter). Half of the proximal big cup segment is also covered by a <b>polyethlene</b> membrane, which is adjacent to the middle part of the stent. The stent is preloaded in a 6. 0 -mm-diameter introducer system. Thirteen patients with gastric outlet obstruction resulting from gastric cancer received the new stents under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 12 of 13 (92. 3 %) patients. Among the 12 patients in whom endoscopic stent was placed successfully, the clinical success rate was 91. 7 % during a follow-up of average 6. 5 mo. During the first month follow-up, the migration rate was 0 %, recurrent obstruction 0 % and gastric bleeding 8. 3 %. During the follow-up between 2 - 12 mo, no migration, recurrent obstruction and gastric bleeding occurred. CONCLUSION: The proximal big cup segment seems to be effective and promising for technical efficacy, clinical outcome, and preventing migration and tumor ingrowth and increasing the emptying rate of sinus ventriculi...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{produced}} chemicals have revolutionised the way {{in which}} humans live and has led to both a significant increase in quality of life and a concomitant change in the way we pollute our habitats. Such chemicals include pharmaceuticals, plasticisers, perfluorinated compounds and metabolites which enter rivers via sources such as sewage treatment works (STW) effluent outfalls. The presence and distribution of these contaminants is of concern due to their increasing use and ability of some to biologically affect non-target aquatic organisms at trace (ng/L) levels. This work investigated the fate and distribution of selected pharmaceuticals, plasticisers, illict drugs, perfluorinated compunds (PFCs) and metabolites are investigated in three rivers of southern England. Specific objectives included establishing spatial distribution patterns of selected contaminants along the entire course of rivers receiving inputs from multiple STWs, their partition between bound (to suspended particulate material) and dissolved phases of river water, accumulation in sediment, bioaccumulation in primary producers including plants and biofilm/ periphyton, bioaccumulation in benthic aquatic organisms, adsorption of studied contaminants to <b>polyethlene</b> microparticles (similar to those used in cosmetic products) both in the lab and in rivers, and adsorption to 'natural' replacements for polyethylene microparticles (MPs). Spatial distribution analysis showed that selected contaminants are ubiquitous in the studied rivers with trace levels of plasticisers and perfluorinated compounds identified in river headwaters and beyond. Within the rivers studied in this work, pharmaceuticals were shown to be exclusively introduced by STW effluent and persisted exclusively in the dissolved phase of river water through the studies areas. Plasticisers and PFCs however were additionally introduced via runoff from streets, at times at higher concentrations than in SFWs effluent outfall and bound to suspended particulate material. Only PFCs and plasticisers were found to be bioaccumulative or very bioaccumulative in aquatic plants, biofilm. periphton and benthic organisms, and accumulated in sediment. Illicit drugs were only found in STW effluent and downstream river flow, almost exclusively in the dissolved phase of collected water. Laboratory assessment of adsorption to polyethylene MPs showed adsorption largely occurred via a linear isotherm and only for PFCs. However, trace levels of pharmaceuticals and an illicit drug urinary metabolite were extracted from polyethylene MPs deployed downstream from STW effluent outfalls in three rivers. Investigation of a 'natural' alternative to polyethyle MPs (walnut husk Mps) showed adsorption to these replacement particles occurred to a greater amount with more of the studied contaminants than to polyethylene MPs. This work significantly contributes to the knowledge of organis contaminant occurrence, bioaccumulation, fate and distribution in the aquatic environment. Future research should focus on elucidating the fate and distribution of conugated pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the aquatic environment, establishing organism-specific contaminant bioaccumulation guideline, the effect of microparticle fragmentation on contaminant adsorption, identification of adsorption-free MPs for use in cosmetic products and developing study designs to incorporate environmental epigenetics with toxicology and chemistry in the aquatic environment...|$|E
