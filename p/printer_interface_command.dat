50|$|Since {{there were}} severe {{shortcomings}} of early Commodore printers, CARDCO released the Card Print A (C/?A) <b>printer</b> <b>interface</b> that emulated Commodore printers by converting the Commodore-style CBM-bus IEEE-488 serial interface to a Centronics printer port to allow numerous 3rd-party printers {{to be connected}} to a Commodore 64, such as Epson, Okidata, C.

CARDCO released additional enhancements, including a model with RS-232 output, and shipped a total over 2 million <b>printer</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Xetec also released a series of <b>printer</b> <b>interfaces.</b> With a parallel interface, the QMS KISS laser printer, the most inexpensive then available at $1995, could be used.

50|$|One of the Indigo Forms software's {{innovations}} when it {{was introduced}} was its ability to have its forms installed into Laserjet font cartridges. This meant that the product only had to send forms data to the printer; since the form was already encoded in the font cartridge. Given the slow <b>printer</b> <b>interfaces</b> used at that time, this greatly reduced print times.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of industrial technology, the requirements to surface feature of machinery parts {{are more and}} more high. It is far not enough to describe the machined surface feature with single roughness parameter Ra, but the instrument improvement for adding measurable roughness parameters is always companied with the cost increase. Therefore, how to acquire multi-parameter measurement of machined surface feature with existing single parameter profilometer is a significant and practical problem. It is a convenient and efficient way to acquire measurement data through the communication between measurement instrument and personal computer through parallel <b>printer</b> <b>interface.</b> This paper investigates the feasibility. A portable profilometer was taken as the displacement sensor, which was communicated with PC through parallel <b>printer</b> <b>interface</b> under the control of special software written by ourselves. The plentiful information of measured surface was entered the computer, through data processing the surface profile curve and various parameters were produced automatically. Consequently, the surface feature can be fully investigated...|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in February 1983. Initially, they produced simple peripherals {{such as an}} RS-232 to Centronics parallel <b>printer</b> <b>interface</b> adapter. Later, they designed the Expanderam series of RAM expansion cards for the QL, {{which led to the}} Trump Card combined RAM expansion and floppy disk interface. This was notable in that it mapped RAM into memory space reserved for external peripheral devices, thus allowing the QL's RAM to be expanded to 768 kB rather than the official limit of 512 kB.|$|R
