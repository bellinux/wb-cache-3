5|$|Virgin queens {{and males}} appear in colonies during January, before their nuptial flight. 20 females or fewer {{are found in}} a single colony, while males are much more common. The nuptial flight begins at {{different}} times for each species; they have been recorded in mid-summer to autumn (January to early April), {{but there is one}} case of a nuptial flight occurring from May to July. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight are hot stormy days with windspeeds of 30km/h (18mi/h) and temperatures reaching 30°C (86°F), and elevations of 91 metres (300ft). Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly, although as many as four queens may leave the nest at the same time. Species are both polygynous and <b>polyandrous,</b> with queens mating with one to ten males. Polygynous and <b>polyandrous</b> societies can occur in a single nest, but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily <b>polyandrous.</b> For example, nearly 80% of tested M. pilosula colonies are polygynous while M. pyriformis colonies are mostly <b>polyandrous.</b> Nuptial flight takes place during the morning and can last until late afternoon. When the alates leave the nest, most species launch themselves into the air from trees and shrubs, although others launch themselves off the ground. Queens discharge a glandular secretion from the tergal gland, which males are strongly attracted to. As many as 1,000 alates will gather to mate. A queen was once found to have five or six males attempting to copulate with her. The queen is unable to bear the weight of the large number of males trying to mate with her, and will drop to the ground, with the ants dispersing later on. M. pulchra queens are ergatoid and cannot fly; the males meet the queen out in an open area away from the nest and mate, and these queens do not return to their nest after mating.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are intelligent, {{with some}} {{possessing}} large brains, self-awareness and tool use. Mammals can communicate and vocalize {{in several different}} ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-marking, alarm signals, singing, and echolocation. Mammals can organize themselves into fission-fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies, but can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but some can be monogamous or <b>polyandrous.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the Ramayana {{states that}} Tara first weds Vali, some Ramayana adaptations {{sometimes}} present a <b>polyandrous</b> relationship between Tara, Vali and Sugriva. The Ranganatha Ramayana states that Tara {{is given to}} Vali and Sugriva {{as a reward for}} helping the gods. A Tamil folk tale tells that after the amrita emerged, Tara rises and is given as a common wife to both Vali and Sugriva. In the Mahabharata, there is a reference to Vali and Sugriva fighting over an unnamed woman, who the mythologist Bhattacharya believes to be Tara.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are mainly}} {{polygynous}} with <b>polyandrous</b> queens, however, polyandry in jack jumper colonies {{is low in}} comparison to other Myrmecia ants, but it is comparable to M. pyriformis ants. In 1979, Craig and Crozier investigated the genetic structure of jack jumper ant colonies, and although queens are unrelated {{to each other as}} mentioned previously, the occurrence of related queens in a single colony was possible. During colony foundation, there are suggestions of dependent colony foundation in jack jumper queens, although independent colony foundations can occur, as the queens do have fully developed wings and can fly. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns have been recorded, specifically where nests that tend to be closer to each other were more genetically similar in comparison to other nests farther away.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an oestrus ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each oestrus lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus. Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression toward one another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a few more times within the next few days. <b>Polyandrous,</b> females can mate with several males. The mean number of motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E
5|$|Queens are <b>polyandrous,</b> {{meaning that}} queens will mate more than once; queens mate with one to nine males during a nuptial flight, and the {{effective}} number of mates per queen ranges from 1.0 to 11.4. Studies {{show that most}} queen ants will only mate {{with one or two}} males. If the number of available male mates increases, the number of effective matings per queen decreases. Colonies are polygynous, meaning that a colony may house multiple queens; there are on average one to four queens per colony, and in multiple-queen colonies, the egg-laying queens are unrelated to one another. Based on a study, 11 of the 14 colonies tested were polygynous (78.57%), showing that this is common in jack jumper colonies. When the queen establishes a nest after mating, she will hunt for food to feed her young, making her semi-claustral. Nests can hold as few as 500 ants or as many as 800 to 1,000. Excavated nests typically have populations ranging from 34 to 344 individuals. Jack jumper ant workers are gamergates, having the ability to reproduce in colonies with or without queens.|$|E
5|$|Some birds, {{especially}} corvids and parrots, {{are among}} the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (arrangement of one male with many females) or, rarely, <b>polyandrous</b> (arrangement of one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyandrous</b> mating {{systems are}} also a common {{phenomenon}} in the animal kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Among the whales, <b>polyandrous</b> {{behavior}} {{has been noted}} among the bowhead, harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), and humpback whales.|$|E
25|$|A common {{example of}} <b>polyandrous</b> mating {{can be found}} in the field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) of the {{invertebrate}} order Orthoptera (containing crickets, grasshoppers, and groundhoppers). <b>Polyandrous</b> behavior is also prominent in many other insect species, including the red flour beetle and the species of spider Stegodyphus lineatus. Polyandry also occurs in some primates such as marmosets, mammal groups, the marsupial genus' Antechinus and bandicoots, around 1% of all bird species, such as jacanas and dunnocks, insects such as honeybees, and fish such as pipefish.|$|E
25|$|Males {{in these}} mating systems are {{generally}} monogamous, if not bigynous, and have sexually evolved accordingly. Since males of these cannibalistic species {{have adapted to}} the extreme mating system, and usually mate only once with a <b>polyandrous</b> female, they are considered monogynous.|$|E
25|$|Limpkins may {{be either}} monogamous, with females joining a male's territory, or {{serially}} <b>polyandrous,</b> {{with two or}} more females joining a male. With the monogamous pairs, banding {{studies have shown that}} a small number of pairs will reform the following year (4 out of 18 pairs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyandrous</b> {{behavior}} is quite {{widespread in the}} animal kingdom. It is prominent in many species of insects and fish (for example pipefish; see Polyandry in fish). It {{is also found in}} other animals such as birds (for example dunnocks), whales, and in some mammals such as house mouse.|$|E
25|$|Polyandry {{may also}} impose costs on females, exposing them to diseases, {{increased}} predation risk, {{time and energy}} costs, and even physical harm due to sexual harassment. <b>Polyandrous</b> females encounter sexual harassment when courted by males resulting to be costly to females. In {{order to reduce the}} costs to the females, females will take part in polyandry. For example, in the bee species Anthidium maculosum, like in many other species, the high cost of resisting mating may exceed the cost of accepting numerous males in a breeding if copulating takes a short time, and therefore females in some species are inclined to being <b>polyandrous.</b> In the <b>polyandrous</b> system, sexual coercion has been observed {{to be one of the}} major reasons for why females begin to mate with multiple males to outweigh the cost under different circumstances. The sexual conflict hypothesis suggest that polyandry can occur due to sexual coercion preventing females from obtaining any benefits. Sexual coercion has been seen in three different forms: forced copulation, sexual harassment, and intimidation. Forced copulation is seen in those males that cannot gain access to females for mating. As a result of the lack of access to mates, males are more likely to engage in sexually aggressive behaviors that could result in physical harm and death for females, as has been observed in elephant seals and ducks. Intimidation was seen in social primates, who coerce females into mating, therefore, pushing them to mate with their own aggressor. Males use intimidation as a method of punishment in females that do not mate with them.|$|E
25|$|He {{believes}} that both <b>polyandrous</b> sambandhams and hypergamy were {{most common in}} Central Kerala. In northern Travancore there appears {{not to have been}} as great a prevalence of hypergamy because of a relative scarcity of Brahmins living there. Fuller {{believes that}} in the relatively undocumented southern Travancore monogamy may have been predominant, and that although the matrilineal joint family still applied it was usually the case that the wife lived with the tharavad of her husband.|$|E
25|$|Infanticide {{avoidance}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} reason animals, like mammals, are inclined to choose polyandry. Infanticide is observed to be the major cause of mortality in various mammals. Polyandry is thought to evolve from their offspring's vulnerability to infanticide. There is evidence that polyandry is an effective strategy that is adapted by many to increase their offspring survival through the avoidance of male infanticide. Bank voles (Myodes glareolus) has supported the infanticide avoidance hypothesis where <b>polyandrous</b> females' offspring have a higher survival than monandrous females' offspring.|$|E
25|$|Polyandry in Tibet was {{a common}} {{practice}} and continues {{to a lesser extent}} today. In Tibet, polyandry has been outlawed since the Chinese takeover of the area in 1950, so it is difficult to measure the incidence of polyandry in what may have been the world's most <b>polyandrous</b> society. Polyandry in India still exists among minorities, and also in Bhutan, and the northern parts of Nepal. Polyandry has been practised in several parts of India, such as Rajasthan, Ladakh and Zanskar, in the Jaunsar-Bawar region in Uttarakhand, among the Toda of South India.|$|E
25|$|Fraternal {{polyandry}} (from the Latin frater—brother), {{also called}} adelphic polyandry, {{is a form}} of polyandry in which a woman is married to two or more men who are one another's brothers. Fraternal polyandry was (and sometimes still is) found in certain areas of Tibet, Nepal, and Northern India, where polyandry was accepted as a social practice. The Toda people of southern India practice fraternal polyandry, but monogamy has become prevalent recently. In contemporary Hindu society, <b>polyandrous</b> marriages in agrarian societies in the Malwa region of Punjab seem to occur to avoid division of farming land.|$|E
25|$|The {{practices}} of thalikettu kalyanam, the <b>polyandrous</b> sambandhams, {{and also the}} existence of large tharavads declined during the nineteenth century, as did that of hypergamy. Monogamy and small nuclear family units became the norm, as they were elsewhere in the country. This process occurred more rapidly in some areas than in others, and in Central Kerala the traditional systems still lingered {{as late as the}} 1960s, although hypergamy had largely disappeared everywhere by the 1920s. A possible reason for the various rates of change across the region lies in {{the extent to which the}} various agrarian local economies were dominated by the Nairs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyandrous</b> {{relations}} are disapproved of inmost expressions of Hinduism.There {{is at least}} one reference to polyandry in the ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata. Draupadi married the five Pandava brothers, as this is what she chose in a previous life. This ancient text remains largely neutral to the concept of polyandry, accepting this as her way of life. However, in the same epic, when questioned by Kunti to give an example of polyandry, Yudhishthira cites Gautam-clan Jatila (married to seven Saptarishis) and Hiranyaksha's sister Pracheti (married to ten brothers), thereby implying a more open attitude toward polyandry in Vedic society.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} suggests that polyandry is the dominant social structure in the Callitrichidae subfamily of New World monkeys. The Callitrichidae family includes marmosets and tamarins, two groups of small New World monkeys found in South America. Wild groups usually consist of three to ten individuals, with one reproductively active female, one or more reproductive males, and several nonreproductive helpers that can be either male or female. Interestingly, cooperative polyandry {{is not the only}} mating system found in these primates. <b>Polyandrous,</b> monogamous, and polygynous groups can be found within the same population, and a group can even change mating systems, making it the most flexible mating system of any non-human primate. Unlike most primates who typically give birth to single young, twins are the average litter size for tamarins and marmosets. The entire group participates in raising the offspring, sharing the responsibilities of infant carrying, feeding, and grooming. The presence of nonreproductive helpers appears {{to be the most important}} factor in determining which mating system is used, as ecological and environmental variability have not been found to have a significant impact. Goldizen (1987) proposed the hypothesis that monogamy in Callitrichidae should develop only in groups with nonreproductive helpers to help raise the young, and in the absence of these helpers, both <b>polyandrous</b> males and females would have higher reproductive success than those in lone monogamous pairs. Indeed, in studies of Saguinus fuscicollis, common name saddle-back tamarin, no monogamous lone pairs have ever been seen to attempt a breeding cycle.|$|E
25|$|Males that {{compete for}} more mating {{opportunities}} {{are the ones}} that have shown less cooperation in breeding. However, there are other males that in order to gain access to females and mating opportunities practice parental care. Such parental care is mostly seen in <b>polyandrous</b> mating systems; but they must go through the cost of sharing paternity and parental care. This has been observed in avians like acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), and fishes as the cichlid fish (Julidochromis transcriptus). Observations that show male relatedness suggest the importance for male social relationships in taking care of offspring. These social relationships in males are seen in primates, Geoffroy's tamarins, Saguinus geoffroyi. High proportions of related males at the half sibling or higher were found.|$|E
25|$|Rivers {{had already}} formed {{a career in}} {{physiology}} and psychology. But now he moved more definitively into anthropology. He wanted a demographically small, fairly isolated people, comparable to the island societies of the Torres Strait, where {{he might be able}} to get genealogical data on each and every individual. The Todas in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, with their population then about 700 plus, suited Rivers’s criteria. And they had speciﬁc features of social organization, such as <b>polyandrous</b> marriage and a bifurcation of their society into so-called moieties that had interested historical evolutionists. Whether his fieldwork was initially so single-minded is questionable, however, since at first he looked at other local communities and studied their visual perception before fixing all his attention on the Todas.|$|E
25|$|Some male {{behaviors}} {{that may have}} led to polyandry are displacement, where a male is gripped onto and mating with a female, another male may make an effort to mate as well and displace the male that was originally copulating; forced copulation, where there is a high density of aggressive males, and female abandonment, where a female but spots a better one to mate with and abandons the less favorable one. This can lead to sequential polyandry if the male leaves before the entire clutch is released and an additional male fertilizes these eggs as well. In Bibron's toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) females spread out their eggs across the nests of two to eight males, with those who exhibited higher levels of <b>polyandrous</b> behavior having higher mean offspring survivorship, showing that insurance against nest failure and dispersal of mortality risk is related to the evolution of polyandry.|$|E
25|$|Multiple mating is {{also seen}} in wattled jacanas where females {{have a group}} of males close by for mating. Copulations are easily seen in jacanas facilitating the {{observation}} of females copulating continuously with various males. The continuous copulations and the close proximity to mates have allowed the females to fly in within minutes leading to the expected sperm mixing and allowing the most viable sperm to fertilize most of the clutch or to increase genetic diversity for benefits in disease resistance. Snow and Andrade (2005) concluded that the redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti) increases their ability to manipulate the paternity of their offspring by using the spermathecae to store multiple sperms. Additionally, a study on leaf-cutting ants (Acromyrmex echinatior) supported the hypothesis that sperm mixing indeed occurs in <b>polyandrous</b> social insects. It was further found that the eggs in the queen ants showed to be completely mixed and used randomly during egg laying.|$|E
25|$|It is {{only during}} the {{breeding}} season males congregate around a female in estrus for a few hours. All spiral-horned antelope species are <b>polyandrous.</b> Aggression is very low among individuals of both sexes though intraspecific competition does occur. In females often they neck-fight as well poke and snap at each other. Males would use their horns for wrestling where they try to attack the face. Sometimes there is even intimation from the males to persuade the female into submission as often she would try and retaliate. The gestation period occurs once the female has been inseminated from the male successfully. In most species it lasts approximately seven months, although in the larger species this extends to eight or nine months. They only {{give birth to a}} single calf. Once the young are born, they won't wean until they are around five to six months of age. Females sexually mature by two to three years while for males it is four to five years.|$|E
25|$|The bella moth {{presents}} a <b>polyandrous</b> mating system, where females mate with multiple males. On average, females mate with {{four to five}} males over their lifespan of {{three to four weeks}} but can mate with and receive up to thirteen spermatophores. Since spermatophores contain nuptial gifts of pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) and nutrients, multiple mating helps the female increase the fitness of her offspring. In addition, multiple mating also benefits the female directly. Since the spermatophores are sizeable and can be digested within the female, multiple mating allows females to accrue the resources necessary to build additional eggs. This is equivalent to a 15% increase in egg production. In addition, multiple mating results in increased transmission of alkaloidal gifts to eggs. However, {{this does not mean that}} there is segregated allocation of these gifts. Instead, the PA obtained from numerous males is allocated in admixture so that eggs tend to receive from more than one male source. In contrast, normally most of the sperm used to fertilize the eggs comes from a single male.|$|E
500|$|Breeding usually {{involves}} {{some form of}} courtship display, typically performed by the male. Most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song. Some displays, however, are quite elaborate. Depending on the species, these may include wing or tail drumming, dancing, aerial flights, or communal lekking. Females are generally the ones that drive partner selection, although in the <b>polyandrous</b> phalaropes, this is reversed: plainer males choose brightly coloured females. Courtship feeding, billing and [...] are commonly performed between partners, generally after the birds have paired and mated.|$|E
500|$|Fossas have a <b>polyandrous</b> mating system. Most of {{the details}} of {{reproduction}} in wild populations are from the western dry deciduous forests; determining whether or not certain of these details are applicable to eastern populations will require further field research. Mating typically occurs during September and October, although there are reports of its occurring as late as December, and can be highly conspicuous. In captivity in the Northern Hemisphere, fossas instead mate in the northern spring, from March to July. Intromission usually occurs in trees on horizontal limbs about [...] off the ground. Frequently the same tree is used year after year, with remarkable precision as to the date the season commences. Trees are often near a water source, and have limbs strong enough and wide enough to support the mating pair, about [...] wide. Some mating has been reported on the ground as well.|$|E
500|$|In April 1841, Smith wed Louisa Beaman. During {{the next}} two-and-a-half years he married or was sealed to about 30 {{additional}} women, ten {{of whom were}} already married to other men. Some of these <b>polyandrous</b> marriages were done {{with the consent of}} the first husbands, and some plural marriages may have been considered [...] "eternity-only" [...] sealings; [...] (Hales discusses the historical records and context of 5-11 such sealings, which indicate they were eternity-only unions.); [...] (Quinn acknowledged in 2012 that a recently discovered historical record regarding Ruth Sayers indicates that the union applied [...] "only to the eternities after mortal life," [...] disproving his previously-held [...] "decades-long" [...] assumption that excluded eternity-only sealings.). Ten of Smith's plural wives were between the ages of fourteen and twenty; others were over fifty. The practice of polygamy was kept secret from both non-Mormons and most members of the church during Smith's lifetime.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the reasons}} this bat is in so much danger is its slow {{reproduction}} rate. The Eastern small-footed bat usually has only one offspring a year, although a few instances of twins have been noted. Mating most often occurs in autumn and the female stores the male’s sperm throughout hibernation in the winter. Fertilization occurs in the spring once the females are active again, and gestation occurs between 50–60 days with young being born in late May and early June. Mating has also been noted to occur throughout the hibernation period if individuals awake. [...] During the time of breeding large number of bats {{come together in a}} behavior commonly known as “swarming.” All bats of this species are <b>polyandrous,</b> meaning they mate with multiple partners throughout the mating period. This mating behavior allows them to increase the likelihood of copulation, and therefore increase their reproductive success.|$|E
500|$|Parsons and Sara {{were in an}} open {{relationship}} {{encouraged by}} the O.T.O.'s <b>polyandrous</b> sexual ethics, and she became enamored with Hubbard; Parsons, despite attempting to repress his passions, became intensely jealous. Motivated {{to find a new}} partner through occult means, Parsons began to devote his energies to conducting black magic, causing concern among fellow O.T.O. members who believed that it was invoking troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that [...] "our own Jack is enamored with Witchcraft, the houmfort, voodoo. From the start he always wanted to evoke something—no matter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a result." [...] He told the residents that he was imbuing statues in the house with a magical energy in order to sell them to fellow occultists. Parsons reported paranormal events in the house resulting from the rituals; including poltergeist activity, sightings of orbs and ghostly apparitions, alchemical (sylphic) effect on the weather, and disembodied voices. Pendle suggested that Parsons was particularly susceptible to these interpretations and attributed the voices to a prank by Hubbard and Sara. One ritual allegedly brought screaming banshees to the windows of the Parsonage, an incident that disturbed Forman {{for the rest of his}} life. In December 1945 Parsons began a series of rituals based on Enochian magic during which he masturbated onto magical tablets, accompanied by Sergei Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto. Describing this magical operation as the Babalon Working, he hoped to bring about the incarnation of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth. He allowed Hubbard to take part as his [...] "scribe", believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena. As described by Richard Metzger, [...] "Parsons jerked off in the name of spiritual advancement" [...] while Hubbard [...] "scanned the astral plane for signs and visions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, {{and other}} early Latter-day Saints, practiced {{polygynous}} marriages. [...] The practice was officially {{ended with the}} 1890 Manifesto. [...] <b>Polyandrous</b> marriages did exist, albeit in significantly less numbers, in early LDS history.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of Islam, the Arabian Peninsula was characterized by a wide range of marriage practices—both polygynous and <b>polyandrous</b> alike, as well as monogamous.
