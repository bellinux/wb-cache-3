5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the <b>prepuce</b> and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding.

5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In both males and females, {{the base of the}} glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced <b>prepuce</b> with an enlarged orifice with split lips.|$|E

40|$|Os objetivos do estudo foram: (a) relatar os procedimentos no condicionamento dos machos reprodutores no período pré-pubere de criação, averiguando o percentual de montas com sucesso, volume do ejaculado e concentração espermática. (b) Avaliar o efeito da suplementação de vitamina A em machos reprodutores nos parâmetros: volume, motilidade, concentração espermática e alterações morfológicas. A pesquisa foi desenvolvida no Laboratório de Pesquisa em Suínos, da FMVZ-USP, utilizando-se de animais de linhagens híbridas sintéticas, provenientes de uma granja reprodutiva localizada no sudoeste de São Paulo, local este, onde foi realizada a seleção dos animais a partir de 70 dias de idade e com peso médio de 25, 16 Kg. Aos 117 dias de idade foi realizada a inspeção dos aprumos, testículos, bolsa prepucial e pênis, sendo selecionados 12 animais, que foram transferidos para o referido laboratório, aos 193 dias de idade, com peso médio de 147, 00 Kg. O condicionamento iniciou-se aos 210 dias de idade dos animais, e, após 8 semanas, todos os reprodutores já estavam saltando no manequim, havendo a estabilização das colheitas. A partir deste período os valores das características, volume e concentração tornaram-se estáveis, demonstrando-se a homogeneidade dos animais que serviram para a fase {{experimental}} subsequente, relativa à avalição dos efeitos da vitamina A em animais submetidos a suplementação de vitamina A e controle. Nesta segunda fase experimental, foram verificadas diferenças significativas (p< 0, 05) quanto à motilidade, concentração espermática quantificada pela câmara de Neubauer e alterações morfológicas, não havendo significância quanto à concentração total e volume do ejaculado. Houve significância (p< 0, 05) quanto ao tempo nas 25 colheitas, semanais, quanto a concentração, quantificada na câmara de Neubauer e total, não se evidenciando interação x tratamento. Inferiu-se com o estudo que, dada à condição metabólica diferencial dos animais de genéticas híbridas sintéticas, novas averiguações devem ser direcionada para a relação nutrição x reprodução, devem ser averiguadas, uma vez que, os efeitos positivos da suplementação da vitamina A na espermatogênese foram destacados, principalmente nas características que mais se relacionam com a formação da célula espermáticaThe {{objectives of}} the study were: (a) Report the procedures for the conditioning of boars in the pre pubescent period of the breeding, by checking the percentage of succeed mounts, semenś concentration and volume. (b) Evaluate {{the effect of the}} vitamin A supplementation in boars, related to the parameters: volume, motility, semen concentration and changes in the morphology of the spermatozoids. The research was developed in the Swine Research Laboratory from the FMVZ, University of São Paulo, Pirassununga campus. In {{the first phase of the}} trial, which corresponded to the conditioning of the boars to the semenś collection process, 12 boars were utilized. The boars for the experiment came from a breeding swine operation located at the southeast of the SP state and were born from a hybrid synthetic genetic line. They were 70 days old and weighted an average of 25. 16 Kg. At 117 days of age the inspection of the legs, testicles, <b>prepuceś</b> bag and penis was done. 12 animals among the 24 were selected and, at 193 days of age and weighting an average of 147 kg, they were transferred to the boarsúnit of the referred Laboratory. The conditioning process started at 210 days of age and 8 weeks after all the boars were already mounting on the dummy, which completed the phase of the collectionsśtabilization. From this period, the values of the characteristics (volume and concentration) become stable, showing the homogeneity of the animals, which were used in the next experimental phase, related to the evaluation of the vitamin A effects on both treatments (Control and Vitamin A supplementation). In this second experimental phase we found significant differences (p< 0. 05) considering motility, semen concentration determined by the Neubauer chamber and changes in the morphology of the spermatozoids, while no significant differences were found considering semenś concentration and volume. There was significance (P< 0. 05) considering time in the 25 collections, weekly collections, concentrations, Neubauer chambers and the total, while the interaction time x movement was not significant. The study lead us to conclude that due to the differential condition of the animals which were born from the present hybrid genetics, it is necessary to study the relationship nutrition x reproduction, once the positive effects of the vitamin A supplementation in the semen production was emphasized, mostly in the characteristics that are related to the formation of the sperm cells...|$|R

There was some delicacy of structure with muscles that were not very well developed... The distribution of pubic hair was typical of the male. Perhaps the lower extremities were somewhat delicate, resembling the female, and were covered with hair... The penis was curved posteriorly and measured 6 cm, or with stretching, 10 cm. The corona was 3 cm long and 8 cm in circumference. There was an ample <b>prepuce.</b> There was a first grade hypospadias...

500|$|The {{clitoris}} and penis {{are generally}} the same anatomical structure, although the distal portion (or opening) of the urethra is absent in the clitoris {{of humans and}} most other animals. The idea that males have clitorises was suggested in 1987 by researcher Josephine Lowndes Sevely, who theorized that the male corpora cavernosa (a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue which contain most of the blood in the penis during penile erection) are the true counterpart of the clitoris. She argued that [...] "the male clitoris" [...] is directly beneath {{the rim of the}} glans penis, where the frenulum of <b>prepuce</b> of the penis (a fold of the <b>prepuce)</b> is located, and proposed that this area be called the [...] "Lownde's crown." [...] Her theory and proposal, though acknowledged in anatomical literature, did not materialize in anatomy books. Modern anatomical texts instead show that the clitoris displays a hood that is the equivalent of the penis's foreskin, which covers the glans, and a shaft that is attached to the glans; the male corpora cavernosa are homologous to the corpus cavernosum clitoridis (the female cavernosa); the corpus spongiosum is homologous to the vestibular bulbs beneath the labia minora, and the scrotum is homologous to the labia minora and labia majora.|$|E

FGC affects many religious faiths, nationalities, and socioeconomic classes and is highly controversial. The main arguments advanced to justify FGC are hygiene, fertility, the preservation of chastity, an important rite of passage, marriageability and enhanced sexual pleasure of male partners. The amount of tissue removed varies considerably, leading the WHO and other bodies to classify FGC into four types. These range from the partial or total removal of the clitoris {{with or without the}} <b>prepuce</b> (clitoridectomy) in Type I, to the additional removal of the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora [...] (Type II) to narrowing of the vaginal orifice (...) with the creation of a covering seal by suturing the remaining labial tissue over the urethra and introitus, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation).

500|$|The urethra and vagina of {{the female}} spotted hyena exit through the clitoris, {{allowing}} the females to urinate, copulate and give birth through this organ. This trait makes mating more laborious for the male than in other mammals, and also makes attempts to sexually coerce (physically force sexual activity on) females futile. Joan Roughgarden, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist, said that because the hyena's clitoris is higher on the belly than the vagina in most mammals, the male hyena [...] "must slide his rear under the female when mating so that his penis lines up with [...] ". In an action similar to pushing up a shirtsleeve, the [...] "female retracts the [...] on itself, and creates an opening into which the male inserts his own penis". The male must practice this act, which can {{take a couple of}} months to successfully perform. Female spotted hyenas exposed to larger doses of androgen have significantly damaged ovaries, making it difficult to conceive.
