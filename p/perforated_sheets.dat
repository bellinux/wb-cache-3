The one exception to this was the network used by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD)—the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party—who {{did not make the}} change until 1 July 1939. Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the insecure procedure of sending the enciphered message key twice, remained in use, and it was quickly exploited. Henryk Zygalski devised a manual method that used 26 <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets,</b> and Marian Rejewski commissioned the AVA company to produce the bomba kryptologiczna (cryptologic bomb).|$|E
2500|$|Greece's first {{commemorative}} stamps {{were issued}} in 1896 for the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first Olympic games in modern times. The series consisted of twelve values (1 lepton, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 40 and 60 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 5 and 10 drachmae). There were eight different designs, by Professor I. Svoronos, which included famous sports-related images from ancient Greece, {{such as a}} chariot race and Myron's Discobolus. The stamps were designed by Swiss artist A. Guilleron, the steel dies were created by the French engraver [...] and printing {{took place at the}} National Printing Office of France. The name E. MOUCHON appears at the bottom side of each stamp. [...] The stamps were delivered in <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets</b> (13½ x 14). [...] They were at first meant to be sold only during the Games, but their circulation period was extended; first to March 1897, then until they were sold out. The 1896 Olympics stamps, of which the 5 and 10 drachmae denominations are relatively rare, remain popular with collectors of topical stamps relating to sports and Olympic games.|$|E

5000|$|Jeffreys was put {{in charge}} of a small section {{manufacturing}} <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets</b> for use in the cryptanalysis of the Enigma, a task which took over three months, completed on 7 January 1940. One type were the Zygalski sheets, known as Netz at Bletchley Park, a technique revealed to the British by Polish cryptologists. Another type, named [...] "Jeffreys sheets", were different, and were a [...] "catalogue of the effect of any two Enigma rotors and the reflector". Jeffreys's <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets</b> were used by Polish cryptologists in exile in France to make the first wartime decryption of an Enigma message on 17 January 1940.|$|E

5000|$|The British, at Bletchley Park, near London, England, {{undertook}} {{the production}} of two complete sets of <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets.</b> The work was done, {{with the aid of}} perforators, by a section headed by John R.F. Jeffreys. The sheets were known at Bletchley as Netz (from Netzverfahren, [...] "net method"), though they were later remembered by Gordon Welchman as [...] "Jeffreys sheets"; the latter term, however, referred to another catalog produced by Jeffreys' section.|$|E

Initially, the product was called Shepard’s Adhesive Annotations. The citations were printed on gummed, <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets,</b> which could be divided and pasted onto pages of case law.

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a masking method generally and, more particularly to {{a method of}} masking <b>perforated</b> titanium <b>sheets</b> having laminar control suction strips. As illustrated in the drawings, a nonaerodynamic surface of a <b>perforated</b> <b>sheet</b> has alternating suction strip areas and bonding land areas. Suction strip tapes overlie the bonding land areas during application of a masking material to an upper surface of the suction strip tapes. Prior to bonding the <b>perforated</b> <b>sheet</b> to a composite structure, the bonding land tapes are removed. The entire opposite aerodynamic surface is masked with tape before bonding. This invention provides a precise control of suction strip porosities by ensuring that no chemicals penetrate the suction strip areas during bonding...|$|R

5000|$|Only {{a limited}} number of {{scrambler}} settings would give rise to females, and these would have been identifiable from the card catalog. If the first six letters of the ciphertext were SZVSIK, this would be termed a 1-4 female; if WHOEHS, a 2-5 female; and if ASWCRW, a 3-6 female. The method was called Netz (from Netzverfahren, [...] "net method"), or the Zygalski sheet method as it used <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets</b> that he devised, although at Bletchley Park Zygalskis name was not used for security reasons.

40|$|Summary. Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} on the turbulent boundary layer with uniform suction and with zero pressure gradient. The test surface consisted of a uniformly <b>perforated</b> <b>sheet</b> which replaced {{the floor of a}} wind tunnel, the tunnel boundary layer being removed through a slot a short distance ahead of the test section. For several different suction velocities, and for different entry conditions, boundary-layer measurements were made on the perforated surface and on a porous surface formed by covering the <b>perforated</b> <b>sheet</b> with calendered nylon fabric. For certain conditions it was found that both the thickness and the velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer remained constant over virtually the full length of the suction surface, thus establishing the existence of a turbulent asymptotic layer. At sufficiently high rates of suction it was found that an initially turbulent layer reverted to the laminar asymptotic form...|$|R
