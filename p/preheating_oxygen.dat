40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{studies on}} coal based power plants with CO 2 capture. As coal {{is the single}} largest fuel in use today to generate electricity, technologies to improve the efficiency and reduce emissions are critical in the future. The oxycombustion method {{is one of the}} three main routes to capture at least 90 % of the CO 2 generated by a fossil fuel based power plant. In addition to the standard power plant components such as the boiler and the steam cycle, systems to generate oxygen (ASU) and purify/compress the flue gas (CPU) are required. These additional systems cause an efficiency penalty of around 10 % points and also incur additional capital cost. The objective of this project is to investigate the efficiency improvement potential of the oxy-combustion coal based power plant. Process Integration methodologies such as Pinch and Exergy analyses were used to conduct the investigations. Process Integration methodologies are proven and can be applied to power plants with capture to bring down the efficiency penalty. Baseline simulations of the overall power plant with capture were established {{as a part of the}} study. Recycling the untreated hot flue gas for boiler temperature control provides the best performance. More heat can be recovered from the flue gas before being processed by the CPU by condensing the moisture present in it. The recovered heat can either be used for boiler feedwater preheating or oxygen <b>preheating.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> preheating proved to be a better choice from the efficiency standpoint. Heat can also be recovered from the CPU compressors for feedwater preheating. All the above mentioned heat integration options boost the system efficiency and reduce the efficiency penalty to less than 7 % points. Operating the boiler at a higher pressure enhances flue gas heat recovery. A boiler operating pressure of 16 bars was found to be near-optimal. Additionally, adiabatic compression of the oxygen stream eliminates the need for preheating while keeping the system simple. Finally, a combined pinch and exergy analysis helps modify the feedwater preheating system of the steam cycle. Pinch analysis helps target the energy (steam mass flows) requirements of the feedwater preheating system while exergy analysis guides the system design. The modified steam cycle has a better performance than the traditional steam cycle while maintaining reasonable network complexity. All the above mentioned process improvements help to attain a capture efficiency penalty of around 6 % points...|$|E
30|$|We {{report a}} {{low-cost}} and simple method for fabrication of nonspherical colloidal lithographic nanopatterns with a long-range order by <b>preheating</b> and <b>oxygen</b> {{reactive ion etching}} of monolayer and double-layer polystyrene spheres. This strategy allows excellent control of size and morphology of the colloidal particles and expands the applications of the colloidal patterns as templates for preparing ordered functional nanostructure arrays. For the first time, various unique nanostructures with long-range order, including network structures with tunable neck length and width, hexagonal-shaped, and rectangular-shaped arrays as well as size tunable nanohole arrays, were fabricated by this route. Promising potentials of such unique periodic nanostructures in various fields, such as photonic crystals, catalysts, templates for deposition, and masks for etching, are naturally expected.|$|R

30|$|In this work, we {{demonstrate}} {{a simple and}} inexpensive method to fabricate controllable nonclose-packed nonspherical PS particle arrays with long-range order. The method {{is based on a}} combination of colloidal self-assembly, <b>preheating,</b> and <b>oxygen</b> reactive ion etching techniques. The long-range ordered network pattern of PS particle arrays with tunable neck width and length were obtained. The hexagonal- and the rectangular-shaped PS particles were fabricated. Moreover, the round nanoholes were also achieved after oxygen RIE of double layer of PS spheres with preheating. These structures and patterns differ noticeably from the known elliptical-shaped PS particles and triangular nanoholes produced without preheating. Such unique colloidals and their ordered arrays resulted from the strategy demonstrated in this work may have important applications in fields of chemical sensors, photonic crystals, catalysts, biosensors, and can serve as good deposition or etching masks for growth of other 2 -dimensional nanostructures, which have shape- and size-dependent properties. The effect of preheating on the fabrication of long-range ordered nonclose-packed nonspherical colloidal nanopatterns was also discussed in this work.|$|R
30|$|In summary, we have {{fabricated}} controllable PS particle structures with {{a long-range}} order by combination of <b>preheating</b> and <b>oxygen</b> RIE techniques. The neck length and neck {{width of the}} network pattern fabricated by <b>oxygen</b> RIE of <b>preheated</b> monolayer of PS spheres can be easily tuned from about 30 to 80 nm and 150 to 80 nm, respectively, by increasing the oxygen RIE time. Moreover, the hexagonal-shaped and rectangular-shaped PS particles and round nanoholes were obtained after oxygen RIE of monolayer and double layer of PS spheres with preheating, which differs noticeably from the elliptical-shaped PS particles and triangular nanoholes produced without preheating. The network pattern with controllable neck width and length and the hexagonal-shaped as well as rectangular-shaped PS particle arrays obtained with preheating are new colloidal lithographic nanopatterns, which raised hopes for NSL. Preheating {{plays a crucial role}} in fabricating these new long-range ordered PS particle arrays. These new colloidal nanopatterns have important applications in fields of catalysts, biosensors, and biomedical devices, especially in next-generation integrated nanophotonic devices, bimolecular labeling and identification [23].|$|R
25|$|For cutting, {{the setup}} {{is a little}} different. A cutting torch has a 60- or 90-degree angled head with {{orifices}} placed around a central jet. The outer jets are for <b>preheat</b> flames of <b>oxygen</b> and acetylene. The central jet carries only oxygen for cutting. The use of several preheating flames rather than a single flame {{makes it possible to}} change the direction of the cut as desired without changing the position of the nozzle or the angle which the torch makes with the direction of the cut, as well as giving a better preheat balance. Manufacturers have developed custom tips for Mapp, propane, and polypropylene gases to optimize the flames from these alternate fuel gases.|$|R

Conceptual designs of plant componets and equipment with performance, operational characteristics, and costs are reported. Plant economics and overall performance including full and part load operation are reviewed. The projected performance and estimated cost of this early MHD plant are compared to conventional power plants, although it does not offer the same high efficiency and low costs as the mature MHD power plant.

The dependence of particle size, morphology and crystalline phase of titania on temperature schedules including the reactor temperature, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>preheated</b> temperature and the product cooling measure were explored. It is found {{that there are two}} opposite effects of temperature on particle size and crystalline phase content. The particle size distribution, SEM and TEM of resulting powders show that the grain size is controlled by the relative magnitudes of the nucleation rate and growth rate, both of them being subject to the temperature schedules. XRD indicates that particles crystalline phase is predominately anatase and the rutile content increment is not consistent with temperature increase. Anatase titania can be converted to rutile by addition of crystal modifier AlCl 3. The element analysis by EDS shows that Al enriches on the particle outer surface. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Volumetric {{combustion}} {{has been}} developed to realize a high substitution ratio of biomass in co-firing boilers, which features an intensive flue gas internal recirculation inside furnace. However, the characteristics of NOx and SOx emis-sions in large-scale boilers with volumetric combustion were not fully clear. In this paper, an Aspen Plus model of volumetric combustion system was built up based on a co-firing boiler. In order to characterize the reductions of NOx and SOx, three biomass substitution ratios were involved, namely, 100 % biomass, 45 % biomass with 55 % coal, and 100 % coal. The effects of flue gas recirculation ratio, air <b>preheating</b> temperature, <b>oxygen</b> concentration, and fuel types on pollutants emission in the volumetric combustion system were investigated. According to the results, it was con-cluded the higher substitution ratio of biomass in a co-firing boiler, the lower emissions of NOx and SOx. Moreover, flue gas internal recirculation is an effective pathway for NOx reduction and an increased recirculation ratio resulted in a significant decreasing of NOx emission; however, the SOx increased slightly. The influences of air preheating tem-perature and O 2 concentration on NOx emission were getting weak with increasing of recirculation ratio. When 10 % or even higher of flue gas was recycled, {{it was observed that}} almost no NOx formed thermodynamically under all studied conditions. Finally, to reach a low emission level of NOx, less energy would be consumed during biomass combustion than coal combustion process for internal recirculation of flue gas...|$|R
40|$|Central {{plasma sheet}} (CPS) ion conics are oxygen-dominated, with peak {{energies}} ranging from tens {{to hundreds of}} eV centered around pitch-angles between 115 and 130 degrees. Because {{of the lack of}} correlation between the CPS conics and the observed currents and/or electron beam-like structures, it is not likely that all of these conics are generated by interactions with electrostatic ion cyclotron waves or lower hybrid waves. Instead, it is suggested that the observed intense broad band electric field fluctuations in the frequency range between 0 and 100 Hz can be responsible for the transverse energization of the ions through cyclotron resonance heating with the left-hand polarized electromagnetic waves. This process is much more efficient for heating the oxygen ions than hydrogen ions, thus providing a plausible explanation of the oxygen dominance in CPS conics. Simple algebraic expressions are given from which estimates of conic energy and pitch angle can be easily calculated. This suggested mechanism can also provide some <b>preheating</b> of the <b>oxygen</b> ions in the boundary plasma sheet (BPS) where discrete aurorae form...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the improvement potential as well as heat integration opportunities of the oxy- pulverized coal power plant by means of the mapping exergy destruction sources on a conventional architecture as a first step towards an integrated, highly efficient system with optimized operating conditions and advanced architecture. On the basis of a first generation oxy-fired power plant, composed by conventional cryogenic ASU and CPU, a standard pulverized-coal boiler with supercritical steam cycle, the whole system is modeled at elementary equipment level. Operating conditions and current state-of-the-art design are considered in order to set a base-case for the identification of the exergy destruction. The exergy analysis reveals the location and the magnitude of the losses. Main losses occur in the boiler, steam generation, turbines, distillation unit, compression steps of the ASU and CPU, gas quality control system, and in the regenerative heater. According to this assessment, a novel architecture is investigated. Compression heat integration, bypass regenerative heater with improved heat exchange, <b>preheating</b> of the <b>oxygen</b> flow with the bypass flow surplus heat and reheat of the cold depolluted flue gas in a regenerative heater are implemented. Important reduction in exergy destruction is reported and the exergy efficiency of the integrated power plant increases from 36. 4 % to 39. 6 % (considering CO 2 as a product), which corresponds to an overall exergy destruction diminution of 16 %. The resulting net plant energy efficiency is 36. 1 %LHV, which is a 3. 5 %-pts increase compared to the base-case oxy-fired power plant, reducing the energy penalty down to 7. 9 %-pts when compared to the reference air-fired unit without CCS...|$|R
40|$|U. S. {{industry}} consumes approximately 40 {{percent of}} all fuel consumed by the nation. The majority of this fuel is used to generate heat for elevating temperatures of materials. The heat is generated by combustion of the major fuels such as natural gas, fuel oil and coal. The combustion process itself and the utilization of heat generated by combustion {{has been carried out}} rather inefficiently. In the past, combustion equipment, primarily burners, were designed and operated with very little attention to the amount of heat wasted during their operation. The burners were considered a necessity, but their full potential in improving thermal efficiency of the heating process was very rarely used. Most of the burners used a varying amount of excess air. The air-fuel ratio control was primarily left to the operator and the flame shape and momentum were rarely considered as a design factor for the heating equipment. In the last few years, heating equipment designers and suppliers have realized the importance of efficient burner operation. Midland-Ross and other burner manufacturers have, during this time, developed a large variety of special burners and associated equipment to allow the use of efficient combustion of fossil fuels. In addition to proper air-fuel ratio, the burners are capable of operating with <b>preheated</b> air or <b>oxygen</b> enriched air to recover and reduce the flue gas heat. Certain specially designed burners improve heat transfer to the work load by discharging high velocity gases into the furnace. This paper describes various types of burners, their applications, and field test results which illustrate that a properly designed and applied combustion system can reduce the energy consumption and improve the productivity by reducing the process heating time...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} on High Temperature Air Combustion (HiTAC) are reviewed. In HiTAC method, combined {{heat regeneration}} and low oxygen methods are utilized to enlarge {{and control the}} flame thermal behavior. The HiTAC technology emerged from the conception of Excess Enthalpy Combustion (EEC). This technology {{has the potential for}} very wide applications, including power and process industries and energy conversion. The technology has been shown to provide significant reduction in energy consumption (up to 60 %), downsizing of the equipment (about 30 %) and lower emissions (about 30 %) while maintaining high thermal performance of the system. Energy savings translate to reduction of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases to the environment. Qualitative and quantitative results are presented on several gaseous diffusion flames using high temperature combustion air. A specially designed regenerative combustion test furnace facility, built by Nippon Furnace Kogyo, Japan, was used to preheat the combustion air to high temperatures. The flames with highly preheated combustion air were much more stable and homogeneous (both temporally and spatially) as compared to the room-temperature combustion air. Information on global flame features, flame spectral emission characteristics, spatial distribution of OH, CH and C 2 species and emission of pollutants has been obtained. The global flame feature showed range of flame colors (yellow, blue, bluish-green, green and purple) over the range of conditions examined. In some cases hybrid color flame was also observed. Under certain conditions flameless or colorless oxidation of the fuel has also been observed. Low levels of NOx along with negligible amounts of CO and HC have been obtained under high-temperature air combustion conditions. The thermal and chemical behavior of high-temperature air combustion flames depends on fuel property, <b>preheat</b> temperature and <b>oxygen</b> concentration of air. Flames with high temperature air provide much higher heat flux than normal air. Challenges of this new technology are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ignition}} of {{electrically heated}} boron filaments in air and argon/oxygen mixtures has been studied. Boron filament resistance, temperature, and emissions from the BO and BO 2 bands were monitored. Preliminary experimental data {{have also been}} obtained to characterize the phases formed inside burning boron particles produced and ignited from the same filament material by feeding a vibrating boron filament into an oxygen–acetylene flame. The liquid boron particles so formed and ignited burned in room air where their combustion was recorded using a high-speed video system. Samples of both filaments and particles quenched at different times during their combustion were analyzed using electron microscopy to characterize their internal structures and compositions. The filaments “burned ” in two distinct stages. The onset of the first stage was characterized by a local minimum in the filament resistance, a sharp spike in boron oxide radiation emission, and a rapid rise in temperature. It occurred at a temperature of 1500 6 70 °C, independent of the <b>preheating</b> history and <b>oxygen</b> content (5 – 40 %) in the gas environment. These data {{and changes in the}} filament physical characteristics suggest that a phase transition occurs in the filaments at this temperature and triggers stage one combustion. A transition from a to b rhombohedral boron structures has been reported in this temperature range. The burning boron particles exhibited periodic brightness oscillations that arise from asymmetric particle combustion associated with internal phase changes. Electron microprobe analyses indicated significant amounts of oxygen contained within both quenched filaments and particles. Additionally, quenched filament samples collected during the second stage of combustion exhibited large spherical voids. The present observations indicate that in-depth heterogeneous processes play important roles in boron ignition and combustion and that their elucidation will result in a more complete description of ignition and combustion phenomena that previously have been only incompletely understood. © 1999 by The Combustion Institut...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, new {{advanced}} combustion systems that {{share the same}} basic concept of using a substantially diluted and high-temperature oxidizer in the reaction volume have gained {{a great deal of}} interest regarding their application in industrial and power systems. These novel combustion technologies have proved to offer significant benefits compared to traditional combustion techniques. These benefits include reductions in pollutant emissions and energy consumption, as well as a higher and more uniformly distributed heat flux. This entails the potential to, for example, reduce the size of equipment in industrial units or increase production rates while fuel consumption and the subsequent CO 2 emissions are decreased or maintained at the same level. Although the development of these new combustion technologies has occurred fairly recently, it has gained worldwide recognition. During the past few years the technique has been used commercially with several different types of burners. Despite its widespread use, the basic understanding of the chemical-physical phenomena involved is limited, and {{a better understanding of the}} combustion phenomena is required for more effective utilization of the technology. The objectives of this work have been to obtain fuel-jet characteristics in combustion under high-temperature, low-oxygen conditions and to develop some theoretical considerations of the phenomena. The effect of the preheat temperature of the combustion air, combustion stoichiometry and the fuel-jet calorific value on flame behavior was investigated. Temperature and heat-flux distribution were also studied using a semi-industrial test furnace to see if similar flame features would be found for the small- and large-scale experiments. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used for the first time to obtain information on the flow dynamics of a fuel jet injected into a crossflow of oxidizer at either a normal temperature or a very high temperature. Light emission spectroscopy was used to collect information on time-averaged radical distributions in the combustion jet. Jet turbulence, time-averaged velocity distribution, fuel-jet mixing, the distribution of radicals such as CH, OH and C 2, and flame photographs were investigated. The results showed delayed mixing and combustion under high-temperature low-oxygen-concentration conditions. The combustion air <b>preheat</b> temperature and <b>oxygen</b> concentration were found to have a significant effect on the burning fuel-jet behavior. The results of the semi-industrial-scale tests also showed the features of even flame temperature and heat flux. QC 2010061...|$|R
