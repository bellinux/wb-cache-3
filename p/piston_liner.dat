The wearing parts for mud pumps include pump casing, bearings, impeller, <b>piston,</b> <b>liner,</b> etc. Advanced antiwear measures should be adopted to increase the service life of the wearing parts, which can reduce the investment cost of the project, and improve production efficiency. At the same time, wearing parts and other mud pump parts should be repaired rather than replaced when possible.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the development of}} a model for the calculation of the temperature field and heat flow in the combustion chamber components of internal combustion piston engines, which occur both under steady and transient engine operating conditions. Two and three-dimensional finite-element analyses were implemented for the representation of the complex geometry metal components (<b>piston,</b> <b>liner</b> and cylinder head). The model is applied for the piston and liner of a medium speed diesel engine, for which relevant experimental data exist in the literature. Special care is given for accurately specifying the thermal boundary conditions (temperatures and heat transfer coefficients). Gas side boundary conditions are calculated using a thermodynamic cycle simulation code, including spatial variation of the gas side heat transfer coefficient. Coolant sides (water on the external liner surface and oil on the piston undercrown surface) boundary conditions are calculated using correlations pertaining to real engine conditions. Also an effort is made to model the piston-ring belt-liner complex thermal paths using equivalent thermal circuits. A satisfactory degree of agreement is found between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements, revealing that the finite-element methods presented are successful in formulating this kind of problem, giving accurate results with reasonable computational cost. The utilization of the model reveals very clearly the essential role of engine operating transients (sudden changes in speed and/or load) in the generation of sharp temperature excursions in the metal components until a new steady state is reached. The phenomenon should be taken into account for correct engine design and safe operation (i. e. the avoidance of high local stresses). © 1996 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne {{of the key}} {{technologies}} {{for the improvement of}} the diesel engine thermal efficiency is the reduction of the engine heat transfer through the thermal insulation of the combustion chamber. This paper presents a numerical investigation on the effects of the combustion chamber insulation on the heat transfer, thermal efficiency and exhaust temperatures of a 1. 6 l passenger car, turbo-charged diesel engine. First, the complete insulation of the engine components, like <b>pistons,</b> <b>liner,</b> firedeck and valves, has been simulated. This analysis has showed that the piston is the component with the greatest potential for the in-cylinder heat transfer reduction and for Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) reduction, followed by firedeck, liner and valves.

40|$|Given {{continuous}} environmental legislation, the lubrication {{industry has}} been striving to produce environmentally suitable lubrication alternatives for internal combustion engines. Addressing this challenge {{requires the use of}} lubricants that conform to environmental standards while maintaining excellent lubrication performance. This thesis investigates the tribological viability of bio-based base stock to which different nanoparticles were incorporated for engine <b>piston</b> ring–cylinder <b>liner</b> interaction. The specific base stock examined was trimethylolpropane (TMP) ester derived from palm oil, and the nanoparticles were used as additives to obtain tribologically enhanced bio-based lubricants. Nano sized additives included copper oxide, molybdenum disulfide and titanium silicate nanoparticles as lubricant additives. The effects of lubricating oil conditions (new and engine-aged) on the friction and wear of the materials used for piston rings and cylinder liners were experimentally determined. The research began with investigation of wear protection and friction reduction behavior of palm oil-derived TMP ester for <b>piston</b> ring–cylinder <b>liner</b> interaction. It was followed by the investigation of lubrication behavior of variety of nanoparticles as additives to palm TMP ester. The friction and wear characteristics of the lubricant samples were examined in contact conditions that were simulated using a high-stroke reciprocating tribometer. Four-ball tribo-testing was conducted to evaluate the extreme pressure characteristics of the samples. Suitable nanoparticle types and concentrations were then evaluated to enhance wear protection and reduce friction. Finally, surface analyses were carried out to ascertain potential lubrication mechanisms contributed by nanolubricants. In the next stage of the research, bio-based nanolubricant degradation under actual engine conditions and its tribological effect on the <b>piston</b> ring–cylinder <b>liner</b> combination was examined. Long duration engine testing was carried out using a single-cylinder compression ignition engine. To control lubricant acidity, a chemically active filter technology was used during engine bio-based lubrication. Engine sump oil samples were collected and analyzed for their physicochemical and tribological properties in comparison to a conventional diesel engine lubricant. The results have shown that friction reduction and antiwear behavior of palm TMP ester can be improved by addition of suitable concentrations of considered nanoparticles. The most significant improvement in the lubrication performance of palm TMP ester has been shown by 0. 75 wt% of titanium silicate nanoparticles. A reduction of 68 % in average friction coefficient was observed while wear volume was reduced to half for piston ring and cylinder liner specimen. The surface analysis results showed that the nanoparticles improved the lubrication performance by surface enhancement of interacting surfaces in terms of tribofilm formation, polishing and mending effects. Bio-based nanolubricant showed high degradation during long hours’ engine tests resulting in 17 % lower viscosity, 30 % high acidity and 16. 8 % higher oxidation than that of conventional engine oil. However, the friction and wear behavior of corresponding engine-aged samples were comparable to that of engine-aged conventional engine lubricant samples. The overall analysis of results demonstrated the potential of nanoparticles to improve the tribological behavior of bio-based base stock for <b>piston</b> ring–cylinder <b>liner</b> interaction...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{influence of}} the crankshaft offset of spark ignition engine regarding the engine friction, torque and power. It is known from the literature that crankshaft offset has a potential to reduce normal piston force during the expansion stroke at lower engine speeds. The results of lower normal force are reduced mechanical losses due to friction between the <b>piston</b> and <b>liner</b> of the cylinder. The crankshaft offset can significantly change the piston kinematics because the piston moves slower around TDC and BDC. If spark timing is referenced to the piston position from the TDC, the crankshaft offset increase in-cylinder pressure during the combustion {{as a result of}} lower change of the cylinder volume close to the TDC and engine performances can be improved. Two operating points of spark ignition engine were analyzed and optimization of crankshaft offset was performed by the NSGA-II genetic algorithm. In order to calculate the active piston force during the combustion process Vibe function were applied. The minimization of friction losses that occur between <b>piston</b> and cylinder <b>liner</b> as well as minimization of difference between peak values of resultant force of the piston in the normal direction were the main objectives of the optimization. The optimization results show that crankshaft offset has potential to improve engine performances at lower engine speeds...|$|R

The results have revealed two regimes of lubrication, an elasto-hydrodynamic one under low loads and one with low, velocity-independent specific friction, under high loads.

40|$|To {{shed light}} on the {{mechanisms}} with which surface texture improves the tribological performance of piston–liner contacts, we have measured the transient friction response as individual pockets pass through a reciprocating sliding contact. Tests were performed at different sliding speeds and results compared to those from a non-textured, reference specimen under different lubrication regimes. At low speed when the contact is in the boundary regime, friction force falls abruptly as each pocket leaves the contact zone, before gradually returning to an approximately steady-state value. This suggests that each pocket acts to temporarily increase the film thickness, which then decays to its non-textured value as oil is squeezed out. At higher speeds, friction is seen to reduce in a stepwise fashion, since the period between pockets being entrained is less than the time taken for the film to decay. In addition, friction results obtained when the contact is operating {{in the middle of the}} mixed regime point to a temporary film thickness collapse as the pocket enters the contact, and this agrees with recent modelling predictions. At higher speeds, the compound effect of successive pockets is to shift the contact to the right on Stribeck curve. These results imply that each pocket gives rise to an increase in film thickness that is both short-lived and small in magnitude (we estimate a few tens of nm). However, the resulting effect on friction can be significant (up to 82 % in this study) for two reasons: (1) provided the pocket frequency is sufficiently high, each successive pocket entrainment builds the film up without there being time for it to reduce back to its steady-state value; (2) when the contact is in the mixed regime, the Stribeck curve is at its steepest and friction is therefore most sensitive to film thickness changes. This has important practical implications in that pocket spacing on <b>piston</b> <b>liners</b> should be varied as a function of reciprocating sliding speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research presented in this thesis was to investigate and quantify the impact of biofuel ethanol and the associated water contamination into a commercially available automotive gasoline engine lubricant on the frictional response of <b>piston</b> ring/cylinder <b>liner</b> contacts and the resulting implications for fuel economy under problematic cold-start/warm-up/short-journey driving conditions. Whilst road transport is a major driver of global economic growth, {{it is also a}} primary user of fossil fuel based energy and a major emitter of Carbon Dioxide (C 02). Therefore, increasingly stringent legislation demanding the use of biofuels in conjunction with conventional fossil fuels has been put in place. Even though biofuels are being blended into conventional gasoline and diesel at varying concentrations, information relating to the impact of these fuels on automotive engine lubrication, friction and fuel economy is scarce. A comprehensive and rigorous laboratory bench-top screening test programme using a reciprocating tribometer and Statistical Experimental Design was developed for the first stage of this investigation. Bespoke engine test programmes were also conducted to identify areas susceptible to ethanol and water dilution on the piston assembly and cylinder liner and to quantify fuel and water dilution into the lubricant present along the cylinder liner wall and in the sump. Tribometer investigations showed that significant reductions m friction resulted when the <b>piston</b> ring/cylinder <b>liner</b> contacts were lubricated with the lubricant-ethanolwater mixtures and the separated phases of these mixtures compared to the formulated lubricant. Temperature measurements on a single cylinder gasoline engine highlighted that lubricant present on the piston skirt, the connecting rod and on the intake side of the cylinder liner was highly susceptible to ethanol and water contamination under cold-start/warm-up conditions. Fuel dilution measurements on the same engine revealed that lubricant present on the upper cylinder liner, at top dead centre, was highly contaminated with ethanol, gasoline and water compared to that present lower down the cylinder, mid-stroke and bottom dead centre, and in the sump. again under cold-start/warm-up conditions.
