5|$|In 1992, Brown was a {{delegate}} to the 1992 Democratic National Convention from the New York's 33rd congressional district. He was originally pledged to Bob Kerrey, but switched to Bill Clinton after Kerrey bowed out of the 1992 Democratic <b>Primary</b> <b>campaign</b> on March 5, 1992. In 1993, Brown was invited to attend Bill Clinton's Inauguration.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>primary</b> <b>campaign,</b> {{two major}} issues surfaced. First, Waterfield favored {{a tax on}} parimutuel betting, while Clements opposed it. Second, Waterfield {{supported}} the development of electric power generation through public utilities, while Clements favored private development (which won him {{the support of the}} Kentucky Utilities company). The Clements campaign also attacked Waterfield for being deemed physically unfit for military service. Clements received a late boost when he gained the endorsement of John Y. Brown, Sr., garnering added support from organized labor. Ultimately, Clements defeated Waterfield by over 30,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{announced}} his candidacy {{in a radio}} broadcast on November 3, painting the race as a choice between a free society and state socialism. Chotiner's philosophy for the <b>primary</b> <b>campaign</b> was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition. Nixon did not indulge in negative campaigning in the primaries; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, the internecine warfare in the Democratic Party made it unnecessary. The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building a statewide organization, and on intensive fundraising, which proved successful.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{candidates}} declared their {{candidacy for}} the Democratic nomination, including Rhea and Lieutenant Governor Chandler. Former governor Beckham {{was not a}} candidate; his only son had died in late 1934, devastating his family and leaving his wife strongly opposed to another political campaign. Near {{the end of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>campaign,</b> Laffoon suffered an attack of appendicitis and required an appendectomy, leaving him unable to campaign for Rhea. Two candidates dropped out of the race prior to the election.|$|E
5|$|Beshear {{did little}} in the {{political}} arena for almost a decade after his 1987 primary defeat, but in late 1995, he was encouraged by Democratic leaders – including former governor Ned Breathitt, Senator Wendell H. Ford, and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair Bob Kerrey – to challenge incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell. Beshear entered the primary as a heavy favorite against Tom Barlow, a former one-term Congressman from Kentucky's First District, and Shelby Lanier, a retired Louisville police officer. During the <b>primary</b> <b>campaign,</b> Beshear virtually ignored Barlow and Lanier and focused his rhetoric on McConnell. Despite Barlow's tour of all 120 Kentucky counties, Beshear cruised to victory in the primary, garnering 177,859 votes (66.38%) to Barlow's 64,235 (23.97%) and Lanier's 25,856 (9.65%).|$|E
50|$|The Graduated Random Presidential Primary System, {{also known}} as the California Plan or the American Plan, is a {{proposed}} system to reform the conduct of United States Presidential <b>primary</b> <b>campaigns.</b> Under this system the campaign period would be broken into ten two-week periods in which an escalating number of electoral votes would be contested. It was developed by aerospace engineer and political scientist Thomas Gangale in 2003 in response to the trend toward front-loading in recent <b>primary</b> <b>campaigns</b> and the influence wielded by Iowa and New Hampshire, which traditionally hold their nominating events before any other state.|$|R

5|$|Brian Tierney is {{the fourth}} of five sons of James and Claire Tierney. Growing up in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, he {{attended}} Waldron Mercy Academy and later The Episcopal Academy. When he was seven, {{his family moved to}} Springfield Township, Pennsylvania. In 1975, at the age of eighteen, Tierney unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for township commissioner of Springfield. During the campaign supporters of his opponent in the Democratic primary had torn down his campaign posters and stole other campaign items. Tierney became a Republican after the primary when a few Republicans who said they would look out for his stuff during his <b>primary</b> <b>campaign,</b> invited him to a party meeting.|$|E
5|$|Carroll had {{considered}} {{running for the}} U.S. Senate in 1968, but {{dropped out of the}} race after just two weeks when he discovered that it would take well over $100,000 to run a competitive <b>primary</b> <b>campaign.</b> In 1971, former governor Bert T. Combs sought a second term as governor and chose Carroll as his informal running mate. (The governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately at the time.) Combs, an Eastern Kentucky native, sought geographic balance for the ticket by selecting Carroll, from the far-west Jackson Purchase. Combs said he would provide the needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.|$|E
5|$|In late April, Brown {{still held}} a 20 {{percentage}} point lead {{in public opinion}} polling. However, as Beshear began to slip in the polls, Wilkinson moved up. By Memorial Day weekend, he was polling second among the candidates. Brown largely ignored Wilkinson until {{a week before the}} election, when he began running ads questioning the amount of money Wilkinson claimed would be generated by a state lottery. Wilkinson won the primary, garnering 36 percent of the vote to 26 percent for Brown, 18 percent for Beshear, 12 percent for Stumbo, and 6 percent for Carroll. In total, Wilkinson spent a record $4 million during the <b>primary</b> <b>campaign.</b> Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark opined that Wilkinson's lavish spending during the campaign prompted the legislature to adopt campaign finance reform measures.|$|E

For example, the <b>primary</b> presidential <b>campaign</b> has become longer and increasingly use more media to target audiences. As such, <b>primary</b> <b>campaigns</b> might elicit negative attitudes toward the electoral process and negative affective states such as boredom or disgust that in turn might make a person not turn out to vote.|$|R

5|$|In the 1968 Democratic <b>primary</b> <b>campaign,</b> McCarthy {{staged a}} strong showing. Robert Kennedy entered the race, President Johnson withdrew and Vice President Hubert Humphrey ran instead. While McGovern privately favored Kennedy, McCarthy and Humphrey were {{both from the}} {{neighboring}} state of Minnesota and publicly McGovern remained neutral. McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 4 South Dakota Democratic primary, {{which resulted in a}} strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night. McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles. The death of Bobby Kennedy left McGovern the most emotionally distraught he had ever been to that point in his life.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy was {{admitted}} to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959. In 1960, his brother John ran for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states. Ted learned to fly and during the Democratic <b>primary</b> <b>campaign</b> he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and bonding with them by trying his hand at ski jumping and bronc riding. The seven weeks he spent in Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

5|$|Ted Kennedy was 30 {{years old}} when he first entered the Senate {{following}} a November 1962 special election to fill the vacant seat previously held by his brother, John, who was now the President. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was later re-elected seven more times. The Chappaquiddick incident in 1969 resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and later received a two-month suspended sentence. The incident and its aftermath hindered his chances of ever becoming President. His only attempt, in the 1980 election, resulted in a Democratic <b>primary</b> <b>campaign</b> loss to incumbent President Jimmy Carter, who later lost the general election to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic primary for the 2010 United States Senate {{election}} in Pennsylvania {{took place on}} May 18, 2010, when Congressman Joe Sestak defeated incumbent Arlen Specter, {{which led to the}} end of Specter's five-term Senatorial career. Just {{prior to the start of}} the <b>primary</b> <b>campaign,</b> after serving in the Senate as a Republican for 29 years, Specter had switched to the Democratic Party in anticipation of a difficult primary challenge by Pat Toomey; Sestak was ultimately defeated by Toomey in the general election. Political observers and journalists described the race between Specter and Sestak as one of the bitterest and most watched of all the 2010 primary elections.|$|E
5|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>campaign</b> {{issue was}} the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the {{hand-picked}} candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant siding with the tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>primary</b> <b>campaign,</b> Chandler {{focused his}} {{attacks on the}} Combs {{administration}} rather than the inexperienced Breathitt. A seasoned campaigner, he bitterly attacked the three percent sales tax enacted during the Combs administration. Breathitt struck back with accusations that, as a senator, Chandler had {{voted in favor of}} declaring war on Japan during World War II, but resigned his army commission shortly thereafter. He further charged that Chandler's son-in-law was collecting campaign donations from individuals who desired favors from state government. The younger Breathitt, thirty-eight years old when the campaign began, adapted well to the relatively new medium of television, while the aging Chandler did not. Breathitt won the primary by more than 60,000 votes and carried {{all but one of the}} state's congressional districts. Chandler's running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, easily won the nomination for lieutenant governor over Breathitt's running mate, John B. Breckinridge, showing that the defeat was not so much a result of factionalism as a personal rebuff of Chandler. This campaign ended Chandler's political career.|$|E
5|$|By October 1991, Ferraro {{was ready}} to enter {{elective}} politics again, {{and ran for the}} Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the <b>primary</b> <b>campaign</b> from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the <b>primary</b> <b>campaign,</b> the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E
