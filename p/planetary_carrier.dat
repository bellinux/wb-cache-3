50|$|The {{hydraulic}} control system consists of a valve arrangement and an engine driven pump. The automatic transmission contains a planetary gear set consisting of two sun gears, two sets of three planet pinions contained within a <b>planetary</b> <b>carrier</b> and ring gear. Various speed ratios are obtained by holding or clutching various combinations of elements of the planetary train. This is performed by two bands, two multi-disc clutches and a one-way clutch.|$|E
50|$|In bicycle hub gears, the sun {{is usually}} stationary, being keyed to the axle or even {{machined}} directly onto it. The <b>planetary</b> gear <b>carrier</b> is used as input. In this case the gear ratio is simply given by (N+N)/N. The number of teeth in the planet gear is irrelevant.|$|R

It was used in trucks and vans starting in the mid-1990s. While currently used with some internal changes such as the move from aluminum to steel <b>planetary</b> <b>carriers</b> and {{an increase in the number}} of clutch plates when coupled to the 5.9 L Cummins Turbo-Diesel and the 8.0 L V-10 applications, it's still a 727 with overdrive and stronger internal parts. It has an input torque rating of 450 lbft Nm. The 48RE is an electronically governed, ECU controlled, four-speed heavy-duty overdrive automatic transmission, that is stronger than its predecessor, the 47-series.|$|R
5000|$|The {{schematic}} diagrams {{illustrate the}} paths of power flow between the two electric motor-generators MG1 & MG2, the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), and the front wheels via the planetary [...] "Power Split Device" [...] elements. The Internal Combustion Engine {{is connected to the}} <b>planetary</b> gear <b>carrier</b> and not to any individual gear. The wheels are connected to the ring gear.|$|R
50|$|During Starting, the proven DIWA {{power split}} {{principle}} comes into action. As {{soon as the}} vehicle begins to move, power is divided steplessly between the hydrodynamic and the mechanical transmission of torque. In 1st gear, the DIWA range, input clutch and turbine brake are closed. The engine torque is directly transmitted to the outer rim of the differential. The impeller and the pump shaft is driven in opposite rotary directions via the planetary gears of the differential. During this process, the output and hence the <b>planetary</b> <b>carrier</b> remain stationary.In the converter, oil delivered by the impeller flows through the guide wheel to the turbine wheel in a closed circuit. The torque that is delivered and converted, that is increased, is transmitted to the <b>planetary</b> <b>carrier</b> via the sun gear of the turbine gear. The planetary gear shaft transmits both the torque of the input differential, that is the purely mechanical share, and the torque of the turbine gear, that is the hydrodynamic share, directly to the transmission output.|$|E
50|$|The {{planetary}} gear driving power through direct connection or link initiates the sun gear. The sun gear then drives the {{planetary gear}}s assembled with the external gear ring to operate. The {{whole set of}} planetary gear system revolves on its own axis and along the external gear ring where the output shaft connected to the <b>planetary</b> <b>carrier</b> achieves the goal of speed reduction. A higher reduction ratio {{can be achieved by}} doubling the multiple staged gears and planetary gears.|$|E
50|$|In one arrangement, the <b>{{planetary}}</b> <b>carrier</b> (green) is held stationary, and the {{sun gear}} (yellow) is used as input. In this case, the planetary gears simply rotate about their own axes (i.e., spin) at a rate determined {{by the number of}} teeth in each gear. If the sun gear has Ns teeth, and each planet gear has Np teeth, then the ratio is equal to −N/N. For instance, if the sun gear has 24 teeth, and each planet has 16 teeth, then the ratio is −24/16, or −3/2; this means that one clockwise turn of the sun gear produces 1.5 counterclockwise turns of each of the planet gear(s) about its axis.|$|E

It's the boundary between both continuously variable ranges. The two-modes switching occurs at this point, when the third {{planetary gearset}} ring gear reach zero rotational speed, and all the <b>planetary</b> gearset <b>carriers</b> gears reach the same rotational speed together.|$|R

These cracks originated at the blend between the gear post and the plate and later diagnosed as low cycle fatigue. Cracks on the planet carrier plate are a very serious but rare type of fault that may require the redesign of this critical part. In this paper {{an investigation of the}} problem is attempted using experimental data from ground and aircraft tests. Two features based on the signal energy are used to distinguish the faulty from the healthy plate using the signals from four one-dimensional accelerometers. A data analysis based on the Time Synchronous Averaging signal transformation tends to indicate that the apart from any machining error or material fault that may have initiated the crack; there is evidence of a non-rotating fault, possibly on the ring gear, as well as a considerable non-uniform distribution of forces among the planet gears that may have been generated by the presence of the crack and or may have promoted its rapid development...|$|R

The state pdf estimate is then used to predict the evolution in time of the fault indicator, obtaining as a result the pdf of the remaining useful life (RUL) for the faulty subsystem.

40|$|Introduction: The {{nature of}} the <b>planetary</b> noble gas <b>carrier</b> (Q) in meteorites remains uncertain. It is known that {{it is likely to}} be carbonaceous, but {{represents}} only a small fraction of the total macromolecular material. Q is oxidisible with nitric and other oxidizing acids. It seems to be partly destroyed with pyridine and may have an organic structure. Previously, we have shown that during parent body thermal metamorphism Q is less affected than the majority of other carbonaceous materials. If organic matter is graphitized, as has happened in the enstatite chondrite parent bodies, Q remains unaffected. In the present study we have found that Q is also separable from the majority of carbon in type 2 and 3 CR chondrites during stepped combustion. It is possible that this is because Q has become encased within the matrix, in contrast to other carbon phases, during parent body metamorphism...|$|R
40|$|In {{several studies}} and {{on-going}} developments for advanced rotorcraft, {{the need for}} variable multi-speed capable rotors has been raised. Speed changes of up to 50 have been proposed for future rotorcraft to improve vehicle performance. A rotor speed change during operation not only requires a rotor that can perform effectively over the operating speedload range, but also requires a propulsion system possessing these same capabilities. A study was completed investigating possible drive system arrangements that can accommodate up to a 50 speed change. Key drivers were identified from which simplicity and weight were judged as central. This paper presents {{the current status of}} two gear train concepts coupled with the first of two clutch types developed and tested thus far with focus on design lessons learned and areas requiring development.

Final version published by Inderscience Publishers, and available at: [URL] and electric powertrain components can be connected in numerous configurations to create hybrid powertrains. Owing to the exponential increase of permutations {{as the number of}} components increases, a framework to determine the best possible powertrain configuration that minimises fuel consumption was developed. This framework uses enumeration to discover all powertrains, the Graph-Theoretic Method to generate system equations, dynamic programming to evaluate fuel consumption and generate an objective score, and Pattern Search to optimise the sizing of each component. A multi-stage screening process was used to reduce computation time. Parallel and powersplit-like topologies with additional discrete gearboxes were found to be the most efficient.

40|$|This {{computational}} work investigates {{planetary gear}} load sharing of three-mount suspension wind turbine gearboxes. A three dimensional multibody dynamic model is established, including gravity, bending moments, fluctuating mesh stiffness, nonlinear tooth contact, and bearing clearance. A flexible main shaft, <b>planetary</b> <b>carrier,</b> housing, and gear shafts are modeled using reduced degrees-of-freedom through modal compensation. This drivetrain model is validated against the experimental data of Gearbox Reliability Collaborative for gearbox internal loads. Planet load sharing is a combined effect of gravity, bending moment, bearing clearance, and input torque. Influences {{of each of}} these parameters and their combined effects on the resulting planet load sharing are investigated. Bending moments and gravity induce fundamental excitations in the rotating carrier frame, which can increase gearbox internal loads and disturb load sharing. Clearance in carrier bearings reduces the bearing load carrying capacity and thus the bending moment from the rotor can be transmitted into gear meshes. With bearing clearance, the bending moment can cause tooth micropitting and can induce planet bearing fatigue, leading to reduced gearbox life. Planet bearings are susceptible to skidding at low input torque...|$|E
40|$|The known {{attempts}} {{to create a}} continuously-adjustable gear train with solid gears have led to development of some so-called adaptive gears. The most structurally simple version of continuously- adjustable gear train is a two-wheel planetary gear. It is an obvious fact that an active regulation of gear ratio for the gear {{should be based on}} the presence of con- trolled elements (parameters) and a mechanism for their control. In respect of the mentioned gear one of the controlled elements that is a compound central toothed gear has such controlled parameter as a nominal pitch diameter. In this case it can rotate or remain motionless. Other controlled element which is a <b>planetary</b> <b>carrier</b> has its own radius as a controlled parameter and makes a rotary motion with a great speed of a leading element. The purpose of the control mechanism is to ensure radial displacement of central toothed gear and planet gear sectors in the working gear.

The transfer is ensured by mechanical gears (two variants) and hydraulics. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a framework to automate {{the process of}} designing Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powertrain architectures. An algorithm was developed to assemble and compare all possible configurations of powertrain components. Combinatorics was used to discover all possible combinations of: an internal combustion engine, high-torque low-speed electric motor, low-torque high-speed electric motor, planetary gearset, and five-speed discrete gearbox. The Graph Theoretic Method was used to generate the powertrain models. The powertrain models were comprised of steady-state equations in symbolic form. An optimal control strategy is required to fairly compare the different topologies because a powertrain control strategy is dependant on the configuration. Dynamic Programming {{was used to determine}} the control law that minimizes the energy consumption for a given drivecycle. Evaluating every possible topology would take an extremely long time, so topologies were evaluated using a multi-stage screening process. The first stage examined the structure of the powertrain and used heuristics to eliminate infeasible topologies; 512 topologies were feasible. The second stage eliminated topologies that could not meet basic driving performance; 193 topologies were feasible. Basic driving performance was tested using a section of the US 06 drivecycle. The sizes of three components were optimized to ensure the topology is feasible independent {{of the size of the}} components. The third stage eliminated topologies which could not achieve driving performance design goals; 159 could achieve the performance requirements, but only 119 were reasonably fuel efficient. The driving performance goals were implemented with a drivecycle based on the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) goals. The sizes for five components were optimized at this stage. The 20 most fuel efficient powertrains were selected for further evaluation. Additionally, 4 common powertrains were evaluated for reference. The size of the components were optimized for a combination of the PNGV drivecycle and the HWFET drivecycle. The most fuel efficient topology was found to be a Powersplit hybrid which has a discrete gearbox between the final drive and the powersplit device. The electric motor, <b>planetary</b> <b>carrier</b> gear, and gearbox were connected in parallel. It was found that Parallel-like, Powersplit-like, and Complex-like topologies were were the most efficient powertrain configurations. Powertrains containing two gearboxes were more efficient because the geartrain models ignored mechanical inefficiencies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an on-line particle-filtering-based framework for fault diagnosis and failure prognosis in nonlinear, non-Gaussian systems. The methodology assumes {{the definition of}} a set of fault indicators, which are appropriate for monitoring purposes, the availability of real-time process measurements, and the existence of empirical knowledge (or historical data) to characterize both nominal and abnormal operating conditions. The incorporation of particle-filtering (PF) techniques in the proposed scheme not only allows for the implementation of real time algorithms, but also provides a solid theoretical framework to handle the problem of fault detection and isolation (FDI), fault identification, and failure prognosis. Founded on the concept of sequential importance sampling (SIS) and Bayesian theory, PF approximates the conditional state probability distribution by a swarm of points called particles and a set of weights representing discrete probability masses. Particles can be easily generated and recursively updated in real time, given a nonlinear process dynamic model and a measurement model that relates the states of the system with the observed fault indicators. Two autonomous modules have been considered in this research. On one hand, the fault diagnosis module uses a hybrid state-space model of the plant and a particle-filtering algorithm to (1) calculate the probability of any given fault condition in real time, (2) estimate the probability density function (pdf) of the continuous-valued states in the monitored system, and (3) provide information about type I and type II detection errors, as well as other critical statistics. Among the advantages offered by this diagnosis approach {{is the fact that the}} pdf state estimate may be used as the initial condition in prognostic modules after a particular fault mode is isolated, hence allowing swift transitions between FDI and prognostic routines. The failure prognosis module, on the other hand, computes (in real time) the pdf of the remaining useful life (RUL) of the faulty subsystem using a particle-filtering-based algorithm. This algorithm consecutively updates the current state estimate for a nonlinear state-space model (with unknown time-varying parameters) and predicts the evolution in time of the fault indicator pdf. The outcome of the prognosis module provides information about the precision and accuracy of long-term predictions, RUL expectations, 95 % confidence intervals, and other hypothesis tests for the failure condition under study. Finally, inner and outer correction loops (learning schemes) are used to periodically improve the parameters that characterize the performance of FDI and/or prognosis algorithms. Illustrative theoretical examples and data from a seeded fault test for a UH- 60 <b>planetary</b> <b>carrier</b> plate are used to validate all proposed approaches. Contributions of this research include: (1) the establishment of a general methodology for real time FDI and failure prognosis in nonlinear processes with unknown model parameters, (2) {{the definition of a}}ppropriate procedures to generate dependable statistics about fault conditions, and (3) a description of specific ways to utilize information from real time measurements to improve the precision and accuracy of the predictions for the state probability density function (pdf).

40|$|The article {{subject is}} a {{thin-film}} coating process using ion-plasma sputter deposition systems with magnetron sputtering targets. To improve coating thickness evenness of parts various manufacturers equip their systems with mechanisms for moving the coating parts, {{and sometimes the}} magnetrons. More specifically, the article concerns the ion-plasma sputtering process using a system equipped with a mechanism for providing a planetary movement of the coating parts in the plane perpendicular to the planes of two sputtering targets. The purpose of this work was to improve a distribution of the coating thickness evenness on the sputtering surface of the part. It is achieved through selection of the best combinations of kinematic and geometric factors that characterize a particular sputtering operation, {{depending on the size}} and position of the surface to be coated. These factors include a ratio between directions and frequencies of the self-rotation of satellite planetary gear, which holds a work piecesubstrate, and the translational motion i. e. <b>planetary</b> <b>carrier</b> rotation to carry the satellite; the angles of planes of the right and left magnetrons with respect to the system frontal plane. Since there is, essentially, a lack of mathematical models to perform the appropriate calculations for the considered type of system designs, a more specific aim of the article is to develop a technique to evaluate the uneven thickness of coatings provided by the systems of this type. To achieve this more specific purpose the analytical technique had been used, applying the postulates of analytical geometry and theoretical mechanics. The main results of the research described in the article are as follows: - mathematical models of dependencies of geometric and kinematic parameters, changing during the sputtering process and characterizing each considered point {{on the surface of the}} work piece, on the current position of the work piece in the structure of the planetary gear; - technique and algorithm for computing the thickness distribution of thin film coating on the substrate surface. The technique is based on the proposed model of the dependence of the coating thickness growth rate in each considered point on sputtered surface on the geometric and kinematic parameters, which characterize this point and are changed during the deposition. As geometric and kinematic parameters characterizing each considered point on the work piece surface, the article considers parameters to be changed during the deposition process. These are: distances from the considered point to the point sources of sputtered material i. e. erosion zones on the magnetron targets; the angles of orientation from the point sources of sputtered material on a considered point on the surface of the work piece; the angles of incidence in the considered point on the work piece surface of sputtered material emitted from these point sources. The proposed technique and algorithm of calculation of the coating thickness allow us to take into consideration only those sources for which the angle of incidence of sputtered material onto the covering surface in modulus is not more than 90 °. Compared with the other similar publications in the field concerned, the presented article offers a possibility to calculate the unevenness of thin-film coating for a new previously nonconsidered class of gadgetry mechanisms applied in magnetron sputtering systems. Obtained results can find applications in microelectronics and precision instrument manufacturing to ensure functional coatings of equal thickness, as well as in optical coating technology. One more application should be noted i. e. the obtained results may be used in twocomponent coatings. The suggested technique for calculating the thickness distribution of thin-film coatings allows us to extend the boundaries of technological capabilities of magnetron sputtering systems with a planetary gear for moving the substrate. The article can be recommended for engineerstechnologists of instrumentation engineering enterprises using the sputtering installations. Future developments should be focused on experimental updating the numerical values of the technological coefficients used in the calculations of the coating thickness growth rate. </p...|$|E
