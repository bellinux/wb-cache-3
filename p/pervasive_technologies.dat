In 1974, IBM {{announced}} Systems Network Architecture (SNA), a networking protocol for computing systems.

In 1975, IBM researcher Benoit Mandelbrot conceived fractal geometry—a new geometrical concept that made it possible to describe mathematically the kinds of irregularities existing in nature. Fractals had a great impact on engineering, economics, metallurgy, art and health sciences, and are integral to the field of computer graphics and animation.|$|E

The home {{environment}} offers a promising venue for deployment of <b>pervasive</b> <b>technologies.</b> To date, most research efforts in this domain {{have focused on}} improving the life experience of family members. However, nowadays {{many people who are}} unrelated to each other share accommodation, giving rise to the phenomenon of “cohabitation of convenience”. Examples include elder care facilities, hostels, shared houses and dorm rooms.

We further plan to develop and evaluate systems that accomplish the proposed scenarios...|$|E

In the last decade we have seen the emergence of a multitude of closely-related <b>pervasive</b> <b>technologies</b> that have only recently started to materialize on a grand scale, such as wireless sensor networks, RFID and NFC. We discuss the arising research challenges associated with such converging fields and we also provide a survey of the state-of-the-art related application scenaria, which we believe set their near-future applied context. Finally, we provide a more analytic discussion on three discrete systems that belong to this category of applications and give insight to the current state-of-the-art work in this field. © 2011...|$|E
40|$|Lessons {{learned from}} {{deploying}} a hospital scheduling and awareness system can help other researchers prepare pervasive {{systems for the}} real world.

However, there are few examples of real-world researchbased deployments of <b>pervasive</b> <b>technologies</b> and only a sparse amount of literature about how ubicomp concepts and technologies play out on a large scale. 1, 2 This is likely because <b>pervasive</b> <b>technologies</b> are, to a large degree, still premature, and examples of such systems are mostly in controlled lab environments. Another reason is that it’s problematic to defi ne a real pervasive computing application or system. Must it include sensors? Should it be context...|$|E

40|$|In an {{environment}} of escalating healthcare costs, chronic disease management is particularly challenging, since, by definition such diseases have no foreseeable cure and if poorly managed typically lead to further, complicated secondary health issues, which ultimately only serve to exacerbate cost. Diabetes {{is one of the}} leading chronic diseases and its prevalence continues to rise exponentially. Thus it behooves all to focus on solutions that can result in superior management of this disease. Hence, the following presents findings from a longitudinal exploratory case study that examined the application of a <b>pervasive</b> <b>technology</b> solution; a mobile phone, to provide superior diabetes self-care. The conclusions highlight the benefits of a <b>pervasive</b> <b>technology</b> solution for supporting superior self-care in the context of chronic disease.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} some possible broad changes that may impact {{society as a}} whole as a result of widespread integration of full-spectrum deployed pervasive computing technologies. Our approach considers design challenges for successfully developing and integrating <b>pervasive</b> <b>technologies</b> into culture and society. This is particularly challenging, since <b>pervasive</b> <b>technologies</b> as services are most successful when transparent, invisible, over-looked, unacknowledged and seemingly forgotten by the very groups that embrace their usage and development. We suggest a heuristic for understanding pervasive technology from an anthropological/social perspective, along with a reminder that humans create, shape and use the technologies that affect them. In particular, we look at the impact on social relations in a poly-social world where people must develop means to blend their own realities with those of of others. In conclusion, we remind those developing these technologies, that although we will eventually become wedded and intertwined as cyborgs within this new envi-ronment, it may have a positive outcome, creating new social group models for human interaction.

40|$|The {{experience}} {{of living and}} interacting with new <b>pervasive</b> <b>technologies</b> is often {{described in terms of}} subjective accounts and frequently recalls ideas and myths that are attached to a specific domain of knowledge. It is therefore of interest for a sociologist to investigate the accounts that frame the interpretations of the scientists and technologists. The reactions of the scientific community to the increase of daily technology, in particular, can be synthesized in two approaches. On one side the spread of mobile and controlling technology encourages critics to foresee an Orwellian context, on the other side the availability of such information and the development of scientific tools for processing complex dataset offer an incredible opportunity to scientist and social analysts. So to what extent are we witnessing the case for extensive and realistic social experiments?

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a brief overview}} of the continuously growing field of Persuasive technology, and addresses some of the apparent benefits of considering ubiquitous and <b>pervasive</b> <b>technologies</b> in a persuasive design context. Advantageous as a combination of the research fields may be, it also calls for thorough ethical reflections, if the persuasive technologies of the future are to be efficient as well as appropriate. By applying persuasive principles to ubiquitous and <b>pervasive</b> <b>technologies,</b> the notion of Kairos may be more thoroughly incorporated into the design, than be the case for any other persuasive technology. However, in consideration of the different dimensions of Kairos, contextual reflections must not only be related to practical design issues, but also constitute a significant perspective upon the ethical considerations of such technologies. In order to address the need for a contextual dimension in the ethical foundation of Persuasive Everyware, this paper introduces the ethical reflections of Danish theologian and philosopher K. E.
