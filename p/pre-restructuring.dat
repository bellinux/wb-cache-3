40|$|The key {{consideration}} for firms’ restructuring is improving their operational efficiencies. Market conditions often offer opportunities or generate threats {{that can be}} handled by restructuring scenarios through consolidation, to create synergy, or through split, to create reverse synergy. A generalized restructuring refers to a move in a business market where a homogeneous set of firms, a set of <b>pre-restructuring</b> decision making units (DMUs), proceed with a restructuring to produce {{a new set of}} post-restructuring entities in the same market to realize efficiency targets. This paper aims to develop a novel inverse Data Envelopment Analysis based methodology, called GInvDEA (Generalized Inverse DEA), for modeling the generalized restructuring. Moreover, the paper suggests a linear programming model that allows determining the lowest performance levels, measured by efficiency that can be achieved through a given generalized restructuring. An application in banking operations illustrates the theory developed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} a work-team restructure {{within an}} organization obtaining measures {{before and after}} the change occurred. <b>Pre-restructure</b> analyses revealed that, in addition to informational variables, subgroup identification (work-team) and superordinate identification (organization) were important predictors of negative feelings towards the restructure. The more that employees identified with the subgroup, the more negative feelings they reported about the upcoming change. In contrast, the higher the identification with the superordinate group, the less negative employees felt. Longitudinal analysis revealed that compared with the <b>pre-restructure,</b> post-restructure levels of work-team identification, organizational identification, job satisfaction and perceived work-team performance were significantly lower. <b>Pre-restructure</b> work-team identification was a stronger predictor of post-restructure job satisfaction than <b>pre-restructure</b> organizational identification. In addition, it was found that <b>pre-restructure</b> work-team identification and organizational identification had opposing effects on post-restructure organizational identification. There was some evidence that high initial organizational identification protected long-term organizational commitment...|$|R

40|$|One {{purpose of}} {{electricity}} restructuring {{is to create}} a market in which prices reflect costs to which both generators and consumers may respond efficiently. Yet in many jurisdictions, spot prices may be quite volatile, and both consumers and generators of electricity {{have made it clear that}} they do not prices that are highly volatile. This paper examines price plans that have been and might be used in restructured electricity markets assessing their ability to face consumers with efficient prices at the margin but to minimize their exposure to volatility, considering the welfare losses that may be associated with them. It notes that electricity markets are necessarily artificial and that few have managed to create price plans that seem to improve on the efficiency of <b>pre-restructuring</b> prices. Moreover in the California market, the operation of a separate market for air pollution emissions gave rise to emission prices far above reasonable estimates of environmental harm, further exacerbating wholesale price fluctuations in 2000. Solutions to these problems are explored. electric utilities, electricity restructuring, air pollution, spot market, price volatility, price structure, Ontario...|$|E
40|$|After the Asian {{financial}} crisis, {{companies are}} now contending with the current global economic slowdown. Whether {{it is at the}} national, industry or organizational levels, restructuring has gained currency as a strategic decision to realign internal structure with changing macro environmental factors. Faced with more competitive markets and greater demands on costs controls, organizations and businesses are taking the fast track to cost-cutting by downsizing, reorganizing their divisions, streamlining their operations, and closing down unprofitable divisions. Changes that are introduced in an organizational restructuring will affect the socio-psychological well-being of organization members given the potential for uncertainty that may accompany such changes. There is a need to better understand the consequences of organizational restructuring and consider some of its potential side effects on the work environment. Employees in a post-restructuring context are understandably wary about the future direction of the organization and their roles within it. This study is an attempt to examine the social-psychological impact of organizational restructuring on trust and work satisfaction. Additionally the inter-relationships between trust and work satisfaction, including their antecedents in the work environment are examined. Trust and work satisfaction levels were tracked before and three months after organizational restructuring for varying types of changes that were initiated during the restructuring. Both trust and satisfaction with working in the organization declined significantly when compared to <b>pre-restructuring</b> levels. Independent t-tests analysis indicated that there was a significant decline in trust for the work group which had a newly hired manager and a change in work processes. Results showed that there was a negative relationship between both work satisfaction and trust with the extent of change required of employees. The findings also showed that there was a positive relationship between trust and work satisfaction and that trust contributed to work satisfaction. Perception of colleagues’ willingness to help solve job-related problems contributed significantly to strengthening of trust relations among colleagues. Additionally, colleagues and supervisor’s willingness to listen to employee problems contributed significantly to work satisfaction. Results of the study highlighted the need for strategic decision-makers to consider the social impact of organizational restructuring. Top managers must realize that both trust and work satisfaction are important ingredients for the effective functioning of an organization and to actively ensure that support systems or structures are adequate and available to mitigate the negative impact, particularly if the changes to be implemented are extensive.

40|$|Research problem: The {{restructuring}} of an organisation {{can be classified}} as a transformational intervention (Litwin & Burke, 1992). As such is it has a potential to significantly influence key employee attitudes {{that are related to}} employee and organisational performance. Any deterioration in these attitudes could impact negatively on organisational outcomes. As part of the monitoring and review of change interventions, management needs to understand the change in employee attitudes towards their work and management in their business units and towards the broader organisation in order that, if necessary, corrective action can be taken. Research objectives: To address the research problem, research objectives and questions were established. The main objective {{of the study was to}} investigate whether there has been a change in attitudes of employees in two business units of a South African National Science Council after the implementation of restructuring in the organisation and the business units. The key attitudes to be measured are job and management satisfaction, perceived organisational support, organisational commitment and a dimension of employee engagement, dedication. Research questions: Four research questions were established and these were; What is the change in employee attitudes post-restructuring? In particular what is the change in employee job satisfaction; management satisfaction, employee engagement, commitment to the organisation and perceived organisational support? What is the relationship between the sub-groups, distinguished by gender, occupational level, race, home language, age, number of years of service and business unit, and employee attitudes <b>pre-restructuring?</b> What is the relationship between the sub-groups distinguished by gender, occupational level, race, home language, age, number of years of service and business unit, and employee attitudes post-restructuring? What is the relationship between the sub-groups distinguished by gender, occupational level, race, home language, age, number of years of service and business unit, and the change in employee attitudes pre and post-restructuring? Research design: The nature of this research is descriptive. In order to solve the research questions the researcher used a pre-test and post-test measurement of employee attitudes. A survey using a structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information regarding employee attitudes before and after the {{restructuring of}} the organisation and business units. Major findings: The results from the survey showed that there was a change in the levels of organisational commitment, job satisfaction and management satisfaction at the National Science Council after the restructuring had taken place. Also, the impact of the sub-groups in the organisation on affective factors was evident in the level of occupation and employee engagement, race and management satisfaction, the business unit and the levels of perceived organisational support, management satisfaction and employee engagement, home language and employee engagement, the number of years the employee had worked for the organisation and management satisfaction, age and job satisfaction and employee engagemen...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} {{focus will be}} on the Bijlmer, a post-war urban neighbourhood in the Southeastern part of Amsterdam. The demographics of the district are unique within the Netherlands. Only a quarter of its population is native Dutch. Contrary to problematic districts {{in other parts of the}} country where a lot of Morrocans and Turks live, the Bijlmer is the domain of other Africans and people from Surinam and the Antilles. The neighbourhood has undergone a big restructuring process between 1995 and 2011. The question is whether this physical change has lead to changes in the social climate. As goes from that urban restructuring and social climate will be key terms in the theoretical framework. To answer the research question, first of all the history of the neighbourhood has been reviewed. Due to various reasons the socio-economic situation of the district had become so bad, that policy makers saw massive physical changes as the only solution in 1992. Unsafety, vacancies, crime, (drugs) nuisance and illegality where the biggest problems <b>pre-restructuring.</b> The urban redevelopment process has been a physical metamorphosis for the area. Initially 95 % of the dwellings where part of gigantic high-rise residential units, now only 45 % of the dwellings are in those units. A lot of low-rise houses have been built, the level of facilities has been upgraded and the structure of the public space as a whole has been improved. In order to research the social changes, a mix of research methods has been used. Firstly an analysis has been made of existing quantitative data ('the Bijlmermonitor' and 'Living in Amsterdam') on the Bijlmer. Secondly residents have been interviewed on the street, to get to know how they experienced the restructuring process and whether they see certain social developments in the district. Thirdly a micro-etnography has been done to report on observations by the researcher. The social climate of the Bijlmer has undergone a moderately positive change between 1995 and 2011, due to the physical changes in the district. Inhabitants are happy with the demolishments of a lot of high-rise residential units, the renovation of still existing high-rise housing and new low-rise dwellings. The still existing high-rise units are managed better and the police is more committed. This makes drug nuisance, noise nuisance and dirty porches a lot less common problem. More low-rise has made the district more open, it allows residents to live less anonimously and interact better with their neighbours. The respondents are positive about the upscaling of the level of facilities in the area. Shopping centre 'Amsterdamse Poort' is the best example for that. The Bijlmer has become safer and overall a nicer place to live. The interviewees told that they felt very at home in the area and that it had everything they wanted. The mentality of the inhabitants is mainly that of "minding my own business" and of "looking the other way when something happens". People in this neighbourhood almost exclusively live within their own ethnic community, there's little contact between people with differing backgrounds. All in all, the Bijlmer is a special Dutch urban neighbourhood with a short but versatile history...|$|E
