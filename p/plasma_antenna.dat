50|$|A <b>plasma</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is a type}} {{of radio}} antenna {{currently}} in development in which plasma is used instead of the metal elements of a traditional antenna. A <b>plasma</b> <b>antenna</b> can be used for both transmission and reception. Although plasma antennas have only become practical in recent years, the idea is not new; a patent for an antenna using the concept was granted to J. Hettinger in 1919.|$|E
50|$|Early {{practical}} {{examples of}} the technology used discharge tubes to contain the plasma and {{are referred to as}} ionized gas plasma antennas. Ionized gas plasma antennas can be turned on and off and are good for stealth and resistance to electronic warfare and cyber attacks. Ionized gas plasma antennas can be nested such that the higher frequency plasma antennas are placed inside lower frequency plasma antennas. Higher frequency ionized gas <b>plasma</b> <b>antenna</b> arrays can transmit and receive through lower frequency ionized gas <b>plasma</b> <b>antenna</b> arrays. This means that the ionized gas plasma antennas can be co-located and ionized gas <b>plasma</b> <b>antenna</b> arrays can be stacked. Ionized gas plasma antennas can eliminate or reduce co-site interference. Smart ionized gas plasma antennas use plasma physics to shape and steer the antenna beams without the need of phased arrays. Satellite signals can be steered and/or focused in the reflective or refractive modes using banks of plasma tubes making unique ionized gas satellite plasma antennas. The thermal noise of ionized gas plasma antennas is less than in the corresponding metal antennas at the higher frequencies. Solid state plasma antennas (also known as plasma silicon antennas) with steerable directional functionality that can be manufactured using standard silicon chip fabrication techniques are now also in development. Plasma silicon antennas are candidates for use in WiGig (the planned enhancement to Wi-Fi), and have other potential applications, for example in reducing the cost of vehicle-mounted radar collision avoidance systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{industrial}} potential of plasma technology {{is well known}} and excellent demonstrated in several processes of microwave technology, which incorporate some use of an ionized medium. In vast majority of approaches, the plasma, or ionized volume, simply replaced a solid conductor. Highly ionized plasma is essentially a good conductor, and therefore plasma filaments can serve as transmission line elements for guiding waves, or antenna surfaces for radiation. <b>Plasma</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is a kind of}} antenna that radiate electromagnetic wave (EM) energy based on ionized gas instead of metallic conductor in antenna design. In this research work, the development using plasma medium as a conductor element instead of metal medium is investigated. Three new design antenna by using plasma concepts were proposed; namely cylindrical monopole <b>plasma</b> <b>antenna</b> using electrode-less discharge tube, monopole <b>plasma</b> <b>antenna</b> using fluorescent tube and reconfigurable <b>plasma</b> <b>antenna</b> array. The research described in this project introduces the analysis of cylindrical monopole <b>plasma</b> <b>antenna.</b> Three types of gases with three different pressure which are Argon gas, Neon gas and Hg-Ar gas (mixture of Argon gas and mercury vapor) with pressure at 0. 5 Torr, 5 Torr and 15 Torr respectively is used in this research to observe the interaction between plasma medium and radio frequency (RF) signal. The containers that use to fill the gas are namely electrode-less discharge tube. The technique that used in this experiment to generate plasma is using Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD). The monopole <b>plasma</b> <b>antenna</b> using fluorescent tube is designed at frequency 2. 4 GHz which is aim in wireless application.

Two radically different current distributions on the antenna are considered and their influences on the antenna impedance are studied.

Staras proposed the second one. In this paper, we offer an analytical solution for the second one as proposed by Staras. We compare both distributions and find that impedances resulting from them are remarkably close.

To reproducibly fabricate the arrays, glass micromaching using replica molding and micropowder blasting was proposed and demonstrated. The microplasmas were optically and electrically probed in this work. The investigation showed that each plasma is physically separated and yet, under the proper conditions, is optically and/or electrically coupled to its neighbors. In arrays {{as large as}} 10 parallel microchannel plasmas, evidence of optical coupling among the channels is observed {{in the form of}} strongly enhanced atomic emission which is attributed to electron heating driven by the resonant absorption of scattered radiation. The transition from Townsend-like discharges to abnormal glow-like discharges was observed in arrays of microcavity plasma devices. During the transition, bistable oscillations of visible emission were observed in microcavity plasma devices operating in Ne at pressures of 200 - 700 Torr. In this situation, the time-varying distribution of charge deposited on a dielectric layer in a dielectric barrier device structure appears to be responsible for the oscillations and coupling.
