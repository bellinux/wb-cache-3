25|$|This {{approach}} {{was extended to}} the lymphomas in 1963 by Vincent T. DeVita and George Canellos at the NCI, who ultimately proved in the late 1960s that nitrogen mustard, vincristine, <b>procarbazine</b> and prednisone — known as the MOPP regimen — could cure patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include <b>procarbazine</b> and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine {{has serious}} {{interactions}} {{that can be}} dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, <b>procarbazine,</b> selegiline, tranylcypromine). Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion. It {{is thought to be}} caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, some antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include <b>procarbazine</b> and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
25|$|MDS {{most often}} {{develops}} without an identifiable cause. Risk factors include exposure to an agent {{known to cause}} DNA damage, like radiation, benzene, and certain chemotherapies; other risk factors have been inconsistently reported. It {{can be difficult to}} prove a connection between a suspected exposure and the development of MDS, but the presence of genetic abnormalities may provide some supportive information. Secondary MDS can occur as a late toxicity of cancer therapy (therapy associated MDS, t-MDS). MDS after exposure to radiation or Alkylating agents such as busulfan, nitrosourea, or <b>procarbazine,</b> typically occurs 3-7 years after exposure and frequently demonstrates loss of chromosome 5 or 7. MDS after exposure to DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors occurs after a shorter latency of only 1-3 years and can have a 11q23 translocation. Other pre-existing bone marrow disorders like acquired aplastic anemia following immunosuppressive treatment and Fanconi's anemia can evolve into MDS.|$|E
2500|$|Some cancer {{treatments}} like bexarotene, busulfan, chlorambucil, estramustine, etoposide, flutamide, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, ixabepilone, letrozole, lomustine, megestrol, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, <b>procarbazine,</b> tamoxifen, topotecan ...|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{primidone}} with {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors (MAOIs) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), <b>procarbazine</b> (Matulane), selegiline (Eldepryl), tranylcypromine (Parnate) or {{within two weeks}} of stopping {{any one of them}} may [...] the effects of primidone or change one's seizure patterns. Isoniazid, an antitubercular agent with MAOI properties, has been known to strongly inhibit the metabolism of primidone.|$|E
5000|$|Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, <b>procarbazine,</b> mechlorethamine ...|$|E
5000|$|... (D)acarbazine (similar to (<b>P)rocarbazine,</b> {{designated}} as P in MOPP and in COPP) ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{combined}} with ethanol, <b>procarbazine</b> may cause a disulfiram-like reaction in some people.|$|E
50|$|It {{contains}} less <b>procarbazine</b> than MOPP (<b>procarbazine</b> {{is given}} only for 10 days in cycle instead of 14), {{and the very}} toxic mechlorethamine, which is prone to give severe neutropenia and to severely heighten the risk of secondary malignancies, is changed to less toxic cyclophosphamide, which is more safe to the progenitor stem cells (thus, less neutropenia) and less prone to give late secondary malignancies.|$|E
50|$|COPP is a {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{for treatment}} of Hodgkin disease, consisting of concurrent treatment with (C)yclophosphamide, (O)ncovin, (<b>P)rocarbazine</b> and (P)rednisone.|$|E
50|$|When used {{to treat}} Hodgkin's lymphoma, it is often {{delivered}} {{as part of the}} BEACOPP regimen that includes bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine (tradename Oncovin), prednisone, and <b>procarbazine.</b> The first combination chemotherapy developed for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), MOPP also included <b>procarbazine</b> (ABVD has supplanted MOPP as standard first line treatment for HL, with BEACOPP as an alternative for advanced/unfavorable HL). Alternatively, when {{used to treat}} certain brain tumors (malignant gliomas), it is often dosed as PCV when combined with lomustine (often called CCNU) and vincristine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Procarbazine</b> rarely causes chemotherapy-induced {{peripheral}} neuropathy, a progressive, enduring, often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, {{beginning in}} the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} is usually administered in four week cycles, often for six cycles. MSD and VCR are administered intravenously, while <b>procarbazine</b> and prednisone are pills taken orally. A newer Hodgkin's lymphoma {{treatment is}} ABVD.|$|E
50|$|<b>Procarbazine</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. In the United Kingdom a month of treatment cost the NHS 450 to 750 pounds.|$|E

DeVita and George Canellos at the NCI, who ultimately proved in the late 1960s that nitrogen mustard, vincristine, <b>procarbazine</b> and prednisone — known as the MOPP regimen — could cure patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Procarbazine</b> is a {{chemotherapy}} medication {{used for}} the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma and brain cancers. For Hodgkin's it is often used together with mechlorethamine, vincristine, and prednisone while for brain cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme it is used with lomustine and vincristine. It is typically taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to studying {{the effect of}} radiation for SLT, Russell et al. were also interested in studying the effect of chemical mutagens such as <b>procarbazine</b> and ethylnitrosourea for SLT. At that time, <b>procarbazine</b> was the most potent chemical mutagen known to cause a significant spermatogonial mutagenesis in an SLT, although at a rate one-third of that of X-rays. Russell's earlier mutagenesis work on Drosophila using diethylnitrosoamine (DEN) triggered them to use DEN for the SLT. However, DEN needs to be enzymatically converted into an alkylating agent {{in order to be}} mutagenic and probably this enzymatic activation was not sufficient in mammals. This could be illustrated by the extremely low mutation rate in mice given by DEN (3 in 60,179 offsprings). To overcome this problem, a new mutagen, N-ethyl N-nitrosourea (ENU), an alkylating agent, which {{does not need to be}} metabolised, was suggested to be used by Ekkehart Vegel to Russell et al. The ENU (250 mg/kg) induced mice underwent a period of sterility for 10 weeks. After recovery, 90 males were crossed to the T-stock females and 7584 pups were obtained. Their results showed that a dose of 250 mg/kg of ENU was capable of producing a mutation rate 5 times higher than that obtained with 600R (1R = 2.6 x10^-4 coulombs/kg) of acute X-irradiation. This rate was also 15 times higher to that obtained with <b>procarbazine</b> (600 mg/kg).|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effect}} include low blood cell counts and vomiting. Other side effects include {{tiredness}} and depression. It {{is not recommended}} in people with severe liver or kidney problems. Use in pregnancy is known to harm the baby. <b>Procarbazine</b> is in the alkylating agents family of medication. How it works is not clearly known.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{primidone}} with {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors (MAOIs) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), <b>procarbazine</b> (Matulane), selegiline (Eldepryl), tranylcypromine (Parnate) or {{within two weeks}} of stopping {{any one of them}} may potentiate the effects of primidone or change one's seizure patterns. Isoniazid, an antitubercular agent with MAOI properties, has been known to strongly inhibit the metabolism of primidone.|$|E
50|$|CNS {{depressants}} {{may enhance}} the depressant effects of hydromorphone, such as other opioids, anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, chloral hydrate, dimenhydrinate, and glutethimide. The depressant effect of hydromorphone {{may also be}} enhanced by MAO inhibitors (including <b>procarbazine),</b> first-generation antihistamines (brompheniramine, promethazine, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine), beta-blockers, and alcohol. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose should be reduced of one or both agents.|$|E
50|$|Chemotherapy poses a {{high risk}} of {{infertility}}. Chemotherapies with high risk of infertility include <b>procarbazine</b> and other alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
50|$|As of mid-2006, {{dacarbazine}} {{is commonly}} used as a single agent {{in the treatment of}} metastatic melanoma, and as part of the ABVD chemotherapy regimen to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma, and in the MAID regimen for sarcoma. Dacarbazine was proven to be just as efficacious as <b>procarbazine</b> in the German trial for paediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma, without the teratogenic effects. Thus COPDAC has replaced the former COPP regime in children for TG2 & 3 following OEPA.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the mid-1960s, advanced-stage Hodgkin {{disease was}} treated with single-agent chemotherapy, with fairly dismal {{long-term}} survival and cure rates. With advances {{in the understanding of}} chemotherapy resistance and the development of combination chemotherapy, Vincent T. DeVita and George Canellos at the National Cancer Institute (United States) developed the MOPP regimen. This combination of mechlorethamine, vincristine (Oncovin), <b>procarbazine,</b> and prednisone proved capable of curing almost 70% of patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma.|$|E

50|$|Pethidine {{has serious}} {{interactions}} {{that can be}} dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, <b>procarbazine,</b> selegiline, tranylcypromine). Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion. It {{is thought to be}} caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, some antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.|$|E
50|$|Second line {{treatment}} may include fludarabine, combined with cyclophosphamide and/or mitoxantrone, usually with rituximab. Cladribine and clofarabine {{are two other}} drugs being investigated in MCL. A relatively new regimen that uses old drugs is PEP-C, which includes relatively small, daily doses of prednisone, etoposide, <b>procarbazine,</b> and cyclophosphamide, taken orally, has proven effective for relapsed patients. According to John Leonard, PEP-C may have anti-angiogenetic properties, something {{that he and his}} colleagues are testing through an ongoing drug trial.|$|E
50|$|MDS may {{be caused}} by {{environmental}} exposures such as radiation and benzene; other risk factors have been inconsistently reported. However, definitive proof of specific causes cannot be determined. Secondary MDS occurs as a late toxicity of cancer treatment, usually with a combination of radiation and the radiomimetic alkylating agents such as busulfan, nitrosourea, or <b>procarbazine</b> (with a latent period of 5 to 7 years) or the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors (latency 2 years). Both acquired aplastic anemia following immunosuppressive treatment and Fanconi's anemia can evolve into MDS.|$|E
50|$|DEAD is an aza-dienophile and an {{efficient}} dehydrogenating agent, converting alcohols to aldehydes, thiols to disulfides and hydrazo groups to azo groups; {{it is also}} a good electron acceptor. While DEAD is used in numerous chemical reactions it is mostly known as a key component of the Mitsunobu reaction, a common strategy for the preparation of an amine, azide, ether, thioether, or ester from the corresponding alcohol. It is used in the synthesis of various natural products and pharmaceuticals such as zidovudine, an AIDS drug; FdUMP, a potent antitumor agent; and <b>procarbazine,</b> a chemotherapy drug.|$|E
50|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include <b>procarbazine</b> and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
50|$|Chemotherapy and {{radiation}} treatments for {{cancer and other}} serious illnesses can affect reproductive health. The regimens that threaten ovarian and testicular function are mainly radiation therapy to the pelvic area and some types of chemotherapy. Chemotherapies with high risk include <b>procarbazine</b> and alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycinand dactinomycin and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine and 5-fluoruracil.|$|E
50|$|To {{overcome}} {{the problem of}} initial period of sterility, the Russell group showed that instead of injecting one large dose of ENU, a fractionated dose (100 mg/kg) on a weekly schedule permitted a total higher dose (300-400 mg/kg) to be tolerated. This further showed that the mutation frequency improved to be 12 times that of X-rays, 36 times that of <b>procarbazine</b> and over 200 times that of spontaneous mutations. When the mutation rate was averaged across all 7 loci, ENU was found to induce mutations at a frequency of one per locus in every 700 gametes.|$|E
50|$|While MOPP {{was remarkably}} {{successful}} in curing advanced Hodgkin lymphoma, its toxicity remained significant. Aside from bone marrow suppression, frequent side effects included nerve injury caused by vincristine and allergic reactions to <b>procarbazine.</b> Long-term effects {{were also a}} concern, as patients were often cured and could expect long survival after chemotherapy. Infertility was a major long-term side effect, and even more seriously, {{the risk of developing}} treatment-related myelodysplasia or acute leukemia was increased up to 14-fold in patients who received MOPP. These treatment-related hematological malignancies peaked at 5 to 9 years after treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and were associated with a dismally poor prognosis.|$|E
50|$|Patients with AIDS and PCNSL have {{a median}} {{survival}} of only 4 months with radiotherapy alone. Untreated, median survival is only 2.5 months, sometimes due to concurrent opportunistic infections {{rather than the}} lymphoma itself. Extended survival has been seen, however, in a subgroup of AIDS patients with CD4 counts of more than 200 and no concurrent opportunistic infections, who can tolerate aggressive therapy consisting of either methotrexate monotherapy or vincristine, <b>procarbazine,</b> or whole brain radiotherapy. These patients have a median survival of 10-18 months. Of course, {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) is critical for prolonged survival in any AIDS patient, so compliance with HAART {{may play a role in}} survival in patients with concurrent AIDS and PCNSL.|$|E
5000|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{analysis}} shows {{a large number}} of white blood cells. Typically small mature lymphocytes are the majority of cells seen, with monocytes and neutrophils making up the rest. [...] Definitive diagnosis is based on histopathology, either a brain biopsy or post-mortem evaluation (necropsy). A CT scan or MRI will show patchy, diffuse, or multifocal lesions. For a number of years, the basic treatment was some type of corticosteroid in combination with one or more immunosuppressive drugs, typically cytosine arabinoside and/or cyclosporine or other medications such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or <b>procarbazine,</b> of which were usually added one at a time to the corticosteroid until a successful combination was found. There is evidence that treatment with radiation therapy for focal GME provides the longest periods of remission.|$|E
