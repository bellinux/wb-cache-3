40|$|Background. Self-reported {{weight and}} height {{are used to}} compute <b>ponderal</b> <b>indices</b> in studies where it is {{impractical}} to obtain objectively measured data. Little {{is known about the}} associations between self-reported and measured weight and height in older adults. Methods. Participants in congregate and home-delivered meal programs in a rural Wisconsin county recorded their height and weight on a questionnaire as part of a study on nutritional risk and quality of life. Objective measurements of height and weight were made on the same day. Data for 131 subjects, ranging in age from 62 - 92 years, were ana-lyzed to evaluate associations between self-reported and measured weights and heights. Results. Correlation coefficients between self-reported and measured values suggested that self-reported weight was somewhat more valid than self-reported height in this population. However, self-reported weight was misreported by 10 pounds or more in 20 % of the sample. Conclusions. More data are needed to evaluate the utility of self-reported data for weight and height in groups of older people. Judging from this study, self-reported height and weight data, if used at all for older adults, should only be used as a continuous variable rather than for classifying subjects into relative weight categories. MEASURES of weight adjusted for height, such as thebody mass index (BMI = weight [kg]/height [m 2]) are frequently used. Height and weight measures are sometime...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroduction and aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relation between birth weight and neonatal umbilical cord serum lipid levels. Patients and methodsTwo hundred and three healthy newborns were studied in an educational hospital in the south-west of Iran from April 2009 to April 2010. The newborns’ birth weights were measured and their neonatal <b>ponderal</b> <b>indices</b> (NPI) were calculated. Newborns were divided into 3 groups according to their birth weight: low birth weight (4000 g; group 3). The newborns’ umbilical cord serum was analyzed for its lipid profile, including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL). The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) also was calculated. ResultsThe mean serum lipid levels (TG, TC, LDL, and VLDL) were higher in groups 1 and 3 than in group 2, but the HDL levels were not significantly different. TG, TC, HDL, LDL, VLDL, and atherogenic index had no significant differences between genders (P> 0. 05). TG, TC, LDL, and VLDL levels in low birth weight (LBW) and high birth weight newborns were significantly higher than in normal weight newborns (P 25. ConclusionTG, TC, LDL, and VLDL levels in LBW and high birth weight newborns were significantly higher than in normal weight newborns. TC and LDL were significantly lower in neonates whose mother's age≤ 30 years compared to older mothers. TC and LDL were significantly higher in group whose mother's BMI≤ 25 compared to > 25.

40|$|Birthweight is a crude {{indicator}} of size at birth. Some neonatologists and obstetricians have advocated {{the use of}} <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> and birthlength to characterize size at birth. This paper examines the associations between various size-at-birth indicators and neonatal and postneonatal mortality, {{with an emphasis on}} <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> and birthlength. Size at birth, gestational age and mortality data for about one million babies born alive in Sweden between 1987 and 1995 were collected from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry. A multinomial logit regression was used to estimate conditional odds ratios. Birthlength and <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> were independently associated with neonatal and postneonatal mortality. In the latter period, <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> was only weakly associated with mortality. The associations were not sensitive to exclusion of cases of congenital anomalies and adjustment for gestational age.

40|$|A {{crossbreeding}} design {{based on}} the use of mixed semen from Large White (LW) and Meishan (MS) boars was set up to study differences in late development of purebred and crossbred fetuses developed in the same uterine environment, i. e. either LW or MS. Caesareans were performed {{at the end of the}} second gestation to study characteristics of fetuses at 90 d and 110 d of development. A total of 312 fetuses from 9 LW and 10 MS sows were dissected. The four genetic types of piglets were compared according to body, bones and organs traits measured on the experimental farm or from image analyses. The model for statistical comparison included the fixed effect of sex, the interaction between genetic type and age of development, the percent of purebreds in the litter and litter size as covariates, and the sow random effect. Purebred (PB) and crossbred (CB) fetuses differed for body weight and body length at 90 d and 110 d of development in MS sows (P< 0. 05) but not in LW sows. LW PB were heavier and longer than MS PB at 110 d but not 90 d (P< 0. 05). The body mass and <b>ponderal</b> <b>indexes</b> of LW PB were lower than those of LW CB at 90 d and 110 d, and of MS PB and MS CB at 90 d only. These indexes were lower in MS CB than MS PB at 90 d but the difference disappeared at 110 d. Proportionally to body length, the femur was the shortest in LW PB, intermediate in the 2 reciprocal CB types, and the longest in MS PB (at 90 d). Proportionally to body weight, liver was the lightest in LW PB, ofintermediate weight in the 2 CB types, and the heaviest in MS PB (P< 0, 05). Ratios of the brain weight aboveweight of several organs at 90 d were the highest in LW PB, intermediate in the 2 CB types, and the lowestin MS PB, indicative of sparing effects in LW PB. Our findings outlined a delay of late fetal development inLW PB fetuses. The complementary comparison of born alive LW PB that died or survived the first 24 h afterbirth confirmed that disproportionate development is correlated with lower survival...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{scientific}} literature poses a perplexing dilemma {{for pregnant women}} {{with respect to the}} consumption of fish from natural bodies of water. On one hand, fish is a good source of protein, low in fat and a rich source of other nutrients all of which have presumably beneficial effects on developing embryos and fetuses. On the other hand, consumption of fish contaminated with environmental toxicants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been associated with decrements in gestation and birth size. Methods 2, 716 infants born between 1986 – 1991 to participants of the New York State Angler Cohort Study were studied with respect to duration of maternal consumption of contaminated fish from Lake Ontario and its tributaries and gestation and birth size. Hospital delivery records (maternal and newborn) were obtained for 92 % of infants for the ascertainment of gestation (weeks), birth size (weight, length, chest, and head circumference) and other known determinants of fetal growth (i. e., maternal parity, history of placental infarction, uterine bleeding, pregnancy loss or cigarette smoking and infant's race, sex and presence of birth defect). Duration of maternal fish consumption prior to the index infant's birth was categorized as: none; 1 – 2, 3 – 7, 8 + years, while birth weight (in grams), birth length (in centimeters), and head and chest circumference (in centimeters) were left as continuous variables in multiple linear regression models. Birth size percentiles, <b>ponderal</b> <b>indices</b> and head to chest circumference ratios were computed to further assess proportionality and birth size in relation to gestational age. Results Analysis of variance failed to identify significant mean differences in gestation or any measure of birth size in relation to duration of maternal lifetime fish consumption. Multiple linear regressions identified gestational age, male sex, number of daily cigarettes, parity and placental infarction, as significant determinants of birth size. Conclusions The results support the absence of an adverse relation between Lake Ontario fish consumption and reduced birth size as measured by weight, length and head circumference. Biological determinants and maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy remain important determinants of birth size. </p...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Fish assemblages were sampled and water physicochemistry was evaluated in Lake Nokoue and Lagoon Toho-Todougba in southern Benin. Various biological parameters (species richness, species diversity, abundance, relative abundance, <b>ponderal</b> <b>indexes)</b> were evaluated and regressed against environmental conditions to examine patterns of association. Feeding ecology and morphological diversification of the fish assemblages were examined. Multivariate procedures (principal components analysis, euclidean distance, cluster analysis, and canonical correlation analysis) were performed to examine trophic guilds and associations between trophic specialization and morphology. Fish species trophic relationships (food webs) were examined for each fish assemblage. The two fish-, assemblages exhibited low similarity in species composition due to differences in water physicochemical conditions. Among the 35 and 21 species found in Lake Nokoue and Lagoon Toho-Todougba respectively, only a few species dominated. Lake Nokoue was dominated by the perciform Gerres melanopterus and the clupeiform Ethmalosafimbriata, whereas Lagoon Toho-Todougba was dominated by the characiforyn Brycinus longipinis. In Lake Nokoue, the Akadja habitat exhibited high species richness compared to the other local biotas. In general, for the dominant species, small individuals were associated with shallow habitats with or without vegetation. Within assemblages, {{there was a lack of}} association between physicochemical conditions and community attributes. In Lagoon Toho-Todougba, the utilization of vegetation (flowers, duckweed, seeds) and aquatic insects was common, but these items were very rare in Lake Nokoue fish diets. Most likely, the destruction of the mangroves in Lake Nokoue has reduced the availability of vegetation and aquatic insects. As a result, Lagoon Toho-Todougba was dominated by detritivorous and insectivorous species, whereas Lake Nokoue was dominated by piscivorous species. About thirteen (I 3) trophic guilds were identified within both assemblages. The detritivore and the piscivore guilds contained more species than the others. Despite the differences in species composition, the two fish assemblages had similar mean values for most morphological traits, so that morphological-based centroids were similar in multivariate analyses. Most species belonging to the same feeding guild had similar morphologies indicating that a degree of diet specialization has accompanied morphological diversification. Further investigation is needed, both spatially and temporally, to assess the existing fish resources, their exploitation, and habitat associations. Also, more data are needed to better understand the roles of interspecific and intraspecific interactions and the overall pattern of community organization with regard to habitat utilization and resource partitioning. In any case, restoration of these ecosystems will require assessments of ecosystem integrity in order to diagnose the relative impacts of human activities...|$|R
40|$|We collected, examined, and {{analyzed}} 368 fish of seven species from 10 sites on rivers of the Rio Grande Basin (RGB) during late 1997 and early 1998 to document temporal and geographic {{trends in the}} concentrations of accumulative contaminants and to assess contaminant effects on the fish. Sites were located on the mainstem of the Rio Grande and on the Arroyo Colorado and Pecos River in Texas (TX), New Mexico (NM), and Colorado. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were the targeted species. Fish were examined {{in the field for}} internal and external visible gross lesions, selected organs were weighed to compute <b>ponderal</b> and organosomatic <b>indices,</b> and samples of tissues and fluids were obtained and preserved for analysis of fish health and reproductive biomarkers. Whole fish from each station were composited by species and gender {{and analyzed}} for organochlorine chemical residues and elemental contaminants using instrumental methods, and for 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin-like activity (TCDD-EQ) using the H 4 IIE rat hepatoma cell bioassay. Overall, fish from lower RGB stations contained greater concentrations of organochlorine pesticide residues and appeared to be less healthy than those from sites in the central and upper parts of the basin, as indicated by a general gradient of residue concentrations and biomarker responses. A minimal number of altered biomarkers and few or no elevated contaminant concentrations were noted in fish from the upper RGB. The exception was elevated concentrations [up to 0. 46 µg/g wet-weight (ww) ] of total mercury (Hg) in predatory species from the Rio Grande at Elephant Butte Reservoir, NM, a condition documented in previous studies. Arsenic (As) and selenium (Se) concentrations were greatest in fish from sites in the central RGB; Se concentrations in fish from the Pecos River at Red Bluff Lake, TX and from the Rio Grande at Langtry, TX and Amistad International Reservoir, TX exceeded published fish and wildlife toxicity thresholds. In the lower RGB, residues of p,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT metabolites (≤ 1. 69 Ag/g ww), chlordane-related compounds (≤ 0. 21 Ag/g ww), dieldrin (≤ 0. 0. 05 Ag/g ww), and toxaphene (≤ 2. 4 Ag/g ww) were detected in fish from most sites; maximum concentrations were in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) from the Arroyo Colorado at Harlingen, TX. Concentrations of one or more residues exceeded toxicity thresholds for fish and wildlife in fish from this site and from the Rio Grande at Mission, TX and Brownsville, TX; however, concentrations were lower than those reported by previous studies. In addition, the proportional concentrations of p,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDT at all sites were low, indicating weathered DDT rather than the influx of new material. Concentrations of total PCBs (3 ̆c 0. 05 Ag/g ww) and TCDD-EQ (≤ 6 pg/g ww) were comparatively low in all samples. Hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in some fish was elevated relative to reference rates at most sites, but was generally lower than previously reported activity in fish from heavily contaminated locations. The comparatively low PCB and TCDD-EQ concentrations together with elevated EROD activity may reflect exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Reproductive biomarkers were consistent with chronic contaminant exposure at lower RGB sites; comparatively large percentages of intersex male largemouth bass, relatively low gonadosomatic indices, and elevated plasma vitellogenin concentrations in male fish were noted at three of the four stations. Large percentages of atretic eggs were also observed in the ovaries of female common carp from the Rio Grande at Brownsville, TX. Although many of the conditions noted may have other causes in addition to contaminant exposure, the biomarker results for the lower RGB sites are consistent with subtle responses of fish to contaminants, an interpretation supported by the chemical data of this and other investigations...|$|R

This study investigated intrauterine growth of foetuses in women with epilepsy, as compared with controls, and explored whether intrauterine growth was affected by prenatal exposure to AED. MethodData were obtained from prospectively registered data regarding pregnancy and prenatal and perinatal factors in women in Oppland County in Norway. The final analysis included information from 166 mothers with epilepsy and 287 children. The control group consisted of 40, 553 pregnancies in women without epilepsy registered in the same database. ResultsThere was a significantly higher risk of the <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> being below the 10 th percentile and infants being small for gestational age (SGA) in the epilepsy group; exposure to AED increased the risk. The frequency of SGA and low <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> was highest in Lamotrigine exposed infants. In the AED group, head circumference was significantly smaller among Carbamazepine exposed. ConclusionImpaired intrauterine growth of foetuses in women with epilepsy was identified. The frequency of SGA and low <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> was highest in Lamotrigine exposed infants. The epilepsy group had a higher risk profile for having smaller babies, in being younger at age, lower in body weight and more frequent smokers.

40|$|We use {{a richly}} {{parameterized}} model to analyse {{the effects of}} shortness and thinness at birth on neonatal mortality in Swedish live-born singletons. The model captures the hazard of neonatal mortality according to the function α × exp(-γ × t) + δ, where t represents age. Covariates are allowed to simultaneously influence the initial excess hazard, the rate of decay, and the long-term hazard. Among term newborns, birth length for gestational age had a stronger effect on the long-term hazard and a weaker effect on the initial excess hazard than the <b>Ponderal</b> <b>index.</b> The initial excess hazard associated with a low <b>Ponderal</b> <b>index</b> tended to decay quickly. Among preterm newborns, a higher birth length for gestational age was associated with lower initial and long-term hazards, and with a faster rate of decay of the initial excess hazard. In contrast, the <b>Ponderal</b> <b>index</b> {{was not associated with}} the long-term hazard. We discuss the interpretability of the model and its potential use in neonatology and medical demography. We also compare the model to a Cox model with time-dependent covariates.

40|$|People {{differ in}} their {{susceptibility}} to developing cancer on exposure to carcinogens such as tobacco. What causes this is largely unknown. One possibility {{is that it is}} determined by nutritional influences during development that permanently change the structure and function of the baby's body. We studied an older and a younger cohort, totaling 20, 431 men and women, born in Helsinki during 1924 - 1933 and 1934 - 1944. Their body size at birth had been recorded. Of them, 385 had developed lung cancer. Smoking history was known for 6, 822 people. At birth, babies who later developed lung cancer had a high <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> (birthweight/length 3). This association was confined to people whose mother's height was below the median. Among these people in the older cohort, the hazard ratio associated with a <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> > 30 kg/m 3 was 3. 1 (95 % CI 1. 6 - 5. 9), in comparison to those with a <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> of 26 kg/m 3 or less (P for trend < 0. 001). The equivalent figures for the younger cohort were 2. 9 (1. 2 - 7. 0, P for trend = 0. 001) and this association was independent of smoking. We suggest that a high <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> in babies born to short mothers is the result of low amino acid delivery to the fetus in relation to glucose delivery. We hypothesize that this impairs the development of the babies' antioxidant systems and makes them vulnerable to oxidative stress in later life. This is the first evidence that fetal programming may determine vulnerability to carcinogens in humans. humans. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 2010...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Pregestational {{body mass}} index (BMI) {{which is one of}} the best markers of {{nutritional}} status can be one of many variables affecting fetal growth. We wanted to determine the relations between various prepregnancy BMI categories, parity and newborn Ponderal indexes, birthweights in our population. Methodology: For the assessment of the functional significance of BMI during pre-pregnancy, data from 264 women living in Sakarya were used. Maternal age, pregestational weight, height, parity were obtained from self-report at interview. We evaluated the relationship between maternal age, parity, pregestational weight and BMIs and newborn parameters as birthweight and <b>Ponderal</b> <b>index.</b> Results: Average of the birth weight was 3. 340 ± 400 gr, of the birth height was 50. 53 ± 1. 66 cm, of <b>Ponderal</b> <b>index</b> was 25. 54 ± 2. 06. The mean of maternal BMI was 23. 06 ± 3. 64, of parity was 2. 14 ± 1. 17. Conclusions: When BMI groups were compared with birthweight (p: 0. 026) and parity (p: 0. 02), it was observed that it had significant relationship. Statistical differences were not observed between maternal pregestational BMI and newborn <b>Ponderal</b> <b>index</b> (p: 0. 466).

40|$|Long-term poor growth {{outcomes}} are well documented for intrauterine growth-retarded babies (IUGR) in developed populations {{but there is}} a paucity of IUGR studies from disadvantaged populations where the greatest burden of IUGR occurs. Using a Northern Territory, Aboriginal cohort recruited at birth and followed up at a mean age of 11. 4 years, comparisons of body size were made between children born at term who had been IUGR (n = 121) and those non-IUGR (n = 341), and between those IUGR babies who had an appropriate <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> at birth (n = 72) and those with a low <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> (n = 49). Compared with non-IUGR children, at follow-up the IUGR children were almost 2 cm shorter (P = 0. 10), 4 kg lighter (P < 0. 01) and their head circumferences were almost a 1 cm smaller (P < 0. 01). For the 121 term IUGR children, {{there were no significant differences}} in growth outcomes according to <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> measures at birth. These findings from an Australian Aboriginal sample are consistent with other comparisons of IUGR and non-IUGR children in developed populations and suggest there may be no additional effects of IUGR on growth in childhood for disadvantaged populations similar to the Aboriginal population in the Northern Territory...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTVE: To objectively and {{critically}} assess {{body mass index}} and to propose alternatives for relating body weight and height that are evidence-based and that eliminate or reduce {{the limitations of the}} body mass index. METHODS: To analyze the relations involving weight and height, we used 2 databases as follows: 1) children and adolescents from Brazil, the United States, and Switzerland; and 2) 538 university students. We performed mathematical simulations with height data ranging from 115 to 190 cm and weight data ranging from 25 to 105 kg. We selected 3 methods to analyze the relation of weight and height as follows: body mass index - weight (kg) /height (m²); reciprocal of the <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> - height (cm) /weight 1 / 3 (kg); and ectomorphy. Using the normal range from 20 to 25 kg/m² for the body mass index in the reference height of 170 cm, we identified the corresponding ranges of 41 to 44 cm/kg 1 / 3 for the reciprocal of the <b>ponderal</b> <b>index,</b> and of 1. 45 to 3. 60 for ectomorphy. RESULTS: The mathematical simulations showed a strong association among the 3 methods with an absolute concordance to a height of 170 cm, but with a tendency towards discrepancy in the normal ranges, which had already been observed for the heights of 165 and 175 cm. This made the direct convertibility between the indices unfeasible. The reciprocal of the <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> and ectomorphy with their cut points comprised a larger age range in children and adolescents and a wider and more central range in the university students, both for the reported (current) and desired weights. CONCLUSION: The reciprocal of the <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> and ectomorphy are stronger and are more mathematically logical than body mass index; in addition, they may be applied with the same cut points for normal from the age of 5 ½ years on...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that, in addition to genetic liability and environment in early childhood, intrauterine life also influences the risk for asthma beyond childhood. Low birth weight, prematurity, young maternal age, and maternal smoking have all shown an association with asthma. The effect of perinatal factors on the risk for asthma in relation to familial and social risk factors was studied in a nationwide population-based sample of adolescent twins. In addition to a distribution of birth characteristics among twins which {{differs from that of}} singletons, data on twins enable a distinction to be made between genetic and environmental sources of variation.  METHODS—Questionnaires were sent to five consecutive birth cohorts of Finnish 16 year old twins born in 1975 - 9 and to their parents (3065 families). The outcome measure was life time prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma in these adolescents. The association between asthma and potential risk factors was assessed by multiple logistic regression and discordant twin pair analysis.  RESULTS—Risk for asthma increased with increasing <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> (p for trend < 0. 01) and decreasing maternal age (p for trend < 0. 05). Among the 25 % of twins with the highest <b>ponderal</b> <b>index,</b> the odds ratio for asthma was 1. 82 (95 % confidence interval 1. 18 to 2. 79) compared with those in the lowest 25 %. Neither birth weight, gestational age, nor Apgar score was associated with asthma. When perinatal risk factors were combined with familial and social risk factors, <b>ponderal</b> <b>index,</b> maternal smoking, parental asthma, and sibship size were all significant independent determinants of asthma in these adolescents.  CONCLUSIONS—The risk for asthma in adolescent twins increases with increasing <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> when adjusted for familial and social factors. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess whether}} HbA 1 c and plasma glucose predicts {{abnormal}} fetal growth, 758 pregnant women attending 5 Diabetic Centers were screened for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). On glucose challenge (GCT) at 24 - 27 weeks of gestation (g. w.), negative cases formed the normal control group (N 1). Positive cases took an oral {{glucose tolerance test}} (OGTT) : those found negative were classed as false positives screening test (N 2); if they had an OGTT result at least as high as their normal glucose levels, they were classed as having one abnormal glucose value (OAV) at OGTT; two values as GDM. HbA 1 c was assayed {{on the day of}} GCT. We considered fetal macrosomia, large for gestational age (LGA), <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> and mean growth percentile. Mean age, pre-pregnancy BMI, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA 1 c were progressively higher from N 1 to GDM patients. The newborn of N 2 mothers were heavier than those with N 1 or GDM. The mean growth percentile was significantly higher in N 2 than in N 1. More LGA babies were born to OAV than to N 1 or N 2 women. Macrosomia and <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> did not differ significantly in the four groups. At logistic regression only plasma glucose at GCT could predict LGA babies and a <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> above 2. 85. At risk analysis, GDM and OAV significantly predicted LGA babies, and GDM a <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> > 2. 85. In conclusion, FPG at GCT could predict fetal overgrowth and plasma glucose > 85 mg/dl doubles the risk of LGA infants. HbA 1 c at 24 - 27 g. w. does not predict fetal overgrowth. Mild alterations in glucose tolerance correlate with fetal overgrowth and needs monitoring and treatment...|$|E

In this context, we investigated the association between maternal nutrition and birth anthropometry. We analyzed data on 1040 mother–infant pairs collected during the Tasmanian Infant Health Survey (TIHS), Tasmania, 1988 – 1989. Maternal dietary intake during pregnancy was measured by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) applied soon after birth.

Data were collected through interviews with the mothers at the maternity, anthropometrycal study of the newborns, and cord blood estradiol, testosterone and leptin assays obtained immediately after birth. The levels of leptin were significantly higher in females than in males (8. 34 +/- 0. 65 ng/ml versus 6. 06 +/- 0. 71 ng/ml; p = 0. 000). The concentrations of estradiol and testosterone did not differ between males and females. Leptin levels were positively correlated with gestational age (r = 0. 394, p < 0. 01), birth weight (r = 0. 466, p < 0. 01), birth length (r = 0. 335, p < 0. 01) and <b>ponderal</b> <b>index</b> (r = 0. 326, p < 0. 01).
