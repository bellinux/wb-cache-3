50|$|In July 1958 {{the library}} celebrated a {{groundbreaking}} {{for a new}} addition. The new wing opened on February 1, 1960. Under the leadership of library director, Kathleen Carnall, the library facilitated its goals of bringing people together, promoting community involvement, sharing information and encouraging learning. Porter Library staff developed pre-school and school age children’s programming, such as story hours. They acquired a young adult collection, and extended library services to parochial schools. They supported adult programs, and organized a pamphlet and <b>picture</b> <b>file,</b> a periodical collection, and a film, filmstrip and phonograph collection.|$|E

The library also has a folder for each senior class of Lillington High School from 1944-1977.|$|E
50|$|So far the {{panoramic}} pictures {{have been}} 105 m in circumference and around 30 m in height, making them currently the largest such {{pictures in the}} world.

Digital technology is used to combine photos, drawings and paintings into a single large <b>picture</b> <b>file,</b> which is then printed onto individual strips of textile. The strips are combined into a circular picture which is then hung up as a single piece. The panorama is viewed from a raised platform in the centre. Perspective distortion is used to create an impression of space.|$|E

50|$|Prime Photo {{users can}} upload an {{unlimited}} number of <b>picture</b> <b>file</b> formats only, and {{rest of the}} formats including video formats will be counted in the additional 5GB storage in the plan.

5000|$|Related {{processes}} such as datamoshing {{changes the}} data in a video or <b>picture</b> <b>file.</b> [...] Datamoshing with software such as Avidemux is a common method for creating glitch art by manipulating different frame types in compressed digital video: [...] "Datamoshing involves the removal of an encoded video’s I-frames (intra-coded picture, also known as key frames—a frame that does not require any information regarding another frame to be decoded), leaving only the P- (predicted picture) or B- (bi-predictive picture) frames. P-frames contain information predicting {{the changes in the}} image between the current frame and the previous one, and B-frames contain information predicting the image differences between the previous, current and subsequent frames. Because P- and B-frames use data from previous and forward frames, they are more compressed than I-Frames."This process of direct manipulation of the digital data is not restricted to files that only appear on digital screens.

5000|$|The {{software}} {{allows users}} to import 3D models into a virtual space that can be moved and animated accordingly. The positioning of the 3D figures can be easily altered, the facial expressions can be altered (as long as the model has morphs to use), and motion data {{can be applied to}} the model to make it move. Along with these functions for models, accessories, stages, and backgrounds can be added to create an environment, and effects such as lens flares and AutoLuminous (an effect that makes things glow and light up) can be applied as long as the MikuMikuEffect (MME) plugin is installed into the interface. Sound and music can also be added to create music videos, short films, and fan-made stories. The motion data used to animate the characters and the pose data mainly used for making screenshots can be exported as [...]vmd (Vocaloid Motion Data) files and [...]vpd (Vocaloid Pose Data) files, respectively. The exported files can then be imported into other projects made with software that can use the file types. This {{allows users to}} share the data with other users. The software also uses the Bullet physics engine. Users can also use Microsoft's Kinect for motion capturing. Map shadowing, screenshot rendering in several <b>picture</b> <b>file</b> formats and full movie rendering in the [...]avi file format are also possible.|$|E
