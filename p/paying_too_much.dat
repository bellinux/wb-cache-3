5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network {{should be prepared to}} pay up towards £30 million for live football. At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company would be forced to increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E

When you <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> little, you {{sometimes}} lose everything because {{the thing you}} bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do.

25|$|It was {{impossible}} to achieve both these aims, as the principle of less eligibility made people search for work in towns and cities. Workhouses were built and paupers transferred to these urban areas. However, the Settlement Laws were used to protect ratepayers from <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> Workhouse construction and the amalgamation of unions was slow. Outdoor relief did continue after the PLAA was introduced.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} round of the playoffs, the team played the New York Islanders, facing former team captain Alexei Yashin for the first time in the playoffs. Yashin played well in the first game and the Islanders won the first game at the Corel Centre 3–0. The loss by the Senators was {{attributed}} to <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> attention to stopping Yashin and not enough on the rest of the Islanders. The Senators adjusted their play for the next game winning it and the next three games in a row to win the series 4–1.|$|E

25|$|ONdigital had {{problems}} from the start, and renaming the service ITV Digital on 11 July 2001 failed {{to help the}} matter. All subscription services except E4 and FilmFour went off-air on 1 May 2002 after the consortium collapsed, explained as being due to <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the television rights for The Football League. However, the choice of 64QAM broadcast mode, {{the fact that at}} least 40% of homes would need new aerials to receive it, a high churn rate, an insecure hackable encryption system, the cost of having to provide free set-top boxes, and aggressive competition from BSkyB all contributed to ITV Digital's spiraling costs, before shareholders Granada and Carlton called a halt to the venture.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of October 14, 1880, Bull, now partnered with gambler Jim Moon, became {{involved}} in an altercation with two city policemen. Moon's wife and another {{woman who had been}} dating Bull also became involved, throwing chinaware at the officers, causing them to retreat. Bull and Moon met the officers, who returned with more policemen, at the front door, pistols drawn, but after seeing that they could not win, both Bull and Moon surrendered. Less than a month later, Moon killed a man named Sam Hall by beating him on the head with his pistol. He was acquitted on the grounds of self defense in the trial that followed. Seven months later, Moon, a jealous man, attacked a gambler named Clay Wilson, believing Wilson was <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> attention to his (Moon's) wife. Wilson shot Moon twice, killing him.|$|E

In {{the early stages of}} the campaign, a series of leaks were released by purported Labor Party sources, indicating apparent divisions within Cabinet over the replacement of Kevin Rudd by Gillard.

500|$|In a {{commentary}} in the Financial Times entitled [...] "Olympus's deceit was dishonourable", John Gapper noted that [...] "It {{is still possible}} {{to believe that the}} accused trio of directors... thought they were behaving honourably... failure discreetly and not to make their predecessors lose face." [...] He noted that accounting scandals were not uniquely Japanese, but that it was [...] "a nice piece of corporate satire to conceal losses by exploiting the widespread habit of <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for acquisitions and writing them down [...] the 'advisory fee' was especially creative". Gapper criticised the weakness in governance, particularly how 12 out of 15 directors were either executives or former executives of the company, and that Hideo Yamada, head of the Audit Board, was complicit in the scam. He also noted that auditors KPMG and Ernst & Young would have to answer tough questions about why the manipulation was never discovered or properly questioned.|$|E
500|$|With {{his next}} album, the new decade found Morrison {{following}} his muse into uncharted territory and sometimes merciless reviews. In February 1980, Morrison {{and a group}} of musicians travelled to Super Bear, a studio in the French Alps, to record (on the site of a former abbey) what is considered to be the most controversial album in his discography; later [...] "Morrison admitted his original concept was even more esoteric than the final product." [...] The album, Common One, consisted of six songs; the longest, [...] "Summertime in England", lasted fifteen and one-half minutes and ended with the words,"Can you feel the silence?". NME magazine's Paul Du Noyer called the album [...] "colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak." [...] Greil Marcus, whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, critically remarked: [...] "It's Van acting the part of the 'mystic poet' he thinks he's supposed to be." [...] Morrison insisted the album was never [...] "meant to be a commercial album." [...] Biographer Clinton Heylin concludes: [...] "He would not attempt anything so ambitious again. Henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality." [...] Later, critics reassessed the album more favourably with the success of [...] "Summertime in England". Lester Bangs wrote in 1982, [...] "Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> attention to the lyrics." ...|$|E
2500|$|A row {{subsequently}} developed {{within the}} party, in which MEP and campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn described Farage's public image as [...] "snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive" [...] {{and said he}} risked turning the party into a [...] "personality cult". O'Flynn accused Farage of <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> attention to advisors that [...] "would like to take UKIP {{in the direction of}} some hard-right, ultra-aggressive American Tea Party-type movement", singling out the NHS and gun control liberalisation as particular issues. Raheem Kassam, Farage's chief of staff and editor of Breitbart London was later sacked as a result, whilst O'Flynn insisted he continued to support Farage as party leader. Farage also faced a number of calls from senior figures within the party to stand down.|$|E

5000|$|This {{statement}} {{is also found}} in this lengthier version: [...] "There is hardly anything in the world that someone cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper, and the people who consider price alone are that person's lawful prey. It's unwise to <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> but it's worse to <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> little. When you <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> you lose a little money - that is all.

2500|$|In 2007, he {{presided over}} the sale of Jaguar Cars and Land Rover to Tata Motors, an Indian car and truck manufacturer. Mulally said he had [...] "no regrets" [...] over the sale, preferring to {{concentrate}} on the Ford brand, as then-CEO Jacques Nasser was criticized in 2001 for <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> attention to new overseas acquisitions while letting the main Ford operations in the U.S. decline. Ford received US$2.3 billion on the sale, considerably below what they paid for it under Nasser and Donald Petersen. However, analysts said that Ford would have gotten much less or might not have found a buyer if they had tried to sell it later in 2008, as Jaguar Land Rover sales subsequently plummeted due to high oil prices in the summer, causing Tata to request a bailout from the British government. Mulally also sold off Aston Martin and Volvo Cars, and reduced Ford's stake in Mazda.|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn {{played a}} career-high 160 games in 1986, {{when he led}} NL {{position}} players in Wins Above Replacement (WAR). He scored 100 runs for the first time, and tied for the NL lead (107). He set then-career highs for doubles (33), homers (14) and steals (37). On September 20 against the Houston Astros, he had four hits and became the fifth NL player that century with five stolen bases in a game. He finished third in hitting (.329) after leading {{for most of the}} season. He hit only [...]296 in September, and he regretted <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> attention to Tim Raines and Steve Sax, who were previously trailing him. Gwynn was honored for his defense with his first Gold Glove after leading the league in total chances and putouts (337). His 19 outfield assists that year, which were one short of the league high, were highlighted by the three Mets he threw out in one game.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, he {{made the}} {{modestly}} successful Kingdom of Heaven, a film about the Crusades. The film starred Orlando Bloom, and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composer Harry Gregson-Williams. The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes. Unhappy with the theatrical version of Kingdom of Heaven (which he blamed on <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> attention to the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006. The director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven has been met with critical acclaim, with Empire magazine calling the film an [...] "epic", adding: [...] "The added 45 minutes in the director’s cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle." [...] "This {{is the one that}} should have gone out" [...] reflected Scott. Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: [...] "It depends who's in the driving seat. If you've got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version {{to go out into the}} cinema." ...|$|E
