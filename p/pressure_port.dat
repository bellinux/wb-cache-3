This measurement is conducted at the outlet of the cascade wind tunnel at the Mach numbers 0. 3 and 0. 4, attack angle about − 20 °, ambient pressure 95. 4 kPa and temperature 15 °C. The vane under study owns a large camber angle of about 40 ° and 4 × 10 <b>pressure</b> <b>ports</b> on its suction surface with a steel cubic stand attached. It is fixed vertically on the lower guide steel plate at the outlet through the stand for convenient acquisition of images.

50|$|The oiling {{problem was}} caused by the passage from the center cam bearing to the {{cylinder}} head being offset by an inch and too small. The motor oils of the era were low in detergents, but high in petroleum coke; when combined with short trips and infrequent oil changes, this led to blockage of this passage.

40|$|A spring 1997 {{test section}} {{calibration}} program {{is scheduled for}} the NASA Glenn Research Center Icing Research Tunnel following the installation of new water injecting spray bars. A set of new five-hole flow angle pressure probes was fabricated to properly calibrate the test section for total pressure, static pressure, and flow angle. The probes have nine pressure ports: five total <b>pressure</b> <b>ports</b> on a hemispherical head and four static <b>pressure</b> <b>ports</b> located 14. 7 diameters downstream of the head. The probes were calibrated in the NASA Glenn 3. 5 -in. -diameter free-jet calibration facility. After completing calibration data acquisition for two probes, two data prediction models were evaluated. Prediction errors from a linear discrete model proved to be no worse than those from a full third-order multiple regression model. The linear discrete model only required calibration data acquisition according to an abridged test matrix, thus saving considerable time and financial resources over the multiple regression model that required calibration data acquisition according to a more extensive test matrix. Uncertainties in calibration coefficients and predicted values of flow angle, total pressure, static pressure. Mach number. and velocity were examined.

50|$|A certain minimum supply {{pressure}} {{is needed to}} drive the air through the system, but it is desired to use as low a {{supply pressure}} as possible, because the energy the engine uses to compress the bleed air is not available for propulsion, and fuel consumption suffers. For this reason, air is commonly drawn from one of two (or in some cases such as the Boeing 777, three) bleed ports at different compressor stage locations. When the engine is at low pressure (low thrust or high altitude), the air is drawn from the highest pressure bleed port. As pressure is increased (more thrust or lower altitude) and reaches a predetermined crossover point, the high pressure shut-off valve (HPSOV) closes and air is selected from a lower <b>pressure</b> <b>port</b> to minimize the fuel performance loss. The reverse happens as engine pressure decreases.|$|E

40|$|Methods {{to account}} for finite spatial {{resolution}} and induced downwash velocity are given for multiple-hole pressure probes as {{they are used to}} measure complex three-dimensional flow fields. Spatial resolution limitations result because <b>pressures</b> from different <b>ports</b> are not measured at the same physical location. As transverse gradients increase in magnitude, uncorrected errors then become larger. Because of this, most existing correction techniques employ schemes which depend on gradients of velocity or pressure (Ikui and Inoue 1970; Sitaram et al. 1981; Eibeck and Eaton 1985; Westphal etal. 1987).
