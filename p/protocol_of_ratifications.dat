It first analyses the constitutional constraints which have to be observed in the member states, distinguishing between ratification according to ordinary legislative procedure and according to a special procedure, the possibility to chose between a parliamentary authorisation or a referendum, the possibility of judicial review of the constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> and {{the powers of the}} Head of State. It then examines more deeply the different procedures followed for the authorisation <b>of</b> <b>ratification,</b> the referenda which took place or were foreseen and the delays in ratification, as well as the decisions of constitutional courts and the constitutional amendments adopted in view <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution for Europe.

40|$|The Pacific {{region has}} the lowest {{regional}} rate <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> international human rights treaties in the world. There is currently considerable pressure on Pacific Island states from various quarters to ratify the core human rights treaties.

This paper explores whether ratifying human rights treaties is a useful way to advance the cause of human rights in the Pacific. Part I of the paper takes a current “snapshot” <b>of</b> the <b>ratification</b> project in the Pacific by setting out the current levels <b>of</b> <b>ratification,</b> looking at the reasons for low ratification, and noting the recent calls for greater ratification. Part II sets out the key consequences for states of ratifying international human rights treaties, and then looks at the benefits and drawbacks <b>of</b> <b>ratification.</b> In light <b>of</b> this context, Part III considers strategies Pacific states might adopt in responding to the call for ratification...|$|R

50|$|In a state's legislature, the {{ratification}} method is procedurally simple - merely propose a resolution, memorial, or proclamation <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> and vote {{it up or}} down in each chamber of that state legislature. But using the convention method <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> {{is a bit more}} complicated because it is, by necessity, separate and different from a state legislature. As early as the 1930s, state lawmakers enacted laws to prepare for the possibility of Congress specifying the convention method <b>of</b> <b>ratification.</b> Many laws refer to a one-off event, with an ad-hoc convention convened solely {{for the purposes of the}} 21st amendment.
