50|$|<b>Pompano</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> are carnivorous, feeding {{primarily}} on small fish and squid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pompano</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> have a {{lifespan}} {{of three}} to four years. They are often mistaken for juvenile mahi-mahi; they are somewhat smaller than their mahi-mahi cousins, only reaching a maximum length of 127 cm TL. <b>Pompano</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> have compressed heads and dorsal fins extending {{the entire length of}} their bodies. Their backs are a brilliant blue-green, and their sides are a silvery-golden color. Mature males develop a protruding forehead, but not to the same extent as male mahi-mahi. When they are removed from the water, the fish fade to a muted green-grey upon death.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pompano</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> (Coryphaena equiselis) is {{a species}} of surface-dwelling ray-finned fish found in {{tropical}} and subtropical waters. They are {{one of only two}} members of the Coryphaenidae family, the other being the mahi-mahi or common dolphinfish.|$|E
5000|$|The mahi-mahi (...) or common {{dolphinfish}} (Coryphaena hippurus) is a surface-dwelling ray-finned fish found in off-shore temperate, tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. Also widely called dorado and dolphin, {{it is one}} of two members of the Coryphaenidae family, the other being the <b>pompano</b> <b>dolphinfish.</b> Mahi means very strong in Hawaiian.|$|E
5000|$|The common English name of dolphin causes much confusion. Additionally, {{two species}} of {{dolphinfish}} exist, the common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) and the <b>pompano</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> (Coryphaena equiselis). Both these species are commonly marketed by their Pacific name, mahi-mahi. Being fish, they {{are not related to}} dolphins. See Coryphaena for the possible etymologies of [...] "dolphinfish".|$|E
40|$|On 5. 9. 2009, a catch {{comprising}} 15 {{specimens of}} <b>pompano</b> <b>dolphinfish,</b> Coryphaena equiselis (Linnaeus, 1758) was landed at Chennai Fisheries Harbour by mechanised gillnet. The mechanised gillnets operated usually {{at a depth}} between 30 and 50 m {{at a distance of}} 30 - 40 km north of Chennai towards Andhra Pradesh. Since, trawlnets and mechanised gillnets are the main fishing gears operated off Chennai coast, fishes belonging to the family Coryphaenidae formed part of regular landings by these two gears. Normally common dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus formed regular fishery along this coast...|$|E
