50|$|U.S. State Nonresident Withholding Tax is a {{mandatory}} <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>of</b> individuals or entities {{that are not}} resident in the state. A common {{example of this is}} the taxation of oil and natural gas royalty interest revenue. In order to ensure that the state receives a portion of the revenue from oil and gas leases within the state, any payments made to an address outside of the state require that a tax be withheld and paid directly to the state.|$|R

50|$|The Democrats {{used their}} {{power in the}} state {{legislature}} to disenfranchise minorities, primarily blacks, and ensure that Democratic Party and white power would not be threatened again. They passed laws restricting voter registration. In 1900 the Democrats adopted a constitutional suffrage amendment which lengthened the residence period required before registration, and enacted both an educational qualification (to be assessed by a registrar, which meant that it could be subjectively applied) and <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> a poll <b>tax.</b> A grandfather clause exempted from the poll tax those entitled to vote on January 1, 1867.

50|$|To {{prevent this}} kind of challenge, after Democrats regained {{control of the state}} legislature, in 1900 they adopted a {{constitutional}} suffrage amendment which required <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> a poll <b>tax</b> and an educational qualification (to be assessed by a registrar, which meant that it could be subjectively applied), and lengthened the residence period required before registration. A grandfather clause exempted from the poll tax those entitled to vote on January 1, 1867, which limited exemptions to white men. These barriers to voter registration caused a dramatic drop in the number of African-American voters in the state by 1904, although they constituted one-third of the population. An estimated 75,000 black male citizens lost the vote.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Tax</b> Reform Act <b>of</b> 1986 (Act) {{replaces the}} add-on minimum tax {{with a new}} {{alternative}} minimum tax (AMT) system. Under the Act, a company's federal income tax liability is the greater <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> computed using the regular tax system (regular tax) or the tax under the AMT system. A credit (AMT credit) may be earned for tax paid on an AMT basis that is {{in excess of the}} amount <b>of</b> regular <b>tax</b> that would have otherwise been paid. With certain exceptions, the AMT credit can be carried forward indefinitely and used to reduce regular tax, but not below the AMT for that future year. The issues are: 1.

50|$|In {{a county}} {{with a high}} {{proportion}} of people of color, both Native Americans and African Americans were oppressed by the Jim Crow system established in the state after white conservative Democrats regained power following the Reconstruction era. The state legislature passed laws to raise barriers to voter registration and disfranchise minorities. In 1900 the Democrats adopted a constitutional suffrage amendment which lengthened the residence period required before registration (which worked against sharecroppers and tenant farmers), and enacted both an educational qualification (to be assessed by a registrar, who were white and applied it subjectively) and <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> a poll <b>tax</b> (difficult for poor people to raise who did not use much cash). A grandfather clause exempted from the poll tax those entitled to vote on January 1, 1867. The effect in North Carolina was the complete elimination of black and mixed-race voters from voter rolls by 1904. Contemporary accounts estimated that 75,000 black male citizens across the state lost the vote.|$|R
50|$|When Streseman reshuffled {{his cabinet}} on 6 October 1923, Luther {{took over the}} Ministry of Finance and kept that {{portfolio}} in the two cabinets led by Wilhelm Marx which followed. Luther thus {{was in charge of}} the currency reform which ended the hyperinflation and introduced a new stable Mark. By 15 October, Luther presented a plan that combined elements of a reform by economist Karl Helfferich with ideas of Luther's predecessor Rudolf Hilferding. With the help of the emergency law (Ermächtigungsgesetz) of 13 October 1923 which gave the government the power to issue decrees on financial and economic matters, the plan was implemented that same day, 15 October 1923. The restrictive monetary policy by Hjalmar Schacht at the Reichsbank helped to stabilize the currency, as did steps taken by Luther to close the budget deficit. On the revenue side, he pushed through three emergency tax hikes, brought forward due dates for <b>taxes,</b> increased <b>prepayments</b> <b>of</b> assesed <b>taxes,</b> raised the sales tax, taxed inflation gains and reorganized the financial burden sharing between Reich and Länder. On the spending side, Luther managed a drastic cut in personnel costs - by reducing the number of Reich employees by almost 25% over four months, a freeze on promotions and fixing public salaries at a level lower than that of 1913.|$|R
40|$|Contact author. 1 Although {{extensive}} {{studies have}} been done to examine the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> primary mortgages, not much has been done to analyze the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. This paper studies the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> fixed-rate home equity loans using a large loan-level sample for the period 1995 to 1998. We find that <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans is sensitive to changes in market interest rates, indicating that borrowers refinance their loans when market interest rates are lower than coupon interest rates. We also find that trends in interest rate changes {{play an important role in}} borrower prepayment decisions. When borrowers expect market interest rates to decrease further, they will wait for better opportunities to prepay their home equity loans even when the loans are already “in the money. ” Loan size and borrower creditworthiness also affect the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. However, the loan-to-value ratio, an important factor in primary mortgage prepayment, has little effect on the <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> home equity loans. This paper also documents the effect of payment delinquencies on prepayment behavior. Borrowers with either minor or major delinquencies in making monthly payments are less likely to prepay their home equity loans. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the probabilities <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> or default for Fixed Rate Mortgages (FRMs) and Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs). Using {{data from the}} period 1985 - 1992, the analysis indicates that the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> thirty year FRMs was determined primarily by house price appreciation and personal income growth and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>prepayment</b> <b>of</b> fifteen year FRMs was determined primarily by interest rate changes. ARMs were prepaid less frequently than FRMs, {{were less likely to}} be prepaid when interest rates declined and defaulted more often than FRMs. The analysis provides evidence that ARM holders are less mobile than FRM holders.
