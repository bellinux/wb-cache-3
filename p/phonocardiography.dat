He worked as SHO to Sheila Sherlock and medical registrar under Mr John McMichael at Hammersmith Hospital and The Royal Post Graduate Medical School in London. It was during this time that Barlow became interested in auscultation and <b>phonocardiography</b> which led him to investigate non-ejection clicks and late systolic murmurs. The non-ejection click had long been thought to have an origin outside the heart. During his time at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School Barlow attended the postmortem examination of a patient who was known to have a 'click'. Barlow noticed {{that the man had}} a single fibrosed mitral valve chord, he also noted no abnormality outside the heart to account for the click. Barlow, by further investigation, was able to demonstrate that the cause of this widely known but little understood problem was due to a pathological condition of the mitral valve. This discovery by Barlow was controversial at the time and was met with scepticism by the cardiological community. His first paper on the subject was declined on the grounds that his assertions were extreme. A friend and former colleague persuaded Barlow to submit a shorter version of the paper to the Maryland State Medical Journal (of which his friend was a sub-editor) where it was published under the title [...] "The Significance of Late Systolic Murmurs and Mid-Late Systolic Clicks". A second and ground-breaking paper was published in the American Heart Journal in October 1963.So significant was this paper that it {{became one of the most}} commonly cited papers in the AHJ and in 1983 was designated by the Institute for Scientific Information as a citation classic.

40|$|Abstract—Phonocardiography is {{important}} in appraisal of congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension as it reflects the duration of right ventricular systoles. The systolic murmur in patients with intra-cardiac shunt decreases as pulmonary hypertension develops and may eventually disappear completely as the pulmonary pressure reaches systemic level. <b>Phonocardiography</b> and auscultation are non-invasive, low-cost, and accurate methods to assess heart disease. In this work an objective signal processing tool to extract information from <b>phonocardiography</b> signal using Wavelet is proposed to classify the murmur as normal or abnormal. Since the feature vector is large, a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with mutation for feature selection is proposed. The extracted features improve the classification accuracy and were tested across various classifiers including Naïve Bayes, kNN, C 4. 5, and SVM...|$|E
40|$|Spectral <b>phonocardiography,</b> an {{adaptation}} of the method of sound spectrography devised at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, differs from conventional oscillographic <b>phonocardiography</b> princi-pally {{in the fact that}} frequency spectrum is displayed as well as the dimensions of time and intensity. The display of frequency spectrum is responsible for three advantages of the method: (1) Quality, or timbre, is given physical definition, (2) resolution in the time dimension is improved, and a (3) a better display of the wide dynamic range of cardiovascular sound is attained. This method can do, or can be made to do, all the ear can, and can probably emulate the performance of the ear because 1) it is not wed to a particular frequency-intensity response curve, 2) it suffers from no "psychoacoustic " impediments, 3) it provides better resolution in the time dimension, and 4) it produces permanent, quantifiable records. Discussed here are selected features of mitral valve disease, aortic valve disease, gallops, systolic clicks, and extracardiac sounds.

This system {{can serve as a}} cost-effective option to the recent developments in wireless <b>phonocardiography</b> sensors that have primarily focused on Bluetooth technology. This wireless sensor system has been designed and developed in-house using off-the-shelf components and open source software for remote and mobile applications. The small form factor (3. 75 cm ´ 5 cm ´ 1 cm), high throughput (6, 000 Hz data streaming rate), and low cost ($ 13 per unit for a 1, 000 unit batch) of this wireless sensor system make it particularly attractive for <b>phonocardiography</b> and other sensing applications. The experimental results of sensor signal analysis using several signal characterization techniques suggest that this wireless sensor system can capture both fundamental heart sounds (S 1 and S 2), and is also capable of capturing abnormal heart sounds (S 3 and S 4) and heart murmurs without aliasing. The results of a denoising application using Wavelet Transform show that the undesirable noises of sensor signals in the surrounding environment can be reduced dramatically.

Can this technic be of practical help in the diagnosis of small or complicated ventricular septal defects? Is a ventricular septal 1 defect ever silent? What mechanisiims are responsible for the diastolic mlurmlurs in ven-tricular septal defect? In an attempt to answer these problemus, intracardiac phonocar-diograms have been studied in 47 cases. THE most useful clinical sign of ventrieu-lar septal defect is a loud, harsh, pan-systolic murmur with maximal intensity over the midprecordium (Roger murmur). ' This murmur is often accompanied by a mitral diastolic rumble, and by an early diastolic murmur at the base or along the left sternal border of uncertain origin. 2 This typical auscultatory picture nmay be greatly altered when ventricular septal defect is associated with high pulmonary vascuLlar resistance, pul-monary stenosis, overriding aorta, or aortic insufficiency. The role of the septal defect in the production of sounds in these condi-tions, cannot be established by simple auscul-tation or ordinary chest <b>phonocardiography.</b> Previous experience has demonstrated that intracardiae <b>phonocardiography</b> 3 - provides precise localization of the source of cardio-vascular sound.

In this paper, we demonstrate {{the development of}} a new type of stethoscope using laser technology to visualize the heart beat signal. This heartbeat detection technique could overcome the limitation of the acoustic stethoscope brought by the poor ability of human ears to hear low frequency heart sounds. This is important, as valuable information from sub-audio sounds is present at frequencies below the human hearing range. Moreover, the diagnosis accuracy of the acoustic stethoscope is also very sensitive to noise from the immediate environment. In this laser-based stethoscope, the heartbeat signal is correlated to the optical spot of a laser beam reflected from a thin mirror attached to the patient’s chest skin. The motion of the mirror with the chest skin is generated by heartbeat and breathing. A linear optical sensor is applied to detect and record the motion of the optical spot, from which the heart sound signal in time-domain is extracted. The heart sound signal is subsequently transformed to frequency domain through digital signal processing. Both time domain and frequency-domain signals are analyzed in order to classify different types of heart murmurs. A digital filter is designed to remove other activities associated with the movement of chest skin, such as respiration. We developed the prototype of the system and tested the prototype on a dummy human body with various heartbeat patterns and breathing. We compared the laser generated results with the concurrent testing results from <b>phonocardiography.</b> Results reveal that the laser based heart sound detection approach has the advantage over the <b>phonocardiography</b> for low frequency sounds (≤ 50 Hz) while the <b>phonocardiography</b> is more sensitive to higher frequency sounds ≥ 200 Hz) ...|$|E
40|$|Fetal {{heart rate}} (FHR) {{measurement}} {{is one of}} the most important approaches used for monitoring the cardiac health status of fetal human beings. The routine clinical FHR measurements are usually carried out by means of ultrasound (US) cardiotocography; in clinical practice, this signal is combined with that related to correspondent uterine contractions. Although frequent and/or long-term FHR monitoring is recommendable, some problems are associated with the US device employment. An alternative to US monitors is offered by <b>phonocardiography,</b> a passive and fully non-invasive acoustic recording (no energy is transmitted to the fetus) of fetal heart sounds [1]. By recognising the heart sounds associate to each fetal heart beat is possible to reconstruct the FHR signal. There is no limitation in the duration of monitoring; in addition, this approach gives also the possibility to diagnose abnormal heart activity like heart murmur, extrasystoles and other arrhythmias. Unfortunately, the acoustic signal recorded on the maternal abdominal surface is faint and heavily loaded by noise, thus the determination of the FHR raises serious signal processing issues [2].
