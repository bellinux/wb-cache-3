5000|$|From 1952 to 1964, Rainier came {{packaged}} {{in a series}} of decorative beer cans known as the Rainier Jubilee Series. First in the series were a set of Christmas cans marketed in late 1952 and again in late 1953; these cans are rare and highly collectible today. The Christmas cans proved such a success that Rainier's use of decorative Jubilee Series cans continued for over a decade, with thousands of different designs. Most of these are not as rare and collectible as the Christmas cans, but the [...] "reindeer" [...] cans (which were sold only in Alaska), and the first <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> Jubilee <b>cans</b> (made only {{in the last couple of}} years of the Jubilee Series) are also considered rare.|$|R

50|$|An {{electronic}} <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> {{is derived}} from paper <b>pull</b> <b>tabs.</b> The first electronic <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> patent {{appears to have been}} filed in November 1990, US5042809. The electronic game closely resembled <b>pull</b> <b>tabs</b> in that when new, there are a fixed and preset quantity of chances among which are a fixed quantity of winning chances of a predetermined prize value. Furthermore, it brings the unique features of allowing players to view the quantity of chances for each given prize value in each deal, as well as other <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> features common to <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> operations in Minnesota, Virginia, North Dakota and other jurisdictions.|$|R

5000|$|There {{have been}} several {{renditions}} of electronic <b>pull</b> <b>tabs</b> since 1990. The latest rendition was that authorized in Minnesota in the 2012 legislative session. These devices are available for use by state licensed charitable organizations. This version of an electronic <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> uses a hand-held device, similar to a tablet computer, with a touch screen interface. All such devices are subject to control and monitoring from a central computer. Each device must have access {{to one or more}} finite sets of chances not to exceed a maximum number per set or [...] "deal" [...] as they are called in <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> lingo. Sizes of the sets are under jurisdictional control and vary between maximums of 7,500 to 25,000. Among the chances are a predetermined quantity of winning and losing chances. Furthermore, the legislature stated that <b>pull</b> <b>tab</b> devices have [...] "no spinning reels or other representations that mimic a video slot machine." [...] The Minnesota statute states an electronic pull-tab game means a pull-tab game containing [...] "(a) facsimiles of pull-tab tickets that are played on an electronic pull-tab device." [...] One value of such systems is that they not only are much more secure than paper based systems, but afford an opportunity to present games that fall within pull-tab definitions, yet have an enhanced presentation and are more suited to the desires of an electronically oriented public. Innovative manufacturers of such gaming systems expand the entertainment value of the gaming experience through the introduction of new game presentation styles.|$|R

50|$|The key {{attributes}} that make something a <b>pull</b> <b>tab,</b> electronic or paper, is the finite probability basis {{of having a}} predetermined quantity of chances among which there are a predetermined quantity of winners that pay a fixed and predetermined value of prize. Redemption of one losing chance actually does mean one chance closer to a winner. This {{is not so much}} the case with slots that operate on near-continuum probability premises. With a slot, each event is a separate activity without bearing on the next outcome and without having been influenced from past events, very different from <b>pull</b> <b>tabs.</b> Finite vs. continuum probability foundations make them different no matter which symbols are used or how those symbols are displayed: rotating, flash sequencing, revolving, etc.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Pull</b> <b>tab</b> {{games are}} quite unique among wagering games in that each game, when new, has a {{predetermined}} quantity of tickets/chances, which {{can range from}} 5,000 to 50,000 total, among which are a predetermined and fixed quantity of winning chances each of which rewards a predetermined prize value.|$|R

The concave surface forces the tops together to battle. The outcome is somewhat indeterminate, but there is a slight element of skill. Pegs in holes {{on the rim of the}} arena mark victories. The first to win ten battles wins the game.|$|R
