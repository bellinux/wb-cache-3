40|$|Honeycomb {{structures}} {{are often used}} because they are light in weight, yet able to bear large pressure loads. Because weight is such a major consideration in the aerospace industry, honeycomb is used in many non-load bearing structures such as control surfaces, access doors, floors, and speed brakes. As may be expected in a complicated structure, there are many possibilities for defects or damage to be induced into these parts, both during the fabrication process and while the part is in service. The presence of these defects necessitate that honeycomb structures be inspected. Film radiography is often used as the <b>primary</b> <b>inspection</b> technique for honeycomb. Alternatively, real time imaging is a filmless radiographic inspection technique which has speed and arbitrary orientation of the sample as its primary advantage. This technique has not been widely used, primarily because of poor image quality. The first point is poor spatial resolution, {{and the second is}} poor contrast sensitivity, as compared to film. When a microfocus x-ray source is used in conjunction with a real time system, the result is a marked improvement of the image resolution.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{decision}} tree model for evaluation {{of the next generation}} radiation portal technology (Advanced Spectroscopic Portals or ASPs) to scan containers entering the United States non-intrusively against nuclear or radiological weapons. Advanced Spectroscopic Portals are compared against the current designs of portal monitors (plastic scintillators or PVTs). We consider five alternative deployment strategies: 1) Exclusive deployment of ASPs replacing all the PVTs currently deployed at U. S. ports of entry, 2) Sequential deployment of ASPs with PVTs installing ASPs in all secondary and some <b>primary</b> <b>inspections</b> areas, 3) Sequential deployment of ASPs with PVTs installing APs in only secondary inspections areas, 4) Exclusive deployment of PVTs, 5) Stop deployment of new portal monitors and continue inspections with the current capacity. The baseline solution recommends a hybrid strategy that supports the deployment of new designs of portal monitors for secondary inspections and current designs of portal through ports of entry, the probability of successful detonation, detection probabilities and the extra deterrence that each alternative may provide. We also illustrate that the list of most significant parameters depends heavily on the dollar equivalent of overall consequences and the probability of attack attempt. For low probability and low consequence scenarios, false alarm related parameters are found to have more significance. Our extensive exploratory analysis shows that for most parametric combinations, continued deployment of portal monitors is recommended. Exclusive deployment of ASPs is optimal under high risk scenarios. However, we also show that if ASPs fail to improve detection capability, then extra benefits they offer in reducing false alarms may not justify their mass deployment...|$|R

40|$|Timber {{railroad}} bridges {{have been}} exposed to increasingly large axle loadings accompanied by a steady increase in the amount of railcar traffic over the past 50 years. In addition to mechanical loading, there exists a number of environmental conditions that can deteriorate the timber in these bridges: e. g. insects and decay organisms. The <b>primary</b> <b>inspection</b> method is conducted on a bridge by bridge basis and involves visually examining individual components of the bridge and assessing the damage. This research examines an automated impairment detection system positioned on a railcar capable of traversing multiple bridges along a track to aid in determining critical bridges that need to be inspected. The technology and techniques presented in this dissertation are envisioned as a potential enhancement to current visual evaluation methods by providing system-wide trending data for human decision makers. The objective of the research is to develop technology that will autonomously detect structural impairments in timber railroad bridges using data gathered from rail vehicles that cross the bridges. This was accomplished by recording the behavior of a bridge and the motion of a railcar passing over bridge spans. Artificial neural networks, a type of pattern recognition technology, were used to determine relationships between the bridge and vehicle behaviors. The results of a finite element analysis were utilized to train the neural networks to recognize the patterns associated with the bridge and railcar motions. Five different impairment conditions, or simulated damage scenarios, were developed for the training process. This allowed the networks to recognize the patterns correlating the railcar and bridge data streams. Once the artificial neural networks were successfully trained, new vehicle motions from a field test were presented to the network and the corresponding bridge behavior was predicted. The neural networks were accurate in predicting the maximum chord deflection to within 0. 1 inches in 72 % tested chords with improved accuracy at faster speeds...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 46) The Automated Regulator Test Machine (ARTM) is {{an electronic}} test machine {{developed for the}} Southern California Gas Company to monitor the performance of self-operated diaphragm-type natural gas service regulators. The ARTM was initially designed to serve in a capacity {{similar to that of}} an existing pneumatic system and was incorporated into Southern California Gas Company quality control procedures in 1989. Up until 1994, the ARTM was the <b>primary</b> <b>inspection</b> apparatus for all standard service regulators delivering 8 inches water column (w. c.) pressure. Problems were later encountered with data entry and the existing Honeywell controller. These issues were caused by increasing digits in regulator purchase order numbers and system memory failure evident in the existing controller setup. Other problems, related to system piping, inoperable solenoid valves, and noticeable pressure losses delayed the initial repairs greatly. The objective of this project is to resolve these problems by introducing an entirely new programmable controller, human-machine interface, and software program that will allow the ARTM to perform its function seamlessly and efficiently. The ARTM system consists of various solenoid control valves, differential pressure switches, control piping, ram operators, pressure transmitters, an electronic mass flow meter, and a PC workstation. The goal is to incorporate existing components where possible, perform a complete functionality check, and finally, implement the newly installed software and hardware to perform a series of pressure regulator tests in sequential fashion. In addition to the software and hardware integration, overall system improvements are presented. These include various upgrades in system components, including the installation of new pressure transmitters, new solenoid control valves, a new volume bottle accumulator, and the results of a comprehensive leak assessment to eliminate pressure losses in the ARTM system. The SCADAPack 32 installation, TelePACE Ladder Logic programming, and system improvements presented are then put to the test by a series of validation tests. The regulator performance results of the ARTM are compared to those obtained by American Meter, a well known pressure regulator manufacturing company, and to the pneumatic regulator test machine (PRTM). Finally, a conclusion is presented based on the validation tests, overall perfomlance of the AR TM, and a net time savings assessment related to quality control test procedures...|$|E
