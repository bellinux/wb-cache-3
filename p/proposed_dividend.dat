50|$|After {{railways}} {{had been}} operating in England {{for a few}} years, local businesspeople decided to build a railway line along the Nürnberg-Fürth road. On 14 May 1833 they founded the Gesellschaft zur Errichtung einer Eisenbahn mit Dampffahrt zwischen Nürnberg und Fürth ("company {{for the establishment of}} a steam railway between Nuremberg and Fürth") to develop the railway. Within six months the two main instigators from Nuremberg, the merchant and market chief, George Zacharias Platner, and the head of the poly-technical school, Johannes Scharrer, had successfully raised the planned share capital of 132,000 guilders. The <b>proposed</b> <b>dividend</b> of 12% was met with skepticism, although the company did, in fact, pay a dividend of 20% in 1836.|$|E

While earlier research found that the dividend premium is not driven by traditional clienteles derived from market imperfections such as taxes, transaction costs, or institutional investment constraints, we find empirical evidence that demographic clienteles are {{an important source of}} the time-varying demand for dividend payers. In particular, we find that, as consistent with the behavioural life-cycle theory and the marginal opinion theory of stock price, the dividend premium is positively driven by demographic clientele variation represented by changes in the proportion of the older population.

The tax {{world as}} {{we knew it was}} turned upside down on 13 September 2007 when the Supreme Court of Appeal (“SCA”) {{announced}} its decision to deem the right to use an interest-free loan as an amount that accrued to the taxpayers in the case Commissioner for South African Revenue Service v Brummeria Renaissance (Pty) Ltd and others 69 SATC 205. The findings of SCA brought about a “great deal of consternation in the business world” (Loubser, 2007 : 20). Due to the controversy {{as a result of this}} case, SARS drafted an Interpretation Note that illustrates the reasoning and tax treatment of an interest-free loan. On 30 June 2010, Interpretation Note No 58 was finally issued by SARS, providing guidance with regard to “an amount” that “accrues” to a taxpayer for the purposes of the gross income definition. This Interpretation Note will have a significant impact on a number of taxpayers. The purpose of this study is to understand the nature of an interest-free loan and identify its tax implications. The methodology followed in this study will be that of qualitative research. This will be conducted through analyzing the nature of a loan, specifically an interest-free loan, the gross income definition, including the value and timing of such amount, and whether a deduction may be claimed in respect of an interest-free loan.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{integration of}} global markets continuously generates influences, challenging traditional corporate governance models. Ownership concentration {{is one of}} the most fundamental features of corporate governance, and is expected to determine shareholders’ ability to monitor the corporation's management to ensure that the company is run in the best interest of its financiers. Thus, depending on the degree of ownership concentration, the investor is expected to have a varying need of receiving frequent returns on investment. In light of principal-agent theory, the objective of this paper is to examine ownership concentration and its <b>proposed</b> effect on <b>dividend</b> payouts. By investigating approximately 300 companies listed on the UK and Swedish stock exchanges, this paper firstly seeks to establish whether there are significant difference in ownership concentration between the Nordic and Anglo-Saxon corporate governance models. The results find that traditional differences in ownership concentration persist, yet observe a tentatively increasing similarity in the average stakes held by the ten and five largest shareholders respectively. Secondly, the results of a multiple regression reveal a negative relationship between ownership concentration and dividend payouts, supporting the explanation provided by principal-agent theory. The implications thus suggest agency problems to be relatively more prevalent in Anglo-Saxon countries than in the Nordic equivalent, reinforcing previous research findings in the area...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine whether or not the {{dividend}} signaling theory holds in the Spanish market. Concretely, it aims to investigate whether the dividend changes that Spanish public firms make convey any information about the future earnings of the company. To that end, the relation between dividend increases and decreases with future earnings changes is analysed separately. The impact of dividend changes on future earnings should be positive as <b>proposed</b> by the <b>dividend</b> signaling hypothesis. A linear model is used to study this relation over a sample of 158 Spanish public companies during a ten years period of time, from January 2004 to December 2013. The results reveal that in the case of Spain, the company’s dividend changes do affect future earnings changes. However, the results are not very conclusive. The findings support a positive relationship between dividend decreases and future earnings in changes. Nonetheless, a negative relation is found for the dividend increases despite it is not very significant. This last finding is the contrary to the expectation. Furthermore, the future earnings reaction to the dividend changes is examined year by year. It can be concluded that there is a change since 2008. I conjecture that this is due to the economic and financial crisis that Spain was experiencing. However, those results are not very reliable as most of them are not empirically significant. Therefore, there is a need to conduct further studies in this field...|$|R
40|$|The {{dividend}} {{policy and the}} distribution of cash dividend can be of interest to the investors from many angles. Consequently, many theories have been built on the relevance of {{dividend policy}} and there are several theories <b>proposing</b> that <b>dividends</b> increase shareholder value. However, the most famous theory on dividend policy might be Miller and Modigliani's dividend irrelevance theory which implies that the dividend policy does not affect shareholder value. Although investors are concerned with shareholder value they are also concerned with achieving the highest possible return with the lowest volatility (risk). As many studies have focused on the dividend policy, especially dividend yield or the dividend payout ratio, and its relation with stock price movement we felt that {{there was a lack of}} information regarding the relation between return volatility and cash dividends. This resulted in the following research question: Does a change in cash dividend affect stock return volatility on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm? Answering this research question is the main purpose of the research. Additionally, the relationship between changes in cash dividend and return volatility will be compared in the different size segments that are to be found on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. The study is quantitative with a deductive approach where historical data ranging from 2006 - 2012 has been gathered. Two measures of return volatility has been used, beta and standard deviation of return. Statistical tests have been conducted in an approach to answer the research question, mainly correlation tests and logistic regression analysis. No correlation between changes in cash dividend and changes in beta, nor changes in standard deviation were found. The same results were found when examining small, mid and large cap individually. In the logistic regression analysis no evidence was found that changes in dividend could explain changes in return volatility. Contrary to changes in dividend, the results indicate that the size of the company can explain changes in return volatility. Specifically, large cap companies explain increases in return volatility better than companies in the small cap segment. Therefore, the research question is concluded with no, a change in cash dividend does not affect stock return volatility. The findings could also be argued to be in support of the dividend irrelevance theory. Furthermore, the conclusion implies that investors need not regard the dividend policy when diversifying their portfolios. Additionally, managers need not be worried that a change in dividend policy should affect return volatility...|$|R

Hence, Turkish corporations have also been adopting stable dividend policies and using cash dividends as a signalling mechanism since 2003, with the implementation of severe economic and structural reforms. Research evidence reveals that the ISE-listed firms have highly concentrated ownership structures; mostly owned by families followed by foreign investors, whereas other blockholders such as domestic financial institutions and the state, show relatively lower shareholdings. Moreover, evidence implies that the implementation of various major economic and structural reforms in cooperation with the IMF and the EU directives and best-practice international standards, which include the publication of the Capital Market Board (CMB) of Turkey’s Corporate Governance Principles in line with the World Bank and the OECD, starting with the fiscal year 2003, have resulted in significant improvements for the ISE-listed firms corporate governance, transparency and disclosure practices and better shareholder protection. Investors, in general, therefore, have preference for the potential long-run growth opportunity for the stocks they hold in the ISE, since Turkey is a fast-growing market, rather than requiring cash dividends as a monitoring mechanism or to control agency problems. This thesis extends empirical research on dividend policy into an emerging market, which not only passed laws for financial liberalisation, but implemented serious reforms to integrate with world markets by using a large panel dataset from Turkey. Although the implementation of major reforms and regulatory changes may produce different results in different emerging markets, it is believed that this thesis can be a valuable benchmark for further longitudinal and cross-country research on this respect of the dividend puzzle...|$|R
40|$|This article {{constitutes}} a 20 -year update to a previous publication (Pelton, 1994), {{which showed that}} there is overwhelming evidence that poverty and low income are strongly related to child abuse and neglect. Subsequent evidence shows that the relationship continues to be strong. In addition, there is further evidence since the 1994 publication that this relation is not substantially due to class bias.

There is also further evidence that decreases in child maltreatment follow increases in material supports, and that job loss bears a complex relationship to child maltreatment. Findings pertaining to racial bias within the child welfare system continue to be mixed, but leave no doubt that racial disproportionalities within the system are overwhelmingly related to racial disproportionalities in the poverty population. There is continuing evidence that children placed in foster care are predominantly from impoverished families, and that changes in the level of material supports are related to risk of placement. It is suggested that {{the fact that there are}} nearly one million children in out-of-home placement (foster care and child-welfare involved adoption, combined) is indicative of the continuing dysfunction of the child welfare system, and that the differential response paradigm has not altered this dysfunction.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{three different}} economic {{issues have been}} analyzed. The first issue is whether monetary policy rules can improve forecasting accuracy of inflation. The second is whether the preference of a central bank is symmetry or not. The last issue is whether the behavior of aggregate dividends is asymmetry. Each issue is considered in Chapter II, III and IV, respectively. The linkage between monetary policy rules and the prediction of inflation is explored in Chapter II. Our analysis finds that the prediction performance of the term structure model hinges on monetary policy rules, which involve the manipulation of the federal funds rate {{in response to the}} change in the price level. As the Fed's reaction to inflation becomes stronger, the predictive information contained in the term structure becomes weaker. Using the long-run Taylor rule, a new assessment of the prediction performance regarding future change in inflation is provided. The empirical results indicate that the long-run Taylor rule improves forecasting accuracy. In chapter III, the asymmetric preferences of the central bank of Korea are examined under New Keynesian sticky prices forward-looking economy framework. To this end, this chapter adopts the central bank's objective functional form as a linear-exponential function instead of the standard quadratic function. The monetary policy reaction function is derived and then asymmetric preference parameters are estimated during the inflation targeting period: 1998 : 9 - 2005 : 12. The empirical evidence supports that while the objective of output stability is symmetry, but the objective of price stability is not symmetry. Specifically, it appears that the central bank of Korea aggressively responds to positive inflation gaps compared to negative inflation gaps. Chapter IV examines the nonlinear dividend behavior of the aggregate stock market. We <b>propose</b> a nonlinear <b>dividend</b> model that assumes managers minimize the regime dependent adjustment costs associated with being away from their target dividend payout. By using the threshold vector error correction model, we find significant evidence of a threshold effect in aggregate dividends of S&P 500 Index in quarterly data when real stock prices are used for the target. We also find that when dividends are relatively higher than target, the adjustment cost of dividends is much smaller than that when they are lower...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the market’s reaction to announcements of dividend increases. In particular, it considers {{the factors that}} affect the magnitude of abnormal returns during the days that surround announcements of dividend increases. The objective is to find whether the market reaction to dividend increases has weakened {{with the passage of}} time and whether market conditions affect the reaction. Eventually, this study is expected to reveal whether dividends continue to be important to investors. This research is motivated by the findings of Fama and French (2001). They suggest that since 1978 firms have had a declining propensity to pay <b>dividends.</b> They <b>propose</b> that <b>dividends</b> are declining as a result of the ease by which investors can make homemade dividends through selling small portions of their holdings. They argue that recent market developments, particularly the introduction of negotiated commissions and discount brokers, have made homemade dividends easier and less costly. Their results may suggest that investors are now less interested to receive dividends than in the past. One objective of this study is to examine whether investor’s preferences regarding dividend payments have changed over time. This is accomplished by measuring the abnormal returns following announcements of dividend increases. Benartzi, Michaely, and Thaler (1997) suggest that the reaction of the market to dividend increases is an acceptable method of determining the value of dividends to investors. In addition, this study explores the theoretical factors that may affect dividend valuation. Previous studies, such as Allen, Bernardo and Welch (2000), suggest that the existence of debt holders and institutional investors reduce the potential for agency costs as these stakeholders monitor managers. In contrast, Jensen (1986) suggests that high cash flows make it easier for managers to spend on perquisites and empire building. Thus, the potential for agency costs increases. Therefore, paying dividends when cash flows are high reduces the likelihood of agency costs. At the same time, Benartzi, Michaely and Thaler (1997) suggest that increasing dividends following higher cash flows signals management’s expectation that future performance warrants a dividend increase. Consequently, the agency and signaling theories suggest that investors may react positively to dividend increases when cash flows are high. Several observations are obtained from this study. First, investor reaction to dividend increases seems to have weakened over time. Second, the reaction is different when the increase is announced in a bear market rather than in a bull market. Third, the market reaction to dividend increases is less in firms that are more liquid. This finding may be interpreted as evidence that dividends are valued less in more liquid firms because it is easier for the investors of these firms to make homemade dividends. Fourth, the magnitude of the reaction is directly related to the increase in trading volume following the announcement. Surprisingly, the evidence disputes the predictions of the agency cost theory of dividends. This theory states that dividends are valued because they decrease the amount of cash available to management, which in turn decreases the potential for waste. Given this theory, it is expected that firms with high debt loads already have agency costs decreased so the market reaction to their dividend increases would be less than other firms while firms with high free cash flows would have a greater market reaction to their dividend increases because of the large potential for waste on management’s part. Instead, the results suggest that firms with high debt loads experience positive market reaction following dividend increases while firms with large free cash flows experience negative reactions. It seems that the signaling theory of dividends is contributing heavily to this result. Future research should be directed to investigate the possibility that share repurchases may be replacing dividends as a way to redistribute surplus cash to shareholders. In addition, future studies may focus on the signaling theory of dividends as useful tool to explain the dividend policies of corporations...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>proposed</b> new <b>Dividends</b> Tax will {{have a significant impact}} on financial institutions such as Collective Investment Schemes, Linked Investment Service Providers and Long-term Insurers. The reason for this is that South African listed companies declaring local dividends will not necessarily have all the details of and know the identity of their shareholders. These financial institutions may be regarded as regulated intermediaries in terms of the new Dividends Tax legislation and therefore may have the responsibility of withholding the Dividends Tax from dividends received on behalf of their clients, who may in most cases be the beneficial owners of the underlying equity shares. The motivating factor for the research is the fact that there does not appear to be any guidance on the impact of the new Dividends Tax on financial institutions, since the Dividends Tax is new legislation. The research problem addressed in this thesis is how the systems and processes of a financial institution will be affected by the implementation of the new Dividends Tax. The research took the form of a case study designed to investigate the impact of the Dividends Tax on the financial institution at which the researcher is employed. The data required for the research was collected by means of a study of the relevant legislation enacted in connection with the topic, journal articles in financial/tax journals, as well as articles published in the media. The systems and processes presently in place, as well as the changes to these systems that will be needed to accommodate the new dividend tax were ascertained by means of in-depth interviews with relevant staff at the financial institution. In addition, the researcher also applied her personal knowledge of the business of the financial institution at which she works to the problem. As a result of the research it was determined that a Collective Investment Scheme, Linked Investment Service Provider and Long-Term Insurer will all be regarded as regulated intermediaries for the purposes of the new dividend withholding tax. This means that these financial institutions will be required to withhold Dividends Tax from dividends paid to their clients and pay this Dividends Tax so withheld to SARS. Furthermore, the findings of the research confirmed that the new Dividends Tax will {{have a significant impact on}} the client services department in areas such as notifying clients, training of client service staff, handling of declaration of exemption forms received from clients, amending client statements and tax certificates (to cater for the new Dividends Tax). In addition to this, it was ascertained that significant systems development will be required by these financial institutions in order to comply with the new Dividends Tax legislation. This would include the development of data input fields to enable users to capture the relevant information required and development of the system to enable it to flag local dividends received to which the Dividends Tax applies. The system would also need to cater for Secondary Tax on Companies credits as well as foreign tax rebates. The system should also be able to calculate the amount of Dividends Tax to withhold per dividend received by a client, as well as be able to handle the payment of the Dividends Tax to SARS and the refund to clients of Dividends Tax over deducted. It is essential that systems are able to flag the correct date of payment of the dividend so that the Dividends Tax can be paid over timeously to SARS in order to avoid interest and penalties being levied. To summarise, the new Dividends Tax has a significant impact on these financial institutions in areas such as client services, administration and system development...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. in the Faculty of Business AdministrationWhen {{stock option}} implied volatilities are {{calculated}} using the Black and Scholes [73] model, even considering the adjustment for <b>dividends</b> <b>proposed</b> by Black [75], {{there are different}} figures for the same underlying assets with different exercise prices and/or different maturities. Such a phenomenon, which contradicts {{one of the main}} assumptions of the model thathere is only one "future·volatility" for the time to expiration, is often used in the literature as a source for an efficiency hypothesis test. The literature on implied volatility estimators has developed from using a siinple at-the­ money volatility to incorporatig all of the available market information. The uses of implied volatility estimators depend on the purpose of the studies analysed. While some estimators have been used for time series analysis (Latane and Rendleman'[76], Trippi [77], Chiras and Manaster [78], Be kers [81], Whaley [82], Day and Lewis [88]), others have been used in option pricing only(MacBeth and Mervine [79] or Finucane [89 a]). Authors have suggested different implied volatility estimators to handle apparently contradicting information. These different theoretical estimators lead to significantly different empirical estimates. The analysis of the database of implied volatilities resulted in two particular pheomena:·a significant presence of outliers and a "smile" shape for implied volatilites. The outliers were excluded from the principal database and analysed as a separate case. The number of outliers seemed to increase as the tiine to maturity decreased (maturity effects) and the market index increased (market effects). Also, the ggregate number of outliers changed according to the moneyness degree (moneyness effect). There was no apparent relation between these variables and changes in the open interest of these outliers. The main part of the thesis studied the effectiveness of implied volatility estimators inforecasting future volatilities. Several historical, implied and future volatility estimators were calculated. Then they were compared and significant differences were found among them. Implied volatility estimators were divided into three groups based on their method of calculation. It was expected a priori that the group that takes into account the exercise price effect, in particular the Finucane [89 a] and [89 b] estimator, would have the lowest mean absolute errors. Is implied volatility a good predictor of future volatility? Since there are several methods for calculating implied volatility, each method is examined in attempting to answer this essential question. Future volatility seems to be related to both historical and implied volatility. Models that embody both historical and implied are successful in explaining future volatility. However, independence of the variables and autocorrelation are important weaknesses of such regression model. The Cochrane-Orcutt procedure was used to overcome the autocorrelation problem; however, the revised figures often result in conflicting conclusions. In particular, historical volatility seems to be more important than implied volatility in predicting / explaining future volatility, after correcting for autocorrelation. This conclusion depends on·the estimators used to calculate both historical and implied volatility. Also, forecasting errors using impiied volatilities seem to be related to tline to maturity. Implied volatility is empirically related to historical volatility (positively correlated), time to maturity (negatively correlated) and the underlying stock price returns (negatively correlated). Since different volatility estimators often lead to different conclusions regarding forecasting future volatility, some short period sample tests were devised to test for ·option market inefficiency. Although there are differences in the efficiency of using different implied volatility estimators for option market transactions, these differences were not large enough to dramatically change the general support of market efficiency after-introducing transaction costs. However, in some ·cases the Finucane [89 a] and [89 b] estimator shows. that positive·abnormal returns could be obtained even after considering transaction costs. In a final chapter, the effect of the "smile" in simple and sophisticate hedging strategies was examined. The results did not changafter introducing transaction costs. Simple delta hedging strategies seem to outperform more sophisticated strategies. Delta hedging strategies for at-the-money series result in the most effective outcome. But for more complex strategies, the best outcome is obtained by the simultaneous use of near-in and out­ of-the-money series...|$|R
