5|$|The Via Panisperna boys {{also noticed}} some unexplained effects. The {{experiment}} {{seemed to work}} better on a wooden table than a marble table top. Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> was effective at slowing neutrons, {{so he decided to}} try that. When neutrons were passed through <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax,</b> they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin. Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the less collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones. He developed a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi age equation.|$|E

By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application {{of the discovery of}} slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax,</b> and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E
40|$|Thermophysical {{properties}} of phase change materials (PCM) are {{of utmost importance}} in latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) applications. Therefore, an experimental study is conducted {{in order to determine}} thermophysical {{properties of}} five technical grade <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> produced by major Croatian oil company, INA d. d. Rijeka. The temperatures and enthalpies of melting and solidification (latent heat capacity) and specific heat capacities of solid and liquid <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal diffusivity of <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> was determined utilizing transient method. The importance of eliminating phase transformation interferences to thermophysical properties determination is addressed. The densities and the coefficient of thermal expansion were measured using Archimedes methods. A self-adopted simple and inexpensive laboratory procedure for the determination of liquid density as a temperature function is presented. Finally, the thermal conductivities have been calculated from measured densities, heat capacities and diffusivities. Based on results obtained, the investigated <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> were evaluated in regard to their applicability as PCM for LHTES...|$|R

5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax</b> using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E

40|$|Surfaces {{submerged}} in marine environments rapidly get colonized by marine organisms, {{a process known}} as biofouling. Fouling costs maritime industries billions of dollars annually. The most common methods of combating marine biofouling are toxin containing antifouling coatings which often have detrimental non-target environmental effects. These effects and proposed bans on harmful substances in antifouling coatings, mandates development of more environmentally friendly antifouling technologies. Of these, foul-release coatings, which minimize attachment and adhesion of fouling organisms (rather than killing them) are promising alternatives. Here I explored the utility of petroleum waxes as novel antifouling/foul-release coatings. I first investigated the responses of propagules (larvae or spores) of six common fouling organisms to wax coatings in the laboratory. A wide variation in the response of these different organisms, and in the different types of response (settlement, adhesion, etc.) by the same organism, was observed, but the most inhibitory coatings were those made from microcrystalline wax and silicone oil. However, in field trials in Sydney Harbour, <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> had the strongest antifouling performance, with activity up to one year (the trial duration). These waxes also had strong foul-release effects, with fouling that did attach mostly removed by a low pressure water jet. Composition of fouling communities on <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> differed significantly from other waxes or controls, with little or no hard fouling organisms (barnacles, bivalves) on paraffin. The mechanisms of antifouling and foul-release actions of <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> appear to be due to changes in surface properties. The surfaces of the <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> changed noticeably after 4 - 8 weeks immersion in the sea or in seawater aquaria. Antibiotic treatments showed that this change in surface appearance was due to biological (microbial) activity. Bacteria appear to remove the amorphous phase {{from the surface of the}} <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes,</b> revealing an underlying crystalline phase, which is less affected by bacterial action. I suggest that these crystals form a microstructured ?bed of nails? of crystals of varying shapes and sizes which inhibit settlement and reduce adhesion strength of those organisms which do settle...|$|R

The paraffin-based blends filled with LiAlH 4 were found to be stable when exposed to air.

Thermal properties were studied using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) leading to obtain data about the transitions typical of <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> (solid/solid and solid/liquid) and also about the thermal decomposition of the added energetic filler. A manufacturing technique for the production of homogeneous blends strengthened with SEBS-MA and filled with LAH is described.

The behavior of <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> blended with the selected SEBS-MA thermoplastic elastomer and filled with LAH, is discussed...|$|R
25|$|Another area of {{research}} focuses on the prevention of thermal runaway in batteries. The researchers coated the anode or separator layer of the battery with microspheres sensitive to heat.

25|$|Regarding the {{organization}} of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The example given, <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax,</b> {{is a member of}} a family of hydrocarbon molecules of differing chain lengths, with high-density polyethylene at the long-chain end of the series. High-density polyethylene can be a strong material: when the hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, the resulting fibers rival the strength of steel. The covalent bonds in this material form extended structures, but do not form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from Cross-linked polyethylene, to rigid thermosetting resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids, to vitreous carbon, diamond-like carbons, and ultimately to diamond itself. As this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and network covalent solids.|$|E
25|$|Although {{chewing gum}} {{can be traced}} back to civilizations around the world, the {{modernization}} and commercialization of this product mainly took place in the United States. The American Indians chewed resin made from the sap of spruce trees. The New England settlers picked up this practice, and in 1848, John B.

In this way, the industrializing West, having forgotten about tree gums, rediscovered chewing gum through the First Americans. Around 1850 a gum made from <b>paraffin</b> <b>wax,</b> which is a petroleum product, was developed and soon exceeded the spruce gum in popularity. To sweeten these early gums the chewer would often make use of a plate of powdered sugar, which they would repeatedly dip the gum into to maintain sweetness.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the heat {{transfer}} associated with a phase change process is much higher than sensible enthalpy change even in forced convection. In particular, the vaporization process has been widely studied because it exploits the highest heat transfer coefficient; this heat transfer mechanism is used in both passive (i. e. heat pipes) and active (i. e. refrigerating machines) cooling devices. However, the solid-liquid phase change process is another interesting possibility to reject even high heat loads, especially when they are intermittent. The term Phase Change Materials (PCMs) commonly refers to those materials, which use the solid-liquid phase change process to adsorb and then release heat loads [1]. The present work aims at investigating the new challenging use of oxide (TiO 2, Al 2 O 3, etc.) nanoparticles to enhance the thermal properties: thermal conductivity, specific heat, and latent heat of pure <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> to obtain a new class of PCMs, the so-called nano-PCMs. The nano-PCMs were obtained by seeding different amounts of oxide nanoparticles in <b>paraffin</b> <b>waxes</b> with melting temperature ranging between 20 °C and 70 °C. The thermophysical properties were then measured to understand the effects of the nanoparticles (material, size, and amount) on the thermal properties of both the solid and liquid PCM.
