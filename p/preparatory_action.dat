Only {{a small proportion of}} residents adequately prepare for wildfire with monetary and time costs cited as significant impediments. Few studies have quantified the monetary and time costs for residents to prepare. Here we use an online survey to estimate the extent to which cost drives the probability of a resident undertaking <b>preparatory</b> <b>actions.</b> Cost was found to be a significant driver if <b>preparatory</b> <b>actions</b> were being undertaken primarily for wildfire, but not if the <b>preparatory</b> <b>actions</b> were partially or primarily for other purposes, e. g. landscape maintenance. Approximate average costs for a resident to prepare for wildfire was $AUD 10, 000, with a subsequent annual maintenance cost of $AUD 1000. Largest costs were related to altering landscaping features, e. g. fencing, positioning of garden beds. The paper argues that risks from landscape features could be reduced through further development of guidelines or standards for building in fire prone landscapes. Overall, two primary factors were found to predict the extent of preparation of a resident - planned future actions and their risk perception. Residents who intend to evacuate {{in the event of a}} wildfire are less likely to prepare than those that plan to stay and defend, which points to a problematic gap between official advice to prepare regardless of intended actions and public tendencies to only prepare if they intend to stay and defend...|$|R

40|$|This policy brief {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the approach and outcomes of a European Parliament <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Action</b> centred on the refinement and implementation of the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategy (RIS 3) in the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (REMTh). Implemented, mainly during 2015, by the European Commission (the Joint Research Centre in collaboration with the Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy) and the Managing Authority of the region, this action also had the explicit aim to draw lessons for other low growth and less developed regions in Europe. An essential aspect of the <b>preparatory</b> <b>action</b> was the opportunity it offered for stakeholders, the EC and the regional authority to share experiences and build a common understanding of RIS 3 and the challenges to its implementation. This centred on a series of stakeholder events, critical for the mutual learning process and trust building among stakeholders. Stakeholders have thus worked together to identify and exploit research and innovation based opportunities for the region as well as tackling the challenges to RIS 3 implementation. The various tools developed and applied in the REMTh <b>preparatory</b> <b>action</b> can, taken together, be seen to constitute a toolbox of approaches for RIS 3 implementation. This toolbox and the hands-on approach taken for the implementation of this <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Action,</b> as well as the flexibility to further adapt methodologies to local needs and context, can generate a wide set of tools and lessons on the implementation of regional smart specialisation strategies. These can be of benefit both to less developed regions that have struggled to restructure their economy in spite of considerable investments, and to all regions facing difficulties in implementing RIS 3 as a new and largely unknown governance approach.

40|$|When a {{disaster}} occurs, society becomes disabled, limiting participation in meaningful activities (American Occupational Therapy Association, 2013). Developing emergency preparedness and disaster response programming {{to address the}} physical and emotional needs of individuals who may go through disaster situations is vital (Scaffa, Reitz, 2 ̆ 6 Smith, 2011). With an understanding of the impact of client factors and context on occupational participation, occupational therapy practitioners are uniquely qualified to assist individuals, organizations, and communities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from {{a disaster}} (American Occupational Therapy Association, 2013; Scaffa, et al., 2011). Exploring the impact of disasters on daily lives and occupations from an occupational science perspective (Clark 2 ̆ 6 Lawlor, 2009), two graduate occupational therapy students conducted an independent study project at a local middle school. Over a five month period, the graduate students prepared 85 seventh grade students for disaster and emergency situations through the development of skills necessary for maintaining occupational participation and well-being. While involvement in a disaster can be a traumatic experience, <b>preparatory</b> <b>actions,</b> including the development of a family plan, emergency preparedness kit, and go-bags can significantly reduce the associated trauma (Scaffa et al., 2009). The occupational therapy students guided the seventh grade youth through a series of activities designed to explore these <b>preparatory</b> <b>actions</b> and the emotions typically experienced by individuals in an emergency situation. In exploring these emotions, the seventh graders developed a repertoire of coping skills to reduce the impact of negative reactions on their mental health in an actual emergency. The project culminated with participation of the middle school youth in a disaster drill at the university. After participation in the disaster drill, the seventh graders were interviewed in groups to gain a greater understanding {{of the impact of the}} programming as it related to the occupational nature of being human. The youth reported that participation in the drill felt very realistic and emphasized the importance of <b>preparatory</b> <b>actions</b> in developing the skills to maintain meaningful patterns of occupations in an actual disaster situation. From an occupational science perspective, these experiences highlight the impact of disasters on daily lives and occupations, and the need for additional research to develop scientifically informed interventions teaching individuals, organizations, and communities the skills for maintaining occupational participation in emergency situations.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of the European Parliament Preparatory Action: "Actual and desired state of the {{economic}} potential in regions outside the Greek capital Athens" (hereafter <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Action</b> or PA). It reviews the key activities of this <b>preparatory</b> <b>action,</b> its impacts, the remaining barriers to RIS 3 implementation and presents a perspective on the way forward. Providing hands-on support to the refinement {{and implementation of the}} RIS 3 strategy in the Greek Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (REMTh) has entailed the following activities: •	Mutual learning: this has at core element of the <b>preparatory</b> <b>action,</b> and has offered a unique opportunity to all the stakeholders involved to share experiences and build a common understanding of RIS 3, its potential and the real challenges to its implementation. •	Optimisation of the Entrepreneurial Discovery Process (EDP) – the design, implementation and adaptation of a systematic participatory methodology for the EDP, centred on thematic focus groups. These events enabled the generation and articulation of innovation ideas and initiated the first necessary steps towards concrete projects. •	Capacity building - two dedicated working groups were organised: one centred on issues of human resources mobility and one on RIS 3 governance. Relevant stakeholders, under the guidance of an expert, discussed and formulated plans on how to tackle the different challenges at stake. •	Identification of bottlenecks and systemic failures in RIS 3 implementation - the region has good potential for diversification, but faces a wide set of legal and administrative barriers, which need to be addressed to enable the allocation of structural funds and other resources to support RIS 3 implementation in an optimal way. •	Communication and codification of activities - with the aim of replicating or adapting the activities of the <b>preparatory</b> <b>action</b> and the emerging learning opportunities for other regions, outcomes of all the events have been published on-line, as have methodological guidelines for the EDP process. Furthermore, further publications from these activities are foreseen in the near future. •	Supporting tools for internationalisation and collaboration. The <b>preparatory</b> <b>action</b> has developed a set of online resources that aim at guiding the region in increasing its international outlook to RIS 3 and its collaboration between research and industry. The <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Action</b> generated some very concrete impacts on the regions, among which the main ones are: •	The mobilisation of a critical mass of researchers and business people (600 + people), which actively participated to the EDP focus groups and PDL events. This bottom-up process has increased mutual trust, created a 'momentum' in initiating change and increased the understanding of what RIS 3 can contribute to this change. •	The appreciation of networking and research-business collaboration across stakeholders and especially between research and business. Indeed, some informal networks have been organised, for instance in the wine and marble sector. •	The creation of an action plan for both RIS 3 governance and mobility of human resources. •	Both the Managing Authority and regional stakeholders have better access to international counterparts, both in governance of RIS 3 and in performing research and innovation. •	The project has also determined a shift in perception as far as the European Commission is concerned, which is now perceived more as a collaborator. •	The PA has stimulated and accelerated a discussion between the EC, regional and national authorities which has help to clarify – for the whole country – several aspects of RIS 3 and Structural Funds. •	The <b>preparatory</b> <b>action</b> has significantly influenced the way to design and implement the development strategy for the Region by engaging all relevant stakeholders from the outset.

The <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Action</b> has built on the prior efforts and analysis carried out by the Greek region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (REMTh) between 2012 and 2014, with the aim of complementing and reinforcing them. It has revolved around three main aims: •	to facilitate the refinement and implementation of the S 3 strategy in a region heavily hit by the crisis; •	to {{serve as a model for}} other convergence regions in Greece and Europe. •	to test theories on smart specialisation. These goals have been pursued through three, overlapping, streams of activity, aimed at: 1. 	Ongoing mapping, stocktaking and assessment of the development of the S 3 strategy and identification of actions to ensure its smooth implementation. 2. 	Testing and optimising an entrepreneurial discovery process (EDP) by engaging stakeholders and policy makers in participatory excercises 3. 	Bottom-up capacity-building for a sustainable S 3 development and implementation This brief focuses on the third of these streams.

40|$|Optimal control {{models of}} {{biological}} movements {{are used to}} account for those internal variables that constrain voluntary goal-directed actions. They however do {{not take into account}} external environmental constraints as those associated to social intention. We investigated here the effects of the social context on kinematic characteristics of sequential actions consisting in placing an object on an initial pad (<b>preparatory</b> <b>action)</b> before reaching and grasping as fast as possible the object to move it to another location (main action). Reach-to-grasp actions were performed either in an isolated condition or {{in the presence of a}} partner (audience effect), located in the near or far space (effect of shared reachable space), and who could intervene on the object in a systematic fashion (effect of social intention effect) or not (effect of social uncertainty). Results showed an absence of audience effect but nevertheless an influence of the social context both on the main and the preparatory actions. In particular, a localized effect of shared reachable space was observed on the main action, which was smoother when performed within the reachable space of the partner. Furthermore, a global effect of social uncertainty was observed on both actions with faster and jerkier movements. Finally, social intention affected the <b>preparatory</b> <b>action</b> with higher wrist displacements and slower movements when the object was placed for the partner rather than placed for self-use. Overall, these results demonstrate specific effects of action space, social uncertainty and social intention on the planning of reach-to-grasp actions, in particular on the <b>preparatory</b> <b>action,</b> which was performed with no specific execution constraint. These findings underline the importance of considering the social context in optimal models of action control for human-robot interactions, in particular when focusing on the implementation of motor parameters required to afford intuitive interactions...|$|E
