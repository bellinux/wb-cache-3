President Kennedy's death was officially announced by White House Acting Press Secretary Malcolm Kilduff at 1:33p.m. CST (19:33 UTC). Kilduff was acting press secretary on the trip because <b>Pierre</b> <b>Salinger</b> was traveling to Japan with half the Cabinet, including Secretary of State Dean Rusk.

2500|$|Johnson {{retained}} senior Kennedy appointees, {{some for}} the full term of his presidency. He even retained Robert Kennedy as Attorney General, {{with whom he had}} a notoriously difficult relationship. Robert Kennedy remained in office for a few months until leaving in 1964 to run for the Senate. Although Johnson had no official chief of staff, Walter Jenkins was the first among a handful of equals and presided over the details of daily operations at the White House. George Reedy, who was Johnson's second-longest-serving aide, assumed the post of press secretary when John F. Kennedy's own <b>Pierre</b> <b>Salinger</b> left that post in March 1964. Horace Busby was another [...] "triple-threat man," [...] as Johnson referred to his aides. He served primarily as a speech writer and political analyst. Bill Moyers was the youngest member of Johnson's staff. He handled scheduling and speechwriting part-time.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} presidential {{candidates}} have campaigned in Waterbury {{due to its}} pivotal role in statewide elections. The most famous was the election eve visit on the Green by John F. Kennedy in 1960. Forty thousand people waited until 3am on the Green to greet Kennedy on Sunday, November 6, 1960. Sen. Kennedy spoke to them from the balcony of the Roger Smith Hotel (now called the Elton). <b>Pierre</b> <b>Salinger</b> later {{said it was the}} greatest night of the campaign. In September 1984 Ronald Reagan held a huge noontime election rally at the same location. In July 2006 former President Bill Clinton made a campaign appearance at the Palace Theatre for Senator Joe Lieberman during his campaign for re-election to the U.S. Senate. Shortly after the Democratic primary, Tom Swan, campaign manager for Lieberman's opponent Ned Lamont, described Waterbury as a place where [...] "the forces of slime meet the forces of evil," [...] after a large majority of the town's voters backed Lieberman. Swan claimed he was referring to former Mayor Philip A. Giordano and former Governor John G. Rowland.|$|E
2500|$|Five {{days after}} the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law, the Watts Riots {{occurred}} in Hawkins' district. It {{was the first of}} many race riots in the 1960s. Hawkins urged his colleagues in Congress to increase antipoverty funds, but did not condone the violence. Due to his light skin and heightened racial tensions, Hawkins had to be careful when he visited his district shortly after the riots. The riots stalled the Great Society, particularly over the fair housing; blacks who benefited from Great Society laws were blamed as being harmful to the [...] "law and order" [...] of America, particularly if they were allowed to live next to whites. Fair housing was still an unpopular issue in America: Democratic Senate nominee <b>Pierre</b> <b>Salinger</b> lost to Republican George Murphy in California over the issue, marking the only Republican pickup amid Lyndon Johnson's crushing presidential victory over anti-civil rights Barry Goldwater in 1964. Open housing reform seemed next on the Great Society list after the Voting Rights Act was signed, but the Watts Riot put it on hold. It was not passed until after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|$|E

2500|$|Biographer Robert Caro {{offered a}} {{different}} perspective; {{he wrote that}} the Kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast {{to be a very}} close election against Richard Nixon and Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.. Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry Texas and the Southern states. Caro's research showed that on July 14, John Kennedy started the process while Johnson was still asleep. At 6:30am, John Kennedy asked Robert Kennedy to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes [...] "including Texas". Robert called <b>Pierre</b> <b>Salinger</b> and Kenneth O'Donnell to assist him. Salinger realized the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own, and asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy-Johnson ticket, and Robert replied [...] "yes". Caro contends that it was then that John Kennedy called Johnson to arrange a meeting; he also called Pennsylvania governor David L. Lawrence, a Johnson backer, to request that he nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role. According to Caro, Kennedy and Johnson met and Johnson said that Kennedy would have trouble with Kennedy supporters who were anti–Johnson. Kennedy returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy-Johnson ticket to his closest supporters, including northern political bosses. O'Donnell was angry at what he considered a betrayal by Kennedy, who had previously cast Johnson as anti-labor and anti-liberal. Afterward, Robert Kennedy visited labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson and, after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson, Robert ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnson—apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy's authorization.|$|E
