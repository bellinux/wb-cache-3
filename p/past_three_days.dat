5|$|German forces {{continued}} their counterattacks on Übach, suffering heavy casualties to American artillery and infantry fire. Although {{the inability to}} retake Übach persuaded German commanders that they had insufficient forces to properly defend the approaches to Aachen, the counterattacks did tie down American troops which could have otherwise continued the advance. On 4 October, the Allied advance was limited, with only the towns of Hoverdor and Beggendorf taken, the Americans having lost roughly 1,800 soldiers in the <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> of combat. Better progress was made on 5 October, as the 119th Regiment of the 30th Infantry Division captured Merkstein-Herbach. The following day the Germans launched another counterattack against Übach, again failing to dislodge the Americans. German armor was unable {{to cope with the}} overwhelming numerical superiority of the American tanks, and as a last-ditch effort to halt the advance the Germans began concentrated attacks on American positions with what artillery and aircraft they could muster. They found themselves severely hamstrung by lack of reserves, although General Koechling was able to deploy a Tiger detachment to the town of Alsdorf in an attempt to plug the American penetration of Aachen's northern defenses.|$|E

30|$|To {{determine}} their probability of future resource demands, our model users employ a simple prediction {{based on their}} immediate history of past usage: each user considers if a resource was needed at that hour over the <b>past</b> working <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> For example, if a resource was required at 11 am {{every day for the}} past 3 days, the user will reserve a resource with probability 1.0 that it will be used at 11 am tomorrow.

The lad was a fine specimen of the young Uitlander.

Four days a week he had spent in the mines, for his father intended him to follow in his footsteps, and he had worked by turns with the miners below and the engineers on the surface, so that he might in the course of a few years be thoroughly acquainted with all the details of his profession.|$|R
