5|$|Naming and {{classifying}} our surroundings {{has probably}} been taking place as long as mankind {{has been able to}} communicate. It would always have been important to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the family or group.

5|$|The bluebuck rock <b>paintings</b> <b>from</b> the Caledon {{river valley}} have been {{attributed}} to Bushmen. They show six antelopes facing a man, and were supposedly inspired by shamanic trance; they may depict a Bushman visiting the spirit-world through a tunnel. The Bushmen possibly believed that the bluebuck had a supernatural potency, like other animals in their environment. The animals in the paintings are similar in proportion to the reedbuck, but the large ears, horns, and lack of a mane rule out species other than the bluebuck.|$|E

However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls.|$|E

5|$|Highly distinctive, male lions {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by their manes, and the male's face {{is one of}} the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and <b>paintings</b> <b>from</b> the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France dated to 17,000 years ago, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire, and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic lions.|$|E
