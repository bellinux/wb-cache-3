25|$|A small, left-facing Indian-style {{swastika}} {{was painted}} {{on the inside of}} the original <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> of the Spirit of St. Louis along with the names of all the Ryan Aircraft employees who designed and built it. It was meant as a message of good luck prior to Lindbergh's solo Atlantic crossing as the symbol was often used as a popular good luck charm with early aviators and others. The inside of the original <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> can be viewed at the National Air and Space Museum. This <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> was found to be cracked when Lindbergh arrived at New York prior to his transatlantic flight. The <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> that is on the Spirit of St. Louis now was hastily made in New York to replace the cracked original and was on the aircraft during the transatlantic flight.|$|R

50|$|Jasta 12 {{operated}} Fokker D.I, Albatros D.III, Fokker Dr.I, and Fokker D.VII fighter aircraft. The common squadron {{paint scheme}} was black tails and rear fuselages with white <b>propeller</b> <b>spinners</b> and/or engine cowlings.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the engine}} and {{armament}} options was the Yak-7-37 fitted with a 37 mm MPSh-37 cannon, (MPSh - motornaya pushka Shpital'novo - engine mounted Shpital'nyy cannon), mounted between the engine cylinder blocks, firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Hurricane Mk IIA Series 2 was {{equipped}} with new and slightly longer <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> and new wing-mounting 12 x [...]303in (7.7mm) Browning machine guns. The first aircraft were built in October 1940 and were renamed Mark IIB in April 1941.|$|R
25|$|Canada's first {{licensed}} amateur-built {{aircraft was}} a highly modified Playboy that was built by Keith S. Hopkinson. Hopkinson used the basic Playboy design and incorporated a Piper J-3 cowling, a Cessna 170 <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner,</b> de Havilland Tiger Moth wing struts, Cessna 140 conventional landing gear and Stinson 108 wheel pants.|$|R
50|$|In April 2015 the Super Legend {{design was}} further {{developed}} {{with the addition}} of a greater number of carbon fibre components, including doors, floorboards, the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> and the wingtip bows.

5000|$|Art Chester [...] (1899 - 1949) was an American barnstormer and air racer of the 1930s and 1940s. Chester was {{instrumental}} {{in the development of the}} Menasco Pirate and Buccaneer inverted inline engines. He was also the designer of the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> and engine front cowling for the North American North American P-51 fighter.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} flew on 9 October 1939. By {{the end of}} 1939, this aircraft had logged only 10 {{hours of}} flight, due to the unreliable engines. This was not sufficient to adequately evaluate the design, so in March 1940, the engines were replaced with Piaggio P.XII radial engines with three-blade propellers, with improved engine nacelles and <b>propeller</b> <b>spinners.</b>|$|R
50|$|Yak-7-37:After {{trials in}} April-May 1942, a small batch of 22 Yak-7-37s was authorised, {{fitted with a}} MPSh-37 37 mm cannon, (MPSh - motornaya pushka Shpital'novo - engine mounted Shpital'nyy cannon), mounted between the engine {{cylinder}} blocks, firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner.</b> Two 12.7 mm UBS machine guns were also fitted in the forward fuselage firing above the engine.|$|R
25|$|The Douglas XA-26 {{prototype}} (AAC Ser. No. 41-19504) first flew on 10 July 1942 at Mines Field, El Segundo, with {{test pilot}} Benny Howard at the controls. Flight tests revealed excellent performance and handling, but engine cooling problems led to cowling changes and {{elimination of the}} <b>propeller</b> <b>spinners</b> on production aircraft. Repeated collapses during testing led to reinforcement of the nose landing gear.|$|R
25|$|His {{personal}} Albatros D.V {{during this}} period {{had one of the}} more fanciful paint schemes of the war. Its base color was green fuselage, tail, and elevators with a red <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner.</b> His insignia of black and white checkerboarding edged in red adorned the fuselage just ahead of the Maltese crosses, with a thin red line ringing the fuselage just before the tail.|$|R
50|$|Austrian pilots often {{removed the}} <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> from early {{production}} aircraft, {{since it was}} prone to falling off in flight. Beginning with aircraft 112 of the series 153 production run, Oeffag introduced a new rounded nose that eliminated the spinner. Remarkably, German wind-tunnel tests showed that the simple rounded nose improved propeller efficiency and raised the top speed by 14 km/h (9 mph).|$|R
40|$|The {{lock screw}} of <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> of an {{aircraft}} {{was found to}} have fractured by fatigue. Evidences suggest that excessive pre-tension due to over tightening of the lock screw is the most probable reason for the fatigue crack initiation. The failure of the locating and locking pins is secondary in nature and subsequent to the primary fatigue failure of the lock screw...|$|R

After March 1944 aircraft {{of the group}} were identified by red-yellow-red rings on the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> and a 12" [...] red and yellow band around the forward part of the nose in the checkerboard pattern of the 66th Fighter Wing groups.|$|R
25|$|Even {{in an era}} of relaxed garb and standards, Woollettt was colourful. He wore a leopardskin flying {{helmet and}} gauntlets when he flew. His {{aircraft}} was equally distinctive, with the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> painted as a Native American's face and a dragon trailing {{down the length of the}} fuselage. He also briefly adorned his aircraft with white 'splotches' as experimental camouflage to aid his balloon busting, but his superiors made him remove them.|$|R
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of a comprehensive experimental study carried out at full scale in the NACA 20 -foot wind tunnel, the general purpose of which is to furnish information in regard to the functioning of the power plant and propeller unit under different conditions. This report deals particularly with the problem of the cooling of an airplane engines on the ground. The influence of different nose forms, skirts, flaps, <b>propellers,</b> <b>spinners,</b> and special blowers has been investigated...|$|R
5000|$|The 172B was {{introduced}} in late 1960 as the 1961 model and featured a shorter landing gear, engine mounts lengthened three inches (76 mm), a reshaped cowling, and a pointed <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner.</b> [...] For the first time, the [...] "Skyhawk" [...] name was applied to an available deluxe option package. This added optional equipment included full exterior paint to replace the standard partial paint stripes and standard avionics. The gross weight was increased to 2250 lb.|$|R
50|$|Placing {{personalized}} decorations {{on fighting}} aircraft began with Italian and German pilots. The first recorded piece of nose art was a sea monster painted on an Italian flying boat in 1913. This {{was followed by}} the popular practice of painting a mouth beneath the <b>propeller's</b> <b>spinner,</b> begun by German pilots in World War I. The cavallino rampante (prancing horse) of the Italian ace Francesco Baracca was another well-known image. Nose art of that era was often conceived and produced not by the pilots, but rather the aircraft ground crews.|$|R
50|$|Gabardini re-engined the G.9 {{with the}} 224-kilowatt (300-horsepower) Hispano-Suiza HS 42, {{replaced}} its frontal radiator with two radiators {{mounted on the}} sides of the fuselage above the leading edge of the wing, raised its cockpit, increased the gap between its fuselage and upper wing, and increased the height of its undercarriage to create the G.9bis. After Ing Filippo Zappata (1894-1994) joined Gabardini in 1923, he further modified the G.9bis; among various changes he made were an improved engine cowling intended to reduce aerodynamic drag and the mounting of a large <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Mamba was {{a compact}} engine [...] with a 10-stage axial compressor, six {{combustion}} chambers and a two-stage power turbine. The epicyclic reduction gearbox was {{incorporated in the}} <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner.</b> Engine starting was by cartridge. The Ministry of Supply designation was ASM (Armstrong Siddeley Mamba). The ASM.3 gave 1,475 ehp and the ASM.6 was rated at 1,770 ehp. A 500-hour test was undertaken in 1948 and the Mamba was the first turboprop engine to power the Douglas DC-3, when in 1949, a Dakota testbed was converted to take two Mambas.|$|R
50|$|The D-0 {{was similar}} to the earlier C models, with a few notable changes. Primary among these was a larger {{vertical}} tail in order to finally solve the stability issues. In addition, the cockpit and canopy were slightly redesigned, with the pilot sitting high in a large canopy with excellent vision in all directions. The armament was reduced from the C model to one 20 mm MG FF/M in the engine V firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner,</b> and two 7.92 mm (.30-caliber) MG 17s in the wings close to the fuselage.|$|R
2500|$|Hurricane Mk IIA Series 1 {{equipped}} with new and slightly longer <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner,</b> and fully replaced the machine-gun armament with four 20mm (.79in) Hispano Mk II cannons, two per side. Hurricane IIA Series 2 became the Mk IIC in June 1941, using a slightly modified wing. The new wings {{also included a}} hardpoint for a [...] bomb and, later in 1941, fuel tanks. By then performance was inferior to the latest German fighters, and the Hurricane changed to the ground-attack role, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hurribomber. The mark also served as a night fighter and intruder.|$|R
