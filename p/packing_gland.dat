40|$|Abstract Background Pyloric gland adenoma {{consists}} of closely <b>packed</b> pyloric-type <b>glands</b> lined by mucus-secreting cells. To date, approximately 230 {{cases have been}} reported, mostly of gastric localization with a tumour size up to 3. 5 cm and {{a mean age of}} occurrence around 70 years. Adenocarcinoma develops in about 40 % of cases and may be difficult to detect due to relatively mild nuclear atypia. Case presentation We present the first case of a pyloric gland adenoma of the cystic duct in a 62 -year-old male patient and demonstrate the clinicopathologic characteristics, including radiographic, molecular, and cytogenetic findings. The 2 cm-tumour developed in the cystic duct and protruded into the hepatic and common bile duct. On microscopic examination, it displayed closely <b>packed</b> pyloric-type <b>glands,</b> and focal architectural distortion with mild nuclear atypia. Immunohistochemically, it expressed MUC 1, MUC 5 AC, MUC 6 and p 53, but not MUC 2 and CD 10. The Ki 67 -proliferation index was 25 %. Furthermore, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia was observed in the surrounding bile duct. We detected chromosomal gains at 7 p, 7 q 11 q 21, 15 q, 16 p, 20, losses at 6 p 23 pter, 6 q, 18, and amplifications at 1 q and 6 p 21 p 22 in the pyloric gland adenoma by comparative genomic hybridization. A KRAS codon 12 mutation (c. 35 G>T; p. G 12 V) was detected in the pyloric gland adenoma and in the adjacent dysplasia by sequencing analysis. The diagnosis of pyloric gland adenoma was established with transition into well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and high-grade biliary intraepithelial neoplasia. Conclusion Pyloric gland adenoma evolving in the cystic duct is a rare differential diagnosis of obstructive bile duct tumours. Other premalignant bile duct lesions may be associated. Due to the risk of developing adenocarcinoma, surgical resection should be performed. </p...|$|R
50|$|Beginning on the mid-morning of 11 October, Albacore was depth charged {{numerous}} times. At 1548, the conning officer finally {{spotted the}} Japanese attackers, two submarine chasers and an airplane. A third ship equipped with sound gear {{joined the group}} and continued the hunt. The ships crisscrossed over Albacore, close enough for propeller noise to reverberate throughout her hull and compelled her to proceed at silent running, with her ventilator fans shut down. After a chase of nearly seven hours, the Japanese ships disappeared astern, and Albacore then surfaced to clear the immediate area. The next day, Albacore headed for Midway Island. Although she had had several opportunities to score during the patrol, Albacore was not credited with any damage to Japanese shipping. The submarine arrived at Midway Island on 20 October and commenced a refit.With her refurbishing completed and a new Oerlikon 20 mm cannon installed, Albacore sailed on 11 November for her second patrol. Her assigned areas were the St. George's Channel, New Britain, along {{the east coast of}} New Guinea to Vitiaz Strait, and the Dallman Pass off Madang harbor. On 24 November, the submarine spotted a convoy of two cargo vessels. Albacore maneuvered into position and fired two stern tubes, but neither torpedo found its target. Two days later, on 26 November, Albacore herself became the quarry. Two Japanese destroyers depth charged her and the explosions caused numerous small leaks around the cable <b>packing</b> <b>glands</b> in the pressure hull. After a two-hour chase, the Japanese retired, and Albacore shifted her patrol area to Vitiaz Strait. Another golden opportunity arose on 13 December, when Albacore found three Japanese destroyers. She released a three-torpedo spread but again was unsuccessful. On 18 December, Albacore was stationed off Madang. The submarine discovered {{what seemed to be a}} transport and a destroyer.|$|R

The tumor led to occlusion and cystic dilatation of the main duct in the pancreatic tail. The surgical resection specimen disclosed a polypoid, bilobed mass attached {{to the wall of}} the main pancreatic duct by a thin fibrous stalk. Light-microscopic examination revealed a well-demarcated nodule composed of closely <b>packed</b> tubular <b>glands</b> lined by columnar, mucin-secreting cells with abundant clear cytoplasm and basally oriented nuclei. Focal, mild cytologic atypia was seen. Pyloric metaplasia and focal papillary hyperplasia was present in the adjacent ductal epithelium. Periodic acid-Schiff reactions, with and without diastase predigestion, showed reactivity in the tubular glands, whereas alcian blue (pH 2. 5) was negative. Immunohistochemical stains for chromogranin, serotonin, somatostatin, and gastrin failed to detect the respective antigens. Genetic analysis using polymerase chain reaction with mutant enrichment and allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization detected a single mutation at codon 12 of K-ras, which changed the wild-type glycine to arginine. This mutation is commonly found in invasive pancreatic ductal carcinomas. Although tumors with microscopic and immunohistochemical features consistent with pyloric gland adenoma have been described in the gallbladder, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case within the pancreatic ductal system.

The {{surface of the}} tegument was covered by transverse cytoplasmic ridges from which protrude numerous thorn-like spines showing crenelated tips on the posterior part. Spines were arranged in staggered rows. Cobblestone-like units of the tegument were observed on a semicircle-shaped formation over the oral sucker. A tegumental excrescence was observed in the dorsal anterior side of the fluke. Ultrastructural study revealed that the tegument of D. inflata had a typical syncytial organization with a distal cytoplasm lying over a basal matrix and cytons. Cytoplasmic bridges allowed transit of secretory vesicles and granules <b>packed</b> in <b>gland</b> cells. Two types of sensory structures were examined. Type 1 sensory receptor was a button-like uniciliated papilla mounted on a folded tegumental base and surrounded by cytoplasmic ridges. This receptor consisted of a nerve bulb and a cilium that extended from a centriole. Type 2 sensory receptor was a smooth bulb-like non-ciliated papilla. It was only recovered on the ventral sucker. This receptor consisted of a nerve bulb enclosing an ovoid electron-dense structure. For both receptors, the nerve bulbs contained numerous mitochondria, nerve fibers, and electron-lucent material.

40|$|Anatomical, histological, and ultrastructural {{studies of}} the European beaver stomach {{revealed}} several unique morphological features. The prominent attribute of its gross morphology was the cardiogastric gland (CGG), located near the oesophageal entrance. Light microscopy showed that the CGG was formed by invaginations of the mucosa into the submucosa, which contained densely <b>packed</b> proper gastric <b>glands</b> comprised primarily of parietal and chief cells. Mucous neck cells represented < 0. 1 % of cells in the CGG gastric glands and 22 - 32 % of cells in the proper gastric glands of the mucosa lining the stomach lumen. These data suggest that chief cells in the CGG develop from undifferentiated cells that migrate through the gastric gland neck rather than from mucous neck cells. Classical chief cell formation (i. e., arising from mucous neck cells) occurred in the mucosa lining the stomach lumen, however. The muscularis around the CGG consisted primarily of skeletal muscle tissue. The cardiac region was rudimentary while the fundus/corpus and pyloric regions were equally developed. Another unusual feature of the beaver stomach was the presence of specific mucus with a thickness up to 950 µm (in frozen, unfixed sections) that coated the mucosa. Our observations suggest that the formation of this mucus is complex and includes the secretory granule accumulation in the cytoplasm of pit cells, the granule aggregation inside cells, and the incorporation of degenerating cells into the mucus...|$|R

40|$|In {{a typical}} mollusc, the shell {{is the most}} {{important}} defensive mechanism. But the shell does not protect the mollusc from all predators, and {{it is for this reason}} that secondary defensive mechanisms have evolved in many species. In some cases, these secondary mechanisms become more important than the shell as a means of protection from predators, and where this occurs selection may favour the reduction and even the total loss of the shell. The shell has been lost independently in each of the nine orders of the Opisthobranchia except the Thecosomata, and in the Sacoglossa and the Nudibranchia it may have been lost two or three times. In all of these cases where the shell-less or nudibranch condition has evolved, the animal must be adequately protected by defensive mechanisms other than the shell. This thesis studies the defensive mechanisms of a number of nudibranch molluscs. In the Sacoglossa there is a series of forms from the primitive Arthessa, with a well-developed defensive shell, through Oxynoandeuml; and Lobiger, with reduced shells, to the nudibranch Stiliger on the one hand and to the bivalved Berthelinia on the other. The defensive mechanisms of Berthelinia and Stiliger are compared. It is shown that even in Berthelinia. which is protected by a tightly closing bivalved shell, there is a secondary defensive mechanism in the form of a secretion from the hypobranchial gland. In Stiliger, the defensive mechanisms are located in the cerata. Three types of gland are present of which at least one, and probably all, are defensive. In addition the cerata can be autotomised and regenerated, and this may also be of defensive importance. It is also shown that the ceratal glands of Stiliger and the hypobranchial gland of Berthelinia are muscle-operated. It is concluded that in both Stiliger and Berthelinia the defensive system involves two or three defensive mechanisms; and there is evidence that these mechanisms act in series just as do the defensive mechanisms of many tropical insects. The defensive mechanisms of the Doridacea are discussed. It is concluded that camouflage is of widespread occurrence, but that there is as yet no evidence for the occurrence of warning coloration. Many bright colours are deflection marks, but the importance of other bright colours is still not known. Dorsal papillae with a probable defensive function are present in some species of the Doridacea, and they are usually supplied with glands. The function of the caryphyllidia of certain species is not known. Autotomy of papillae has not been described, but autotomy of the mantle edge occurs in the Discodoridinae. Defensive glands are of widespread occurrence in the Doridacea. One type of defensive gland that has not been described before in dorids is the acid gland of Discodoris pusae and Anisodoris stellifera. Acid secretion is well known from certain other opisthobranch and prosobranch molluscs, and the discovery of its occurrence in dorids means that it has evolved independently at least four times in the Mollusca. In D. pusae and A. stellifera, the acid glands are large subepidermal pits with a mucous plug and a muscular sphincter. The acid is inorganic and contains sulphate ions. It may register pH 1 or 2 close to the skin of the mollusc. Another species of Discodoris was found to secrete acid of a similar pH. In this species acid-secretion is from the ordinary epidermal cells, and subepidermal glands are totally absent. In the light of these results, the evolution of acid-secretion is discussed. In all four suborders of the Nudibranchia and in the Sacoglossa, species with dorsal papillae or cerata have evolved. In all cases where these have been studied, they have been found to be of defensive importance. Cerata usually contain glands, are mobile, can be autotomised without harm to the mollusc, and may have yet other defensive mechanisms. The Eolidacea are the best known of these groups with defensive dorsal papillae. In the eolids, some species are camouflaged, but none has been shown to possess warning coloration. Cerata may be brightly coloured to direct attacks away from the head, and the behaviour of the mollusc supports this view. Cerata can be autotomised and regenerated, but the ease with which autotomy occurs varies between different species, Cerata are especially sensitive at their tips, and it is shown that this is because there is a high concentration of neurosensory cilia in this region. Stimulation, by touch, of these cilia can cause ejection of nematocysts or of glandular secretions as a defensive response. Ceratal glands are described for a number of species of solid. The role of the cellules spéciales is discussed, and it is concluded that these are not of defensive importance. Their content of RNA and of protein suggests that they synthesize protein, and their high glycogen content suggests that they are storage cells. They may have a duct in some species, and could thus be excretory. Simple, unicellular mucous glands occur in probably all eolids, but they may be epidermal or subepidermal in different species. They probably protect the animal from abrasion. They may also be responsible for the mucin cuticle, or for the presence of a mucous film just outside the cuticle which is continuously being carried off the tips of the cerata by ciliary action. Mucous glands are the only glands present in some species, for example Eolis M and Tergipes despectus. In other acleioproct eolids there are glands which have a defensive functions the species of Catriona studied have two types of defensive gland, whilst the eubranchids studied have three and possibly five types of defensive gland. These defensive glands are usually concentrated at the tips of the cerata and are exuded when the animal is violently disturbed. Some of them are muscle-operated and are proteinaceous, others contain mucopolysaccharides or mucoproteins. In the smaller species of both Catriona and Eubranchus, the surface area of ceratal epithelium is limited, and the defensive <b>glands</b> are <b>packed</b> so as to utilize all available space. The method of <b>packing</b> the <b>glands</b> is different in the two genera, suggesting that it is a case of parallel evolution. It is further suggested that the defensive glands of Calma, Catriona and the Eubranchidae are convergent. In the cleioprocts studied, no such concentration of glands at the ceras tip was found, but all species possess two or more types of ceratal gland. There is evidence that some of these may be defensive in function. Nematocysts are used in defence by many eolids, but for them to be effective, they must be ejected from the cnidosac and an appreciable percentage of them must explode. It is shown that whilst nematocysts are frequently ejected and exploded as a defensive reaction, there is considerable variation between different species. In Calma, glands are of considerable defensive value, but nematocysts are totally absent; whilst in Tergipes despectus, defensive glands are absent and nematocysts are important in defence. Other species utilize both defensive mechanisms, but to varying extents. In the Cleioprocta generally, and particularly in the Aeolidiidae, glands are not of great importance in defence whilst nematocysts are; but in the Eubranchidae and in Catriona glands are well-developed and of considerable defensive importance. There is even variation within one genus. Thus Catriona tina rarely uses glands but frequently uses nematocysts in defence, whilst C. perca rarely uses nematocysts but frequently uses glands. This interspecific variation in behaviour is probably related to the different predators which different species of eolid are likely to encounter. The predators of nudibranchs in the sea are not well known, but laboratory experiments have demonstrated that many nudibranchs are relatively unpalatable to many species of fish. However, some species of fish are not deterred from eating eolids by nematocysts, and it is likely that it is with relation to these predators that glandular defensive mechanisms have evolved. Thus nematocysts may be protective against one set of predators whilst glands are protective against another set of predators. Nematocysts may be damaging not only to potential predators of eolids, but also to the eolid itself when it crawls over coelenterates. The mechanism by which eolids escape damage from nematocysts is not known, but there is evidence that the vesicular structure of the epidermis is involved. It is concluded that in many nudibranchs the defensive system involves several distinct mechanisms which come into action in series. There is some evidence that certain mechanisms are adapted to specific predators. The eolidiform condition is a particularly efficient defensive adaptation since it concentrates several mechanisms into that part of the mollusc which is expendible, and which is the first to be encountered by a potential predator. Three papers are included in the appendix. The first describes the occurrence of Polycera elegans (Bergh) in Britain, and discusses its taxonomy. The second gives notice of a new species of bivalved gastropod from Jamaica, and the third is a description of this animal. </p...|$|R
