40|$|AI 2003 : Advances in Artificial Intelligence, 16 th Australian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Perth, Australia, December 3 - 5, 2003 Metadata {{plays an}} {{important}} role in discovering, collecting, extracting and aggregating Web data. This paper proposes a method of constructing metadata for a specific topic. The method uses Web pages that are located in a site and are linked from a listing page. Web pages of recipes, real estates, used cars, hotels and syllabi are typical examples of such pages. We call them a series of Web documents. A series of Web pages have the same appearance when a user views them with a browser, because it is often the case that they are written with the same tag pattern. The method uses the tag-pattern as the common structure of the Web pages. Individual contents of the pages appear as <b>plain</b> <b>texts</b> embedded between two consecutive tags. If we remove the tags, it becomes a sequence of <b>plain</b> <b>texts.</b> The <b>plain</b> <b>texts</b> in the same relative position can be interpreted as attribute values if we presume that the pages represent records of the same kind. Most of these <b>plain</b> <b>texts</b> in the same position vary page to page. But, it may happen that the same texts show up at the same relative position in almost all pages. These constant texts can be considered as attribute names. “Location”, “Rating” and “Travel from Airport” are examples of such constant texts for pages of hotel information. If the frequency of a text is higher than a threshold, we accept it as a component of metadata. If we mark a constant text with “N” and a variable text with “V”, the sequence of <b>plain</b> <b>texts</b> forms a series of N’s and V’s. A page in a series contain two kinds of NV sequence pattern. The first pattern is (NV) n, which we call vertical, where an attribute value follows the attribute name immediately. The second pattern is NnV n, which we call horizontal, where names occur in the first row and the same number of values follow in the next row. Thus we can understand the meaning of values and can construct records from a series of Web pages...|$|R
