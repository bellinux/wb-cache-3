40|$|Abstract: The {{success of}} a <b>product</b> <b>family</b> heavily depends {{on the degree of}} reuse {{achieved}} when developing <b>product</b> <b>family</b> based customer specific applications. If a significant amount of the customer requirements can be realized by using the communality and the variability defined for the <b>product</b> <b>family,</b> the reuse level is high; if not, the reuse level is low. In this paper we elaborate on the influence of customer requirements on the degree of reuse achieved within a <b>product</b> <b>family.</b> We argue that the level of reuse can be increased by considering the capabilities of the <b>product</b> <b>family</b> when defining the requirements for the customer specific application. We finally show how this can be supported by <b>product</b> <b>family</b> specific use cases. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Product</b> <b>family</b> {{development}} focusses on systematically developing reusable assets {{over time}} {{that are used}} in later projects to achieve benefits in terms of development effort, time-to-market reduction, and quality improvement. Consequently, the costs from the initial development for reuse are more than compensated by the derived benefits. The initial costs of development for reuse thus take the role of an investment in later product line benefits [CN 01]. Therefore it is key to successful <b>product</b> <b>family</b> engineering to identify costs and benefits that are associated with <b>product</b> <b>family</b> development. This provides the basis for the subsequent optimization of the investment. In this deliverable we focus on the relationship between costs and benefits and show the implications and constraints on the associated investment decisions. We present a basic economic model, which provides the necessary background for understanding the impact of investments in a <b>product</b> <b>family.</b> This model enables a systematic analysis of the <b>product</b> <b>family</b> situation and any consequences of product line investments. A key part of any investment decisions is to define the cost implications of these decisions. Unfortunately, there is no fixed model of <b>product</b> <b>family</b> development and consequently also no fixed model of <b>product</b> <b>family</b> development costs. Thus, we provide a reference model for <b>product</b> <b>family</b> costs in this deliverable together with a collection of the most important cost drivers that we could identify through expert interviews. This will support the organizations in systematically deriving <b>product</b> <b>family</b> cost models that are particularly adapted to their situation. In order to consistently and successfully evolve the <b>product</b> <b>family</b> infrastructure a strategy driven from a market point of view is required [KLD 02]. This strategy is needed in order to decide on the appropriateness of an investment and to do so consistently over time. Thus <b>product</b> <b>family</b> strategy should be the basis for any <b>product</b> <b>family</b> investment. In this deliverable we show approaches to derive such a <b>product</b> <b>family</b> strategy and combine it with the most advanced techniques for evaluating the potential benefits of the <b>product</b> <b>family</b> even when facing considerable uncertainties. As a result, this deliverable provides a basis for analyzing costs and benefits of <b>product</b> <b>family</b> development and enables to connect these aspects through an appropriate strategy that is optimally aligned with the existing <b>product</b> <b>family</b> and the company objectives...|$|R

40|$|While the {{rationale}} {{of developing the}} <b>product</b> <b>family</b> {{as a means to}} achieve economy of scale and standardization of production has been well recognized in both industry and academia, the fundamental concern regarding developing the <b>product</b> <b>family</b> {{lies in the fact that}} a company must optimize the internal complexity and external variety. With this view, this paper recognizes the necessity to understand the <b>product</b> <b>family</b> through developing commonality measurements. The goal of the paper is to present design and process engineers with insight into <b>product</b> <b>family</b> design and its manufacturability. In this paper, two sources of commonality are identified: the component part commonality and the process commonality. The formulation of the component part commonality is based on the mindset of counting the average applications per component part and takes into account product volume, quantity per operation, and the price/cost of the component part. The process commonality index incorporates such concerns as process flexibility, lot sizing, and scheduling sequencing into one analytical measurement. The effects of these two commonality indices on <b>product</b> <b>family</b> design are examined in response to changes in their parameters. Accordingly, the managerial implications are derived. In order to facilitate the understanding of the <b>product</b> <b>family,</b> the feasibility of evaluating the <b>product</b> <b>family</b> by relating commonality indices to the system's performance is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Performance is an {{important}} non functional quality attribute of a software system. The ability to deliver the expected performance objectives comes from a careful design and attention to detail. Unfortunately, performance is not always considered at the beginning. However, once built, software performance can still be improved by evaluating and tuning the software architecture. When analyzing {{the performance of a}} software <b>product</b> <b>family,</b> an understanding of its architectural properties is needed. A software <b>product</b> <b>family</b> architecture’s strength is based on common assets, platforms and source code shared by its <b>family</b> members. Software <b>product</b> <b>family</b> design allows improved time-to-market, software quality and software reuse. At the same time, variability is the factor to instantiate different products and the handling of the variation points must be carefully managed. In this paper I present a scenario-driven approach for analyzing the performance of software <b>product</b> <b>family</b> architectures. The process of performance tuning has been applied to a Nokia software <b>product</b> <b>family</b> architecture and two case studies are presented. The evaluation process and the tradeoffs of evaluating software <b>product</b> <b>family</b> architectures are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Optimisation of <b>product</b> <b>family</b> {{design has}} been {{emphasised}} and studied for many years. However, previous studies only took overall cost or profit as an optimisation objective, but ignored the supply {{risk of a}} <b>product</b> <b>family.</b> Moreover, the discount associated with the bidding price, which is common in practice, was not considered in the modelling. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective optimisation approach integrating supplier selection into <b>product</b> <b>family</b> design. In our optimisation model, not only the profit but also the supply risk of a <b>product</b> <b>family</b> is formulated as optimisation objectives. Consequently, we can evaluate and optimise a <b>product</b> <b>family</b> from many perspectives. In addition, as a bidding price discount may affect <b>product</b> <b>family’s</b> configuration and supplier selection, we include linear piecewise discount of bidding prices from suppliers in our optimisation model. The NSGA-II algorithm is developed to achieve Pareto non-dominated solutions of the multi-objective optimisation model.
