In the following pages this question was addressed by studying {{the resemblance}} of the surface pressure fields, obtained by NCEP reanalyses, corresponding to ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events over 5 Italian climatic areas. Such ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events were selected by means of 45 daily precipitation records covering the period from 1951 to 2000. Two <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> that resemble one another are termed soft-analogues in this paper. The mathematical measures {{used to assess the}} difference between two <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> were: the root-mean-square difference, the correlation, and the S 1 score. The comparison outcomes were categorized into classes according to the previous measures. Once a couple of the <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> were found to be good soft-analogues (that was a rare occurrence), these <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> were compared with all <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> excluded by the initial selection being not associated with intense precipitation events. The few soft-analogues associated with ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events were found to be also softanalogue to several, and sometimes a great deal of, <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> not associated with the selected ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Discovering web <b>navigation</b> <b>patterns</b> is an {{important}} issue in web usage mining with various applications like navigation prediction and improvement of website management. Since web site structure is always changed, we need not only consider the frequency of click behavior but also web site structure to mine web <b>navigation</b> <b>patterns</b> for <b>navigation</b> prediction. To reduce the overhead of dynamically mining the web <b>navigation</b> <b>patterns</b> from the web data, a dynamic mining approach is needed by using the previous mining results and computing new patterns just from the inserted or deleted part of the web data. In this paper, we propose a special data structure named Ideal-Tree (Inverted-database Expectable Tree) to avoid the effort of scanning database. Meanwhile, an efficient mining algorithm named Ideal-Tree-Miner is proposed for mining web <b>navigation</b> <b>patterns</b> with dynamic thresholds. Based on the discovered patterns, we also give a navigation prediction model. The experimental results show that our prediction model outperforms other approaches substantially in terms o...|$|R

A corresponding inlet turbulence pattern is obtained from the CFD solution via a correlation linking root mean square (RMS) inlet turbulence to a formulation of several CFD parameters representative of flow turbulence intensity. This correlation was derived using flight data obtained from the NASA High Alpha Research Vehicle flight test program and several CFD solutions at conditions matching the flight test data. A distortion synthesis analysis is then performed on the predicted steady state total pressure and RMS turbulence patterns to yield a predicted value of dynamic distortion intensity and the associated instantaneous total <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern...</b>|$|R

After the temperature rise, the frequency of winter monsoon <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> did not decrease. According to the classification of <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns,</b> long-term variations of surface <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> frequencies showed negative relations between the winter monsoon and high-pressure patterns before 1992, which subsequently changed to the negative relations between the winter monsoon and traveling low-pressure systems. After the temperature rise, in years when low-pressure patterns prevailed, precipitation increases were observed in western Japan due to low-pressure systems traveling over the Pacific coast, and in wider areas from central Japan to Kyusyu areas due to low-pressure systems traveling over the Sea of Japan. Recently, the frequency of stationary front patterns has been increasing with precipitation increasing in the Setouchi area of western Japan. In years with a warm winter, precipitation increased in wider areas of the Pacific coast to inland areas of central Japan. In cold winters, low-pressure systems traveling over the Pacific coast decreased precipitation in central to western Japan. However, after a temperature rise, low-pressure systems traveling over the Sea of Japan decreased precipitation at {{the coast of the}} sea of Japan from central Japan to Hokkaido...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an {{endogenous}} inhibitor of {{nitric oxide}} synthesis and {{also is an}} indicator of endothelial dysfunction. Patients who have nondipper blood <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> {{have been shown to}} exhibit more endothelial dysfunction than patients who has dipper blood <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern.</b> However, other endogenous markers, but not ADMA, are used to assess endothelial function in these studies. In our study, we used ADMA levels to compare differences in endothelial function between each groups. Materials and methods: This study includes 87 patients who admitted to Düzce University internal medicine and Cardiology outpatient clinics throughout 6 months and have been diagnosed previously as essential hypertension and followed with medical therapy. Patients were divided into two groups as non-dippers and dippers, using ambulatory blood pressure measurement. Patients’ body mass index, Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and ADMA levels were measured. Results: Age, BMI, and lipid values did not differ significantly between groups (p> 0. 05). Mean ADMA level was 1. 29 ± 0. 13 in dippers, and that of non-dippers was 1. 27 ± 0. 13 μmol/L. ADMA levels did not differ significantly between the non-dipper and dipper groups (p= 0. 575). Conclusion: ADMA levels were found to be higher in hypertensive patients due to endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction was more frequent in patients who had nondipper blood <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> than patients who had dipper blood <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern.</b> In our study, ADMA levels did not differ significantly between two patterns...|$|R

40|$|Multi-decadal {{changes in}} {{patterns}} of physical phenomena and populations of marine biota occur in the Bering Sea and Eastern North Pacific Ocean. The most marked physical manifestation of these changes is a variation in modes of atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> known as a “regime shift”. The physical mechanisms that generate regime shifts are hypothesized to include such primary driving forces as the lunar-nodal tide, variations in solar radiation {{and changes in the}} North Pacific circulation that affect air-sea exchange of heat and momentum with the Aleutian Low atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern.</b> Secondary effects include interactions among upper atmosphere <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns.</b> The cause for the variations in these <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns,</b> however, is not known. The changes in atmospheric pressure fields together with their attendant winds, moisture and momentum, transfer energy throughout the oceanic environment. These fluctuations greatly influence such phenomena as variations in the extent of sea ice, transport of nutrients into the euphotic zone, water column temperature and turbulence. Changes in these aspects of the ecosystem, in turn, influence biota both through the nutrientphytoplankton-zooplankton feeding sequence and by directly affecting biological rates and behavior. Changes in the physical environment, however, do not explain all the variations in populations. Clearly, biological interactions are also important, as are the impacts of human intervention. While our understanding of natural changes and their impact on the ecosystem is growing, many of the mechanisms that link physical to biological processes and the life histories of many species are not yet known. As our understanding of how marine populations respond to regime shifts grows, {{we will be able to}} use such knowledge toward sustaining the health and productivity of the ecosystem...|$|R

The investigation covers a down-sloping roof configuration at - 5 ° roof angle and two up-sloping roof configurations of roof angles 5 ° and 10 °. The results supplement an earlier study made on a horizontal roof. The wind <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> on the upper surface of an up-sloping roof suggests that there exists a preferred mode of flow separation on that surface. The pattern shows two localized regions of high suction, which are separately located towards the two ends of the roof span. On the up-sloping roofs, this <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> is observed in the time-averaged mean distribution as well as during the occurrence instant of a peak total uplifting force on the roof. On the horizontal roof, this particular pattern of flow separation is not obviously observed in the time-averaged mean wind <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> but is revealed by the conditional sampling technique which captures the wind pressure distribution during the generation of a peak uplifting force on the roof.
