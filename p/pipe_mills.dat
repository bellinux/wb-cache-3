50|$|In 1886, the German {{brothers}} Reinhard (1856-1922) and Max Mannesmann (1857-1915) {{received the}} world's first patent for their invention {{of a process}} for rolling seamless steel pipes (Mannesmann process). Between 1887 and 1889 they founded tube mills with several different business partners in Bous, Germany, in Komotau/Bohemia, in Landore/Wales and in their home town Remscheid/Germany. In 1890, due to technical and financial start-up problems, the tube and <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> existing on the continent were folded into Deutsch-Österreichische Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG. The new company had its headquarters in Berlin. Reinhard and Max Mannesmann formed the first board of directors but left it in 1893. In that year the company headquarters were moved to Düsseldorf - {{at that time the}} center of the German tube and pipe industry. The company was renamed Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG in 1908.|$|E
50|$|The process {{involves}} {{moving the}} strip past precision-profiled slotted tools made to an exact shape, or past plain cutting tools. The tools are all usually made of tungsten carbide-based compounds. In early machines, {{it was necessary}} to precisely position the strip relative to the cutting tools, but newer machines use a floating suspension technology which enables tools to locate by material contact. This allows mutual initial positioning differences up to approximately 12 mm followed by resilient automatic engagement. Products using this technology directly are automotive seatbelt springs, large power transformer winding strip, rotogravure plates, cable and hose clamps, gas tank straps, and window counterbalance springs. Products using the process indirectly are tubes and <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> where the edge of the strip is accurately beveled prior to being folded into tubular form and seam welded.

40|$|Purpose. Modernization of {{cold-rolled}} <b>pipes</b> <b>mills</b> {{in order}} to increase functionality, regardless of their physical wear and tear. Design/methodology/approach. Constantly increasing demands on the pipe geometry and properties of materials perfectly satisfied by cold rolling (HPT), which evolves by optimizing the modes of deformation and improvement of equipment for its implementation. It offers system-modular approach to modernize the equipment of cold rolling mills, realizing one of the few non-waste technologies for the production of products with high consumer characteristics. The main producers of cold-rolled <b>pipes</b> <b>mills</b> (company SMS Meer and NGOs EZTM) more than a 80 year period of existence and development of technology HPT released about a thousand <b>mill</b> <b>pipe</b> diameters from 4 to 450 mm. Findings. System-modular approach to the unit that implements the method of production of goods HPT, based on the analysis of both technological and regime of the functioning of its mechanisms, and design options for their execution and layout, allows efficient use of the existing equipment and, if necessary, to expand its capabilities. The growing demand for cold-rolled tube can be satisfied both by the modernization of existing units and replacing them with new ones. For the design and manufacture of advanced mill HPT Ukraine has not only technical capabilities but also professionals able to offer solutions {{at the level of the}} best world standards. Originality/value. As part of undergoing a painful restructuring of the Ukrainian pipe production is more than 200 cold rolling <b>mills</b> <b>pipes</b> of different sizes and constructive accomplishments. This production will be effective in diversification - "merging" with the production of final products (for example, the production of ball bearing steel and bearing production at factories of the company "Timken" USA; production of heat exchangers in a SMPO them.

40|$|Abstract: Tubular {{products}} in <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> {{are produced by}} different methods in wide range of sizes and materials for various applications. From simple ERW steel tubes to high quality and expensive seamless tubes, depending on the application, different NDT techniques are used extensively. All these tests are implemented to fulfil the required specification or standard {{as well as for}} condition monitoring of the production lines. While on-line test has the advantage of real time inspection by less investment, off-line test is final inspection and more reliable. Selecting a suitable NDT method is possible by optimizing between the costs and reliability in parallel with requirements of the international standards. Today different standards like API, ASTM, ANSI/AWWA, DIN, BS, SEP are used extensively in <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> but all these standards give options to select test technique and test palce. In many <b>pipe</b> <b>mills</b> NDT is not used as they beleive it is an expensive test that reduces the production speed. While, by implementing proper NDT method in proper stage it is neither expensive nor reduces the production speed. In this paper the applicable NDT methods are evaluated according to the international standards for various tubes on the base of longterm experience in Iranian <b>pipe</b> <b>mills.</b> Introduction: Metalic pipes and tubes are classified in different cataegories depending on the material, size, production technique and applications.

50|$|With {{the growth}} of the steel mills, Ambridge became a {{worldwide}} leader in steel production. The borough became known for bridge building, metal molding, and the manufacture of tubes (large iron pipes). During World War II, the American Bridge Company fabricated steel for the building of LSTs (Landing Ship Tanks). The steel was then sent by rail to the adjacent American Bridge naval shipyard in Leetsdale, PA where the LSTs were built. The area was also home to several other steel mills like Armco, the <b>pipe</b> <b>mill</b> which manufactured oil piping, and A.M. Byers, a major iron and tool fabricator. Eventually competition by foreign steel producers began to cause the share of the steel market for U.S. manufacturers to dwindle. With the shift of steel production overseas, the American Bridge Company ended operations in Ambridge in 1983. The legacy of American Bridge can be seen today in bridges around the world.|$|R
