5|$|Cascioferro {{never went}} to any school. When still young, Cascioferro married a teacher from Bisacquino, Brigida Giaccone, who {{instructed}} him {{how to read and}} write. He was inducted into the Mafia in the 1880s. He worked as a revenue collector as a young adult, using the position as a cover to carry out his <b>protection</b> <b>racket.</b> His criminal record began with an assault in 1884 and progressed through extortion, arson, and menacing, and eventually to the kidnapping of the 19-year-old Baroness Clorinda Peritelli di Valpetrosa in June 1898, for which he received a three-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – {{decided to do}} something about the absence of peace and security in the countryside. The state police at the time was as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a <b>protection</b> <b>racket,</b> victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E
5|$|Aqil {{secured a}} durable {{alliance}} with the Beni Sakhr, consecrated through his marriage to a woman from the tribe. From Transjordan, he and his band of irregulars raided areas {{on both sides of}} the Jordan River until he was invited back to the Galilee by Acre's kaimakam in 1847. The latter had sought to neutralize Aqil and his allies' marauding activities, and thus pardoned Aqil. He was also given command of 75 bashi-bazouk in Lower Galilee. Thereafter, he was commissioned with overseeing that region's security. In particular, the successive governors of Acre entrusted him with protecting the Galilee's trade routes and maintaining general security in the area, which he did successfully. With time, he became an unofficial mutasallim (tax collector) for much of northern Palestine, including the Jezreel Valley, Safad, Tiberias and Nazareth. The tax he collected was not on behalf of the authorities, but rather a tribute payment (khuwwa) to receive his protection. While this unofficial system proved successful in guaranteeing local security, later historians criticized it as akin to a <b>protection</b> <b>racket.</b>|$|E

40|$|Illegality {{does not}} {{necessarily}} breed violence. The relationship between illicit markets and violence depends on institutions of protection. When state-sponsored <b>protection</b> <b>rackets</b> form, illicit markets can be peaceful. Conversely, the breakdown of state-sponsored <b>protection</b> <b>rackets,</b> which may result from well-meaning policy reforms intended to reduce corruption and improve law enforcement, can lead to violence. The cases of drug trafficking in contemporary Mexico and Colombia show how {{a focus on the}} emergence and breakdown of state-sponsored <b>protection</b> <b>rackets</b> helps explain variation in levels of violence both within and across illicit markets...|$|R

He was arrested several times between 1926 and 1937, but never brought to trial. For a time in 1934, Dioguardi was executive secretary of the Allied Truckmen's Mutual Association, an employer association, and represented the employers during a strike by 1,150 Teamsters in September 1934. In March 1937, Dioguardi was arrested on charges of extortion, conspiracy, and racketeering, He pleaded guilty and received a three-year prison term in Sing Sing.|$|E

Bassett's father, rancher Herb Bassett, did business with Cassidy, supplying him with fresh horses and beef. That same year, Cassidy {{was arrested at}} Lander, Wyoming, for stealing horses and possibly for running a <b>protection</b> <b>racket</b> among the local ranchers there. He was imprisoned in the Wyoming State Prison in Laramie, Wyoming. After serving 18 months of a two-year sentence, Cassidy was released and pardoned in January 1896 by Governor William Alford Richards.

25|$|The NCO {{spread like}} {{wildfire}} in the crisis-ridden Campanian towns {{of the late}} 1970s, offering alienated youths an alternative to a lifetime of unemployment or poorly paid jobs. Hundreds of young men were employed as enforcers. Initially, the main specialisation of NCO gangs was extorting money through protection rackets from local businesses. While the traditional Camorristic families held territorial powers and the consequent responsibility over their controlled areas, the NCO had no qualms over breaking the established social fabric by extorting shopkeepers, small factories and businesses, and building contractors. In its quest for cash, it even targeted individuals such as landlords, lawyers and professionals. The NCO's <b>protection</b> <b>racket</b> even included a transient circus.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin Siegel {{was born}} on February 28, 1906 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to a poor Jewish family from Letychiv, Podolia Governorate of the Russian Empire, in modern Ukraine. However, other sources state that his family came from Austria. His parents, Jennie (Riechenthal) and Max Siegel, {{constantly}} worked for meager wages. Siegel, the second of five children, vowed that he would rise above that life. As a boy, Siegel left school and joined a gang on Lafayette Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He committed mainly thefts until he met Moe Sedway. With Sedway, Siegel developed a <b>protection</b> <b>racket</b> where pushcart merchants were forced to pay him a dollar or he would incinerate their merchandise. Siegel had a criminal record that included armed robbery, rape and murder dating back to his teenage years.|$|E

He starts seeing Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), but the relationship stalls when Kathy returns briefly in 1999 and sleeps with Grant. Before Kathy returns to South Africa, she asks Phil {{to go with her}} but he declines as Grant has planned an armed robbery and Phil refuses to let him do the job alone. Infuriated by Phil's loyalty to Grant, Kathy reveals their recent tryst, leading to Phil confronting Grant and Grant's confession that he slept with Kathy as revenge for Phil's affair with Sharon. While trying to escape, Phil pulls out a gun and shoots at the dashboard, causing Grant to crash into the River Thames. Phil is rescued and Grant escapes to Brazil. When Grant sends Phil the deeds for his half of The Queen Victoria, he sells it to Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5 to spite Peggy due to her favouritism towards Grant.|$|E

One of them {{challenges}} Wong to a fight and loses, but his friends take Wong hostage in revenge and demand a ransom from Ip. Ip goes to the local wet market as directed, but the meeting ends in a confrontation with a growing mob of Hung Ga students. Ip and Wong fight their way outside to meet Jin Shanzhao, a martial artist and former bandit, who comes to their rescue with his own gang. The students' master {{and head of the}} coalition of Hong Kong martial arts clubs, Hung Chun-nam, arrives to break up the fight. Ip introduces himself, and Hung informs him that before setting up a school, he needs to attend a special fighting ceremony to test his worth. Ip, Wong and Jin are subsequently arrested by Officer Fatso for disturbing the peace but are later released on bail. Hung and Fatso are then shown to be acting as reluctant collectors for the martial arts schools (including Hung's) as part of a <b>protection</b> <b>racket</b> headed by Superintendent Wallace, a corrupt officer in the Hong Kong police.|$|E

At the Blue Boar, Barbican, he made plans with them, and at the Clerkenwell Workhouse, his tricorn adorned with gold braid glittered over 12 year-old pickpockets, in whose company he very often visited Moorfields and its infamous [...] "Sodomites' Walk".

2500|$|Two related {{theories}} {{are based on}} military development and warfare, and the role that these forces played in state formation. Charles Tilly developed an argument that the state developed {{largely as a result}} of [...] "state-makers" [...] who sought to increase the taxes they could gain from the people under their control so they could continue fighting wars. According to Tilly, the state makes war and war makes states. In the constant warfare of the centuries in Europe, coupled with expanded costs of war with mass armies and gunpowder, warlords had to find ways to finance war [...] and control territory more effectively. The modern state presented the opportunity for them to develop taxation structures, the coercive structure to implement that taxation, and finally the guarantee of protection from other states that could get much of the population to agree. Taxes and revenue raising have been repeatedly pointed out as a key aspect of state formation and the development of state capacity. Economist Nicholas Kaldor emphasized on the importance of revenue raising and warned about the dangers of the dependence on foreign aid. Tilly argues, state making is similar to organized crime because it is a [...] "quintessential <b>protection</b> <b>racket</b> with the advantage of legitimacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1955, Miller {{returned}} to Stories of the Century {{to star in}} her most famous role—Margaret [...] "Jonesy" [...] Jones. The series concerned a pair of railroad detectives dealing with cases from the 1850s to {{the first decade of}} the 20th century, [...] "wrapping them around previously shot films and serials to save money." [...] This gave the series the illusion of a much bigger budget. Typically, the Jones character would do reconnaissance before Matt Clark (Jim Davis) arrived, misleading everyone into thinking the two were not working together. Originally Miller was to star in the series, but was unable due to her first pregnancy. As a result, Mary Castle, a Rita Hayworth lookalike, took her place for the first 26 episodes. Castle had portrayed Clark's fellow detective Frankie Adams. After Castle quit or was fired, Miller replaced her, much to the disappointment of the then director, William Witney, who left after directing a few episodes with Miller. Despite the change of leading lady and the replacement of Witney, Stories of the Century with Miller went on to be the first Western to win an Emmy Award in 1955. Despite the award and excellent ratings, the series was cancelled. Miller's favorite episode is [...] "Jim Courtright," [...] in which her character poses as a seductive barmaid while infiltrating a <b>protection</b> <b>racket.</b> In Miller's last episode of the series, she and Davis investigate a horse theft by the outlaw L.H. Musgrove.|$|E
