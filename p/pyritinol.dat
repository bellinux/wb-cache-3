50|$|All forms except pyridoxic {{acid and}} <b>pyritinol</b> can be interconverted. Absorbed {{pyridoxamine}} {{is converted to}} PMP by pyridoxal kinase, which is further converted to PLP by pyridoxamine-phosphate transaminase or pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase which also catalyzes the conversion of PNP to PLP. Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase is dependent on flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a cofactor which is produced from riboflavin (vitamin B2) i.e. in this biochemical pathway, dietary vitamin B6 cannot be used without vitamin B2.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a nootropic, <b>Pyritinol,</b> on the {{recovery}} of cortical cholinergic deficits induced by injury of the nucleus basalis has been tested on two groups of unilateral quisqualic acid nbM-lesioned rats. The first group had a 30 nmol lesion producing a cortical cholinergic impairment at 21 days, with a spontaneous recovery at 45 days. The second group had a 50 nmol lesion that produced a deeper cholinergic deficit, which did not recover at 45 days. <b>Pyritinol</b> enhanced the recovery in the 30 nmol group of animals on the 21 st day after surgery. The recovery was measured as {{an increase in the}} activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) and the high affinity choline uptake system, and the histochemical densities of the cortical AChE network and the M 2 receptor. Histochemical analysis of the nbM enabled cortical recovery {{to be related to the}} number of surviving neurons and also to their hypertrophy and AChE-ChAT hyperactivity. <b>Pyritinol</b> enhanced recovery in 30 nmol lesioned animals but in the other group, with a lower number of surviving neurons and a lower ability of the cells to become hypertrophic, the drug was unable to promote cortical recovery.

40|$|Perinatal hypoxia {{has been}} {{recognized}} as apossible cause of mental and physicalhandicaps in childhood for more than 100 years(1). Approximately 23 % of the 4 million annual global neonatal deaths are attributable to birth asphyxia(2). In a prospective cohort study undertaken in the principal maternity hospital of Kathmandu, an upper estimate for the prevalence of major neuro-impairment at 1 year, attributable to birth asphyxia was 1 per 1000 live births(3). The best predictive risk factors for the neurological prognosis at follow-up {{is reported to be}} severe perinatal asphyxia at birth and/or evidence of encephalopathy in neonatal period(4, 5). Newborn encephalopathy (Grades I, II and III), particularly with seizures and recurrent apnea, has been demonstrated to be an important predictor of subsequent motor and cognitive handicaps(6 - 9). Clinical presentation of birth asphyxia with severe newborn depression has demonstrated that most children who survived with sequelae had clinical signs of encephalopathy during the neonatal period(10). <b>Pyritinol</b> or <b>pyritinol</b> dihydrochloride mono-hydrate, is a derivative of pyridoxine with a chemical structure of two pyridoxine molecules linked by a disulphide bridge and has only 0. 1 % of vitamin B...|$|E
40|$|Acetylcholine (Ach) is a {{neurotransmitter}} {{considered to}} {{play a critical role}} in processes underlying behavior, learning, and memory. <b>Pyritinol</b> (pyrithioxine, Encephabol â, PRT) is a nootropic drug that increases cholinergic transmission in the central nervous system. Behavioral habituation following multiple exposures to an open field is an experimental paradigm frequently used to assess the cognitive actions of drugs. In this paradigm the decrease of exploratory activity as a function of repeated exposure to the same environment is taken as an index memory. In the present study, effects PRT administrated to aged rats in powder form added to the diet (200 mg /kg / day, p. o., for 14 days) were evaluated in the habituation to an open field. A total of 18 aged rats were randomly assigned to one of two groups control (vehicle-treated rats, n = 8) and experimental group (PRT-treated rats, n = 10) and were used in the following procedure. In the exploratory task, the post-training treatment with PRT significantly decreased the number of total area crossings and rears when compared to the control group, indicating habituation. PRT treatment enhanced retention in the total number of area crossings and rears when compared with control animals. Taken together, the data of present study suggest that muscarinic cholinergic systems could be involved in the effect of PRT in habituation of exploratory activity to an open field in aged rats...|$|E
40|$|BigPharma and {{unethical}} {{marketing of}} medicinal products Citation: Myhr K. BigPharma and unethical marketing of medicinal products. Southern Med Review (2011) 4; 2 : 48 - 48 doi: 10. 5655 /smr. v 4 i 2. 1000 health focus. So why then promote useless tonics for under-/ malnourished children in poor countries? This case {{reminds me of}} other useless products I have come across such as Encephabol (<b>pyritinol)</b> from the German company, Merck 3. When I worked in Botswana in the late 1980 ’s I received requests from doctors for this – for use in malnourished children as it ‘supposedly improves glucose uptake in the brain’. Surprisingly, that product still exists even in Germany with the indication ‘organic brain disorder’, in other countries also with other indications such as mental function disorder, but officially, not malnutrition. There are of course numerous examples of potentially toxic or irrational products out there and many companies besides the multinationals that market such products. As I write this editorial, I {{have been told that}} Roche is continuing to manufacture Halfan for both children and adults. Halfan contains halofantrine, an antimalarial that has serious side effects but worryingly still seems to be on the French, Portuguese and South African markets 3 as well as in many low- and middle-income countries. By pointing finger at the multinationals, I want to highlight the paradoxes in the research-based companies that on the one side claim to do so much good for public health but continue to produce products detrimental to people’s health. Of particular concern is of course medicines for children. How can large research-based companies defend marketing useless products for malnourished children who need proper nutrition? It is time we start confronting BigPharma also with this side of their business. Other examples will be most welcome on E-drug...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer Disease (AD) {{is a very}} {{important}} medical, social and economical problem in developed countries. Current data on the spanish situation is not available, but we can consider that in a few years, more than 500. 000 people will suffer this neurodegenerative process in our community. Around the world an increasing interest in basic and clinical research on this particular dementia has been produced. Although any animal can suffer spontaneously AD and any agent can induce this disorder, distinct experimental AD-models have been outlined for studying, in laboratories, selected ethipathogenic and therapeutic aspects on AD. The following models can be mentioned as the most important: i) normal senile animals; ii) animals with cerebral beta fibrillosis; and iii) animals with selective lesions in cortical regulatory neuronal systems. The most useful models would be the last ones, supported by the ethiopathogenic theories which are proposed to explain AD, mainly the 'cholinergic theory'. Stereotactic injections of neurotoxins (ibotenic, quisqualic and related acids) in the cholinergic centers of the basal forebrain (the septum, the diagonal band of Broca and the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, the rodent equivalent of the Meynert nucleus in man) that innervate specific parts of brain cortex have been useful {{in the study of the}} changes promoted by anatomical or functional deinnervation. High cortical cholinergic deficits in cholinergic enzymes and choline transport, small receptor deficits and impairment in learning and memory abilities are provoked in the long-term follow-up of these lesioned animals. In the AD-models several therapeutic approaches have been teste. The most promising could be: substitutive cholinomimetic approaches (drug or neuronal implants); NGF and nerve growth factor-like therapeutics; and nootropic treatments. <b>Pyritinol,</b> a nootropic with clinical success in the first phases of AD, has been tested in models obtained alter quisqualic nbm-lesioning. In a model in which a number of surviving neurons can be detected after lesioning, the drug promotes a quick recovery of the depressed cortical cholinergic parameters. This effect has not been observed in a strongly nbm-lesioned model. The necessity of an early diagnosis of AD is strongly stressed to obtain the highest benefit from the plastic-hyperactive abilities of the cholinergic neurons before they reach a non-responsive state in their neurodegenerative pathway.
