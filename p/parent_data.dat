50|$|The Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (TARS): Wave 1, 2001, {{explores the}} {{relationship}} qualities and the subjective meanings that motivate adolescent behavior. More specifically, this study seeks {{to examine the}} nature and meaning of adolescent relationship experiences (e.g., with family, peers, and dating partners) {{in an effort to}} discover how experiences associated with age, gender, race, and ethnicity influence the meaning of dating relationships. The study further investigates the relative impact of dating partners and peers on sexual behavior and contraceptive practices, as well as involvement in other problem behaviors that can contribute independently to sexual risk taking. The longitudinal design of the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (TARS) includes a schedule of follow-up interviews occurring one, three, five and ten years after the initial interview. Five waves of data have been collected (2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2010). Data were collected from adolescent respondents through structured in-home interviews utilizing laptop computers. In-depth interviews were conducted at the first wave with a sub-sample (n=100) of the respondents. <b>Parent</b> <b>data</b> was collected via a short, self-administered questionnaire at the first wave.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{temperament and}} character traits using the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory (JTCI) {{in children and}} adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) in comparison with healthy control subjects (HC), and to verify if comorbidity with disruptive behavioral disorders and being currently depressed influence JTCI scores. Methods: A case control study comprising 41 MDD children/adolescents matched to 40 HC by gender and age (8 - 17 years). All participants were assessed diagnostically with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Present and Lifetime (K-SADS-PL). Temperament and character traits were measured with the parent and child versions of JTCI, and depression was evaluated with the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS). Results: According to child and <b>parent</b> <b>data,</b> MDD subjects had significantly higher scores on harm avoidance and novelty seeking, and lower scores on reward dependence, persistence, self-directedness and cooperativeness compared with HC. According to <b>parent</b> <b>data</b> only, MDD subjects significantly differed from HC on self-transcendence (lower spirituality scores and higher fantasy scores). Comorbidity with disruptive behavioral disorders exerted influence on almost all dimensions, in general increasing the mean differences between MDD and HC subjects. Also, being currently depressed did not influence the results, except for reward dependence according to <b>parent</b> <b>data.</b> Limitations: the cross-sectional nature of the study and its limited sample size. Conclusions: MDD children/adolescents have a different temperament and character profile compared to HC subjects. This study supports previous findings of trait-like characteristics of harm avoidance and self-directedness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Introduction: Hearing {{impairment}} and hearing loss are kinds of latent handicap in children. Any abnormality in hearing can affect {{different aspects of}} life. Otoacoustic emissions have been accepted as an appropriate method for screening of hearing loss in neonates. In this study we assessed the hearing status of infants admitted in ICU wards in Yazd. Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study on hearing status of infants admitted in ICU wards of Yazd hospital in 2012 - 2013. Data was collected using a questionnaire involving demographic data of the infants and their <b>parents.</b> <b>Data</b> was gathered from infants’ medical files and interview by their <b>parents.</b> <b>Data</b> was analyzed by SPSS (ver. 20) using chi square test. Results: 514 infants were introduced for primary screening. 82 subjects were referred for the second step of OAE test. Seventy subjects referred for second OAE. Among all 25 infants with hearing impairment, there was no family history of hearing loss, but among the subjects with normal hearing, 5 subjects showed hearing loss. Conclusion: Hearing loss in neonates admitted to NICU is more common than general population. Early diagnosis of hearing impairment is essential for prevention of future disabilities and development of their life quality which explains the need to screen all neonates for hearing impairment...|$|R

40|$|Social and {{emotional}} well-being {{plays an important}} role in young children's development and impacts upon their success in school and in life. Population health and positive psychology perspectives assert that all children can benefit from school based, universal interventions aimed at promoting mental health and enhancing the social {{and emotional}} well-being of young children. A non-clinical sample of preschool age children (N = 42) participated in a classroom based, universal social and emotional well-being program titled Fun FRIENDS. Teachers and parents reported on children's social and emotional wellbeing using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Data was collected at three time points, allowing changes in social and emotional well-being to be tracked over a period of time. Teacher reported data indicated that several areas of social and emotional difficulty, specifically the emotional symptoms of all children, hyperactivity of boys, and the emotional symptoms, hyperactivity and overall social and emotional difficulties of girls, decreased during the time that the Fun FRIENDS program was implemented. Effect sizes for these observed changes were in the medium to large range. In the absence of a control group, the effects of natural maturation cannot be dismissed as influencing these changes in social and emotional well-being and so results must be interpreted with caution. <b>Parent</b> <b>data</b> identified no significant changes in children's social and emotional well-being over the duration of the study. Further research is needed to explore the discrepancy between teacher and <b>parent</b> <b>data</b> and to evaluate the program more thoroughly with a control group for comparison. ...|$|E

40|$|Children's fears {{have been}} the focus of a great deal of {{research}} over the past 10 - 15 years. Studies have centered on the developmental nature and frequency of children's fears, delineating the essential components of certain fears, as well as evaluating the efficacy of various treatment procedures. The present study examined the effects of three behavioral techniques on children's fear of the dark. Nine children who demonstrated a clinical fear of the dark were seen at a university clinic for two, one-half hour sessions each week over a seven week period, with follow-up assessment occurring one and two months after treatment. The three treatments employed were: symbolic modeling, self-instructional training and contact desensitization. A multiple baseline design across subjects was utilized, with dependent measures consisting of the motoric, cognitive, and physiological components of each child's fear and <b>parent</b> <b>data</b> were collected. Significant changes in dark tolerance between baseline and treatment were most consistently observed in those children receiving the symbolic modeling procedure. The next condition yielding the most consistent changes in duration between baseline and treatment was the contact desensitization treatment. No appreciable changes were found in the children in the self-instructional condition. The self-report and heart rate measures failed to demonstrate strong, reliable changes for any subject in the study except for one subject whose heart rate significantly increased after intervention. Examination of <b>parent</b> <b>data</b> yielded inconsistent results across conditions, thereby limiting any conclusions regarding generalization. The results were discussed in relation to the literature on fear reduction techniques. Limitations of the present study were discussed and topics for future research were delineated...|$|E
