50|$|Soil is well {{developed}} in the forest {{as suggested by the}} thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as <b>podzolization.</b> This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.|$|E
5000|$|Precipitation in grasslands {{is equal}} to or less than {{evapotranspiration}} and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and <b>podzolization.</b> The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.|$|E

50|$|Tropical forests (rainforests) {{receive more}} {{insolation}} and rainfall over longer growing seasons {{than any other}} environment on earth.

Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no <b>podzolization</b> and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this work is to review {{publications}} and present a novel approach to the interpretation of available data in attempt to explain process of <b>podzolization.</b> First, we consider all major inputs that affect podzol formation from global to microscopic scale - climate, parent material, vegetation, mycorrhizal fungi, and fire regime in the podzol areas. Important role of fire-produced charcoal in the <b>podzolization</b> process due to its specific properties is also considered. Subsequently, physico-chemical transitions upon the downward progression of <b>podzolization</b> front (i. e., C to Bs, Bs to Bhs, and Bhs to E) are treated, {{in conjunction with the}} characterization of secondary phases that precipitate in the Bs horizon, as well as the demonstration of the major role of organic matter in the formation of podzols. Organic carriers exuded by plants and fungi are shown both to decrease mobility of certain elements (e. g., Ca, Al) by the formation of secondary solid phases, and also to increase mobility of otherwise unavailable elements (e. g., Fe) by their chelating abilities.

40|$|The {{process of}} <b>podzolization</b> and the {{formation}} of Spodosol-like soils in well-drained tundra has been questioned. Standard chemical analyses fail to distinguish between Spodosol-like soils in boreal forest and tundra. As an alternate method to assess present soil processes, tension lysimeters were placed under the horizons of Spodosol-like soils at three sites to collect in situ soil solution. Soil solu-tions obtained by irrigating the soil with deionized water were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, CaZ+, Mg 2 +, K+, iron, and total organiccarbon. Soils from the lysimeter sites were analyzed for pyro-phosphate and dithionite extractable Fe and Al. In the boreal forest, solid phase and soil solution analyses indicate that the process of <b>podzolization</b> has occurred and is currently occurring. In the boreal forest and tundra transition site, analyses show that <b>podzolization</b> occurs sporadically in wet years. In the tundra, conventional analyses indicate that <b>podzolization</b> has occurred; soil solution indi-cates a weak expression of this process. This study reveals the existence of latitudinal pedogenic gradients related to climate, productivity and biomass degradation, and mineral weathering.

The fungi probably form micropores by exuding strongly complexing low-molecular weight organic acids at their hyphal tips, causing highly local dissolution of Al silicates. Micropores occurred in all thin sections of podzols under Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies available from Sweden (3), Finland (2), Switzerland (2), Denmark (2) and the Netherlands (3), but not in the few available thin sections of non-podzolic soils under broadleaves. Many weatherable minerals in the podzol E horizon appeared to be perforated, as opposed to few if any in the abruptly underlying B horizon, suggesting a link to <b>podzolization.</b> High concentrations of Al and Si in organic surface horizons under boreal and temperate conifers can be explained by transfer by hypha of weathering products from the minerals to mycorrhizal roots in the O horizon, followed by release of weathering products that are not taken up by the plants.

We investigated this process in a toposequence of Luvisols and Cambisols on loess using selective extraction and mineralogical data as well as characteristics of the leaf litter. The humus type (O and OAh horizons) is a moder in the three Luvisols and one of the Cambisols, whereas it is a fibrimor in the two other Cambisols. The contents in total alkaline and alkaline-earth cations range from 35 to 60 cmol(c) kg(- 1) in the fibrimor and from 40 to 90 cmol(c) kg(- 1) in the moder humus.

40|$|In Antarctica, ornithogenic soils from penguin guano play an {{important}} role in nutrient cycles in the ecosystem. Soil organic matter (SOM) degradation and translocation are the main determinants of these dynamics, of which <b>podzolization</b> is probably one, in ornithogenic soil. The purpose of this study is to describe the SOM in the older ornithogenic soils of Coastal Continental Antarctica in order to learn more about the organic matter of these soils. The SOM investigations were carried out by means of wet chemical SOM analyses and carbon- 13 and nitrogen- 15 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The purpose is to compare these data with those obtained from spodic horizons formed under temperate climate conditions. This comparison should provide the first information concerning the possibility of <b>podzolization</b> in Antarctica. In contrast to the spodic horizons in Germany, the SOM of the antarctic soils is characterized by a high percentage of amino derivates from proteins, polysaccharides, urates, and chitin, resulting in a mean C-to-N ratio of 10 and a high content of carboxyl carbon units, which probably derived from amino and other organic acids. The 15 N-NMR spectrum of penguin guano suggests the presence of uric acid (2, 6, 8 -trioxypurine).

40|$|The {{weathering}} and {{formation of}} minerals in Podzols and the hypotheses on {{the mechanism of}} <b>podzolization</b> are discussed {{in accord with the}} composition of active fraction (colloids and soil solution) and physico-chemical parameters (pe-pH) of horizons of Ortic Podzols from Galicia (NW Spain). Two different geochemical environments are established in Ortic Podzols. The first one, that includes surface horizons (A and E), is characterized by the predominance of dissolution of primary minerals through a mechanism of "acid-complexolysis” and by the nearly total absence of mineral formation. Under these conditions, only kaolinite can be stable, being promoted by high temperatures and a lowering in the activity of organic matter. lmogolite, halloysite and gibbsite are always unstable. In the second environment, represented by the spodic horizons (Bh and Bs), the conditions are controlled by weaker acids than above (CO 2, hydroxy-AI ions [...] ), the weathering mechanisms range from hydrolysis to moderately acid hydrolysis and the geochemical processes are defined as “aluminosiallitization” or “monosiallltization”. Kaolinite is always a stable mineral, and metastable phases like imogolite, gibbsite and sometimes halloysite can be precipitated from soil solution or formed as the mineralization of organic ligands proceeds. The mechanism of <b>podzolization</b> supported by experimental data is the migration of organo-metallic complexes, and there are not evidences that justify the presence of protoimogolite in surface horizons. lmogolite or protoimogolite must not be considered as typical phases of surface horizons during <b>podzolization,</b> but as characteristic components of environments with moderate acidity and low organic matter activity. This kind of conditions occurs in spodic horizons of Ortic Podzols and in surface (A) and weathering (B) horizons of acid soils without albic horizons...|$|E

Nevertheless, a clear link between isotopic fractionation and elementary processes {{still needs to be}} established. To spatially distinguish the mechanisms successively involved in pedogenesis, we studied a podzolic chronosequence from Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada). We analyzed depth variations in soil properties (pH, particle size fractions, organic carbon, Si/AI ratio, Zr, Ti), Fe concentrations in different Fe pools, and Fe isotopic compositions. The Si/Al ratio, Zr, and Ti demonstrated that the Cox Bay Podzols developed from the same parental material, satisfying the requirements of a chronosequence. We showed that acidification, to a pH of 4. 7, was a prerequisite for the start of <b>podzolization.</b> This first phase took place after 270 years. Furthermore, we observed that once the required pH was reached (4. 7), <b>podzolization</b> occurred rapidly over 50 years.

40|$|Morphological, geochemical and mineralogical {{studies were}} carried out in a {{representative}} soil catena of the low-elevation plateaux of the upper Amazon Basin to interpret the steps and mechanisms involved in the <b>podzolization</b> of low-activity clay soils. The soils are derived from Palaeozoic sandstones. They consist of Hydromorphic Podzols under tree savannah in the depressions of the plateaux and predominantly of Acrisols covered by evergreen forest elsewhere. Incipient <b>podzolization</b> in the uppermost Acrisols is related to the formation of organic-rich A and Bhs horizons slightly depleted in fine-size particles by both mechanical particle transfer and weathering. Weathering of secondary minerals by organic acids and formation of organo-metallic complexes act simultaneously over short distances. Their vertical transfer is limited. Selective dissolution of aluminous goethite, then gibbsite and finally kaolinite favour the preferential cheluviation of first Fe and secondly Al. The relatively small amount of organo-metallic complexes produced is related to the quartzitic parent materials, and the predominance of Al over Fe in the spodic horizons is due to the importance of gibbsite in these low-activity clay soils. Morphologically well-expressed podzols occur in strongly iron-depleted topsoils of the depression. Mechanical transfer and weathering of gibbsite and kaolinite by organic acids is enhanced and leads to residual accumulation of sands. Organo-metallic complexes are translocated in strongly permeable sandy horizons and impregnate at depth the macro-voids of embedded soil and saprolite materials to form the spodic Bs and 2 BCs horizons. Mechanical transfer of black particulate organic compounds devoid of metals has occurred later within the sandy horizons of the podzols. Their vertical transfer has formed well-differentiated A and Bh horizons. Their lateral removal by groundwater favours the development of an albic E horizon. In an open and waterlogged environment, the general trend is therefore towards the removal of all the metals that have initially accumulated {{as a response to the}} ferralitization process and have temporarily been sequestrated in organic complexes in previous stages of soil <b>podzolization...</b>|$|E

We studied this process in two Cambisol profiles developed in loess, one with a fibrimor humus and the other with a dysmoder humus, by characterizing the chemical composition and the complexing properties of the soil solution. The solutions were sampled bimonthly for 3 years at four depths (4, 8, 13, 25 cm) using both zero-tension and low-tension capillary-wick lysimeters. The leachates from the Ah horizon of the soil with fibrimor contained less nitrate, sulphate and calcium than those from the one with a dysmoder because there was less bioturbation and mineralization in it. Both the complexation capacity and the density of ligand binding sites were larger in the soil solutions of the Ah (4 cm) and AB (8 cm) horizons of the soil with the fibrimor. In this soil, the complexing properties of the liquid phase induced a depletion of inorganic monomeric aluminium. In this environment, the hydroxy interlayered 2 : 1 clay minerals lose their Al-interlayers and transform into vermiculite and smectite, which in turn weather, producing large amounts of magnesium in the soil solution. This was found to be a major characteristic of weathering by complexation and incipient <b>podzolization</b> in the Cambisol with the fibrimor.

This work was carried out on soils developed on recent (94 % of sand) and exhibit a bleached E horizon that overlies a yellowish brown B horizon. The process responsible for their formation is <b>podzolization</b> promoted by the high permeability of the material and complexing organic matter produced by coniferous vegetation. Initial mineralogy of C horizons is homogenous and constituted of chlorite, illite, illite/smectite mixed-layer minerals, and kaolinite, quartz, calcite (≈ 8 % related to shell fragments), and feldspars. The initial clay-mineral assemblage of the E horizons is dominated by illite (well-crystallized WCI and poorly crystallized PCI) and chlorite. With progressive <b>podzolization,</b> poorly crystallized illite is first transformed to illite/ smectite mixed-layer minerals and in a further step into smectite. In addition, transformation of well-crystallized illite leads to formation of ordered illite/smectite mixed-layer minerals in the E horizons, which is not commonly described in soils. In the B horizons, illite/smectite mixed-layer minerals are present with traces of smectite, as well as Al and Fe oxi-hydroxides as revealed by DCB and oxalate chemical extractions.

In the Ahb horizon, a contribution from buriedve getation to the total lipidsi gnal is still present, although degradation and an input from roots have significantly altered the original signal. Overall, lipid data indicate that degradation (microbial oxidation) is an important process that should be taken into account, in addition to leaching, when describing <b>podzolization</b> processes in soils...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} soil {{characteristics}} of selected localities on Smrk Mt. and Kněhyně Mt. in the Moravian-Silesian Beskids (38 segments of forest ecosystems). Based {{on the main}} soil forming factors defined for studied soils the correctness of classification of groups of forest types into edaphic categories localities were evaluated. Six main soil forming factors were detected. Some of the soils were strongly influenced by surplus {{of water in the}} profile. Regardless the altitude, the most soils contained considerable share of skeleton. On the rest of the localities, the main soil forming factors were the cambic and <b>podzolization</b> processes. Both of these pedogenic processes (either of them being dominant) were found at most of the localities. Two of the forest soils were predominantly affected by fluvial processes. This soil survey was a part of an extensive multithematic research...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} long-termed {{cultivation}} of spruce stands and of acid atmospheric pollutants was studied on vertical transect in the Working-plan area Forests of city Spišská Nová Ves. Statistical analyses {{showed that the}} mean values of active and exchange reactions found in loamy sand Podzols were significantly lower compared with sandy loam to loam Cambisols. The results showed, that the active reaction in A horizons of Cambisols was already shifted below value 3. 9, i. e. {{in the span of}} oligotrophic order of geobiocoens. The process of <b>podzolization</b> is reversible, because the albic horizons of Podzols were not still formed. The loamy sand Podzols occurring in upper part of transect are reach in skeleton (80 [...] 90 %) and their maximum water capacity represents only 60 [...] 80 mm of water column (28 [...] 58 % of water capacity in studied Cambisols) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the upper}} Amazon Basin, {{aluminum}} previously accumulated in lateritic formations is massively remobilised in soils by <b>podzolization</b> and exported in waters. We {{have investigated the}} speciation of aluminum in the clay-size fractions of eight horizons of waterlogged podzols lying in a depression of a plateau. The horizons illustrate the main steps involved in the <b>podzolization</b> of laterites. They belong to eluviated topsoil A horizons and illuviated subsoil Bhs, Bh and 2 BCs horizons of weakly and better-expressed podzols located at the margin and centre of the depression. For the first time, aluminum speciation is quantitatively assessed in soils by spectroscopic methods, namely FTIR, 27 Al magic angle spinning (MAS) and multiple-quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results thus obtained are compared to chemical extraction data. Solid-state 27 Al MAS NMR spectra enable to distinguish Al bound to organic compounds from that incorporated in secondary mineral phases detected by FTIR. MQMAS experiments additionally show that both chemical shifts and quadrupolar constants are distributed for Al nuclei linked with organic compounds. Similar amounts of chelated Al are obtained from NMR spectra and chemical extractions. The study enables to highlight three major steps in the fate of aluminum. (i) Aluminum is first released by mineral weathering, feeds complexing sites of organic matter and accumulates in subsurface Bhs horizons of weakly expressed podzols (acidocomplexolysis). (ii) Complexes of aluminum with organic matter (Al–OM) then migrate downwards in sandy horizons of better-expressed podzols and accumulate at depth in less permeable 2 BCs horizons. (iii) The minor amounts of aluminum present in the 2 BCs horizon of the downslope podzol show that aluminum is eventually exported towards the river network, either complexed with organic matter or as Al 3 + ions after desorption from organic compounds, due to decreasing pH or biodegradation of organic ligands. The direct spectroscopic determination of Al-speciation during the formation of podzolic soils opens new perspectives to trace metal loads in the rivers of the upper Amazon Basin...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} soil and {{vegetation}} characteristics within a small area of coastal heath near The Gap, Albany, Western Australia, showed that significant differences exist in plant species composition between podzol and non-podzol (calcareous) soil environments. Leaf extracts of common plant species from podzol, non-podzol and transitional soil sites were tested {{for their ability to}} complex with iron. Only those species on the podzol and transitional soils proved to have this ability. Soil column experiments tested the rates of iron mobilization and results indicate that the podzol vegetation elutant solution, which was found to contain the iron-complexing agent gallic acid, was superior to the non-podzol vegetation elutant solution in the rate at which it mobilized iron. It is suggested that initiation of <b>podzolization</b> is due to the presence of gallic acid in the leaves of certain of the species in the coastal heath association, and that the pattern of podzol distribution can be linked to both plant succession and inherent differences in soil parent material...|$|E
40|$|The 13 C/ 12 C ratios were {{determined}} for the organic matter of all horizons of a podzol profile {{and of the}} A 1 horizons of some ferrallitic soils, in some grass shoots and in a fossil root fragment from the B 2 h horizon of the podzol. The isotope ratio in the organic matter of the A 1 horizon of the podzol matches those in grass shoots from the present savanna vegetation. The ratios in the lower horizons match those of organic matter in the A 1 horizons of soils under forest {{and that of the}} fossil root fragment in the B 2 h horizon. The ratios thus demonstrate that the humus enrichment of the B 2 h horizon of the podzol occurred while it was under forest vegetation and that the present grass vegetation did not take part in the <b>podzolization</b> process. The differences also indicate that savanna replaced forest vegetation after the profile had been formed...|$|E
40|$|The {{methods of}} {{quantifying}} atmospheric vs. internal effects on leaching {{described in this}} paper illustrate certain basic principles which {{can be applied to}} an analysis of a broad range of existing data sets. As with any attempt to generalize from site specific data, there are shortcomings, but certain patterns seem to emerge. With regard to natural leaching processes, organic acids may {{play a major role in}} cold region soils undergoing <b>podzolization,</b> carbonic acid may play a major role in tropical and temperate soils, and nitric acid may play a major role in nitrogen-rich soils (such as those with N-fixing vegetation). Verification of these patterns by further site specific information is required before generalizations can be safely made, but the methods and assumptions leading to the evaluation of controlling processes in each of these ecosystems are fundamentally sound and applicable to the central issue of the relative importance of atmospheric acid deposition to soil leaching...|$|E
