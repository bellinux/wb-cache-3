5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>on</b> all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler and the NSDAP came to <b>power</b> <b>on</b> 30 January 1933, the SS were {{considered}} a state organization and {{a branch of}} the government. Law enforcement gradually became the purview of the SS, and many SS organizations became de facto government agencies.|$|E

5|$|Bolt was {{a member}} of the silver medal winning relay team with Asafa Powell, Marvin Anderson, and Nesta Carter in the 4×100 metres relay. Jamaica set a {{national}} record of 37.89 s. Bolt did not win any gold medals at the major tournaments in 2007, but Mills felt that Bolt's technique was much improved, pinpointing improvements in Bolt's balance at the turns over 200 m and an increase in his stride frequency, giving him more driving <b>power</b> <b>on</b> the track.|$|E
5|$|Built to {{a height}} of 100 metres (328ft), the PUB Building was {{completed}} in 1977; construction cost S$32 million.

The Singapore Power Building was renovated in 2006, when Singapore Power chose not to redevelop its corporate headquarters.

Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E
