50|$|Denmark has a <b>penalty</b> <b>point</b> <b>system</b> that penalizes {{drivers with}} a klip ("cut/stamp") for certain traffic violations. The term klip {{refers to a}} klippekort ("punch card ticket"). If a driver with a non-probationary license accumulates three <b>penalty</b> <b>points,</b> then police conditionally suspend the driver's license. To get a new license, {{suspended}} drivers must pass both written and practical drivers examinations. Drivers who have been suspended and first-time drivers must avoid collecting two <b>penalty</b> <b>points</b> for a three-year probationary period; if the driver has not accumulated any <b>penalty</b> <b>points,</b> then the driver is allowed an extra <b>penalty</b> <b>point</b> so they can have three maximum. <b>Penalty</b> <b>points</b> are deleted from the police database three years after they were assessed.

50|$|In 1971, the <b>penalty</b> <b>point</b> <b>system</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} into eventing. This system converts the dressage score and all jump penalties on cross-country and show jumping into <b>penalty</b> <b>points,</b> with the horse and rider with the fewest number of points winning the event. Different weight is given for each phase, with the cross-country — the heart of eventing — being the most important, followed by the dressage, and then the show jumping. The intended ratio of cross-country:dressage:show jumping is theoretically 12:3:1. Therefore, an error in cross-country counts heavily. This prevents horses that are simply good in dressage (for example) from winning the event with a poor cross-country test.|$|R

40|$|Background Road traffic {{accidents}} represent an important {{public health problem}} in both industrialised and developing countries. In Italy, around 270, 000 road {{traffic accidents}} occur annually. In 2001 this resulted in 6682 deaths, more than 20 % of which {{were the result of}} an accident among users of two-wheeled motor vehicles [1]. There is evidence that the raise in the speed limit [2] is associated with a sustained increase in traffic related deaths and case fatality rates. On 1 st of July 2003 a new law was implemented,introducing new legal sanctions, the driver license points (after the experience in Germany, France, UK and Ireland, New Zealand and Brasil) [3, 4], new speed limits and camera controls [5]. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the differences in the epidemiological trend of road accidents in Italy, comparing data before and after the implementation of the new <b>penalty</b> <b>points</b> <b>system</b> law...|$|E
40|$|In many legal domains hybrid {{sanctions}} – i. e. {{the joint}} use of both monetary and non-monetary sanctions – are usually applied. We suggest that one possible rationale behind {{this form of}} sanction is targeting group-specific deterrence. For some groups of agents, hybrid sanctions act indeed as a self-selection mechanism such that deterrence is obtained only after a critical threshold of infractions is reached. We apply our model to traffic law infractions and further test it, performing a micro-econometric analysis on a unique dataset of {{a representative sample of}} 50, 000 Italian drivers, over six years (2003 – 2009), after the introduction of a <b>penalty</b> <b>points</b> <b>system.</b> Our findings empirically confirm our theoretical predictions. When repeated infractions are at stake, well-designed hybrid sanctions, such as the penalty point system designed for traffic law enforcement, may indeed increase overall deterrence.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether recent socio-demographic changes and recent {{health and safety}} measures have impacted on the trends of ocular trauma in the South East of Ireland. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all cases of ocular trauma admitted to our department between October 2001 and September 2007, and the following data were retrieved: demographic details; mechanism of injury and nature of injury. RESULTS: During the study period, 517 patients were admitted with ocular trauma. Work-related and home-related activities were the commonest causes of admission, and accounted for 160 (31. 8 %) and 145 (28. 4 %) cases, respectively. In 2006 / 2007, and following the influx of migrant workers from the 10 new EU accession states (EUAS), the incidence of hospitalised ocular injuries per 100, 000 was 89 in persons from the EUAS versus 18 in those of Irish origin, P < or = 0. 0001. After adding the offence of not wearing a seat belt to the traffic <b>penalty</b> <b>point</b> <b>system</b> in Ireland, the proportion of road traffic accident (RTA) -related ocular injuries dropped significantly from 6. 7 % to 2. 4 %, P= 0. 03. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of the offence of not wearing a seat belt in the traffic <b>penalty</b> <b>point</b> <b>system</b> {{may have contributed to}} the significantly lower proportion of hospitalised ocular injuries attributable to RTAs. Also, the demographic profile of patients admitted because of ocular trauma has changed over the last 6 years, reflected in an increasing proportion of these injuries in persons from the EUAS.

40|$|Objectives. We {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the <b>penalty</b> <b>points</b> <b>system</b> (PPS) introduced in Spain in July 2006 in reducing traffic injuries. Methods. We performed an evaluation study with an interrupted time-series design. We stratified dependent variables-numbers of drivers involved in injury collisions and people injured in traffic collisions in Spain from 2000 to 2007 (police data) -by age, injury severity, type of road user, road type, and time of collision, and analyzed variables separately by gender. The explanatory variable (the PPS) compared the postintervention period (July 2006 to December 2007) with the preintervention period (January 2000 to June 2006). We used quasi- Poisson regression, controlling for time trend and seasonality. Results. Among men, we observed a significant risk reduction in the postintervention period for seriously injured drivers (relative risk [RR]= 0. 89) and seriously injured people (RR= 0. 89). The RRs among women were 0. 91 (P=. 095) and 0. 88 (P<. 05), respectively. Risk reduction was greater among male drivers, moped riders, and on urban roads. Conclusions. The PPS was associated with reduced numbers of drivers involved in injury collisions and people injured by traffic collisions in Spain. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Alternative {{materials}} for power poles include concrete, steel, composite and non-treated wooden poles. This report looks at Mälarenergi Elnät ABs 17, 000 creosote coated poles and their patterns of pollution. GIS analyses in ArcGIS were used to evaluate which creosote poles are most critical to replace by implementing a system of "penalty points" based on the spatial distribution of the poles. 15 of the creosote poles were selected for a field study to investigate how much creosote is leaked to the ground. 1, 000 of the power poles were assigned penalty points of 10 or higher which could be a starting point in pole replacement, although the <b>penalty</b> <b>points</b> <b>system</b> could be used in many different ways for this purpose. Of the 15 power poles investigated during the field work, 5 showed higher leakage than recommended by Naturvårdsverkets guidelines for sensitive ground use.

40|$|Background: The <b>penalty</b> <b>points</b> <b>system</b> (PPS) was {{introduced}} in 2002 {{in an attempt to}} reduce the increasing rate of road traffic accident (RTA) related fatalities and serious injuries. Points are awarded based on the severity of the offence and are cumulative. A total of 12 points results in the disqualification from driving. Objective: A few studies have looked at the immediate or short term impact of PPS on trauma services or specific injuries such as spine trauma in Ireland. Little data is available on the long term effect of the PPS. The aim {{of this study is to}} see if the PPS system has had an influence on the number of pelvic injuries referred to our unit for surgical intervention and if this influence is sustained in the longer term. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of all pelvic and acetabular injuries admitted to our unit from 1999 to 2008 was undertaken. The mechanism of injury, the site and patient demographics were noted. Results: A total of 467 patients were identified over the ten year period. 454 patients were included in the study. There was a significant male preponderance of 76 %. Mean age was 36. 5 years (range 16 to 83). RTA′s were the cause in 74 % (n = 335) of the cases. The annual work load remained similar over the years. There has been a reduction in the number of RTA related pelvic injuries. There have been notable drops in the number of these cases corresponding to the introduction of the PPS and its subsequent expansion. The number of pelvic injuries due to falls continues to rise. Conslusion: The introduction of the PPS and its subsequent expansion has had a positive influence on the number of RTA related pelvic trauma. Continued surveillance and enforcement of the PPS is important for a sustained benefit from it in the long term...|$|E
40|$|Getting caught for {{speeding}} is an emotive issue. This paper analyses an unexpected {{source of data}} captured by unprompted comments left {{at the end of}} a questionnaire by a sample of British drivers who all had <b>penalty</b> <b>points</b> on their licences, many {{for speeding}}. The paper’s relevance to roads policing is that perceived fairness of police procedures is crucial in shaping public support, and comments made by this sample of offending drivers indicated that speed limit enforcement through the operation of the speed camera system was often seen as unfair. Since roads policing is closely linked with this, and with many drivers having <b>penalty</b> <b>points</b> on their licences, the views of such drivers could be instructive given the continuing reliance on camera technology and the need for police to offer public reassurance. Finally, the implications for roads policing are considered. 1 Introduction: an unexpected source of data Britain was one of the first countries to operate a <b>penalty</b> <b>point</b> <b>system</b> that can lead to disqualification.

40|$|Background: Black {{and white}} pain {{drawings}} were introduced as a proposed means to identify patients, presenting with low back pain, who demonstrated functional overlay upon neurological testing. The {{use of color}} may enhance the usefulness of such pain drawings, but has not been described for adult patients. Aims: To retrospectively explore the use of colored pain drawings in patients with neck, low back, or radicular pain. Methods: Patients with neck, low back, or radicular pain referred to a community-based neurosurgical practice for evaluation during 1 year (n = 359) depicted their pain on anatomical drawings using colored pencils representing different pain characteristics. Patients with abnormal (n = 55) and normal (n = 54) pain drawings were selected for this study. Use of medications, findings on physical examination, radiographic findings, activity levels, Waddell signs, and pending litigation were recorded and compared between patients with normal and abnormal pain drawings, as assessed according to the Ransford <b>penalty</b> <b>point</b> <b>system.</b> Results: Patients whose colored pain drawings were abnormal, demonstrated a greater use of medications, more non-focal clinical findings, Waddell signs, impaired activity levels, involvement in pending litigation, and significantly fewer pathological radiographic findings than patients with normal pain drawings. Conclusions: Our findings agree with previous observations using black and white pain drawings, indicating that colored pain drawings are no less useful than {{the black and white}} approach. Further research is necessary to examine the psychometric properties and clinical usefulness of colored pain drawings to predict outcomes and/or determine treatment.

40|$|Objective: To assess {{differences}} between the risk of injury for motorcycle riders {{before and after the}} passing of a law allowing licenced car drivers to drive light motorcycles without having to take a special motorcycle driving test. Methods: We carried out a quasi-experimental study involving comparison groups, and a time-series analysis from 1 January 2002 to 30 April 2008. The study group was composed of people injured while driving or riding a light motorcycle (engine capacity 51 - 125 cubic centimetres), while the comparison groups consisted of riders of heavy motorcycles (engine capacity > 125 cc), mopeds (engine capacity ≤ 50 cc) or cars who were injured in a collision within the city limits. The >intervention> was a law passed in October 2004 allowing car drivers to drive light motorcycles without taking a special driving test. To detect and quantify changes over time we used Poisson regression, with adjustments for trend and seasonality in road injuries and the existence of a driver's licence <b>penalty</b> <b>point</b> <b>system.</b> Findings: The risk of injury among light motorcycle riders was greater after the law than before (relative risk, RR = 1. 46; 95 % confidence interval, CI: 1. 34 - 1. 60). Although less markedly, after the law the risk of injury also increased among heavy motorcycle drivers (RR = 1. 15; 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 29) but remained unchanged among riders of mopeds (RR = 0. 92; 95 % CI: 0. 83 - 1. 01) and cars (RR = 1. 06; 95 % CI: 0. 97 - 1. 16). Conclusion: Allowing car drivers to drive motorcycles without passing a special test increases the number of road injuries from motorcycle accidents.

40|$|In 2002, a {{large-scale}} traffic survey, known as SARTRE ('Social Attitudes to Road Traffic Risk in Europe'), {{was carried out}} in 23 European countries including the Netherlands. In each participating country, a representative sample of approximately 1000 car driving licence holders was asked about their opinions on measures, speed limits, new technical in-car equipment, crash causes, own and other drivers' traffic behaviour, and experiences with police control etc. This study compares the Dutch results of 2002 with those of 1996 (See ITRD 892353). A number of results of the SARTRE survey are presented here. Dutch motorists regard hands-free phoning less dangerous than hands-on, although research has shown that both ways are equally dangerous. Since 1996, there have been positive changes regarding the wearing of, and attitude towards, the seatbelt. In 1996, four of the ten wanted a higher speed limit on motorways, compared to more than half in 2002. There is much support (more than 70 %) for more bicycle paths in cities and improving the quality of roads. As far as European measures are concerned, more than 70 % supports introducing a <b>penalty</b> <b>point</b> <b>system</b> and a 0 promille alcohol limit for novice drivers. More than 70 % also supports possible new measures, for instance, an obligatory rehabilitation course for drivers who have been caught drink-driving more than once. In spite of a considerable intensifying of traffic enforcement during 1998 - 2002, nearly two-thirds say that they are (strongly) in favour of more police traffic control. However, since 1996, this support for more control has declined slightly. During the period 1996 - 2002, the subjective chance of getting caught for speeding has increased. The Dutch motorist is also compared with the average of motorists from a group of seven European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland). A number of deviations from the average were noted, for example that the Dutch motorist: is more in favour of increased penalties for driving while intoxicated; and is more in favour of higher speed limits on motorways.
