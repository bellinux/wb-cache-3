For any small change in input details, it requires a complete rework of design procedure. Even after following this detailed, time consuming procedure, {{it was very difficult to}} explain the geometry of the <b>pump</b> <b>elements.</b> This paper discusses the optimisation and computerisation of the design procedure of single stage centrifUga 1 pumps.

50|$|Fendt's {{infinitely}} variable transmission (IVT) differs from a continuously variable transmission (CVT) as an IVT can be travelling at 0.0 km/h whilst the transmission is engaged and not in neutral. The IVT/CVT gearbox {{is widely regarded as}} the most fuel efficient gearbox on the agricultural market prompting nearly all other major manufacturers to develop their own system. Manufacturers such as ZF, John Deere and CNH group have also developed very intuitive systems but Fendt's Vario is broadly considered a market leader. Variations can be found on other AGCO tractor brands such Massey Ferguson. The gearbox may be the same however the individual brands have different controls/ joystick and may have different ECU software. The IVT transmissions are extremely popular in the European market and its fuel efficiency puts it in favour of mechanical competitors, however one weakness to the Vario is its power consumption, in comparison to a mechanical transmission, most IVT/CVT gearboxes can lose 10-20 hp in the transmission due to the hydraulic swing <b>pump</b> <b>element</b> of the transmission. The Fendt Vario offers 60 km/h travel speed on its 800 series and 900 series models, this same transmission can also be found in 4000 series JCB tractors. Claas also use the Vario transmission sold under its CMatic brand. Claas use their own control method however it is mechanically identical to that of a Massey Ferguson as Claas use Massey Ferguson transmissions/back end.|$|E
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{continuation}} of previous investigations aimed at developing an innovative microfabricated air-cooling technology that employs an electrohydrodynamic corona discharge (i. e. ionic wind pump) [1], [2]. This technology enables the miniaturization of cooling systems for next generation electronics. Our single ionic wind <b>pump</b> <b>element</b> consists of two parallel collecting electrodes between which a single emitting tip is positioned. Two-dimensional (2 -D) and three-dimensional (3 -D) simulations using COMSOL MultiphysicsTM are additionally employed to predict the temperature distribution, the flow field, and the heat removal capacity of the device in operation. One such model utilizes a small gap between collector and emitter electrodes and demonstrates an improvement in the COP (coefficient of performance) of a single device. Comparisons are made with experimental temperature data on an actual device. The purpose of this work is therefore to optimize the performance of a single microfabricated ionic wind pump to enable the development of an array of these elements for use in larger-scale heat transfer applications.

40|$|Progressive cavity {{pumps are}} used in the transportion of slurries. The <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> {{consists}} of a single helical rotor, which intermeshes with a double helical resilient stator, to create the moving cavities that transport the slurry. Both components suffer from weaL at different rates, due to relative sliding movement of the rotor to the stator, and the presence of the abrasives carried within the slurry. for a pump manufacturer to remain active in the market they must provide the customer with optimised material selection, for both wearing parts, at a competitive price. Wear is not an intrinsic material property and its value is dependent upon the conditions within each individual tribological system. In order to improve or optimise the wear life of a system, it is first vital to understand the complexity of the mechanisms that generate the material loss. This thesis achieves this goal, with specific reference to a pumping system, by analysing the wear mechanisms of the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> components in progressive cavity pumps and evaluating how the wear severity changes with the system parameters. The in-depth study has enabled a new wear model to be proposed which describes how the behaviour of the abrasive particles contribute to the wearing process, in the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> of a progressive cavity pump. Hard particle laboratory wear tests were reviewed and assessed to determine their suitability for assessing the wear performance of rotor and stator materials. It was concluded that no one standard laboratory test was suitable and recommendations are given for two tribometers which specifically meet the tribological needs of the pumping syste...|$|R

40|$|Methods for a {{blood pump}} bearing system within a pump housing to support {{long-term}} high-speed rotation of a rotor with an impeller blade having {{a plurality of}} individual magnets disposed thereon to provide a small radial air gap between the magnets and a stator of less than 0. 025 inches. The bearing system may be mounted within a flow straightener, diffuser, or other <b>pump</b> <b>element</b> to support the shaft of a pump rotor. The bearing system includes a zirconia shaft having a radiused end. The radiused end has a first radius selected to be about three {{times greater than the}} radius of the zirconia shaft. The radiused end of the zirconia shaft engages a flat sapphire endstone. Due to the relative hardness of these materials a flat is quickly produced during break-in on the zirconia radiused end of precisely the size necessary to support thrust loads whereupon wear substantially ceases. Due to the selection of the first radius, the change in shaft end-play during pump break-in is limited to a total desired end-play of less than about 0. 010 inches. Radial loads are supported by an olive hole ring jewel that makes near line contact around the circumference of the shaft to support high speed rotation with little friction. The width of olive hole ring jewel is small to allow heat to conduct through to thereby prevent heat build-up in the bearing. A void defined by the bearing elements may fill with blood that then coagulates within the void. The coagulated blood is then conformed to the shape of the bearing surfaces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{a recent}} work from this group (Popovic, D. M.; Stuchebrukhov A. A. FEBS Lett. 2004, 566, 126), {{a model of}} proton pumping by {{cytochrome}} c oxidase (CcO) was proposed. The key element of the model is His 291 (bovine notation), a histidine ligand to enzyme's CuB redox center, which {{plays the role of}} the <b>pump</b> <b>element.</b> The model assumes that upon electron transfer between heme a and the binuclear catalytic center of the enzyme, two sequential proton transfers occur: First, a proton from Glu 242 is transferred to an unprotonated His 291, then a second proton, after reprotonation of Glu 242 from the negative side of the membrane, is transferred to a hydroxyl group in the binuclear center, a water molecule is formed, and the first proton, due to protonâproton repulsion, is expelled from His 291 to the positive side of the membrane, resulting in a pumping event. In the process the free energy of water formation (i. e., reduction of oxygen) is transformed into a proton gradient across the membrane. The model possesses specific kinetic features. It assumes, for example, that upon electron transfer the first proton is transferred to the proton-loading site of the pump, His 291, and not to the catalytic center of the enzyme. Here, we analyze the kinetic properties of the proposed model, and calculate the time dependence of the membrane potential generated by CcO upon a single electron injection into the enzyme. These data are directly compared with recent experimental measurements of the membrane potential generated by CcO. Specifically, F to O, and O to E transitions will be discussed. Several enzymes from different organisms (bovine, two bacterial enzymes, and several mutants) are compared and discussed in detail. The kinetic description, however, is phenomenological, and does not include explicitly the nature of the groups involved in proton translocation, except in terms of their position depth within the membrane; thus, the kinetic equations developed here are in fact describe a generic model, similar, e. g., to that proposed earlier by Peter Rich (P. R. Rich, Towards an understanding of the chemistry of oxygen reduction and proton translocation in the iron-copper respiratory oxidases. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 22 (1995) 479 â 486), and which is based on the idea of displacement of the pumped protons by the chemical ones...|$|E
40|$|Improved efficiency, better {{controllability}} and {{low noise}} {{are the most}} demanding features form a displacement machine now-a-days. Most of the conventional displacement machines are basically a reciprocating <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> controlled by valve plates or {{with the help of}} check valve [1]. This kind of hydraulic machines loose efficiency dramatically at partial displacement because all of the pistons remain at high pressure at the cycle time and due to pressure inside the piston leakage and shear losses increases. One approach to improve the efficiency of the displacement machine can be controlling each hydraulic piston by using programmable faster valves called digital valve. As the total displacement will be controlled digitally, the total system is called Digital Displacement Technology. In digital displacement machine it is possible to disconnect some of the pistons from the load and the piston will connect only with the low pressure side, minimizing losses due to leakage and shear. As the valve will control directly with digital controller it will eliminate the necessity of servo-hydraulic control required by conventional systems. Digital valves can open fully and close again with the input signal within one revaluation of the shaft, so it gives better control to the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> results reduction in hysteresis and increase the linearity of the <b>pumping</b> <b>element.</b> In Digital Displacement machines by controlling the valves pistons are connected with the machine when pressure is equal, but in the traditional machines piston connection was pre-determined with the shaft angle.

Also energy storage and recovery can be possible by using accumulator...|$|R
