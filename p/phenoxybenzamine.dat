Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves and a right shift in the curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored.|$|E

The older, broadly non-selective alpha blocker medications such as <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> are not recommended for control of BPH.

Additional blocking agents were found such as tolazoline in Switzerland and <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> in the United States, but like the ergot alkaloids they blocked only the smooth muscle excitatory receptors. Additional agonists also were synthesized. Outstanding among them became isoprenaline, N-isopropyl-noradrenaline, of Boehringer Ingelheim, studied pharmacologically along with adrenaline and other N-substituted noradrenaline derivatives by Richard Rössler (1897–1945) and Heribert Konzett (1912–2004) in Vienna. The Viennese pharmacologists used their own Konzett-Rössler test to examine bronchodilation. Intravenous injection of pilocarpine to induce bronchospasm was followed by intravenous injection of the agonists. “Arrangement of all amines according to their bronchodilator effect yields a series from the most potent, isopropyl-adrenaline, via the approximately equipotent bodies adrenaline, propyl-adrenaline and butyl-adrenaline, to the weakly active isobutyl-adrenaline.” Isoprenaline also exerted marked positive chronotropic and inotropic effects.

Ahlquist solved the ″myoneural junction″ riddle. “By virtue of this property the reputation of the substance spread all over the world and it became a tool for many investigations on different aspects of pharmacology and therapeutics.” The story had a dark side: overdosage caused numerous deaths due to cardiac side effects, an estaimated three thousands in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenoxybenzamine</b> {{also has}} {{irreversible}} antagonist/weak partial agonist properties at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.

50|$|<b>Phenoxybenzamine</b> {{is used as}} an {{anti-hypertensive}} due to its efficacy {{in reducing}} the vasoconstriction caused by epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. <b>Phenoxybenzamine</b> forms a permanent covalent bond with adrenergic receptors. Based on known information about the structures of these receptors, it likely involves attack by the cysteine at position 3.36 in transmembrane helix 3 to form a stable linkage. Thus, it remains permanently bound to the receptor, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. This causes vasodilatation in blood vessels, due to its antagonistic effect at the alpha-1 adrenoceptor found in the walls of blood vessels, resulting in a drop in blood pressure. A side effect of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> is reflex tachycardia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Phenoxybenzamine</b> {{has long}} been known to block {{ejaculation}} without affecting semen quality or ability to achieve orgasm, which could make it an effective male contraceptive.

50|$|<b>Phenoxybenzamine</b> has a {{long-lasting}} action, binding covalently to {{the alpha}} receptors.

Typically, <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> is not used in the long term, as new receptors are made to upregulate alpha stimulation. The main limiting side-effects of alpha antagonists is that the baroreceptor reflex is disrupted and thus this can cause postural hypotension.|$|E

5000|$|In 1969 Collins [...] {{reported}} {{an improvement in}} the results that could be achieved with simple non perfusion methods of hypothermic kidney storage.

In Collins' model, the dogs were well hydrated prior to nephrectomy, and were also given mannitol to induce a diuresis. <b>Phenoxybenzamine,</b> a vasodilator and lysozomal enzyme stabiliser, was injected into the renal artery before nephrectomy. The kidneys were immersed in saline immediately after removal, and perfused through the renal artery with 100-150 ml of a cold electrolyte solution from a height of 100 cm.

The solution used for these successful cold perfusions imitated the electrolyte composition of intracellular fluids by containing large amounts of potassium and magnesium. The solution also contained glucose, heparin, procaine and <b>phenoxybenzamine.</b> The solution's pH was 7.0 at 25 °C. Collins was able to achieve successful 24-hour storage of 6 kidneys, and 30 hour storage of 3 kidneys, with the kidneys functioning immediately after reimplantation, despite immediate contralateral nephrectomies. Collins emphasised the poor results obtained with a Ringer's solution flush, in finding similar results with this management when compared with kidneys treated by surface cooling alone. Liu [...] reported that Collins' solution could give successful 48-hour storage when the solution was modified by the inclusion of amino acids and vitamins. However, Liu performed no control experiments to show that these modifications were crucial.|$|E

Some authorities would recommend that a combined alpha/beta blocker such as labetalol also be given in order to slow the heart rate. Regardless, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker such as propranolol must never {{be used in the}} presence of a pheochromocytoma. The mechanism for β-adrenoceptor blocker-associated adverse events is generally ascribed to inhibition of β2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, leaving α1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses to catecholamines unopposed and, thus, severe and potentially refractory hypertension. However some clinical guidelines permit beta-1 blockade use together with alpha blockers during surgery for control of tachycardia.|$|E

40|$|The {{intravenous}} {{administration of the}} antiadrenaline drug <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> (Dibenzyline) markedly raised the arterial adrenaline and noradrenaline concentration in dogs lightly anaesthetized with thiopentone.

40|$|Our studies {{demonstrated}} that <b>phenoxybenzamine,</b> 10 mg/kg, administered intravenously to intact anesthetized dogs, produced {{an immediate and}} significant increase of heart rate and cardiac output.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Phenoxybenzamine</b> (PBZ) is an FDA {{approved}} α- 1 {{adrenergic receptor}} antagonist that is currently used to treat symptoms of pheochromocytoma.

40|$|A {{study of}} the actions of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> on {{transmitter}} overflow, neuronal and extraneuronal uptake of noradrenaline and in causing α-adrenoceptor blockade was carried out using the isolated cat nictitating membrane preparation. <b>Phenoxybenzamine</b> increased transmitter overflow elicited by nerve-stimulation at 10 Hz in a concentration dependent manner in the range 10 − 8 to 10 − 5 g/ml. Neuronal uptake of [3 H]-noradrenaline was not inhibited by concentrations lower than 10 − 6 g/ml of <b>phenoxybenzamine.</b> With 10 − 7 g/ml of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> a significant increase in transmitter overflow was obtained, although neuronal uptake of noradrenaline was not affected. Higher concentrations of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> (10 − 6 and 10 − 5 g/ml) inhibited the neuronal uptake of noradrenaline and further increased transmitter overflow. Extraneuronal uptake of [3 H]-noradrenaline was inhibited only with the highest concentration of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> tested (10 − 5 g/ml) and therefore appears to be unrelated to the effects on transmitter overflow. There was a significant correlation between the degree of α-adrenoceptor block produced by <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> and the increase in transmitter overflow obtained by nerve stimulation. These results indicate that <b>phenoxybenzamine,</b> in addition to increasing overflow by preventing reuptake of noradrenaline, may increase transmitter release.

40|$|<b>Phenoxybenzamine,</b> an {{irreversible}} alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, {{is used as}} {{a topical}} treatment against catecholamine-induced contraction in radial artery bypass grafts. Published data suggest that a wide range of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> doses may be equally effective. This study aimed to investigate whether lower doses of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> would benefit grafts by better preserving endothelium. To this end human vascular endothelial cells were isolated from sections of radial artery or saphenous vein, and treated with <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> for 30 min. Cells were then washed free of drug and viability assayed using a resazurin-based toxicology assay or returned to culture for assay at 24 h. <b>Phenoxybenzamine</b> treatment showed a dose-dependent effect on cell viability over several clinically employed concentrations.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> has been {{determined}} on the physiological response to sympathetic stimulation in two preparations, the rabbit isolated ileum and the guinea-pig isolated vas deferens.

40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{surgical}} treatment of pheochromocytoma,`haemodynamic instability may occur. To prevent this, patients receive preoperative treatment with an alpha-blocker. Nowadays, some centres use <b>phenoxybenzamine,</b> while others use doxazosin. The {{purpose of this}} review is to analyse the current evidence of the benefits and risks of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> and doxazosin in the preoperative treatment of pheochromocytoma. METHODS: The literature was reviewed by searching PubMed using the following search terms: pheochromocytoma, <b>phenoxybenzamine,</b> doxazosin and alpha-blockade. The filter was set on English language. RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials were found. Five follow-up studies comparing <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> and doxazosin {{in the treatment of}} pheochromocytoma were retrieved and analysed. There was a trend that systolic arterial pressure is slightly better controlled by <b>phenoxybenzamine.</b> However, this resulted in more pronounced postoperative hypotension as well. The use of an alpha-blocker was often accompanied by other vasoactive agents. <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> was often accompanied by a beta-blocker to control reflex tachycardia, while patients on doxazosin received significantly more additional antihypertensive medicines. Most of the studies showed that the use of vasoactive drugs and fluid infusion does not differ significantly between the two drugs. <b>Phenoxybenzamine</b> caused significantly more orthostatic hypotension, oedema and complaints of a stuffy nose. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the current evidence, there is no evidently superior alpha-blocker for the pretreatment of patients with pheochromocytoma. Perioperative haemodynamics seem to be slightly better controlled with <b>phenoxybenzamine,</b> at the cost of more pronounced postoperative hypotension. Side effects occurred less often in the doxazosin group...|$|E

40|$|In the cat, <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> {{prevented}} the uptake of noradrenaline by the kidney {{but not by}} the uterus; dichloroisoprenaline {{prevented the}} uptake of noradrenaline by the uterus but not by the kidney.

40|$|An {{adrenergic}} {{mechanism is}} thought to contribute to pain in conditions that sometimes develop during chronic inflammation and after nerve or tissue injury. There is some doubt, however, about whether adrenergic activity influences nociception in acute inflammation. To investigate this issue, the noncompetitive alpha-(α) adrenergic antagonist <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> was introduced by iontophoresis into the skin of 16 healthy volunteers either {{before or after the}} topical application of capsaicin. When applied before capsaicin, <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> increased thermal hyperalgesia at normal ambient temperatures and during body warming. These findings suggest that <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> blocked an analgesic mechanism when applied before the onset of inflammation. However, this effect disappeared during body cooling. When applied after capsaicin, <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> inhibited thermal hyperalgesia at normal ambient temperatures, and during body warming and cooling. Thus, <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> blocked a hyperalgesic mechanism when applied after the onset of inflammation. It was concluded that the presence of inflammation influences the nociceptive effect of α-adrenergic blockage, possibly by increasing access to excitatory adrenergic receptors on nociceptive afferents. An excitatory adrenergic influence on nociception may overcome an inhibitory adrenergic influence during inflammation...|$|E

40|$|Aminoglycosides (AGs) {{are widely}} used {{antibiotics}} because of their low cost and high efficacy against gram-negative bacterial infection. However, AGs are ototoxic, causing the death of sensory hair cells in the inner ear. Strategies aimed at developing or discovering agents that protect against aminoglycoside ototoxicity have focused on inhibiting apoptosis or more recently, on preventing antibiotic uptake by the hair cells. Recent screens for ototoprotective compounds using the larval zebrafish lateral line identified <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> as a potential protectant for aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death. Here we used live imaging of FM 1 - 43 uptake {{as a proxy for}} aminoglycoside entry, combined with hair-cell death assays to evaluate whether <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> can protect mammalian cochlear hair cells from the deleterious effects of the aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin. We show that <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> can block FM 1 - 43 entry into mammalian hair cells in a reversible and dose-dependent manner, but pre-incubation is required for maximal inhibition of entry. We observed differential effects of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> on FM 1 - 43 uptake in the two different types of cochlear hair cell in mammals, the outer hair cells (OHCs) and inner hair cells (IHCs). The requirement for pre-incubation and reversibility suggests an intracellular rather than an extracellular site of action for <b>phenoxybenzamine.</b> We also tested the efficacy of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> as an otoprotective agent. In mouse cochlear explants the hair cell death resulting from 24 h exposure to neomycin was steeply dose-dependent, with 50 % cell death occurring at ~ 230 μM for both IHC and OHC. We used 250 μM neomycin in subsequent hair-cell death assays. At 100 μM with 1 h pre-incubation, <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> conferred significant protection to both IHCs and OHCs, however at higher concentrations <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> itself showed clear signs of ototoxicity and an additive toxic effect when combined with neomycin. These data do not support the use of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> as a therapeutic agent in mammalian inner ear.

40|$|The {{effects of}} beta-adrenergic {{receptor}} stimulants (nylidrin and isoprotere-nol) on the hemorrhagic shock state of anesthetized dogs were measured and {{compared to those}} of <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> to determine the therapeutic effec-tiveness of the combined cardiac stimulatory and peripheral vasodilatory ac-tions of the former drugs. Anesthetized dogs were subjected to 3 hours of hypo-volemia followed by {{the return of the}} shed blood. Nylidrin, isoproterenol (continuous infusion), and <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> were administered 1 hour after bleeding the animals and heart rate, arterial blood pressure, venous hemato-crit, coronary blood flow, cardiac output, ventricular contractility, and survival rates were measured. Nylidrin and isoproterenol afforded significant protection against shock deaths, whereas <b>phenoxybenzamine</b> did not increase survival over control values. Mild to moderate intestinal hemorrhage and distention were noted in the isoproterenol- and phenoxybenzamine-treated animals, but not in the nylidrin-treated animals. <b>Phenoxybenzamine</b> gradually decreased the ar...|$|E
