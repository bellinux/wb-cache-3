In Japanese farming communities {{there is often a}} shared <b>rice</b> <b>polishing</b> machine.

25|$|Either by hand or in a rice polisher, {{white rice}} may be buffed with glucose or talc powder (often called <b>polished</b> <b>rice,</b> though this term may also refer to white rice in general), parboiled, or {{processed}} into flour. White rice {{may also be}} enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.|$|E
25|$|A {{familiar}} {{sight in}} several Asian countries is paddy laid {{out to dry}} along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has {{to be carried out}} quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple hullers, with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly <b>polished</b> <b>rice.</b> A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.|$|E
25|$|The {{milling of cereals}} {{results in}} {{considerable}} loss (up to 60%) of vitamin B2, so white flour is enriched in some countries such as US by addition of the vitamin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of vitamin B2. <b>Polished</b> <b>rice</b> is not usually enriched, because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice-consumption populations. However, most of the flavin content of whole brown rice is retained if the rice is steamed (parboiled) prior to milling. This process drives the flavins in the germ and aleurone layers into the endosperm. Free riboflavin is naturally present in foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Bovine milk contains mainly free riboflavin, with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD. In whole milk, 14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins. in Bovine Milk: its concentration, distribution, and binding linkage, J. Nutr. Sci.

The agricultural soil of study area has become highly contaminated with arsenic due to the excessive use of arsenic-rich underground water (0. 070 ± 0. 006 mg l- 1, n = 6) for irrigation. Arsenic content in tissues of rice plant and in fractions of rice grain of two widely cultivated rice varieties, namely BRRI dhan 28 and BRRI hybrid dhan 1, were determined. Regardless of rice varieties, arsenic content was about 28 - and 75 -folds higher in root than that of shoot and raw rice grain, respectively. In fractions of parboiled and non-parboiled rice grain of both varieties, the order of arsenic concentrations was; rice hull > bran-polish > brown rice > raw <b>rice</b> > <b>polish</b> <b>rice.</b> Arsenic content was higher in non-parboiled rice grain than that of parboiled rice. Arsenic concentrations in parboiled and non-parboiled brown rice of BRRI dhan 28 were 0. 8 ± 0. 1 and 0. 5 ± 0. 0 mg kg- 1 dry weight, respectively while those of BRRI hybrid dhan 1 were 0. 8 ± 0. 2 and 0. 6 ± 0. 2 mg kg- 1 dry weight, respectively. However, parboiled and non-parboiled <b>polish</b> <b>rice</b> grain of BRRI dhan 28 contained 0. 4 ± 0. 0 and 0. 3 ± 0. 1 mg kg- 1 dry weight of arsenic, respectively while those of BRRI hybrid dhan 1 contained 0. 43 ± 0. 01 and 0. 5 ± 0. 0 mg kg- 1 dry weight, respectively.
