5|$|The {{earthquake}} forced {{hundreds of}} people {{to leave the country}} for the United States. It occurred during a period of several major natural disasters in which many residents of the island left; in 1975, 8,000 residents left. In 1981, however, just 2,500 <b>people</b> <b>left</b> the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{most devastating}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Olivia. A late-season major hurricane, Olivia came ashore near Mazatlán. The storm killed 30 <b>people,</b> <b>left</b> around 30,000 people homeless, and caused 20million dollars (1975 USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} annually {{cause damage}} to infrastructure and local economies {{as well as}} loss of life. In 2004 Cyclone Gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar. The storm killed 172 <b>people,</b> <b>left</b> 214,260 homeless and caused more than US$250million in damage.|$|E
50|$|Native <b>peoples</b> <b>left</b> {{evidence}} {{of their lives in}} ruins of agricultural communities, broken pieces of pottery, tools, pictographs, and petroglyphs. The landscape includes large sandstone formations, desolate deserts, interesting views, and geologic formations.|$|R

50|$|Indlala killed 150 <b>people</b> and <b>left</b> another 126 missing. A {{total of}} 188,331 <b>people</b> were also <b>left</b> {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm. Damages from Indlala amounted to $240 million.|$|R
5|$|With little other {{employment}} {{available in}} the Rhondda the only solution appeared to be emigration. Between 1924 and 1939, 50,000 <b>people</b> <b>left</b> the Rhondda. During this time life was difficult for communities built solely around a singular industry, especially as most families were on a single wage.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two days}} after the storm, the death toll rose to 18; the next day, the Associated Press {{reported}} 52deaths and 102injuries. Ten days after the storm, military officials reported the death toll rose to 57, and the number of <b>people</b> <b>left</b> homeless by the storm reached over 1,000.|$|E
5|$|Besides Litvinenko, {{only two}} <b>people</b> <b>left</b> {{polonium}} trails: Lugovoy and Kovtun, who were school friends and worked previously for Russian {{intelligence in the}} KGB and the GRU, respectively. They left more significant traces of polonium than Litvinenko, indicating that they handled the radioactive material directly, and did not ingest it.|$|E
50|$|About 30,000 <b>people</b> were <b>left</b> {{homeless}} statewide though other authorities {{estimated that}} 24,000 <b>people</b> were <b>left</b> homeless in both Sonora and Sinaloa combined. Throughout the mainland, 12 communities sustained heavy damage. In all, all, {{there are no}} reports of major damage in the mainland.|$|R
50|$|This cyclone brought torrential {{rainfall}} to Midnapore {{district in}} West Bengal. About 20,000 <b>people</b> were <b>left</b> homeless, while another 20,000 <b>people</b> were <b>left</b> stranded near the Assam border after the Haora River topped its banks. There was an estimated 480 fatalities, most caused by landslides.|$|R
50|$|The {{cultural}} foundation also {{fell from the}} ideology, while communication with the Uralic <b>peoples</b> <b>left</b> under Soviet rule became increasingly difficult and more bureaucratic. In 1991, when Estonia regained its independence with {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, it created more opportunities for NGOs and private citizens.|$|R
5|$|Relief efforts began almost immediately, and {{hospitals}} quickly became full. Rescue trains began arriving from across eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States, but were impeded by a blizzard. Construction of temporary shelters {{to house the}} many <b>people</b> <b>left</b> homeless began soon after the disaster. The initial judicial inquiry found Mont-Blanc to {{have been responsible for}} the disaster, but a later appeal determined that both vessels were to blame. There are several memorials to the victims of the explosion in the North End.|$|E
5|$|The group, now {{numbering}} approximately twenty <b>people,</b> <b>left</b> Constantinople {{in early}} May 1915. They crossed the Bosphorus {{to take the}} unfinished Baghdad Railway to Baghdad. The Taurus Mountains were crossed on horseback, using—as von Hentig reflected—the same route taken by Alexander the Great, Paul the Apostle, and Frederick I. The group crossed the Euphrates at high flood, finally reaching Baghdad {{towards the end of}} May.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced light {{rainfall and}} high tides along the Gulf Coast of the United States. Some low-level flooding was reported, but damage was slight. In Mexico, the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall. The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico, with about 25,000 <b>people</b> <b>left</b> homeless. The rainfall, reaching over 17.52inches (445mm), caused flooding and mudslides which killed eleven people in Tamaulipas. Overall damage is unknown.|$|E
50|$|From the 7th century BC, Scythian tribes {{began to}} {{dominate}} the Pontic steppe. They were in turn displaced by the Sarmatians from the 2nd century BC, except in Crimea, where they persisted for a few centuries longer. These <b>peoples</b> <b>left</b> carefully crafted stone stelae, with all features cut in deep relief.|$|R

5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment. <b>People</b> <b>left</b> rural areas to escape poverty, and females left {{due to the lack}} of local opportunities for women. In the cities, women could find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female migrant workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the migrant women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles sent {{advertisements}} {{to groups}} in California and {{were invited to}} speak to New Age devotees there in April 1975. At this meeting, they persuaded {{about half of the}} 50 attendees to follow them. They also focused on college campuses, speaking at Cañada College in August. At a meeting in Oregon in September 1975, they saw further recruitment success—about 30 <b>people</b> <b>left</b> their homes to follow the pair, prompting interest from media outlets. The coverage was negative: commentators and some former members mocked the group and leveled accusations of brainwashing against Applewhite and Nettles. Balch and Taylor state that Applewhite and Nettles eschewed pressure tactics, seeking only devoted followers.|$|E
5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans {{migrated}} to the West; 3.454million left between 1950 {{and the construction of}} the Berlin Wall in 1961. After the border was fortified and the Berlin Wall constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than a small minority {{of the total number of}} emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more <b>people</b> <b>left</b> the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E
50|$|Sinagua <b>peoples</b> <b>left</b> the Verde Valley by {{the early}} 15th century. Like other pre-Columbian {{cultures}} in the southwest, the Sinagua apparently abandoned their permanent settlements around this time, though the precise reasons for such a large-scale abandonment are not yet known; resource depletion, drought, and clashes with the newly arrived Yavapai people have been suggested.|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused {{an outbreak of}} Leptospirosis, notably in Cortés Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the <b>people</b> <b>left</b> homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month. In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to drain the water.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{issuance}} of a hurricane warning in North Carolina on August17, mandatory evacuation orders were declared for the outermost islands in the state. Local police assisted significant traffic as an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 <b>people</b> <b>left</b> the region. At {{the height of the}} evacuations, delays in some places exceeded three hours. Despite the large number of evacuees, an additional 50,000 people were estimated to have stayed home and wait out the storm. Several bridges in the area were shut down prior to Bob's arrival as hurricane-force winds were likely to create life-threatening conditions on them. The National Park Service in the state also shut down campgrounds across the Outer Banks. An evacuation shelter was also opened in Carteret County.|$|E
5|$|In North Korea, the Red Cross {{provided}} {{relief supplies}} to residents affected by flooding. The agency's international disaster relief fund provided FR75,000 (2002CHF ($50,000USD).. Soldiers {{were used to}} assist in search and rescue missions and to repair damaged infrastructure. Due to storm damage, the Red Cross in North Korea distributed over 2.1million water purification tablets and over 11,000water containers. The agency also provided 32,753blankets and 4,931kitchen units. After the storm, <b>people</b> <b>left</b> homeless by the storm sought shelter with neighbors or in shelters. A South Korean dairy company donated 42,000cans of baby formula to North Korea.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Atlanta, Georgia's capital city, {{underwent}} significant {{economic and social}} change. To serve a growing economy based on manufacturing and commerce, many <b>people</b> <b>left</b> the countryside to relocate in Atlanta, often in primitive housing. Employment conditions in the city included child labor, a 66-hour work week, low wages, and unregulated and unsafe work sites. Men from the traditional and paternalistic rural society felt it degrading that their womenfolk were forced into the city to work in factories. Mixed gender workplaces were seen as places for potential corruption.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} <b>people</b> <b>left</b> to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5|$|Rapists of virgins and {{children}} are also attested to have been buried alive, with a stake driven through them. In one such judicial tradition, the rapist was {{to be placed in}} an open grave, and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure. Serving {{as an example of the}} fate of a child molester, in August 1465 in Zurich, Switzerland, Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled, for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine. His clothes were taken off, and he was placed on his back. His arms and legs were stretched out, each secured to a pole. Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground. Thereafter, <b>people</b> <b>left</b> him to die.|$|E
