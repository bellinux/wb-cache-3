In the period 1942-1944, trials of rotary wing and parachute developments were conducted at Ringway, Sherburn-in-Elmet and during detachments to various other airfields, such as RAF Snaith, RAF Chelveston, RAF Newmarket, RAF Riccall, RAF Burn, RAF Hartford Bridge, RAF Farnborough and RAF Beaulieu. A large and varied fleet of <b>powered</b> <b>support</b> aircraft was used, mostly for parachute-dropping and glider-towing.

The outcomes of an industry sponsored (ACARP) research project on the geotechnical issues associated with conventional longwall recoveries is presented with updates the experiences gained. A number of critical features of the geotechnical environment, support design and mining geometry have a pronounced impact on ground control during take-off. A model of roof behaviour at the take-off point has been developed and validated.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{longwall}} mining can largely {{be traced to}} the development of powered roof support systems. The most significant improvement in <b>powered</b> <b>support</b> design has been the shield support, which improved kinematic stability and promoted the application of longwall mining in difficult-to- control caving conditions where chock and frame supports were inadequate. The most obvious trend in shield design has been an increase in shield size and capacity. This U. S. Bureau of Mines report examines shield design and operation practices and their consequences for the utilization of high-capacity shield support systems. An optimization goal is to minimize support loading by selecting an active shield setting force that is compatible with strata behavior and shield loading characteristics. Shield stiffness is an important design parameter that is often overlooked. A consequence of increasing shield capacity by incorporating larger diameter leg cylinders is a proportional increase in shield stiffness. Setting forces have also increased in direct proportion to the increase in shield capacity. The increased stiffness and higher setting force cause the available capacity to be consumed more quickly, severely limiting the ability of high-capacity supports to last longer and provide reserve capacity for difficult mining conditions...|$|E

40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines study evaluates {{factors that}} {{influence}} longwall support and strata interaction. The longwall system is composed of an immediate and main roof structure and three supporting foundations: longwall panel, powered roof supports, and gob waste. The main roof forms a structure that is generally supported by all three foundations, while the immediate roof acts as a beam that cantilevers from the coal face to the <b>powered</b> <b>support.</b> In most cases, shield loading involves a complex interaction of both main roof and immediate roof behavior and {{is a combination of}} loads produced from convergence of the main roof and displacements of the immediate roof caused by deformations of the cantilevered roof beam. Since the shield stiffness remains constant for all leg pressures and main roof convergence is irresistible in terms of shield capacity, the shield must be able to control the behavior of the immediate roof or floor structure for shield loading to be sensitive to setting pressures. If the goal is to minimize total shield loading, any active setting force must be offset by reduced passive shield loading to justify the active setting loads. Field data sumest that the typical reductions in passive loading do not justify the required increases in setting pressure in some applications...|$|E

40|$|Recovering from roof {{cavities}} on the {{longwall face}} is an endemic aspect of longwall mining {{and this is}} especially the case today as longwall faces are wider and higher than they have ever been, yet <b>powered</b> <b>support</b> ratings are effectively technology constrained. There {{is little doubt that}} the ever-increasing dimensions of longwall faces are consequently increasing the likelihood of major roof falls occurring, especially in those more challenging geotechnical environments containing poor immediate roof conditions at depths of cover greater than 250 m. As a result, the efficiency and safety of longwall roof cavity recoveries is being given increased attention and is more relevant than ever {{to the success of the}} coal industry. This has led to the now almost universal use of cavity fills during the recovery of major roof falls on the longwall face, albeit that there is industry discussion regarding what constitutes ideal properties for cavity fill material. The paper discusses the geotechnical reasons why it is believed that major roof falls on longwall faces are becoming more likely with time and defines a conceptual geotechnical model for the cavity recovery process and the inherent ground control problems involved. Furthermore the paper considers the needs of mine operators during the cavity recovery process and how these can be best achieved. Specifically the paper contrasts foaming cements and phenolic foams as the two main generic types of cavity fill and ranks them according to such parameters as strength, foaming properties, rate of cavity fill, material cost, effectiveness, safety and overall cost effectiveness. The paper concludes that on a holistic basis, phenolic foams are the more suitable means of cavity filling on the longwall face, accepting that foaming cements are also an effective medium. However in the final analysis neither type of cavity fill is cost effective when compared to the benefits of preventing such cavities occurring in the first place through layout design, equipment maintenance and good operating practices and this is the major point of the paper...|$|E

40|$|Power system operators/planners {{are always}} {{faced with the}} problem of how to {{minimize}} the transmission loss. There are a number of ways to achieve this goal. In this thesis, new methods for optimal capacitor placement for transmission loss minimization are proposed. Proposed methods are based on the optimal power flow formulations, which enable the costbenefit analysis and multi-objective optimization assessment of reactive <b>power</b> <b>support</b> investment. For better illustration of proposed methods, they are applied to a real and test transmission networks. In the cost-benefit analysis, reactive <b>power</b> <b>supports</b> are applied to the power system for transmission loss minimization. The candidate places for reactive <b>power</b> <b>support</b> allocation are defined in advance according to where the highest reactive power flow is observed. The benefits after application of reactive <b>power</b> <b>supports</b> are calculated. Benefits considered are the benefits from recovered transmission losses due to the reactive power addition. The benefits are then compared with investments, which would be required for the addition of reactive <b>power</b> <b>supports</b> and in this way the economical justification in reactive <b>power</b> <b>support</b> addition can be made. This method is applied to the real transmission network of a Georgian regional grid. After analyzing the obtained results, we can observe that in some cases even though the losses are minimized up to the minimal level, economically it is not optimal since in such cases, high investment costs are involved. The optimal cases are those where the losses are a bit higher than possible minimum and the investments are minimal also compared to what is required for achieving of minimal transmission losses. Only these optimal cases can justify the investments, made for loss minimization. In the multi-objective optimization several objective functions are proposed in one overall objective function. The optimized functions are minimization of total investment in reactive <b>power</b> <b>support,</b> average voltage deviation, minimization of total system loss and total system cost. At the beginning, optimum values for each objective function is found one by one separately and these optimal values are included while solving for overall objective function. During optimization of all these objectives within one overall objective, we have opportunity to optimize each objective according to what is our interest in it compared to other optimized objectives. This is done using the priority order multipliers, which has each of the objective functions. CIGRE 32 bus test system is used for illustration of this method. Three cases with different values of priority order multipliers are solved and discussed. In the obtained results we can observe how the values of optimized objective functions are changed to reflect their priority orders assigned in the overall objective function...|$|R
