40|$|Development, {{survival}} and {{reproduction of the}} generalist predatory mites, Amblyseius largoensis (Muma), Neoseiulus barkeri (Hughes), Typhlodromips swirskii (Athias-Henriot), Proprioseiopsis kadii (El-Halawany and Abdel-Samad) and Cydnosus negevi (Swirski and Amitai) were assessed when fed on eggs of Bactrocera zonata (Saunders) (Diptera: Tephritidae) as a factitious food. For N. barkeri and P. kadii, the development was faster, while the reproduction was higher in N. barkeri and A. largoensis than for P. kadii. Survival of immatures of T. swirskii and C. negevi was low on eggs of B. zonata and all failed to develop beyond the <b>protonymphal</b> <b>stage.</b> A total of 35. 4, 31. 2 and 19. 6 eggs per female, respectively, were obtained when N. barkeri, A. largoensis and P. kadii were fed B. zonata eggs. A diet of the peach fruit fly eggs provided the longest female longevity and highest mean total fecundity, {{which resulted in the}} highest net reproductive rate (Ro= 34. 61 and 32. 78) and doubling time (DT= 1. 53 and 1. 60) for N. barkeri and A. largoensis, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Varroa jacobsoni reproduces {{in honey}} bee brood cells. Here the {{behavioral}} activity {{and use of}} space by infestingVarroa females and progeny were quantified in transparent artificial brood cells. The time-activity budget of both infesting and developing mites converged toward a stable pattern which was established during the bee prepupal stage of the infesting mites and the <b>protonymphal</b> <b>stage</b> of mite progeny. The pattern was such that infesting females and offspring eventually divided their activity between the fecal accumulation on the cell wall, which served as the rendezvous site for newly molted individuals, and the feeding site prepared on the pupa by the foundress. Other parts of the cell wall were used for oviposition and molting, away from the fecal accumulation on which activity of mobile stages was concentrated. Space structuring and the time-activity budget in Varroa probably evolved to enhance the number of fertilized females produced within the capped brood, where space and time are limiting factors. These behavioral adaptations parallel those of other mite species which show group behavior within cavities...|$|E
40|$|The {{continental}} Antarctic oribatid mite, Maudheimia wilsoni Dalenius, {{is often}} found in compact multi-instar aggregations, under stones. These aggregations may persist for several years. Relative abundances of the four juvenile instars of M. wilsoni in the aggregations suggest an increase in instar duration with progressive development from protonymph to tritonymph, with larval and <b>protonymphal</b> <b>stages</b> apparently being of similar duration. Development from egg to protonymph may occur in a single summer season but, thereafter, at most a single moult is achieved each summer. This suggests that all juvenile instars are capable of overwintering. Minimum generation time (egg-egg) must therefore be three years, but {{the life cycle of}} many individuals is probably considerably longer. Development of individuals is more closely synchronised within aggregations than in the wider population, with synchronisation being particularly apparent in the larval and <b>protonymphal</b> <b>stages.</b> Aggregation behaviour is hypothesised to improve moult synchronisation and accelerate moulting, potentially reducing the number of winters spent as a juvenile, and hence juvenile mortality. There is evidence that adults actively leave or join aggregations, possibly allowing males to locate emerging females, and females to find suitable oviposition sites. Repeated overwintering and aggregation are not unique to M. wilsoni and other Antarctic oribatid mites, but are unusual for the Oribatida in general. We suggest that these features are essential for the survival of Antarctic oribatid mites which are faced with a limited annual growing period and phylogenetically-constrained long generation time...|$|R
40|$|Prenatal or {{embryonic}} learning, {{behavioral change}} following experience made prior to birth, may have significant consequences for postnatal foraging {{behavior in a}} wide variety of animals, including mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and molluscs. However, prenatal learning has not been previously shown in arthropods such as insects, spiders and mites. We examined prenatal chemosensory learning in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus. We exposed these predators in the embryonic stage to two flavors (vanillin or anisaldehyde) or no flavor (neutral) by feeding their mothers on spider mite prey enriched with these flavors or not enriched with any flavor (neutral). After the predators reached the <b>protonymphal</b> <b>stage,</b> we assessed their prey choice through residence and feeding preferences in experiments, in which they were offered spider mites matching the maternal diet (neutral, vanillin or anisaldehyde spider mites) and non-matching spider mites. Predator protonymphs preferentially resided in the vicinity of spider mites matching the maternal diet irrespective of the type of maternal diet and choice situation. Across treatments, the protonymphs preferentially fed on spider mites matching the maternal diet. Prey and predator sizes did not differ among neutral, vanillin and anisaldehyde treatments, excluding the hypothesis that size-assortative predation influenced the outcome of the experiments. Our study reports the first example of prenatal learning in arthropods...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe lifetime-dependent {{functional}} {{response and}} predation rate of Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot on eggs of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch was determined under laboratory conditions using cucumber leaf discs. Densities of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 prey were offered to 4 (protonymph), 5 (deutonymph), 6 (1 -day-old adult), 10 (5 -day-old adult), 15 (10 -day-old adult), 20 (15 -day-old adult), 25 (20 -day-old adult), 30 (25 -day-old adult), 35 (30 -day-old adult) and 40 (35 -day-old adult) P. persimilis individuals. The results of logistic regression analyses showed {{that on the}} 15 th, 35 th and 40 th days of predator age, predation rate of T. urticae eggs increased, resulting in the type III functional response, while at the other ages, the functional response was type II. The Rogers model was used to estimate searching efficiency (a) and handling time (Th). The longest handling time was obtained in the <b>protonymphal</b> <b>stage</b> with 2. 377 +/- 0. 192 h. The shortest handling time and the highest value of estimated maximum attack rate (T/Th) were estimated {{at the age of}} 20 days (0. 494 +/- 0. 009 h and 48. 57 prey/day). At the highest prey density used (128 eggs), our findings showed that the highest number of prey was eaten by 15, 20, 25 and 30 days old P. persimilis (39. 3, 41. 7, 39. 3 and 38. 1 eggs per day, respectively). The results of this study revealed that P. persimilis especially at the middle and late ages has a good predation potential on T. urticae eggs at higher prey densities...|$|E
40|$|Influence {{of various}} prey {{stages of the}} pest Tetranychus urticae Koch on survival, development, and {{reproduction}} {{as well as the}} life table parameters of the predacious mite Neoseiulus barkeri (Hughes) was studied under laboratory conditions. Neoseiulus barkeri females lived shorter (36. 31 days versus 45. 00), had a higher total fecundity (64. 81 eggs female− 1 versus 53. 81 eggs female− 1) and a higher daily fecundity rate (2. 76 eggs female− 1 day− 1 versus 1. 78 eggs female− 1 day− 1), and exhibited a higher intrinsic rate of increase (0. 339 individuals female− 1 day− 1 versus 0. 226 individuals female− 1 day− 1) and shorter generation time (11. 60 days versus 15. 70 days), at 28 – 30 °C, 70 – 75 % RH under continuous fluorescent light, when reared on a diet of larvae rather than a diet on mixed nymph stages of T. urticae on raspberry leaf disks. The sex ratio of the progeny was strongly female biased recorded when female of N. barkeri fed on larvae and nymphs of T. urticae. The adult female of N. barkeri consumed daily an average of 25. 0 larvae versus 82. 0 eggs (24 – 48 -h old) of T. urticae during its life cycle, while it was increased to 48. 6 larvae versus 80. 5 eggs (24 – 48 -h old) daily during the adult stage. Neoseiulus barkeri failed to develop beyond the <b>protonymphal</b> <b>stage</b> when the predator offered eggs (0 – 24 -h old) of T. urticae as food. Larvae of T. urticae proved to be the most favorable stage of T. urticae for N. barkeri, while the eggs (24 – 48 -h old) were the least...|$|E
40|$|Amblydromalus limonicus Garman & McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is a generalist {{predatory mite}} with {{economic}} potential to control thrips and whiteflies in protected cultivation. We tested {{the development and}} reproduction of A. limonicus on three food sources with potential for use in laboratory production or to support its populations in a crop: fresh cattail pollen, Typha latifolia L. (Poales: Typhaceae), dry decapsulated cysts of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana Kellogg (Branchiopoda: Artemiidae) and frozen eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The diets were tested both on an artificial substrate and on kidney bean leaves. In the absence of food, all larvae died on the artificial substrate, whereas they succeeded in reaching the <b>protonymphal</b> <b>stage</b> on bean leaves. Immature survival was high (> 90 %) on all diet-substrate combinations, except when E. kuehniella eggs were offered on the artificial substrate (35 % survival). Both sexes showed the fastest development when offered E. kuehniella eggs on leaf discs, followed by A. franciscana cysts, whereas the slowest development was achieved on T. latifolia pollen. Fecundity and oviposition rate were higher on E. kuehniella and A. franciscana than on T. latifolia. Amblydromalus limonicus females lived longer on the leaf discs than on the artificial substrates. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was highest when E. kuehniella eggs were offered on leaf discs (0. 256 females per female per day), whereas the lowest rate (0. 128 females per female per day) was obtained when the eggs were provided on artificial substrates. The intrinsic rate of increase on A. franciscana cysts was not affected by substrate and averaged 0. 22 females per female per day. Diet significantly influenced the size of A. limonicus females {{as measured by the}} distance between specific setae on the dorsal shield of the idiosoma. The application of the investigated food sources to sustain a colony of predatory mites upon their release in a greenhouse crop is discussed...|$|E
