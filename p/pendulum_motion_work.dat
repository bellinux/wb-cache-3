40|$|Swing toe {{trajectory}} {{has been}} investigated due to its association with tripping - induced falls. This study investigated how m otion of the entire foot segment influences the toe trajectory. Seven young and seven older participants walked both over - ground and on a treadmill to obtain the swing foot trajectory data. No ageing effects were obtained for toe trajectory control. Older adults {{were found to have}} greater asymmetry at minimum ground clearance, especially in treadmill walking, whereas foot center of mass (COM) control was symmetrical, suggesting that foot COM motion does not influence toe trajectory. Correlation analysis ind icated that foot COM and toe trajectory may be controlled independently due to ankle motions that modulate the toe’s elevation, a finding that has implications for falls prevention strategies. The results also provide the first report of the foot’s center of mass trajectory during the swing phase of the gait cycle. The foot’s trajectory resembles <b>pendulum</b> <b>motion</b> but further <b>work</b> will be necessary to test the foot - pendulum control hypothesis.

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{response}} of tower cranes {{coupled with the}} <b>pendulum</b> <b>motions</b> of the payload is studied in this paper. A simple perturbation scheme and the assumption of small pendulum angle are applied to simplify the governing equation. The tower crane is modeled by the finite element method, while the <b>pendulum</b> <b>motion</b> is represented as rigid-body kinetics. Integrated governing equations for the coupled dynamics problem are derived based on Lagrange’s equations including the dissipation function. Dynamics of a real luffing crane model with the spherical and planar <b>pendulum</b> <b>motions</b> is analyzed using the proposed formulations and computational method. It is found that the dynamic responses of the tower crane are dominated by both the first few natural frequencies of crane structure and the <b>pendulum</b> <b>motion</b> of the payload. The dynamic amplification factors generally increase {{with the increase of}} the initial pendulum angle and the changes are just slightly nonlinear for the planar <b>pendulum</b> <b>motion...</b>|$|R

Hence, for example, Galileo was eventually to appeal to <b>pendulum</b> <b>motion</b> to demonstrate that the speed of gravitational free-fall is the same for all unequal weights precisely by virtue of dynamically modelling <b>pendulum</b> <b>motion</b> in this manner as a case of cyclically repeated gravitational free-fall along the horizontal in principle.|$|R

In the present paper the main interest is directed to the neutron noise due to random vibrations of the fuel parts (lower parts of the pendulums).

Simulations were performed with a moving grid geometry oscillating according to the parameters observed in flight tests.

40|$|The Orion Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Orion {{spacecraft}} {{will return}} humans from beyond earth's orbit, including Mars {{and will be}} required to land 20, 000 pounds of mass safely in the ocean. The parachute system nominally lands under 3 main parachutes, but the system is designed to be fault tolerant and land under 2 main parachutes. During several of the parachute development tests, it was observed that a <b>pendulum,</b> or swinging, <b>motion</b> could develop while the Crew Module (CM) was descending under two parachutes.
