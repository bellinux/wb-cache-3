50|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} Fresnel zoneplate antennas, one can divide each Fresnel zone into several sub-zones, such as quarter-wave sub-zones, and provide an appropriate phase shift in each of them, thus resulting in a sub-zone <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> zoneplate 5. The problem with dielectric based zoneplate lens antenna is that whilst a dielectric is providing a phase shift to the transmitted wave, it inevitably reflects some of the energy back, so the efficiency of such a lens is limited. However, the low efficiency problem for a zoneplate reflector is less severe, as total reflection can achieved by using a conducting reflector behind the zoneplate. Based on the focal field analysis, it is demonstrated that high efficiency zoneplate reflectors {{can be obtained by}} employing the multilayer <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> technique, which is to use a number of dielectric slabs of low permittivity and print different metallic zonal patterns on the different interfaces. The design and experiments of circular and offset multilayer <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> zoneplate reflectors were presented in 5.|$|R

Gate-level 3 D circuits with uncertain component delays are analyzed, and safe bounds on timing constraints for <b>correct</b> <b>circuit</b> operation are computed. We employ two passes of multi-valued logic simulation to precisely identify gates where timing constraint violations manifest themselves. Signal propagationdelay bounds from the primary inputs to these gates are then used to compute global timing constraints for <b>correct</b> <b>circuit</b> operation. Timing constraints identified by our tool represent conservative approximations to the true timing requirements in the worstcase.

50|$|A <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> {{reflective}} array {{consists of}} an array of phase shifting elements illuminated by a feed placed at the focal point. The word “reflective” refers {{to the fact that}} each phase shifting element reflects back the energy in the incident wave with an appropriate phase shift. The phase shifting elements can be passive or active. Each phase shifting element can be designed to either produce a phase shift which is equal to that required at the element centre, or provide some quantised phase shifting values. Although the former {{does not seem to be}} commercially attractive, the latter proved to be practical antenna configuration. One potential advantage is that such an array can be reconfigured by changing the positions of the elements to produce different radiation patterns. A systematic theory of the phase efficiency of passive <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> array antennas and experimental results on an X-band prototype were reported in 3. In recent years, it became common to call this type of antennas “reflectarrays”.|$|R
