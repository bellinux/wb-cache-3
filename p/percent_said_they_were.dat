Eighty-eight percent of fire service women responding had experienced some form of sexual harassment {{at some point in their}} fire service careers or volunteer time. Nearly seventy percent of the women in the survey said they were experiencing ongoing harassment at the time of the study. Of the 339 women who said they had complained about harassment, only a third (115 women) listed only positive outcomes: investigating/taking care of the problem, and disciplining the harasser. Twenty-six <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> retaliated against for reporting the incident.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} few months of 2014, The Jewish Agency of Israel has {{continued}} to encourage an increase of French aliyah through aliyah fairs, Hebrew-language courses, sessions which help potential immigrants to find jobs in Israel, and immigrant absorption in Israel. A May 2014 survey revealed that 74 percent of French Jews consider leaving France for Israel where of the 74 percent, 29.9 percent cited anti-Semitism. Another 24.4 cited their desire to “preserve their Judaism,” while 12.4 <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> attracted by other countries. “Economic considerations” was cited by 7.5 percent of the respondents. By June 2014, it was estimated by the end of 2014 a full 1 percent of the French Jewish community will have made aliyah to Israel, the largest in a single year. Many Jewish leaders stated the emigration is being driven by a combination of factors, including the cultural gravitation towards Israel and France’s economic woes, especially for the younger generation drawn by the possibility of other socioeconomic opportunities in the more vibrant Israeli economy. During the Hebrew year 5774 (September 2013 - September 2014) for the first time ever, more Jews made Aliyah from France than any other country, with approximately 6,000 French Jews making aliyah, mainly fleeing rampant antisemitism, pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist violence and economic malaise with France becoming the top sending country for aliyah as of late September 2014.|$|E

In 1974, several hundred people travelled to North West Cape from around Australia to protest and occupy the base. Anti-Americanism supposedly exists among school teachers in Australia, which has been condemned by conservative politicians. In August 2005, Treasurer Peter Costello condemned anti-American sentiment by teachers and criticised the teaching of history in Australian schools. According to an article published by The Monthly magazine, Australians muttered stories about George W. Bush over glasses of beer and despaired of neoconservatism in coffee shops, lamenting the so-called Ugly American activities. According to the same article, Rupert Murdoch, an American who had renounced his Australian citizenship over two decades prior, said during a November 2006 visit to Australia that [...] "he was worried about a [...] "regrettable" [...] anti-American sentiment in Australia." [...] In a poll taken by U.S. magazine Reader's Digest with 1000 Australians, 15 percent of Australians described themselves as [...] "anti-American".

In a recent study by the Corporate Leadership Council, 72 percent of companies predict they will have a large number of leadership vacancies over the next three to five years.

The chief executive of global recruitment agency Manpower recently told the World Economic Forum that 30 percent of companies across the globe continue to struggle to fill available positions. Global searches confirm the increased difficulty getting candidate‟s attention. The situation is pervasive and clearly a result of a miserable economy, high unemployment and a rampant sense of anxiety and insecurity among the well-employed executives. The “Dot Com ” era was tough but this is an even tougher time! There are several reasons why companies are struggling to fill their empty positions.
