40|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} of industrial policy normally restrict {{the range of}} possible outcomes by abstracting from either market or government failures. This paper thus studies industrial policy and its effectiveness in a model that includes both market and government imperfections. We introduce a <b>public</b> <b>agency</b> responsible for industrial policy into the model of Hausmann and Rodrik (2003), and assume that this agency has limited information and is partly politically motivated. We further extend the model to allow the <b>public</b> <b>agency</b> to communicate with en- trepreneurs and the entrepreneurs to engage in rent seeking. We find that industrial policies are ineffective if the <b>public</b> <b>agency</b> is poorly informed, but {{that they are not}} necessarily ineffective if the <b>public</b> <b>agency</b> is highly politically motivated. Given a highly politically mo- tivated <b>public</b> <b>agency,</b> industrial policies are effective if and only if the institutional setting ensures that such policies are modest e. g. by re- stricting the <b>public</b> <b>agency?s</b> budget. Moreover, our model helps us to understand why the same industrial policies that have failed elsewhere have been relatively successful in South Korea and Taiwan.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of antitrust policy in fighting horizontal collusion under different regimes of policy implementation. We consider two regimes : a <b>public</b> <b>agency</b> regime, where an antitrust authority {{is in charge of}} competition policy, and a "delegation" regime, where the policy is chosen by consumers. In both regimes the policy is implemented under discretion. The analysis shows that delegation dominates, both in case of complete and imperfect information about production costs, the <b>public</b> <b>agency</b> regime because consumers credibly start off an higher level of investigation activity than the <b>public</b> <b>agency.</b> This resuit implies that the <b>public</b> <b>agency</b> will fight the cases involving "relevant" anti-competitive activities, while consumers will act also against "minor" violations. The combination of the two regimes yields an higher welfare than having only a <b>public</b> <b>agency</b> in charge of competition policy, because consumers can partially relax the agency's limited resources constraint.
