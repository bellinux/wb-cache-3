5|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for Somerset's poor {{performances}} {{was their}} inability to consistently field their best players; at least four of their better cricketers were unable to commit to the full fixture list, and in all the county played 30 different people in their eight matches. Faint praise was offered to the batting of William Herbert Fowler, Newton and Edward Sainsbury in The Sportsman, but the bowling was considered by Wisden to be sub-standard, particularly that of Arnold Fothergill.|$|E
5|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> {{for this}} is the {{extensive}} freeway system in the city, due to the majority of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways but no three-digit interstates.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> enzyme amount on the glucose laurate {{synthesis}} {{has also}} been examined (Fig.  4 b). The conversion was raised first and then declined as the enzyme amount increased with an optimum obtained at 0.4  g. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for <b>the</b> later decline {{may be related to}} <b>the</b> hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product as mentioned above. Additionally, too high a concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immobilized enzyme makes <b>the</b> mixing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaction slurry difficult. Taking the enzyme cost into consideration, using excessive enzyme is counterproductive. In this study, use of 0.4  g <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzyme in the 5  ml reaction system is recommended.|$|R
5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E

The agreement to build the station was approved by the Parliament of Norway in mid 1966. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the Norwegian support was the opportunity of training Norwegians in pulse-code modulation and digital computing.

40|$|Abstract. A major {{division}} among ontologists {{has always}} been the one between those who believe that all entities are particular, and those who believe that at least some entities are universal. I find myself with the latter, and in this paper I offer <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> why this is so. More precisely, I offer a reason why we ought to reject tropism, due to <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> this view to account for the similarities we experience among entities. In the paper, two tentative accounts are considered and rejected: one postulating <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a relation <b>of</b> primitive resemblance; <b>the</b> other denying <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> any similarity. ...|$|R

5|$|Work {{began in}} 1882 on Fort Glanville's {{northern}} sister Fort Largs—then {{known as the}} Port Adelaide battery—to the same specification as Fort Glanville; its barracks and rear defence wall were finished in 1885. Though guns had already been purchased specially, plans for the third fort at Glenelg were not proceeded with. South Australia was experiencing a depression in 1886 and that coupled with a report by General James Bevan Edwards scuttled plans for the third coastal fort. As early as 1888 the emphasis for defence of the Adelaide coast had already shifted to Fort Largs; a fact cited as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for abandonment of the Glenelg fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Alexander, who {{was also}} a highly {{regarded}} football player, did not play organized basketball until eighth grade. Alexander played on Curie's 2010–11 varsity team as a freshman, but had little impact at first and sat out some games in December. He missed the first ten games due to a heart murmur. In late December, he started getting local attention as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> Curie remained undefeated. During the Chicago Public High School League (CPL) and Illinois High School Association (IHSA) playoffs, he contributed significant performances. On March 9, 2011, Curie was eliminated from the IHSA playoffs in a Class 4A sectional semifinal by Lyons Township High School as freshman Alexander posted 9 points, 13 rebounds, and 2 blocks in a 66–64 loss. His late-season contributions gave Curie an added dimension, as the team finished with a 28–3 record. Following his freshman season, Alexander began to be recognized by local evaluators as a potential top national recruit. After Jabari Parker and Jahlil Okafor, Alexander was already considered the best Chicago area basketball prospect. He earned Red-Central all-conference recognition.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{moving to}} Napa, she started {{working in the}} tasting room at Sterling Vineyards and at a wine shop. During this time, she was getting her Master's degree at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> California, Davis. She was told by her {{professor}} {{that she would not}} get a job in Napa Valley because of being a woman. She tried to get a job at Freemark Abbey and was denied <b>the</b> job. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> owners gave was because she was too short and they believed she could not work in the wine cellar. She almost started working at Christian Brothers in the enology lab. Many women worked in labs and weren't allowed to be winemakers. Corison decided against working in the lab and in 1978 she became an intern at Freemark Abbey. She eventually became a winemaker for the winery. She then joined Chappellet Winery, in 1983, as head winemaker, working there for almost ten years. At Chappellet she was able to focus on developing her skills at creating Cabernet Sauvignon wines. She dislikes wines with high alcohol content and fruit forward wines. She does not add additives of acids to her wine.|$|R

5|$|English naval {{power was}} vital to Edward I's {{successful}} campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland {{and his allies}} in the Islands to transport and supply his armies. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for Robert I's success was his ability to call on naval forces from the Islands. As {{a result of the}} expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea. The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing Edward II to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314. Scottish naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318.|$|E
5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} subway and bus systems, for many more riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for every dollar of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to better}} {{understand}} emigration pressures in migrant sending countries by looking at <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> propensity to migrate at the individual level. The analysis is based on survey data from Albania, Moldova, Egypt and Tunisia collected by the European Training Foundation (ETF) in 2006. Within this context the study focuses on: (i) <b>the</b> self-selection <b>of</b> migrants in terms of skills; and (ii) <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> selective immigration policies on the migration process. The paper finds that migration pressures, or the intent to migrate, {{are not subject to}} any self-selection. However, immigration policies exert a strong out-selection that is likely <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> why positive selection is found in many studies. Further, the study confirms that the European Union (EU) attracts comparatively lower skilled migrants than other destinations.
