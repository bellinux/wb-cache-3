The suitability of each approach in the context of deterministic simulation models is assessed based on theoretical properties, performance on examples, and the selection and sensitivity of required hyperparameters. In general, we favor a parameter updating approach because it uses more intuitive hyperparameters, it performs sensibly on examples, and because the alternative event updating approach fails to exhibit a desirable property (relative propensity consistency) in all cases. Inference in deterministic simulation models is an increasingly important statistical and practical problem, and supra-Bayesian methods represent one viable option for achieving a sensible <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> opinion. 1...|$|R

Our proof techniques {{are very different from}} the standard ones and are based on recent results about defensive forecasting. Given the probabilities produced by a defensive forecasting algorithm, which are known to be well calibrated and to have high resolution in the long run, we use the Expected Loss Minimization principle to find a suitable decision. ...|$|R

One <b>of</b> the great challenges is to effectively collect annotated training samples, especially {{to be able}} to generalize a small <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> feedback from area scale to a more global scale. One possible solution is to use advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques, to select annotations from training samples, and propagate effectively and concisely. We focus on the critical issue of understanding the differ-ent levels of annotations. Using the framework proposed by the RepLab contest we present a considerable number of experiments in Reputation Monitoring and Author Profiling. The proposed methods rely on a large variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods exploiting tweet contents and some background contextual information. We show that simple algorithms only considering tweets content are effective against state-of-the-art techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to determine trends {{in the teaching of}} high school chemistry during the years 1924 to 1932, inclusive, as reflected in the Journal of Chemical Education. Presently, there is not a study available which gives, for the secondary school, a complete and detailed inventory of proposed objectives, methods, materials and devices in the field of chemistry. Therefore, in this report, a new combination of existing materials will be presented. Current trends will be classified. In so far as the findings are conclusive, they will form a background against which the teacher of chemistry can project his philosophy of teaching. The combined ideas of teachers of chemistry from schools at large will be presented. The result will have the strength that comes from the <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> knowledge and varied experience.

40|$|AbstractThe usual theory <b>of</b> {{prediction}} with <b>expert</b> advice {{does not}} differentiate {{between good and}} bad “experts”: its typical results only assert {{that it is possible}} to efficiently merge not too extensive <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts,</b> no matter how good or how bad they are. On the other hand, it is natural to expect that good experts’ predictions will in some way agree with the actual outcomes (e. g., they will be accurate on the average). In this paper we show that, in the case of the Brier prediction game (also known as the square-loss game), the predictions of a good (in some weak and natural sense) expert must satisfy the law of large numbers (both strong and weak) and the law of the iterated logarithm; we also show that two good experts’ predictions must be in asymptotic agreement. To help the reader's intuition, we give a Kolmogorov-complexity interpretation of our results. Finally, we briefly discuss possible extensions of our results to more general games; the limit theorems for sequences of events in conventional probability theory correspond to the log-loss game...|$|R
