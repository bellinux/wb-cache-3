5|$|With a {{loan from}} his cousin, Dudley Selden, and letters of {{recommendation}} from Ellsworth, Colt formed a corporation of venture capitalists in April 1836 {{to bring his}} idea to market.

5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} protection of his <b>patent</b> <b>rights.</b> Even though he lawfully held the only patent on a revolver, scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly in litigation. In {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company's transition to the cartridge system and blocked other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they created their own.|$|E

Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v.

The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E

5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay, and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) {{or whether it was}} only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E
50|$|Since a <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> {{is also a}} kind of {{property}} right, an act of infringement of a <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> constitutes a tort, and a patentee who sustains damages {{as a result of}} an act of infringement may demand damages from the infringer in tort (Article 709 of the Civil Code). Unlike an ordinary tortious act however, in the case of the infringement of a <b>patent</b> <b>right,</b> it is often difficult to prove the amount of the loss, as well as intent or negligence on the part of the infringer. For that reason, the Patent Act contains a special provision for calculating the amount of loss (Article 102), a provision on the presumption of negligence (Article 103), and a provision permitting the determination of a reasonable amount of loss (Article 105-3).|$|R

5|$|In {{the year}} before Apple and Samsung began suing each other on most continents, and while Apple and HTC were already embroiled in a patent fight, Motorola Mobility and Apple started a period of intense patent litigation. The Motorola-Apple patent imbroglio {{commenced}} with claims and cross-claims between the companies for patent infringement and encompassed multiple forums in multiple countries as each party sought friendly venues for litigating its respective claims; the fight also included administrative law rulings as well as ITC and European Commission involvement. As of April 2012, the controversy centered on whether a FRAND license to a components manufacturer carries over to an equipment manufacturer incorporating the component into equipment, an issue not addressed in the U.S. Supreme Court's default exhaustion doctrine in Quanta v. LG Electronics. p. 3. Accessed 2012-4-13. Stern cites , 128 S. Ct. 2109, 2008; accessed 2012-4-13.

In June 2012, appellate Judge Richard Posner ordered dismissal of the case with prejudice and Apple announced its intention to appeal a month later.|$|E
5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared {{in support of the}} defendant. Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's <b>patent</b> <b>rights,</b> it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|E

40|$|This article {{studies the}} opinion system of Japanese Patent Act. Replacing the trial {{to confirm the}} scope of a <b>patent</b> <b>right,</b> the opinion system of Japanese Patent Act was {{introduced}} in 1959. The technical scope of a <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> {{is much more difficult}} to determine compared to the scope of a right for a tangible article, which accordingly gives rise to more disputes. Also, when working a certain technology, the status of both the patentee and third parties would be unstable if its technical scope were unclear. As a matter of course, such a scope is something that should ultimately be determined in court, but in some situations it would be beneficial if an impartial advisory opinion could be given by the competent authority relating to the patented technology in advance, or while the case is pending. The system established to that end is the opinion system. The proprietor of a patent or any other person may request the patent office to issue an advisory opinion on the technical scope of a patented invention. The discussion of the opinion system has been done in conjunction with that of whether to abolish the trial to confirm the scope of a <b>patent</b> <b>right.</b> Even though designed to replace the trial to confirm the scope of a <b>patent</b> <b>right,</b> the opinion system has a large difference in their nature. The discussion of the opinion system and that of the trial to confirm the scope of a <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> must be carried out at a different point. In other words, whether to improve or to repeal the trial to confirm the scope of a <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> that determined by the Patent Office should be approached from the aspect of the principle of authority distribution and the usefulness. On the other hand, the introduction and operation of opinion system by the Patent Office, should be judged from the aspect of its utility properties. Furthermore admitting that the system for determining the protective scope of th patented invention at the stage before infringement action or in preparation of business, improvement or selection is required as this most appropriate scheme. It must be determined whether or not to abolish the system itself. Also, if abolish systems, by evaluating the confusion associated with it, an alternative to this must be discussed. Although there is no legal binding force, opinion system of Japanese Patent Office has received the social respect. Introducing the opinion system of Japanese Patent Office, we should consider whether those functions of opinion system could be realized in our system...|$|R

However, some Western observers say China lacks administrative protection for patents. In 1992, the United States and China signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to allow administrative protection (AP) in China for US pharmaceutical patents granted between 1986 and 1992. The MOU provided seven-and-a-half years of market exclusivity, or AP rights, in China for pharma patents that were: not protected by exclusive rights before the amendment of current Chinese laws; patent protected after 1 January 1986 and before 1 January 1993 in an MOU signatory country; not previously marketed in China.
