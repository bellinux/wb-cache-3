5|$|In 1956, Christy {{was one of}} {{a number}} of {{scientists}} from Caltech who publicly called for a ban on atmospheric nuclear testing. The 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty that Christy advocated put an end to one of his most unusual projects. He worked with Freeman Dyson on Project Orion, the design of a spacecraft <b>propelled</b> <b>by</b> atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{two of the}} disused {{platforms}} {{hosted a}} theatrical performance of The Railway Children by E. Nesbit. The audience was seated {{either side of the}} actual railway track. The show included the use of a steam locomotive coupled to one of the original carriages from the 1970s film (<b>propelled</b> <b>by</b> a diesel locomotive). The performance moved to London after two acclaimed summer runs at the National Railway Museum in York.|$|E
50|$|A human-powered {{hydrofoil}} {{is a small}} hydrofoil watercraft <b>propelled</b> entirely <b>by</b> {{the muscle}} power of its operator(s). Hydrofoils are the fastest water-based vehicles <b>propelled</b> solely <b>by</b> human power. They can reach speeds of up to 34 km/h, easily exceeding the world records set by competitive rowing which stand at about 20 km/h. This speed advantage is achieved since hydrofoils lack a submerged body to provide buoyancy, greatly reducing the drag force.|$|R

5|$|The hemmema {{replaced}} the galleys {{that had made}} up {{the core of the}} Swedish archipelago fleets until the mid-18th century. Compared to galleys, the hemmema had a deeper draft and was slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for the crew, carried more stores, was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times as many heavy guns. It could be <b>propelled</b> <b>by</b> either sails or oars but was still smaller and more maneuverable than most sailing warships, which made it suitable for operations in confined waters.|$|E
5|$|Up {{to the end}} of the 18th century, slate was {{extracted}} on a {{small scale}} by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord, carted slate to the ports, and then shipped it to England, Ireland and sometimes France. Towards the close of the century, the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves, on a larger scale. After the government abolished slate duty in 1831, rapid expansion was <b>propelled</b> <b>by</b> the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates to the ports.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} considered using {{a hydrogen}} bomb for the project, but the United States Air Force vetoed this idea {{due to the}} weight of such a device, {{as it would be}} too heavy to be <b>propelled</b> <b>by</b> the missile which would have been used. It was then decided to use a W25 warhead, a small, lightweight warhead with a relatively low 1.7 kiloton yield. By contrast, the Little Boy bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of some 13–18 kilotons. The W25 would be carried by a rocket toward the hidden side of the Moon, near the terminator, where it would detonate on impact. The dust cloud resulting from the explosion would be lit by the Sun and therefore visible from Earth. According to Reiffel, the Air Force's progress in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles would have made such a launch feasible by 1959.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s saw the {{increased}} use of audio cassettes and videotapes for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture and tape trading, <b>propelled</b> <b>by</b> the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honour system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, {{by the end of the}} 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio {{class was}} {{designed}} in the 1970s to carry the concurrently-designed Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile. Both variants of the Tridents—the UGM-96 Trident I and the UGM-133 Trident II—are <b>propelled</b> <b>by</b> three-stage solid propellant rockets and are equipped with 8–14 nuclear warheads. The 73,000lb (33,100kg) UGM-96, {{with a range of}} 4,000mi (6,400km), served from October 1979, starting with the Benjamin Franklin-class USS Francis Scott Key, until 2006. The 130,000lb (59,000kg) UGM-133, with a range of 6,000mi (9,700km), is in service , having been introduced in 1990 with USS Tennessee. The primary self-defense weapon of the class is the Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo. Ohio-class submarines that carry ballistic missiles receive orders from the United States Strategic Command based in Nebraska.|$|E
5|$|The {{first human}} {{presence}} in the region dates to 8,000years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds. About 2,000years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until about 500CE. Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and <b>propelled</b> <b>by</b> throwing devices called atlatls.|$|E
5000|$|The {{man-of-war}} (pl. men-of-war; also man of war, man-o'-war, man o' war, {{or simply}} man) was a British Royal Navy expression for a powerful warship or frigate from the 16th to the 19th century. The term often {{refers to a}} ship armed with cannon and <b>propelled</b> primarily <b>by</b> sails, {{as opposed to a}} galley which is <b>propelled</b> primarily <b>by</b> oars. The man-of-war was developed in Portugal in the early 15th century from earlier roundships {{with the addition of a}} second mast to form the carrack. The 16th century saw the carrack evolve into the galleon and then the ship of the line.The evolution of the term has been given thus: ...|$|R

5|$|There {{were many}} {{advances}} and new designs in gunpowder weapons during {{the beginning of}} the dynasty, but by the mid to late Ming the Chinese began to frequently employ European-style artillery and firearms. The Huolongjing, compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen sometime before the latter's death on 16 May 1375 (with a preface added by Jiao in 1412), featured many types of cutting-edge gunpowder weaponry for the time. This includes hollow, gunpowder-filled exploding cannonballs, land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights, pins, and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses, naval mines, fin-mounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control, multistage rockets <b>propelled</b> <b>by</b> booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth {{from the end of the}} missile (shaped like a dragon's head), and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. <b>Propelled</b> <b>by</b> Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|Cibber was the {{de facto}} leader of the triumvirate, and he led the theatre through a {{controversial}} but generally successful period until 1733, when he sold his controlling interest to John Highmore. It {{is likely that the}} sale was at a vastly inflated price and that Colley's goal was simply to get out of debts and make a profit (see Robert Lowe in his edition of Cibber's Apology). Members of the troupe at the time were most displeased; an actor's revolt was organised and executed; Charles Fleetwood came to control the theatre. Fleetwood's tenure was tumultuous; his abolition of the practice of allowing footmen free access to the upper gallery led to riots in 1737, and Fleetwood's gambling problems entangled the theatre in his own financial difficulties. It was during this period that actor Charles Macklin (a native of Inishowen in County Donegal in Ulster) rose to fame, <b>propelled</b> <b>by</b> a singular performance as Shylock in an early 1741 production of The Merchant of Venice, in which he introduced a realistic, naturalistic style of acting, abandoning the artificial bombast typical to dramatic roles prior.|$|E
