50|$|The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> is 11 to 16 cm {{long with}} a rounded scale-covered tail of 12 to 16 cm. It weighs 35 to 80 g. Pyrenean desmans have long {{sensitive}} noses, and small front paws but large webbed back paws. They can close off their nostrils and ears with valves {{in order to}} stop water penetration, and use echolocation.|$|E
50|$|Studies on microfauna, {{that was}} very {{abundant}} and relatively homogeneous over the entire sequence have, apart from confirming the interglacial climate during the stratigraphic sequence, delivered an independent set of discoveries. From the more than 80,000 remains of rodent species identified, among others were: Arvicola terrestris, Mimomys pyrenaicus, Mimomys pyrenaicus november. sp., Mimomys salpetrierensis, and the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> or muskrat (Galemys pyrenaïcus).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> (Galemys pyrenaicus) {{is a small}} semiaquatic nocturnal mammal {{related to}} moles and shrews, {{and is one of}} only two {{surviving}} species of the tribe Desmanini. The range of the species centers on northwestern Spain and northern Portugal, but it is under threat due to changes to its habitat. In Portugal it is called [...] "toupeira-d'água", which means [...] "water mole".|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} birds {{live in the}} area {{surrounding}} the cave complex, including the golden eagle, short-toed snake eagle, Egyptian vulture, Eurasian sparrowhawk, Eurasian eagle-owl, griffon vulture, tawny owl, and the peregrine falcon. Inside the caves there are several species of bats, such as the cave bat, greater horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe bat, and Geoffroy's bat. Other mammal species that live in the region include the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman,</b> wildcat, dormouse or the Eurasian otter.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} {{species of the}} Park was the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex which unfortunately went extinct in January 2000 in spite of preservation efforts. The Pyrenean chamois {{is a type of}} goat. There are other species such as the marmot, boar and the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> or water-mole (Galemys pyrenaicus), and great birds like the golden eagle, the bearded vulture, the griffon vulture, hawks, and the royal owl.|$|E

5000|$|In the moors {{there are}} hares (leporidae), rabbits (oryctolagus cuniculus), {{partridges}} (phasianidae) and turtle doves (columbina). Along the river channels {{there is the}} presence of herons (nycticorax nycticorax), otters (lutra lutra), the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> (galemys pyrenaicus), while in the moors are found the Great Bustard (otis tarda), Little Bustard (tetrax tetrax) and montagu's harrier (circus pygargus), a species listed in the Catálogo Nacional de Especies Amenazadas or [...] "National Catalogue of Endangered Species" [...] (Royal Decree 439/1990, of 30 March).|$|E
50|$|In their fauna the Pyrenees {{present some}} {{striking}} instances of endemism. The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> is {{found only in}} some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other desmans are confined to the rivers of the Caucasus in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte (Euproctus pyrenaicus), an endemic relative of the salamander, also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the caverns of Ariège, the principal genera of which are Anophthalmus and Adelops.|$|E
50|$|The park's climate, varied {{vegetation}} and isolation allow a rich wildlife based on various raptorial birds such as hawks, booted eagles, short toed snake eagles, Egyptian vultures {{and a few}} more. But the true ornithological treasure is the middle peak woodpecker that has its largest population of Spain in this park. There are also river mammals like the otter, the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman,</b> the European mink and the more common forest mammals such as the fox, the wildcat and the beech marten. Among amphibians, the Spanish painted frog, the agile frog and the alpine newt inhabit the park.|$|E
50|$|With the {{discovery}} of Mimomys salpetrierensis, the former hypothesis of defining the Lower Pleistocene and Middle Pleistocene through the disappearance of Mimomys has been called into question. This also applies to other species, such as Pliomys and Allocricetus, which were thought to have become extinct during the Eemian. Another example is the European adder (Vipera berus) which evolved towards the Baskian viper and now occupies the Cantabrian region and the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> (Galemys pyrenaïcus), found in fossil form at the site. The European water vole (Arvicola terrestris) retained a local enclave whereas {{the rest of the}} population turned towards Asia.|$|E
50|$|The desman's body {{is covered}} in fur, with the {{exception}} of its tail and nose. Markings typical of the species are a brown body with a light coloured underside. The nose is black and {{is covered in}} whiskers, which it uses to feel the movement of prey as it sticks its nose into mud or crevices while searching for food. The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> can live at least 3.5 years. The animals are nocturnal hunters of small invertebrates, snails and shrimp. They breed up to three times a year, with the period of gestation lasting around thirty days. Three to four young are born in each litter.|$|E
50|$|The {{forests of}} the Néouvielle massif are {{arranged}} in thickets of (mountain pine), the remaining space consists of rhododendrons and lawn. At {{the heart of the}} reserve, mountain pine reaches a European record-breaking 2600 m high. The reserves flora is lush, with 1,250 vascular plants, some of which also reach record-breaking heights, like the foxglove at 1800 m.The vegetation hosts a wide array of fauna with many emblematic breeds like the alpine marmot, the heather cock, the red crossbill, the golden eagle, the griffon, the egyptian vulture, le red kite, the bearded vulture as well as endemical animals: <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman,</b> Pyrenean brook salamander and isard.|$|E
50|$|The Russian desman {{is one of}} two {{surviving}} {{species of}} the tribe Desmanini, the other being the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman.</b> Despite its outward similarity to muskrats (a rodent), the Russian desman is actually part of the mole family Talpidae in the order Soricomorpha. Like other moles, it is functionally blind and obtains much of its sensory input from the touch-sensitive Eimer's organs {{at the end of its}} long, bilobed snout. However, the hind feet are webbed and the tail is laterally flattened —specializations for its aquatic habitat. The body is 18 to 21 cm long while the tail is 17 to 20 cm in length. Easily the largest species of mole, it weighs 400 to 520 g.|$|E
5000|$|More {{recent studies}} have shown that data on the range of their {{habitats}} collected during the 1980s and 1990s is unreliable. Their range had previously been thought of as the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula and the Pyrenees mountains stretching into France. The habitat of the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> is under threat, and research has shown that it [...] "is endangered or almost extinct" [...] in the southern areas of its range. Researchers have determined that this {{is the result of the}} construction of dams, and also that the species may be vulnerable to water pollution. Included in their range is the Alt Pirineu Natural Park in the Pyrenees, where desmans live along mountain streams.|$|E
50|$|The American mink (Neovison vison) is a semiaquatic {{species of}} {{mustelid}} native to North America, though human intervention {{has expanded its}} range to many parts of Europe and South America. Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a least-concern species by the IUCN. Since the extinction of the sea mink, the American mink is the only extant member of the genus Neovison. The American mink is a carnivore that feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its introduced range in Europe it has been classified as an invasive species linked to declines in European mink, <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman,</b> and water vole populations. It is the animal most frequently farmed for its fur, exceeding the silver fox, sable, marten, and skunk in economic importance.|$|E
50|$|As {{a highly}} {{opportunistic}} predator, the Eurasian eagle-owl will hunt almost any appropriately sized prey they encounter. Most often they take what ever prey is locally common {{and can take}} {{a large number of}} species considered harmful to human financial interests such as rats and mice. Eurasian eagle-owls do take rare or endangered species as well. Among the species considered at least vulnerable (up to critically endangered as in the mink and eel, both heavily overexploited by humans) to extinction known to be hunted by Eurasian eagle-owls are Russian desman (Desmana moschata) <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> (Galemys pyrenaicus), barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus), European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus), southwestern water vole (Arvicola sapidus), European mink (Mustela lutreola), marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna), lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythrops), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), greater spotted eagle (Clanga clanga), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), saker falcon (Falco cherrug), houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata), great bustard (Otis tarda), spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus).|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} regions have peculiar fauna {{relatively little}} influenced by human activities.The northernmost are the Scandinavian mountains. Pyrenees present many instances of endemism. The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> is {{found only in}} some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains, Pyrenean brook salamander also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among the other peculiarities of the Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the caverns of Ariège (Anophthalmus, Adelops). The Pyrenean ibex mysteriously became extinct in 2000; the native Pyrenean brown bear was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s but was re-introduced in 1996. Some common animals of the Alps are Alpine ibex, Alpine marmot, Tengmalm's owl and ptarmigan. The Apennine Mountains provide habitat to Marsican brown bear and the Italian wolf. The Carpathian Mountains are a range of mountains forming an arc of roughly 1,500 km across Central and Eastern Europe and are inhabited by the largest populations in Europe of brown bears, wolves and lynxes, as well as chamois and other animals.|$|E
50|$|Between 1973 and 1980 {{he created}} {{his most famous}} {{documentary}} series, El Hombre y la Tierra (Spanish for Humans and Earth) which was divided into three parts: the Iberian, South American, and North American series. The Iberian series consisted of three parts and an unfinished fourth part. The South American series was filmed in 1973 in Venezuela in Los Llanos, the Orinoco and Amazon basins. Originally conceived as an eight-episode production, enough material was filmed for eighteen episodes. Unfortunately, only the episodes of Canada and Alaska of the American series were filmed due to his premature death. The complete series included 124 episodes, most of them shot in Spain. They used 35 mm film, which posed significant logistic and technical challenges at the time. The series gained international recognition. Its memorable soundtrack composed by Antón García Abril soon became recognizable to all. Notable accomplishments of the series included the filming of species for the first time, such as the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman.</b> Using imprinted animals that had become accustomed to human presence, but retained their natural behavioral patterns, his team filmed stunning images. Among them, wolf hunting sequences and the golden eagle capturing a mouflon are notorious. The sequences shot with wolves required {{him to become a}} member of the herd during the imprinting process. The series was broadcast in many countries gaining large audiences. In Spain, it was awarded (Premio Ondas, Antena de Oro) and internationally (Monte Carlo Television Festival). It is noteworthy that the episodes did not include a pre-filming script: Felix improvised the development of each chapter. In April 1980, the city of Burgos awarded him the Gold Medal of the City posthumously.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> (Galemys pyrenaicus) is a small-endangered {{semi-aquatic}} mammal {{endemic to}} the Pyrenean Mountains {{and to the}} northern half of the Iberian Peninsula whose ecology and biology are still poorly known. Its ecological relationships with other semi aquatic mammals like the aquatic shrew (Neomys fodiens) or the European otter (Lutra lutra) are also unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman,</b> aquatic shrew and European otter faeces from the same French Pyrenean regions, in order to analyze their respective diets and to detect possible predation or competition patterns among them. To study precisely their diet, we used next-generation sequencing methods (Ion Torrent or Ilumina miseq technologies). We amplified and sequenced a small DNA minibarcode (133 bp) of the COI gene in 445 faeces samples from the three species. In the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> faeces, we were able to identify a large set of prey species with a positive match (more than 98 % of identity with a reference sequence). These species belonged to four orders and eleven families among which Trichoptera and Hydropsychidae were the most frequent, respectively. The aquatic shrew diet evidenced similar aquatic preys as compared to the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>Desman.</b> However, it also evidenced an important part of terrestrial invertebrates like woodlouse, ants, coleopters or myriapods. The otter diet was mainly constituted of fishes (eg. Cyprinidae, Salmonidae).

40|$|The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> (Galemys pyrenaicus) is {{probably}} one of the most threatened European mammal species. This small insectivorous and semi-aquatic species is endemic to the Pyrenean Mountains and of the north of the Iberic Peninsula. Many biologic aspects of this species are currently suffering from a major lack of information, particularly those concerning its genetics. Therefore the implementation of conservative efforts for the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> remains extremely difficult. In order to improve the knowledge of this vulnerable species and notably, to better understand its distribution area, the first aim of our research was to develop non invasive genetic identification methods based on faeces. The second aim was to have a first look at the phylogeographic structure of the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman.</b> The identification methods were developed on the basis of the sequencing of a small mitochondrial DNA (cyt b) fragment as well as a RFLP method. These approaches led to the identification of the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> and to the differentiation of the latter from two other species living in the same type of habitat, the white-throated dipper (Cinclus cinclus) and the water shrew (Neomys fodiens). Two haplotypes were found in the studied Pyrenean populations but no phylogeographic structure could be established. A dozen of microsatellites markers were also developed during this work and 5 of these were found to be polymorphic.

40|$|The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> (Galemys pyrenaicus) is a small, semiaquatic mammal {{endemic to}} the Pyrenean Mountains and the {{northern}} half of the Iberian Peninsula where it lives in cold and well-oxygenated flowing mountain streams. This species is currently classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List and has been undergoing habitat loss and fragmentation for decades, inevitably impacting its distribution. A recent genetic study, based on mitochondrial and intronic sequences, showed that the genetic variability of the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> is very low in the Pyrenees. In this study, we investigated the potential existence of genetic structure and gene flow at a smaller scale using 24 polymorphic microsatellite loci. As the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> is a very elusive species, we supplemented our tissue sample collection with samples of feces collected in the French range of this species. We successfully identified 70 individuals based on 355 fecal samples. Bayesian analyses revealed 3 genetic and geographic clusters (1 eastern, 1 central, and 1 western, including 3 genetic subclusters), with origins tracing back only 200 years. These clusters were characterized by low levels of genetic diversity and high inbreeding coefficients. Although gene flow among clusters appeared to be limited, populations seem to have exchanged alleles recently. Therefore, connectivity between watersheds should be enhanced to maintain genetic diversity and potentially improve the long-term survival of the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> in France.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Species with strict {{ecological}} requirements {{may provide}} {{new insights into}} the forces that shaped the geographic variation of genetic diversity. The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman,</b> Galemys pyrenaicus, is a small semi-aquatic mammal that inhabits clean streams of the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula and is endangered in most of its geographic range, but its genetic structure is currently unknown. While the stringent ecological demands derived from its aquatic habitat might have caused a partition of the genetic diversity among river basins, Pleistocene glaciations would have generated a genetic pattern related to glacial refugia. RESULTS: To study the relative importance of historical and ecological factors in the genetic structure of G. pyrenaicus, we used mitochondrial and intronic sequences of specimens covering most of the species range. We show, first, that the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> has very low levels of genetic diversity compared to other mammals. In addition, phylogenetic and dating analyses of the mitochondrial sequences reveal a strong phylogeographic structure of a Middle Pleistocene origin, suggesting that the main lineages arose during periods of glacial isolation. Furthermore, both the spatial distribution of nuclear and mitochondrial diversity and the results of species distribution modeling suggest the existence of a major glacial refugium in the northwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Finally, the main mitochondrial lineages show a striking parapatric distribution without any apparent exchange of mitochondrial haplotypes between the lineages that came into secondary contact (although with certain permeability to nuclear genes), indicating incomplete mixing after the post-glacial recolonization. On the other hand, when we analyzed the partition of the genetic diversity among river basins, the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman</b> showed a lower than expected genetic differentiation among main rivers. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of mitochondrial and intronic markers in G. pyrenaicus showed the predominant effects of Pleistocene glaciations on the genetic structure of this species, while the distribution of the genetic diversity was not greatly influenced by the main river systems. These results and, particularly, the discovery of a marked phylogeographic structure, may have important implications for the conservation of the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>desman...</b>|$|E
