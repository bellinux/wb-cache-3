OBJECTIVE To explore the possible association of changes in the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds with changes in the sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> in South America since 1990. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We searched primary sources for the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds in South American countries since 1990 (the year that the Latin American countries signed the Caracas Declaration) and compared these changes against the sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations.</b> The associations between the numbers of psychiatric beds and the sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> were tested using fixed-effects regression of panel data. Economic variables were considered as covariates. Sufficiently reliable and complete data were obtained from 6 countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The numbers of psychiatric beds and the sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations.</b> RESULTS Since 1990, the numbers of psychiatric beds decreased in all 6 countries (ranging from - 2. 0 % to - 71. 9 %), while the sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> increased substantially (ranging from 16. 1 % to 273. 0 %). Panel data regression analysis across the 6 countries showed a significant inverse relationship between numbers of psychiatric beds and sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations.</b> On average, the removal of 1 bed was associated with 5. 18 more prisoners (95 % CI, 3. 10 - 7. 26; P =. 001), which was reduced to 2. 78 prisoners (95 % CI, 2. 59 - 2. 97; P <. 001) when economic growth was considered as a covariate. The association between the numbers of psychiatric beds and the sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> remained practically unchanged when income inequality was considered as a covariate (- 4. 28 [95 % CI, - 5. 21 to - 3. 36]; P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Since 1990, the numbers of psychiatric beds have substantially decreased in South America, while the sizes of the <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> have increased against a background of strong economic growth. The changes appear to be associated because the numbers of beds decreased more extensively when and where the sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> increased. These findings are consistent with and specify the assumption of an association between the numbers of psychiatric beds and the sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations.</b> More research is needed to understand the drivers of the capacities of psychiatric hospitals and prisons and to explore reasons for their associatio...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds and prisoners using recent statistics. Design: An analysis of published data from 158 countries. Methods: Multiple linear regression techniques were used to {{examine the relationship}} between per capita measures of income and numbers of psychiatric hospital beds and the dependant variable of per capita <b>prison</b> <b>populations,</b> in high and low-and-middle-income countries. Results: <b>Prison</b> and psychiatric <b>populations</b> were positively correlated in low-and-middle-income countries. There was no relationship between the number of psychiatric hospital beds and <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> in high-income countries. Conclusions: In low-and-middle income countries the association between prison and psychiatric hospital populations may depend on the ability of governments to pay for custodial institutions as well as differences in cultural attitudes towards abnormal and criminal behaviour. In high-income (HI) countries psychiatric and <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> are not related and probably determined by separate social and political factors...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned {{what had happened to the}} first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main <b>prison</b> <b>population</b> and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.|$|E
