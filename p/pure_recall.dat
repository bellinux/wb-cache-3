The motivation behind exploring a graphical password scheme {{is based on}} the remarkable ability of humans to recall pictures easily. In this paper we are presenting the novel approaches for security of <b>pure</b> <b>recall</b> based techniques with the help of biometric authentication i. e. stroke analysis and mouse movement...|$|E
40|$|Information {{visualization}} {{has recently}} been formulated as an information retrieval problem, where {{the goal is to}} find similar data points based on the visualized nonlinear projection, and the visualization is optimized to maximize a compromise between (smoothed) precision and recall. We turn the visualization into a generative modeling task where a simple user model parameterized by the data coordinates is optimized, neighborhood relations are the observed data, and straightforward maximum likelihood estimation corresponds to Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE). While SNE maximizes <b>pure</b> <b>recall,</b> adding a mixture component that “explains away ” misses allows our generative model to focus on maximizing precision as well. The resulting model is a generative solution to maximizing tradeoffs between precision and recall. The model outperforms earlier models in terms of precision and recall and in external validation by unsupervised classification. ...|$|E
40|$|As we know, {{number of}} Internet users are {{increasing}} drastically. Now, {{people are using}} different online services provided by banks, colleges/schools, hospitals, online utility, bill payment and online shopping sites. To access online services, text-based authentication system is in use. The text-based authentication scheme faces some drawbacks with usability and security issues that bring troubles to users. The core element of computational trust is identity. The aim of the paper {{is to make the}} system more compliable for the imposters and more reliable for the users, by using the graphical authentication approach. In this paper, we are using the more powerful tool of encoding the options in graphical QR format and also there will be the acknowledgment which will send to the user’s mobile for final verification. The main methodology depends upon the encryption option and final verification by confirming a set of pass phrase on the legal users, the outcome of the result is very powerful as it only gives the result at once when the process is successfully done. All processes are cross linked serially as the output of the 1 st process, is the input of the 2 nd and so on. The system is a combination of recognition and <b>pure</b> <b>recall</b> based technique. Presented scheme is useful for devices like PDAs, iPod, phone etc. which are more handy and convenient to use than traditional desktop computer systems...|$|E
50|$|A {{video of}} Dr. Cesar A. Villariba, a known {{historian}} of Lucena City and Quezon Province, was shown wherein he mentioned {{that among the}} famous and important women of Lucena, Hermana Fausta is truly a remarkable one. In addition, Dr. Rebecca V. de Ocampo, a former superintendent of Lucena City and Marinduque and now president of Girl Scouts of the Philippines-Quezon Council, expressed her belief that Hermana Fausta could be the model that youth of today is clamoring for. Then Purificacion Jawili, or Tita Puring, shared her fond memories of Hermana Fausta {{while she was still}} a young child. “Ang diwa ni Hermana Fausta… ang pagtulong sa kapwa ay dumadaloy” said Tita <b>Puring</b> <b>recalling</b> how “banal” Lola Uta was.|$|R
50|$|The {{abstract}} {{sculpture in}} a <b>pure</b> white <b>recalls</b> the contemporary architecture of Le Corbusier, {{and may also}} have been inspired by Hepworth's visits to the studios of Brancusi and Arp on a visit to France with Nicholson in 1932. Hepworth later accepted criticism from physicist John Desmond Bernal that the elements are all positively curved, and suggested that the work could have been improved by the sphere being replaced by a cylinder.|$|R
40|$|This work studies two-person zero-sum {{repeated}} {{games in}} which {{at least one of}} the players is restricted to (mixtures of) bounded <b>recall</b> strategies. A (<b>pure)</b> k <b>recall</b> strategy is a strategy that relies only on the last k periods of history. This work improves previous results [2, 4] on repeated games with bounded recall by extending the range of settings for which we can approximate the value. Bounded recall is one of the alternatives proposed by Aumann [1] to model limited rationality in repeated games. Lehrer [2] studied infinitely repeated two-player zero-sum games where both players have bounded recall. Neyman and Okada [3, 4] study a setting in which one player is bounded while the other is fully rational. In [4] they examine specifically the case of bounded recall. The current work extends results of both [2] and [4]. Apparently, in all previous works, the limited player secures the minimax payoff by playing an oblivious 1 strategy. Our main result follows this line: 2 Theorem 1. 1. Let G = be a two-player zero-sum game in strategic normal form. For every sequence of positive integers {Tk}∞k= 1 and every h 6 = log 2 I, if limk→∞ log 2 Tk k = h, the...|$|R
2500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim {{from many}} music critics. Nick Levine from BBC Music wrote a positive review, commenting: [...] "She's {{a natural and}} charismatic vocal presence, {{so much so that}} Want U Back even creates a recurring hook from – how to put this? – the sound of her ‘frustrated grunts’." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic wrote that the song is [...] "an infectious example of cutesy <b>pure</b> pop that <b>recall</b> Britney before she lost her innocence." [...] Alex Denney from NME considered it [...] "a sassy bit of bubble-drunk pop from Britney songwriter Max Martin." [...] Danner had previously written in another NME review that the song is [...] "a peachy-keen pop number that goes pining after an ex, Cher drawing comfort from the fact that, even if her beloved is going out with someone else now, at least they’re only getting sloppy seconds." [...] Joe Rivers from No Ripcord wrote that [...] "It's packed with hooks and has Cher’s personality stamped all over it." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies infinite-horizon {{bargaining}} {{between a}} seller and multiple buyers when externalities are present. We extend the analysis in Jehiel & Moldovanu (1995 a), by allowing for both pure and mixed equilibria. This extension is warranted, since under some circumstances, {{the complexity of}} the equilibria with bounded recall they analyze tend to infinity as players become very patient. We show that stationary subgame perfect equilibria always exist. Moreover, a characterization of the stationary subgame perfect equilibria in generic games is presented. Equilibria with delay exist only for strong positive externalities. Since each buyer receives a positive payoff when the seller agrees with some other buyer, positive externalities induces a war of attrition between buyers. Furthermore, the results when analyzing mixed stationary equilibria are different than when focusing on <b>pure</b> strategies with bounded <b>recall</b> as Jehiel & Moldovanu (1995 a). Specifically, they find delay only when externalities are negative. This report has been revised and the title has also changed to: "Stationary Equilibria in Bargaining with Externalities".   The link to the updated report is: [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|Physicist Leon M. Lederman {{numbered}} {{his home}} near Fermilab 137 {{based on the}} significance of the number to those in his profession. Lederman expounded on {{the significance of the}} number in his book [...] "The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?," [...] noting that not only was it the inverse of the fine-structure constant, but was also related to the probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon. He added that it also [...] "contains the crux of electromagnetism (the electron), relativity (the velocity of light), and quantum theory (Planck's constant). It would be less unsettling if the relationship between all these important concepts {{turned out to be one}} or three or maybe a multiple of pi. But 137?” The number 137, according to Lederman, [...] "shows up naked all over the place,” meaning that scientists on any planet in the universe using whatever units they have for charge or speed, and whatever their version of Planck’s constant may be, will all come up with 137, because it is a <b>pure</b> number. Lederman <b>recalled</b> that Richard Feynman had even suggested that all physicists put a sign in their offices with the number 137 to remind them of just how much they don’t know.|$|R

Cher's sound works best when it's light and poppy on songs Grow Up, End Up Here and Superhero - which remind you of early Lily Allen."Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, they said: [...] "When Lloyd stops trying so hard, she's {{actually}} a pretty compelling pop star. [...] "Want U Back" [...] and [...] "End Up Here" [...] are both infectious examples of cutesy <b>pure</b> pop that <b>recall</b> Britney Spears" [...] adding [...] "At times, Sticks + Stones sounds like such a calculated effort to copy everything that's hot in 2011 that it's likely to feel utterly irrelevant {{by the time the}} clock strikes 12 on New Year's Eve."BBC Music gave the album a positive review, they said: [...] "Cher has a natural and charismatic vocal presence throughout" [...] and ultimately called it [...] "A sassy, splashy modern pop album that's much better than its dodgy lead single". Digital Spy awarded the album 4 out of 5 stars, they said: [...] "Want U Back", [...] "With Ur Love", [...] "Playa Boi" [...] and [...] "Grow Up" [...] are all tracks worthy of downloading, and went on to praise [...] "Dub on the Track" [...] as [...] "loaded with attitude that few could pull off". Virgin Media gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, they said: [...] "Sticks + Stones is a very pleasant shock. It's sparky and restless and sustains Lloyd's mini rapping firebrand/cute crooner aesthetic through a quickfire run of 10 top-notch songs."NME gave the album 5 out of 10, they said: ‘Grow Up’, a grossly irritating slice of tweenish ragga-pop driven home with are-we-there-yet insistency,still-hideous ‘Swagger Jagger’ and bulldozing dubstep territory on ‘Dub On The Track’ but when Sticks + Stones stops charging about the place, there's evidence to suggest Cher is actually quite good at this pop malarkey. ‘Want U Back’ is a sassy bit of bubble-drunk pop, while ‘End Up Here’ finds Cher adopting a Beyoncé-aping vocal style with not-at-all-bad results.|$|R
