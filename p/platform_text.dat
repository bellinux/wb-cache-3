From the third Live shows, the iTunes bonus took effect and the artists' was decided by an equal say from both the public's vote and their respective coach's scores. In the Finals, each team was represented by one artist and the winner of the competition was only decided by the public's vote.|$|R

There is a wealth of knowledge hidden in this huge amount of articles, but reading and analysing all of them manually is not humanly possible. Text and data mining (TDM) can provide a solution. It can process millions of texts quickly and reveal patterns and trends that can lead to new discoveries in various fields, for example in research analytics, medicine, agriculture and social sciences.

40|$|Timely {{access to}} texts and {{reference}} materials {{is critical for}} students and researchers. For textbooks, sourcing deadlines to ensure timely access to relevant materials is a priority and reading lists need to be kept relevant to assure the best quality outcomes for learning and research. Existing logistics and distribution processes for printed materials can be inefficient in terms of timeliness of supply, cost to the consumer and effect on the environment. It {{is not unusual for}} books which are freighted via publishers’ distribution networks to be returned, resent after having been returned or pulped when not required.
