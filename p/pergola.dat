5|$|After her father's {{death in}} 1882, Alice Longfellow {{commissioned}} two of America's first female landscape architects, Martha Brookes Hutcheson and Ellen Biddle Shipman, to redesign the formal {{garden in the}} Colonial Revival style. The garden was recently restored by an organization called Friends of the Longfellow House, which completed {{the final stage of}} its reconstruction, the historic <b>pergola,</b> in 2008.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pergolas</b> may link pavilions or {{extend from}} a building's door {{to an open}} garden feature such as an {{isolated}} terrace or pool. Freestanding <b>pergolas,</b> those not attached to a home or other structure, provide a sitting area that allows for breeze and light sun, but offer protection from the harsh glare of direct sunlight. <b>Pergolas</b> also give climbing plants a structure on which to grow.|$|R
5000|$|The new {{pavilion}} will comprise four <b>pergolas</b> at {{the corners}} and Victorian colonnades to link up the <b>pergolas.</b> This will offer ample shade and a resting place for the public. The existing kiosk and toilet will also be reconstructed to boost the garden's Victorian ambience.|$|R

The centerpiece of the garden is a large wisteria arbor.|$|E
5|$|The Oak Room at the Algonquin {{was long}} one of New York City's premier cabaret nightclubs.

5|$|This {{was one of}} {{the private}} rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz. It is {{designed}} {{in the form of a}} , with a trellis pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor (illustrated below), giving the impression of being in a <b>pergola</b> rather than an interior. The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited the palace in 1794.|$|E
5|$|Aintree-Eglinton Reserve, a {{grassed area}} {{covering}} , contains a cricket pitch, several practice runs and night lights for Australian rules football, which are utilised by local amateur and junior clubs. Within the reserve is the Hamersley Community Recreation Centre, first {{built in the}} 1970s as a community hall and opened {{in its present form}} on 22 April 1990. The centre is a small village area consisting of a central <b>pergola</b> crossed with walking paths, flanked by four buildings: a sports hall with basketball courts and kiosk, an arts and crafts building, a community hall and function building hosting discos and other social events, and a purpose-built children's centre. Near the centre are the 1st Hamersley Scout Group, a child health centre and the Holy Cross Anglican Church, a colonial-style building built in 1974 and consecrated on 14 December 1980 to serve the newly formed Balcatta-Hamersley Parish.|$|E

50|$|French colonists planted their {{vineyards}} in {{the highlands}} areas around the Ba Vì mountain range near Hanoi. Modern viticultural techniques have produced some successful results with aggressive pruning and {{the adoption of the}} <b>pergolas</b> style of trellising. This <b>Pergolas</b> trellis has the benefit of keeping the grapevines off the ground to where some of the humidity is ventilated which reduces the risk of powdery mildews developing. The grape bunches are shaded by the canopy of the vine which reduces the yields.|$|R

50|$|<b>Pergolas</b> {{are more}} {{permanent}} architectural features than the green tunnels of late medieval and early Renaissance gardens, which were often formed of springy withies—easily replaced shoots of willow or hazel—bound {{together at the}} heads to form a series of arches, then loosely woven with long slats on which climbers were grown, to make a passage that was both cool and shaded and moderately dry in a shower. At the Medici villa, La Petraia, inner and outer curving segments of such green walks, the forerunners of <b>pergolas,</b> give structure to the pattern, which can be viewed from the long terrace above it.|$|R

It was designed by Seattle City Architect Daniel Riggs Huntington and built in 1920. Huntington was also co-architect of the nearby Morrison Hotel (1909) and was responsible for the 1912 repairs to Colman Dock on the site of the present ferry terminal. Huntington also designed the Lake Union Steam Plant, built in 1914. The <b>pergola</b> was restored in the 1970s by the Committee of 33, a local Seattle philanthropic organization.|$|E
