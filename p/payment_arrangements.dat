25|$|Pope {{was born}} in Ashfield, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, on 18 February 1864, and educated at The Hutchins School in Hobart, Tasmania. His first {{recorded}} cricket matches were played for Sydney University's cricket team against Melbourne University in 1879 and 1881, though it is unknown if he actually attended the school. Partly {{as a result of}} scoring 170 not out for a Melbourne I Zingari team against the Richmond Cricket Club, Pope was selected to make his first-class debut for New South Wales against Victoria in late December 1884 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and made what was to be his highest first-class score, 47 runs, in New South Wales' first innings. The English cricket team was touring the Australian colonies at the time, and the second Test match of the series was scheduled to be held in Melbourne beginning on 1 January 1885, two days after the conclusion of the New South Wales–Victoria game. A number of leading New South Wales players, including Jack Blackham, Harry Boyle, George Bonnor, and Percy McDonnell objected to the <b>payment</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the tour, and boycotted the first and second Tests in protest at what they perceived at unfair treatment. The Victorian Cricket Association was forced to choose a team comprising nine debutants (including Pope) for the Test, with Tom Horan as captain. In the match, Pope batted at number six in both innings, making a duck in the first innings and three runs in the second innings of what was to be his only Test.|$|E

40|$|Objective - This study {{attempts}} {{to implement the}} efficient trade matrix among five selected ASEAN countries and its settlement by the gold reserve requirements through Multi-Bilateral <b>Payments</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MBPA). Methods – The study is a qualitative research with analytic description. The purpose of this qualitative-descriptive study is to simulate the implementation of gold in the Multi-Bilateral <b>Payment</b> <b>Arrangement</b> among ASEAN countries using the current trade data. Results – This paper argues that the Southeast Asian countries can solve the problem through their internal coordination, particularly in terms of trade. One of the efforts is to reduce even eliminate the market risk by using the efficient <b>payment</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Conclusions – The study implied that the quantity amount of gold required to settle the trade balance will be reduced from the early gross payment. However, the ASEAN countries need to strengthen the cooperation among them through maximizing the trade relationship...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{competition between}} {{private and public}} payments settlement systems, and examines the consequences of round-the-clock private <b>payments</b> <b>arrangements</b> on the competitiveness of public systems. Central to {{the issue is the}} role of collateral both as a requirement for participation in central bank sponsored <b>payments</b> <b>arrangements</b> and as the backing for private intermediary arrangements. The presence of private systems serves as a check on the ability of a monetary authority to tighten monetary policy. Round-the-clock systems are an example of a collateral saving innovation that further pressures central bank pre-eminence in payments settlement. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{developed}} world exhibits substantial but poorly understood {{differences in the}} efficiency and quality of low-value payment services. This paper compares <b>payments</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the UK, Norway, Swe-den, and Finland, and discusses the impact of network effects on incentives to adopt new payments tech-nology. A model is presented, in which private benefits for investment in shared inter-bank payments in-frastructure are weak. In contrast, due to ‘account externalities’, there are strong incentives for investment in intra-bank payment systems. These two features, distinguishing bank payments from other network in-dustries, can help {{explain some of the}} observed cross country differences in <b>payments</b> <b>arrangements.</b> network effects; incentives; payment technology; externalities...|$|R

Instead of a flat rate or fee, some freelancers have adopted a value-based pricing method based on the perceived value of the results to the client. By custom, <b>payment</b> <b>arrangements</b> may be upfront, percentage upfront, or upon completion. For more complex projects, a contract may set a payment schedule based on milestones or outcomes.

50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{funds for}} large ransoms or {{payments}} {{could not be}} raised quickly, and gradual <b>payment</b> <b>arrangements</b> were usually made. The Treaty of Brétigny, signed on 25 May 1360, offered the release of John in exchange for forty noble hostages, along with other payments. After four years in captivity, King John was released after {{the signing of the}} treaty. John's son, Prince Louis, who had avoided capture at Poitiers, was among the persons who were to be given as hostages. In October 1360, Louis sailed to England from Calais. The full ransom was to be paid within six months, but France was economically weakened and incapable of paying the ransom on schedule. After several years in captivity, Louis tried to privately negotiate with Edward III of England for his freedom. When this failed, Louis decided to escape; he arrived back in France in July 1363.|$|E
50|$|Private {{parties are}} popular events for which to hire strippers. There are many {{entertainment}} businesses that have strippers contracted for private performances. Some {{of these companies}} have a national presence, with strippers contracted in multiple states and some who work regionally over a multi-state area. Strippers will also do side work and handle their own agreements and <b>payment</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Written agreements are atypical {{in this type of}} transaction unless a formal, registered business is involved. They could also travel over significant (i.e. flight required) distances for private events and appointments, most of the time passing the cost of travel and accommodations onto the customer. Patrons at the clubs in which the strippers work are a primary source of customers for their work outside the club. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they will provide during a private party.|$|E

However, the court did consider El-Hasan D.'s share in the death of Nieuwenhuizen to be proven, and described in a reconstruction: [...] "Especially the mature man kicked Nieuwenhuizen in the head. In an attempt to push the mature man away from Nieuwenhuizen, the keeper of Buitenboys, 2, ended up on the ground as well." [...] Especially in response to the fierce accusations, many responded with outrage and anger, mainly on social media, and among others called the family of El-Hasan D. murderers and beggars, after which they removed the call to raise funds.|$|E

The biggest problems, ironically, came from what was potentially WJJY's most important asset: the transmitter, which was a voracious power hog. Look Television was badly undercapitalized, and its owners did not anticipate the high electrical costs from running such a powerful transmitter. The Western Illinois Power Cooperative shut off power to the transmitter on several occasions due to nonpayment. While WIPCO always restored the power, it was not because of a <b>payment</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Rather, it was because the utility would have thus been responsible for a 1,600-foot unlighted airplane hazard.|$|R
