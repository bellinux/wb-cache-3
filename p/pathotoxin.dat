We show by ion uptake studies in E. coli that a pathotoxin-URF 13 interaction causes membrane permeability. Similarly, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by membrane permeabilization probably accounts for increased colonization of maize carrying the Texas cytoplasm by toxin-producing pathogens. Site-directed mutagenesis studies show that approximately one-quarter of the amino acids at the carboxyl end of URF 13 can be eliminated without affecting toxin sensitivity. We have identified two dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) binding sites in the URF 13 protein and show that one of the sites is involved in conferring DCCD protection against the <b>pathotoxin.</b> Substitutional mutations at this DCCD binding site also eliminate toxin sensitivity...|$|E

40|$|Expression of the maize {{mitochondrial}} T-urf 13 gene {{results in}} a sensitivity to a family of fungal <b>pathotoxins</b> and to methomyl, a structurally unrelated systemic insecticide. Similar effects of <b>pathotoxins</b> and methomyl are observed when T-urf 13 is cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. An interaction between these compounds and the membrane-bound URF 13 protein permeabilizes the inner mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. To understand the toxin-URF 13 effects, we have investigated whether toxin specifically binds to the URF 13 protein. Our studies indicate that toxin binds to the URF 13 protein in maize mitochondria and in E. coli expressing URF 13. Binding analysis in E. coli reveals cooperative toxin binding. A low level of specific toxin binding is also demonstrated in cms-T and cms-T-restored mitochondria; however, binding {{does not appear to}} be cooperative in maize mitochondria. Competition and displacement studies in E. coli demonstrate that toxin binding is reversible and that the toxins and methomyl compete for the same, or for overlapping, binding sites. Two toxin-insensitive URF 13 mutants display a diminished capability to bind toxin in E. coli, which identifies residues of URF 13 important in toxin binding. A third toxin-insensitive URF 13 mutant shows considerable toxin binding in E. coli, demonstrating that toxin binding can occur without causing membrane permeabilization. Our results indicate that toxin-mediated membrane permeabilization only occurs when toxin or methomyl is bound to URF 13...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMitochondria {{isolated}} from maize containing cms-T cytoplasm are specifically sensitive to <b>pathotoxins</b> (T-toxins) {{produced by the}} fungi Bipolaris maydis race T and Phyllosticta maydis. T-toxins interact with a 13 kDa membrane-bound toxin receptor protein, URF 13, to produce hydrophillic pores in the membrane. Expression of URF 13 in Escherichia coli produces bacterial cells that form hydrophillic pores in the plasma membrane when exposed to T-toxin or methomyl. Topological studies have established that URF 13 contains three membrane-spanning α-helices, {{two of which are}} amphipathic and may contribute to pore formation. URF 13 specifically binds T-toxin in a cooperative manner. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of URF 13 led to the isolation of methomyl/T-toxin-resistant mutations at 39 separate positions throughout the URF 13 primary sequence. Chemical cross-linking of URF 13 demonstrated the presence of URF 13 oligomers and established that the pore-forming species is oligomeric. The ability of the carboxylate-specific reagent, dicyclohexycarbodiimide to cross-link URF 13 has been used in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis to establish that the URF 13 tetramer has a central core consisting of a four-α-helical bundle that may undergo a conformational change after T-toxin or methomyl binding. Experimental evidence indicates that URF 13 acts as a ligand-gated, pore-forming T-toxin receptor...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pathotoxin</b> {{preparations}} {{were obtained}} from either axenic culture filtrate of race T of Bipolaris maydis (Nisikado) Shoemaker (new culture media and toxin purification procedures are described) or extracts of maize leaves infected with the fungus. The toxins (10 − 6 to 10 − 8 m) caused inhibition of [86 Rb]K+ uptake in leaf discs and apical root segments of Zea mays L. cv W 64 A Texas (Tcms) and normal (N) cytoplasms. Significant inhibition was measurable as early as 5 min after adding toxin. In Tcms per cent inhibition was increased by increasing toxin concentration and time in toxin, by using solution at pH 5 rather than pH 7, by decreasing external KCl concentration over the range 50 to 0. 1 mm (in the presence of 0. 5 mm CaSO 4), or by exposing leaf discs to light rather than dark during the uptake period in toxin.

40|$|Since the host-specific toxins of Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici play an {{important}} role in pathogenesis, they potentially could be applied as selective agents in in vitro selection at the cellular level for disease resistance. Prerequisite for this is that sensitivity to the Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici <b>pathotoxins</b> is manifest at the cellular level. To gain insight into cellular effects of AAL-toxins and into the mechanisms of plant insensitivity to AAL-toxins, effects of AAL-toxins on leaves, leaf discs, roots, calli, suspension cells, minicalli and protoplasts of susceptible and resistant tomato genotypes were studied. In leaves of susceptible genotypes, toxins cause severe necrosis, while in leaves of resistant genotypes necrosis was never observed. Inhibition effects of toxins were observed at all other levels in susceptible and resistant genotypes: toxins inhibited shoot induction on leaf discs, root growth and growth of calli, suspension cells and protoplasts. This indicates a cellular site for AAL-toxins. Differences in sensitivity to AAL-toxins between susceptible and resistant genotypes were observed in leaves and roots, but were not observed during shoot induction on leaf discs, in calli, suspension cells and protoplasts. However, differences in sensitivity to AAL-toxins in roots were at least 20 times less than in leaves. Therefore insensitivity seems related to a higher level of tomato plant differentiation and is most pronounced in leaves. ...|$|R
40|$|URF 13 is a mitochondrially encoded, {{integral}} {{membrane protein}} {{found only in}} maize carrying the cms-T cytoplasm. URF 13 is associated with cytoplasmic male sterility, Texas type, and causes susceptibility to the fungal pathogens Bipolaris maydis race T and Phyllosticta maydis. URF 13 is predicted to contain three transmembrane alpha-helices and is a receptor for the <b>pathotoxins</b> (T-toxins) produced by B. maydis race T and P. maydis. Binding of T-toxin to URF 13 leads to membrane permeability. Cross-linking of URF 13 oligomers with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) protects Escherichia coli cells expressing URF 13 and cms-T mitochondria from the permeability caused by T-toxin or methomyl. Using mutated forms of URF 13 expressed in E. coli cells, we determined the molecular mechanism of DCCD protection. We separately changed Lys- 37 in helix II to isoleucine (K 37 I-URF 13) and Lys- 32 in the helix I/helix II loop region to alanine (K 32 A-URF 13). DCCD treatment of K 37 I-URF 13 -expressing cells did not protect the cells from permeability caused by T-toxin or methomyl. DCCD cross-linking was greatly reduced in K 37 I-URF 13 and in D 39 V-URF 13 -expressing cells, but it was unaffected in K 32 A-URF 13 -expressing cells. Binding of methomyl or T-toxin decreases DCCD cross-linking of URF 13 oligomers expressed in either E. coli or cms-T mitochondria. We conclude that Asp- 39 in helix II is cross-linked by DCCD to Lys- 37 in helix II of an adjacent URF 13 molecule and that this cross-linking protects against toxin-mediated permeabilization. Our results also indicate that helices II form a central core in URF 13 oligomers...|$|R
40|$|The URF 13 protein, {{which is}} encoded by the maize {{mitochondrial}} T-urf 13 gene, {{is thought to}} be responsible for <b>pathotoxin</b> and methomyl sensitivity and male sterility. We have investigated whether T-urf 13 confers toxin sensitivity and male sterility when expressed in another plant species. The coding sequence of T-urf 13 was fused to a mitochondrial targeting presequence, placed {{under the control of the}} cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter, and introduced into tobacco by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Plants expressing high levels of URF 13 were methomyl sensitive. Subcellular analysis indicated that URF 13 is mainly associated with the mitochondria. Adding methomyl to isolated mitochondria stimulated NADH-linked respiration and uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation, indicating that URF 13 was imported into the mitochondria, and conferred toxin sensitivity. Most control plants, which expressed the T-urf 13 c construct lacking the mitochondrial presequence, were methomyl sensitive and contained URF 13 in a membrane fraction. Subcellular fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation showed that URF 13 sedimented at several positions, suggesting the protein is associated with various organelles, including mitochondria. No methomyl effect was observed in isolated mitochondria, however, indicating that URF 13 was not imported and did not confer toxin sensitivity to the mitochondria. Thus, URF 13 confers toxin sensitivity to transgenic tobacco with or without import into the mitochondria. There was no correlation between the expression of URF 13 and male sterility, suggesting either that URF 13 does not cause male sterility in transgenic tobacco or that URF 13 is not expressed in sufficient amounts in the appropriate anther cells...|$|E
40|$|The URF 13 protein, {{which is}} encoded by the {{mitochondrial}} gene T-urf 13, {{is responsible for}} cytoplasmic male sterility and <b>pathotoxin</b> sensitivity in the Texas male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-T) of maize. Mitochondrial sensitivity to two host-specific fungal toxins (T toxins) is mediated by the interaction of URF 13 and T toxins to form pores in the inner mitochondrial membrane. A carbamate insecticide, methomyl, mimics the effects of T toxins on isolated cms-T mitochondria. URF 13 was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (fall army-worm) cells (Sf 9) in culture and in Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper) larvae with a baculovirus vector. In insect cells, URF 13 forms oligomeric structures in the membrane and confers T toxin or methomyl sensitivity. Adding T toxin or methomyl to Sf 9 cells producing URF 13 causes permeabilization of plasma membranes. In addition, URF 13 is toxic to insect cells grown in culture without T toxins or methomyl; even a T-toxin-insensitive mutant form of URF 13 is lethal to cell cultures. Baculoviruses expressing URF 13 are lethal to T. ni larvae, at times postinjection comparable to those obtained by injecting a baculovirus expressing an insect neurotoxin. This result suggests that URF 13 could be useful as a biological control agent for insect pests. Our data indicate that URF 13 has two independent mechanisms for toxicity, one that is mediated by T toxin and methomyl {{and one that is}} independent of these toxins. Similarly, male sterility and toxin sensitivity in cms-T maize may be due to independent mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Texas {{male-sterile}} cytoplasm (cms-T) maize is {{susceptible to}} Helminthosporium maydis race T and its <b>pathotoxin,</b> whereas nonsterile cytoplasm maize is resistant. Callus cultures initiated from immature embryos of a cms-T genotype, BC 1 A 188 (T), were susceptible to the toxin and were capable of plant regeneration. Toxin-resistant cell lines were selected by a sublethal enrichment procedure in which cms-T callus was grown for several selection cycles (subculture transfers) {{in the presence of}} progressively higher concentrations of toxin. Periodically during the selection process, plants were regenerated from the cms-T cultures to determine their susceptibility or resistance to the toxin. Plants regenerated after four cycles of selection were male-sterile and toxin-susceptible as shown by leaf bioassays. All plants regenerated from cell lines isolated from the fifth selection cycle onward, however, were toxin-resistant and 52 of 65 were fully male-fertile. The remaining 13 “male-sterile” resistant plants did not shed pollen and did not resemble cms-T plants in tassel morphology. Some “male-sterile” plants produced anthers containing a small amount of starch-filled pollen, suggesting that the sterility of these 13 plants was not the result of the cms-T trait. Leaf bioassays on F 1 progeny from regenerated resistant plants indicated that resistance to the toxin was inherited only through the female. The male-fertility trait also was inherited only through the female. After inoculation with H. maydis race T spores, leaf lesion size for progeny from regenerated resistant plants coincided with their reaction to the toxin. This result indicated that plant resistance to the pathogen was closely correlated with the toxin resistance obtained through cell culture selection...|$|E
40|$|Albicidin is a <b>pathotoxin</b> {{produced}} by Xanthomonas albilineans, a xylem-invading pathogen that causes leaf scald disease of sugarcane. Albicidin is synthesized by a nonribosomal pathway via modular polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) megasynthases, and NRPS adenylation (A) domains {{are responsible for}} the recognition and activation of specific amino acid substrates. DNA fragments (0. 5 kb) encoding the regions responsible for the substrate specificities of six albicidin NRPS A domains from 16 strains of X. albilineans representing the known diversity of this pathogen were amplified and sequenced. Polymorphism analysis of these DNA fragments at different levels (DNA, protein, and NRPS signature) showed that these pathogenicity loci were highly conserved. The conservation of these loci most likely reflects purifying selective pressure, as revealed by a comparison with the variability of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of two housekeeping genes (atpD and efp) of X. albilineans. Nevertheless, the 16 strains of X. albilineans were differentiated into several groups by a phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences corresponding to the NRPS A domains. One of these groups was representative of the genetic diversity previously found within the pathogen by random fragment length polymorphism and amplified fragment length polymorphism analyses. This group, which differed by three single synonymous nucleotide mutations, contained only four strains of X. albilineans that were all involved in outbreaks of sugarcane leaf scald. The amount of albicidin produced in vitro in agar and liquid media varied among the 16 strains of X. albilineans. However, no relationship among the amount of albicidin produced in vitro and the pathotypes and genetic diversity of the pathogen was found. The NRPS loci contributing to the synthesis of the primary structure of albicidin apparently are not involved in the observed pathogenicity differences among strains of X. albilineans...|$|E
40|$|Plants are {{continuously}} {{bombarded by}} {{an array of}} potential pathogenic invaders and, therefore, must enlist an equally diverse set of defense response mechanisms to protect themselves. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these plant-pathogen interactions is of critical importance in efforts to create disease-resistant crops. Some fungal pathogens rely on the production of toxins to infect their host plants, but, in general, {{little is known about}} how such toxins incite disease. Furthermore, mechanisms of host defense in response to these toxins remain elusive. ^ The first part of my thesis focuses on the interaction of Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 (CCR 1) and the nonhost plant Arabidopsis thaliana. I seek to elucidate the effects of HC-toxin in Arabidopsis and to provide a greater understanding for the role of this <b>pathotoxin</b> in disease caused by CCR 1. Both the root and shoot growth of Arabidopsis were negatively affected when grown on increasing concentrations of HC-toxin. This stunted growth, which is likely in response to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor activity of HC-toxin, was reversed when plants were removed from the phytotoxin. ^ Screens using EMS-mutagenized and T-DNA activation-tagged lines resulted in Arabidopsis mutants showing either enhanced sensitivity or greater tolerance to HC-toxin than their wild-type progenitors. Further characterization of the EMS mutant highly sensitive to hc-toxin 4 (hsh 4) resulted in phenotypic traits associated with modifications in HDAC machinery. Despite hypersensitivity to HC-toxin, hsh 4 did not demonstrate susceptibility to CCR 1 infection, suggesting that HDAC inhibition may not be the sole determinant of CCR 1 pathogenesis. In addition, mutants isolated from T-DNA activation-tagged lines also provided several gene candidates that may regulate sensitivity to HC-toxin in Arabidopsis. ^ Arabidopsis was also utilized to investigate the role of HC-toxin in susceptibility and defense gene regulation. Exogenous application of HC-toxin induced greater susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicicola. In addition, HC-toxin was able to compromise nonhost resistance in Arabidopsis to CCR 1, allowing the pathogen to cause some disease. RNA-blot (Northern) analyses demonstrated that HC-toxin actually induces SA-dependent PR- 1 gene expression in Arabidopsis while simultaneously repressing JA-dependent PDF 1. 2 expression. In addition, HC-toxin induces WRKY 70 expression which functions as a regulator between these defense pathways. Therefore, HC-toxin may function as a disease determinant of CCR 1 by disrupting the normal regulation of defense response pathways. ^ In the second part of my thesis, I present findings in maize that contradict the current hypothesis for how HC-toxin functions in disease caused by CCR 1. Defense genes in maize respond differentially when inoculated with either toxin producing (Tox+) or toxin non-producing (Tox-) isolates of CCR 1. Defense genes are rapidly activated and reach a peak before gradually declining in response to Tox- isolates. In contrast, defense genes are not induced appreciably in response to Tox+ isolates, but rather there is a rapid decline of defense gene transcripts after inoculation. Therefore, HC-toxin appears to induce the degradation of defense gene transcripts in maize. In other experiments, Tox+ isolates are able to cause disease on maize lesion mimic mutants that exhibit constitutive defense gene expression. This contradicts the current hypothesis and demonstrates that HC-toxin can induce susceptibility to CCR 1 in a manner independent of defense gene suppression. Finally, several HDAC inhibitors other than HC-toxin were ineffective at inducing susceptibility to CCR 1, suggesting that HDAC inhibition does not {{play a critical role in}} CCR 1 pathogenesis. ...|$|E
