After spending six weeks at Methil, where she had an advanced ship degaussing system installed among other repairs, Empire Simba proceeded to Oban via Lyness in mid November. She set out for North America in Convoy OB-253 on 2 December. Four days out, heavy weather dispersed the convoy, and Empire Simba proceeded independently. The ship continued to take a beating from heavy seas which opened the number one cargo hold to the ocean. Because the water was coming in faster than the bilge pumps in the hold number one could pump, the crew cut through the bulkheads into cargo hold number two to double the <b>pumping</b> <b>capacity</b> and were able to keep the ship under control long enough to arrive in Bermuda on 26 December. After temporary repairs were made there, Empire Simba sailed on 6 January 1942 first to Halifax and then to Baltimore for more permanent repairs.|$|E
25|$|Echocardiography {{has become}} {{routinely}} {{used in the}} diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with any suspected or known heart diseases. It {{is one of the}} most widely used diagnostic tests in cardiology. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart (internal chamber size quantification), <b>pumping</b> <b>capacity,</b> and the location and extent of any tissue damage. An echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function, such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function (how well the heart relaxes).|$|E
25|$|CCM: Cardiac Contractility Modulation (CCM) is a {{treatment}} for patients with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic heart failure (NYHA class II–IV) which enhances both the strength of ventricular contraction and the heart’s <b>pumping</b> <b>capacity.</b> The CCM mechanism is based on stimulation of the cardiac muscle by non-excitatory electrical signals (NES), which are delivered by a pacemaker-like device. CCM is particularly suitable {{for the treatment of}} heart failure patients with normal QRS complex duration (120 ms or less) and has been demonstrated to improve the symptoms, quality of life and exercise tolerance of heart failure patients. CCM is approved for use in Europe, but not currently in North America.|$|E

40|$|Dairy Research, 2007 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2007 Manning’s {{equation}} provides a method to evaluate the flow characteristics of a flush plume system used to move a diluted, sandladen manure stream from a freestall building to sand or solid separation equipment. Evaluation of a 16, 18, and 24 -inch plume showed pipe slope is critical in maintaining a 5 feet per second water velocity through the pipe. A 24 inch or larger plume placed on a 0. 5 % slope is able to obtain water velocity of 5 feet per second if the <b>pump</b> <b>capacity</b> exceeds 3, 600 gpm. The flow velocity never reached or exceeded 5 feet per second in a 16 - or 18 -inch pipe placed on a 0. 5 % slope, regardless of the <b>pump</b> <b>capacity.</b> A 16 -, 18 - or 24 -inch pipe laid on a 1 % slope could obtain a water velocity of 5 feet per second if the <b>pump</b> <b>capacity</b> exceeded 1, 500 gallons/minute...|$|R

25|$|Watertight {{subdivision}} limits loss of buoyancy and freeboard in {{the event}} of damage, and may protect vital machinery from flooding. Most ships have some <b>pumping</b> <b>capacity</b> to remove accumulated water from the bilges, but a steel ship with no watertight subdivision will sink if water accumulates faster than pumps can remove it. Standards of watertight subdivision assume no dewatering capability, although pumps kept in working order may provide an additional measure of safety {{in the event}} of minor leaks. The most common watertight subdivision is accomplished with transverse bulkheads dividing the elongated hull into a number of watertight floodable lengths. Early watertight subdivision tested with hoses sometimes failed to withstand the hydrostatic pressure of an adjoining flooded compartment. Effective watertight subdivision requires these transverse bulkheads to be both watertight and structurally sound.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans was {{vulnerable}} to flooding {{even before the}} city's footprint departed from the natural high ground near the Mississippi River. In the late 20th century, however, scientists and New Orleans residents gradually {{became aware of the}} city's increased vulnerability. In 1965, flooding from Hurricane Betsy killed dozens of residents, although the majority of the city remained dry. The rain-induced flood of May 8, 1995, demonstrated the weakness of the pumping system. After that event, measures were undertaken to dramatically upgrade <b>pumping</b> <b>capacity.</b> By the 1980s and 1990s, scientists observed that extensive, rapid, and ongoing erosion of the marshlands and swamp surrounding New Orleans, especially that related to the Mississippi River – Gulf Outlet Canal, had the unintended result of leaving the city more {{vulnerable to}} hurricane-induced catastrophic storm surges than before.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to study fluid mixing by {{determining}} impeller pumping capa cities from measured velocities in a mixing tank. Mean velocity measurements were made {{with the use of}} a Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA). The LDA was operated in the dual beam mode, with polystyrene spheres as seeding material. Studies were conducted with a 6 blade radial impeller and a 3 blade axial impeller. From velocity measurements, impeller <b>pumping</b> <b>capacities</b> were calculated for the above impellers. Impeller <b>pumping</b> <b>capacities</b> are correlated for varying impeller speeds at various measurement positions. The obtained results have been compared to published results under similar conditions...|$|R

This was far too much for Titanics ballast and bilge pumps to handle; the total <b>pumping</b> <b>capacity</b> of all the pumps {{combined}} was only [...] per hour. Andrews informed the captain that the first five compartments were flooded, and therefore Titanic was doomed. [...] By his estimate, she could remain afloat for no longer than about two hours.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} {{body structure}} in sponges is a tube or vase shape known as [...] "asconoid", but this severely limits {{the size of}} the animal. The body structure is characterized by a stalk-like spongocoel surrounded by a single layer of choanocytes. If it is simply scaled up, the ratio of its volume to surface area increases, because surface increases as the square of length or width while volume increases proportionally to the cube. The amount of tissue that needs food and oxygen is determined by the volume, but the <b>pumping</b> <b>capacity</b> that supplies food and oxygen depends on the area covered by choanocytes. Asconoid sponges seldom exceed [...] in diameter.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "leuconoid" [...] pattern boosts <b>pumping</b> <b>capacity</b> {{further by}} filling the {{interior}} almost completely with mesohyl {{that contains a}} network of chambers lined with choanocytes and connected {{to each other and}} to the water intakes and outlet by tubes. Leuconid sponges grow to over [...] in diameter, and the fact that growth in any direction increases the number of choanocyte chambers enables them to take a wider range of forms, for example [...] "encrusting" [...] sponges whose shapes follow those of the surfaces to which they attach. All freshwater and most shallow-water marine sponges have leuconid bodies. The networks of water passages in glass sponges are similar to the leuconid structure.|$|E

50|$|As liquid {{enters the}} {{landfill}} cell, it {{moves down the}} filter, passes through the pipe network, and rests in the sump. As collection systems are planned, the number, location, {{and size of the}} sumps are vital to an efficient operation. When designing sumps, the amount of leachate and liquid expected is the foremost concern. Areas in which rainfall is higher than average typically have larger sumps. A further criterion for sump planning is accounting for the <b>pump</b> <b>capacity.</b> The relationship of <b>pump</b> <b>capacity</b> and sump size is inverse. If the <b>pump</b> <b>capacity</b> is low, the volume of the sump should be larger than average. It is critical for the volume of the sump to be able to store the expected leachate between pumping cycles. This relationship helps maintain a healthy operation. Sump pumps can function with preset phase times. If the flow is not predictable, a predetermined leachate height level can automatically switch the system on. Other conditions for sump planning are maintenance and pump drawdown. Collection pipes typically convey the leachate by gravity to one or more sumps, depending upon the size of the area drained. Leachate collected in the sump is removed by pumping to a vehicle, to a holding facility for subsequent vehicle pickup, or to an on-site treatment facility. Sump dimensions are governed by the amount of leachate to be stored, <b>pump</b> <b>capacity,</b> and minimum <b>pump</b> drawdown. The volume of the sump must be sufficient to hold the maximum amount of leachate anticipated between pump cycles, plus an additional volume equal to the minimum pump drawdown volume. Sump size should also consider dimensional requirements for conducting maintenance and inspection activities. Sump pumps may operate with preset cycling times or, if leachate flow is less predictable, the pump may be automatically switched on when the leachate reaches a predetermined level.|$|R

500|$|The 1st Army Troops Company was {{responsible}} for Port Moresby’s utilities: the power house, freezers, electrical installations, lighting and water supply. By June 1942 the water supply was close to its maximum capacity, with the pumping station at Bomana pumping water from the Laloki River 24 hours a day. The main [...] water main ran under the south eastern end of the Jackson Drome, a prime target for Japanese air raids, and the water pipe was consequently prone to damage. From one cause or another there were 40 to 50 breaks per month. By October 1942 the reservoir level was falling, indicating that usage was exceeding <b>pumping</b> <b>capacity.</b> A new intake and pumping station was constructed near Schwimmer Drome to bring water from the Laloki River to a treatment plant and concrete reservoir on Twin Peaks Mountain. The 1st Army Troops Company assumed responsibility for its operation upon its completion in March 1943.|$|E
