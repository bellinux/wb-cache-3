40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a novel portable <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> source applicable to self-powered mobile applications such as wearable actuator and rescue robot etc. Dry ice is chosen as a source of <b>power</b> for the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> source because it is nonpoisonous, easy to obtain and it expands 750 times in volume after being vaporized into gas. When dry ice is stored in the confined pressure container, it begins to liquefy after the pressure reaches the triple point (0. 52 [MPa(abs) ],- 56. 6 ℃). In this process the pressure remains constant until all the dry ice melt into the liquid. When the state remains at triple point, the pressure does not decrease even though the gas is released from pressure container. By using this physical property of carbon dioxide, and by controlling the heat transfer from the surroundings into the pressure container, a noiseless, large capacity and portable <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> source is developed...|$|R

30|$|For mobile robot, the {{integration}} design concept {{is a good}} choice. Since the embedding of pneumatic elements, the implementation of 5 -TET calls for the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> supply, which is a dominant bottleneck in practical of pneumatic mobile applications. Many researchers have been studied on this problem, and new advances in portable <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> source are presented [27 – 29]. For example, a portable pneumatic supply called Dry Ice Power Cell, which could provide sustaining 0.42 MPa gas for about 218 NL with portable size [29]. The achievements from these researches can be used directly to equip 5 -TET to realize mobile function, so do other elements.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} test the timeliness, we also attach great {{importance}} to the response time of OS Hand. We test the closing time of the hand for grasping objects and its opening time for releasing objects. Subject to the speed of our motor, the response time is between 1.2 and 4.7  s. Considering that <b>pneumatics</b> <b>power</b> drive will respond much more rapidly, we connect the OS Hand with a robot arm and drive the hand with <b>pneumatics</b> <b>power</b> and test the response time, as is shown in Fig.  13. And the experimental results are very exciting. The hand is almost instantaneously grasping and releasing, and the response time is less than 1  s.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the core}} systems in a {{conventional}} or More Electric Aircraft (MEA) is the environmental control system (ECS). It is either the key consumer of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> or draws a substantial load from the electric power system. Therefore, it is crucial for the trade-off between aircraft and engine design and {{an important element of}} a tool to assess system architectures at aircraft level.

40|$|The {{blade root}} flow control is of {{particular}} importance to the aerodynamic characteristic of large wind turbines. The paper studies the feasibility of improving blade <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> by applying vortex generators (VGs) to large variable propeller shaft {{horizontal axis wind turbine}}s, with 2 [*]MW variable propeller shaft horizontal axis wind turbine blades as research object. In the paper, three cases of VGs installation are designed; they are scattered in different chordwise position at the blade root, and then they are calculated, respectively, with CFD method. The results show that VGs installed in the separation line upstream, with the separation line of the blade root as a benchmark, show a better effect. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> of blades increases by 0. 6 % by installing VGs. Although the effect on large wind turbines is not obvious, there is a space for optimization...|$|R

500|$|Located {{on a site}} {{originally}} {{occupied by}} a foreman's office when the land was used for quarrying, the new sawmill building was completed in 1899, providing electricity via two enclosed steam <b>engines</b> and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>power</b> across the estate. The engines were housed {{in what is now}} called the Engine Room, while the Lantern Room held multiple lead acid batteries.
