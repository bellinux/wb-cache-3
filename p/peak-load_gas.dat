40|$|We {{develop a}} {{nonlinear}} mathematical optimization program for investigating {{the economic and}} environmental implications of wind penetration in electrical grids and evaluating how hydropower storage {{could be used to}} offset wind power intermittence. When wind power is added to an electrical grid consisting of thermal and hydropower plants, it increases system variability and results in a need for additional peak-load, gas-fired generators. Our empirical application using load data for Alberta’s electrical grid shows that 32 % wind penetration (normalized to peak demand) results in a net cost increase of $C 5. 20 / MWh, while 64 % wind penetration could result in an increase of $ 12. 50 /MWh. Costs of reducing CO 2 emissions are estimated to be $ 41 -$ 56 per t CO 2. When pumped hydro storage is introduced in the system or the capacity of the water reservoirs is enhanced, the hydropower facility could provide most of the peak load requirements obviating the need to build large <b>peak-load</b> <b>gas</b> generators.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the time-varying relationship between {{oil and natural}} gas in the UK. We develop a model where relative prices can move between pricing-regimes; markets switch between being decoupled and integrated. Our model endogenously accounts for periods where {{oil and natural gas}} temporarily decouple due to gas specific pricing. We show that gas-specific pricing is primarily related to fall/winter <b>peak-load</b> <b>gas</b> pricing and that mean reversion in relative prices is dependent on the time of the year. Most of the reversion back to oil occurs in spring and summer when demand for gas to heating and electricity is low and net-availability and transport capacity high. Accounting for periods of gas specific pricing is relevant when determining the long-run equilibrium value of oil relative to natural gas. Utilizing the regime where evidence is strongest for integrated markets we find that oil is historically priced at 2. 3 times the value of natural gas in the UK, and that markets have been decoupled for 49 % of the sample. Our results do not indicate that peak-load pricing has become more prevalent in recent years, i. e., we find no evidence of underinvestment in capacity after deregulation...|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this report}} is to help {{negotiate}} a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the proposed hybrid gas-Linear Frensel Reflector (LFR) plant at Collinsville, Queensland, Australia.  The report’s wider appeal is {{the discussion of the}} current situation in Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) and techniques and methods used to model the NEM’s demand and wholesale spot prices for the lifetime of the proposed plant. Executive Summary 1         Introduction This report primarily aims to provide both dispatch and wholesale spot price forecasts for the proposed hybrid gas-solar thermal plant at Collinsville, Queensland, Australia for its lifetime 2017 - 47.   These forecasts are to facilitate Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) negotiations and to evaluate the proposed dispatch profile in Table 3.   The solar thermal component of the plant uses Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) technology.  The proposed profile maintains a 30 MW dispatch during the weekdays by topping up the yield from the LFR by dispatch from the gas generator and imitates a baseload function currently provided by coal generators.   This report is the second of two reports and uses the findings of our first report on yield forecasting (Bell, Wild & Foster 2014 b). 2         Literature review The literature review discusses demand and supply forecasts, which we use to forecast wholesale spot prices with the Australian National Electricity Market (ANEM) model. The review introduces the concept of gross demand to supplement the Australian Electricity Market Operator’s (AEMO) “total demand”.   This gross demand concept helps to explain the permanent transformation of the demand in the National Electricity Market (NEM) region and the recent demand over forecasting by the AEMO.   We also discuss factors causing the permanent transformation.   The review also discusses the implications of the irregular ENSO cycle for demand and its role in over forecasting demand. Forecasting supply requires assimilating the information in the Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESO) (AEMO 2013 a, 2014 c).   AEMO expects a reserve surplus across the NEM beyond 2023 - 24.   Compounding this reserve surplus, there is a continuing decline in manufacturing, which is freeing up supply capacity elsewhere in the NEM.   The combined effect of export LNG prices and declining total demand are hampering decisions to transform proposed gas generation investment into actual investment and hampering the role for gas as a bridging technology in the NEM.   The review also estimates expected lower and upper bounds for domestic gas prices to determine the sensitivity of the NEM’s wholesale spot prices and plant’s revenue to gas prices. The largest proposed investment in the NEM is from wind generation but the low demand to wind speed correlation induces wholesale spot price volatility.   However, McKinsey Global Institute (MGI 2014) and Norris et al. (2014 a) expect economically viable energy storage shortly beyond the planning horizon of the ESO in 2023 - 24.   We expect that this viability will not only defer investment in generation and transmission but also accelerate the growth in off-market produced and consumed electricity within the NEM region. 2. 1      Research questions The report has the following overarching research questions: What is the expected dispatch of the proposed plant’s gas component given the plant’s dispatch profile and expected LFR yield? What are the wholesale spots prices on the NEM given the plant’s dispatch profile? The literature review refines the latter research question into five more specific research questions ready for the methodology: 	What are the half-hourly wholesale spots prices for the plant’s lifetime without gas as a bridging technology? 	 		Assuming a reference gas price of between $ 5. 27 /GJ to $ 7. 19 /GJ for base-load gas generation (depending upon nodal location;) and 		for <b>peak-load</b> <b>gas</b> generation of between $ 6. 59 /GJ to $ 8. 99 /GJ; and 		given the plant’s dispatch profile 	 	 	What are the half-hourly wholesale spots prices for the plant’s lifetime with gas as a bridging technology? 	 		Assuming some replacement of coal with gas generation 	 	 	How sensitive are wholesale spot prices to higher gas prices? 	 		Assuming high gas prices are between $ 7. 79 /GJ to $ 9. 71 /GJ for base-load gas generation (depending upon nodal location); and 		for <b>peak-load</b> <b>gas</b> generation of between $ 9. 74 /GJ to $ 12. 14 /GJ; and 	 	 	What is the plant’s revenue for the reference gas prices? 	How sensitive is the plant’s revenue to gas as a bridging technology? 	How sensitive is the plant’s revenue to the higher gas prices? 	What is the levelised cost of energy for the proposed plant? 3         Methodology In the methodology section, we discuss the following items: 	dispatch forecasting for the proposed plant; 	supply capacity for the years 2014 - 47 for the NEM; 	demand forecasting using a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY); and 	wholesale spot prices calculation using ANEM, supply capacity and total demand 	define three scenarios to address the research questions: 	 		reference gas prices; 		gas as a bridging technology; and 		high gas prices. 	 	 The TMY demand matches the solar thermal plant’s TMY yield forecast that we developed in our previous report (Bell, Wild & Foster 2014 b).   Together, these forecasts help address the research questions. 4         Results In the results section we will present the findings for each research question, including 	the TMY yield for the LFR and the dispatch of the gas generator given the proposed dispatch profile in Table 3; 	Average annual wholesale spot prices from 2017 to 2047 for the plant’s node for: 	 		Reference gas prices scenario from $ 18 /MWh to $ 38 /MWh 		Gas as a bridging technology scenario from $ 18 /MWh to $ 110 /MWh 		High gas price scenario from $ 20 /MWh to $ 41 /MWh 	 	 	The combined plants revenue without subsidy given the proposed profile: 	 		Reference gas price scenario $ 36 million 		Gas as a bridging technology scenario $ 52 million 		High gas price scenario $ 47 million 	 	 5         Discussion In the discussion section, we analyse: 	reasons for the changes in the average annual spot prices for the three scenarios; and 	the frequency that the half-hourly spot price exceeds the Short Run Marginal Cost (SRMC) of the gas generator for the three scenarios for: 	 		day of the week; 		month of the year; and 		time of the day. 	 	 If the wholesale spot price exceeds the SRMC, dispatch from the gas plant contributes towards profits.   Otherwise, the dispatch contributes towards a loss.   We find that for both reference and high gas price scenarios the proposed profile in Table 3 captures exceedances for the day of the week and the time of the day but causes the plant to run at a loss for several months of the year.   Figure 14 shows that the proposed profile captures the exceedance by hour of the day and Figure 16 shows that only operating the gas component Monday to Friday is well justified.   However, Figure 15 shows that operating the gas plant in April, May, September and October is contributing toward a loss.   Months either side of these four months have a marginal number of exceedances.   In the unlikely case of gas as a bridging scenario, extending the proposed profile to include the weekend and operating from 6 am to midnight would contribute to profits. We offer an alternative strategy to the proposed profile because the proposed profile in the most likely scenarios proves loss making when considering the gas component’s operation throughout the year.   The gas-LFR plant imitating the based-load role of a coal generator takes advantage of the strengths of the gas and LFR component, that is, the flexibility of gas to compensate for the LFR’s intermittency, and utilising the LFR’s low SRMC.   However, the high SRMC of the gas component in a baseload role loses the flexibility to respond to market conditions and contributes to loss instead of profit and to CO 2 production during periods of low demand. The alternative profile retains the advantages of the proposed profile but allows the gas component freedom to exploit market conditions.   Figure 17 introduces the perfect day’s yield profile calculated from the maximum hourly yield from the years 2007 - 13.   The gas generator tops up the actual LFR yield to the perfect day’s yield profile to cover LFR intermittency.   The residual capacity of the gas generator is free to meet demand when spot market prices exceed SRMC and price spikes during Value-of-Lost-Load (VOLL) events.   The flexibility of the gas component may prove more advantageous as the penetration of intermittent renewable energy increases. 6         Conclusion We find that the proposed plant is a useful addition to the NEM but the proposed profile is unsuitable because the gas component is loss making for four months of the year and producing CO 2 during periods of low demand.   We recommend further research using the alternative perfect day’s yield profile. 7         Further Research We discuss further research compiled from recommendation elsewhere in the report. 8         Appendix A Australian National Electricity Market Model Network This appendix provides diagrams of the generation and load serving entity nodes and the transmission lines that the ANEM model uses.   There are 52 nodes and 68 transmission lines, which make the ANEM model realistic.   In comparison, many other models of the NEM are highly aggregated. 9         Appendix B Australian National Electricity Market Model This appendix describes the ANEM model in detail and provides additional information on the assumptions made about the change in the generation fleet in the NEM during the lifetime of the proposed plant...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Base-Load Fallacy is the {{incorrect}} {{notion that}} renewable energy cannot supply base-load (24 -hour) electric power. Alternatives to base-load coal {{power can be}} provided by efficient energy use, solar hot water, bioenergy, large-scale wind power, solar thermal electricity with thermal storage, and geothermal, with gas power playing a transitional role. In particular, large-scale wind power from geographically distributed sites is partially reliable and can be made more so by installing a little additional low-cost <b>peak-load</b> back-up from <b>gas</b> turbines. Other fallacies are refuted concisely in the appendix. 1 Opponents of renewable energy, from the coal and nuclear industries and from NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) groups, are disseminating the Base-Load Fallacy, that is, the fallacy that renewable energy cannot provide base-load (24 -hour) power to substitute for coal-fired electricity. In Australia, even Government Ministers and some journalists are propagating this conventional ‘wisdom’, although it is false. This fallacy is the principal weapon of renewable energy deniers. Other fallacies are discussed briefly in the appendix. The political implications are that, if these fallacies become widely believed, renewable energy would always have to remain a niche market, rather than achieve its true potential of becoming...|$|R
