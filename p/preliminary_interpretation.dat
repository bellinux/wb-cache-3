40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{significance}} of the accuracy of the starting model parameters generated from conventional partial curve matching (CPCM), the asymptotes/inflection points (AIP) and the type curve-controlled guess (TCCG) techniques of Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) <b>preliminary</b> <b>interpretation.</b> The study involves both model studies and field data analysis. A total of thirty (30) Schlumberger VES data sets generated for multilayered (3 - 5 layers) geologic models and field VES data from ten (10) drilled sites in the Basement Complex areas were employed. RESIST version 1. 0 software was used for the refinement of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>interpretation</b> results (layer parameters) obtained from model and field data. Statistical analysis of percentage deviations between model and final interpretation parameters was carried out; while composite plots of the interpreted and borehole derived depths were done. The error margins obtained in each of the conventional partial curve matching, asymptotes/inflection points and type curve-controlled guess technique respectively are significantly between ± 10 %;- 30 and + 40 % and- 30 and + 10 % in resistivity estimates; ± 10 %;- 10 and + 130 % and- 40 and + 100 % in depth estimates in the theoretical model data. The error margins in depth in the field data trial are significantly between- 35 and + 5 % for partial curve matching,- 90 and + 20 % for asymptotes/inflection points and- 85 and- 10 % for type curve-controlled guess technique. The partial curve matching interpretation technique gives the most consistently low percentage deviation error margins amongst the three VES <b>preliminary</b> <b>interpretation</b> techniques...|$|E

40|$|Tablet {{devices have}} {{recently}} been used in radiological image interpretation {{because they have a}} display resolution comparable to desktop LCD monitors. We identified a need to examine tablet display performance prior to their use in <b>preliminary</b> <b>interpretation</b> of radiological images. We compared the spatial and contrast resolution of a commercially available tablet display with a diagnostic grade 2 megapixel monochrome LCD using a contrast detail phantom. We also recorded reporting discrepancies, using the ACR RADPEER system, between <b>preliminary</b> <b>interpretation</b> of 100 emergency CT brain examinations on the tablet display and formal review on a diagnostic LCD. The iPad display performed inferiorly to the diagnostic monochrome display without the ability to zoom. When the software zoom function was enabled on the tablet device, comparable contrast detail phantom scores of 163 vs 165 points were achieved. No reporting discrepancies were encountered during the interpretation of 43 normal examinations and five cases of acute intracranial hemorrhage. There were seven RADPEER 2 (understandable) misses when using the iPad display and 12 with the diagnostic LCD. Use of software zoom in the tablet device improved its contrast detail phantom score. The tablet allowed satisfactory identification of acute CT brain findings, but additional research will be required to examine the cause of "understandable" reporting discrepancies that occur when using tablet devices...|$|E

Sleep deprivation has been shown experimentally to produce effects on certain mental tasks equivalent to alcohol intoxication [42]. Continuous prolonged decision-making results in decision fatigue, and the nature of radiologists’ work makes us prone to this effect. Not surprisingly, this form of fatigue increases later in the day, and leads to unconscious taking of shortcuts in cognitive processes, resulting in poor judgement and diagnostic errors.
