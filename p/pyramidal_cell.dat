5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cell,</b> (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E
50|$|Pyramidal neurons, {{like other}} neurons, have {{numerous}} voltage-gated ion channels. In pyramidal cells, {{there is an}} abundance of Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels in the dendrites, and some channels in the soma. Ion channels within <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cell</b> dendrites have different properties from the same ion channel type within the <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cell</b> soma. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cell</b> dendrites are activated by subthreshold EPSPs and by back-propagating action potentials. The extent of back-propagation of action potentials within pyramidal dendrites depends upon the K+ channels. K+ channels in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cell</b> dendrites provide a mechanism for controlling the amplitude of action potentials.|$|E

40|$|The group I metabotropic {{glutamate}} {{receptor agonist}} DHPG {{has been shown}} to produce two major effects on CA 3 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> at rest: a reduction in the background conductance and an activation of a voltage-gated inward current (ImGluR(V)). Both effects contribute to depolarising CA 3 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> and the latter has been implicated in eliciting prolonged epileptiform population bursts. We observed that DHPG-induced depolarisation was smaller in CA 1 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> than in CA 3 cells. Voltage clamp studies revealed that while DHPG elicited ImGluR(V) in CA 3 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells,</b> such a response was absent in CA 1 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> Both mGluR 1 and mGluR 5 have been localised in CA 3 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas only mGluR 5 has been detected in CA 1 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> Using mGluR 1 knockout mice, we evaluated whether the absence of an ImGluR(V) response can be correlated with the absence of mGluR 1. In these experiments, DHPG failed to elicit ImGluR(V) in CA 3 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> This suggests that the smaller depolarising effects of DHPG on wild-type CA 1 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> is caused, at least in part, by the absence of ImGluR(V) in these cells and that the difference in the responses of CA 1 and CA 3 cells may be attributable to the lack of mGluR 1 in CA 1 <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I ratio), two opposing {{forces in the}} mammalian cerebral cortex, affects many cortical functions like feature selectivity and gain 1, 2. Individual <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> show stable E/I ratios in time despite fluctuating cortical activity levels because when excitation increases, inhibition increases proportionally through the increased recruitment of inhibitory neurons, a phenomenon referred to as excitation-inhibition balance 3 – 9. However, {{little is known about}} the distribution of E/I ratios across <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> Through their highly divergent axons inhibitory neurons indiscriminately contact most neighboring <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> 10, 11. Is inhibition homogeneously distributed or is it individually matched to the different amounts of excitation received by distinct <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells?</b> Here we discover that <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> in layer 2 / 3 of mouse primary visual cortex (V 1) each receive inhibition in a similar proportion to their excitation. As a consequence E/I ratios are equalized across <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> This matched inhibition is mediated by parvalbumin-expressing (PV) but not somatostatin-expressing (SOM) inhibitory neurons and results from the independent adjustment of synapses originating from the same PV cell but targeting different <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, this match is activity-dependen...|$|R

This spike results in a trisynaptic EPSP being recorded in a postsynaptic <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cell</b> (cell 4, event A).

The spiking chandelier cell (6) triggers yet another pyramidal neuron to fire (7), which produces an EPSP on the recorded neuron (cell 4, event C), five synapses away from the original spike. The result seen in the postsynaptic pyramidal neuron (cell 4) is a delayed EPSP-IPSP-EPSP sequence (events A, B, and C), traveling through three, four, and five synapses respectively.

Interneurones were identified by their expression of GFP under the GAD- 65 promoter. We used the sensitivity to the cardiac glycoside, ouabain, to discriminate between different α subunit isoforms. GFP-positive interneurones were depolarized by nanomolar doses of ouabain, but higher concentrations were needed to depolarize <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> Comparison of pump currents in these cells revealed a current sensitive to low doses of ouabain in interneurones, while micromolar doses of ouabain were needed to suppress the pump current in subicular <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> As predicted, nanomolar doses of ouabain increased the frequency but not the amplitudes of IPSPs in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> Immunostaining confirmed a differential distribution of α-subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase in subicular interneurones and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> In conclusion, {{these data suggest that}} while ATP 1 A 3 -isoforms regulate sodium and potassium homeostasis in subicular interneurones, ATP 1 A 1 -isoforms assume this function in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells.</b> This differential expression of sodium pump isoforms may contribute to differences in resting membrane potential of subicular interneurones and <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|In addicts, {{associative}} memories {{related to}} the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse can evoke powerful craving and drug seeking urges, but effective treatment to suppress these memories is not available. Detailed insight into the neural circuitry that mediates expression of drug-associated memory is therefore of crucial importance. Substantial evidence from rodent models of addictive behavior points to {{the involvement of the}} ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in conditioned drug seeking, but specific knowledge of the temporal role of vmPFC <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> is lacking. To this end, we used an optogenetics approach to probe the involvement of vmPFC <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> in expression of a recent and remote conditioned cocaine memory. In mice, we expressed Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) or Halorhodopsin (eNpHR 3. 0) in <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> of the vmPFC and studied the effect of activation or inhibition of these cells during expression of a cocaine-contextual memory on days 1 - 2 (recent) and ~ 3 weeks (remote) after conditioning. Whereas optical activation of <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> facilitated extinction of remote memory, without affecting recent memory, inhibition of <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> acutely impaired recall of recent cocaine memory, without affecting recall of remote memory. In addition, we found that silencing <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> blocked extinction learning at the remote memory time-point. We provide causal evidence of a critical time-dependent switch in the contribution of vmPFC <b>pyramidal</b> <b>cells</b> to recall and extinction of cocaine-associated memory, indicating that the circuitry that controls expression of cocaine memories reorganizes over time. © 2013 the authors...|$|R
