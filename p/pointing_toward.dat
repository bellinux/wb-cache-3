5|$|Titania orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of about , being the second farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Titania's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 8.7 days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Titania is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> the planet.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Jupiter's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing magnetotail, which sometimes extends well beyond the orbit of Saturn. The structure of Jupiter's magnetotail is similar to Earth's. It consists of two lobes (blue areas in the figure), with the magnetic field in the southern lobe <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> Jupiter, and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it. The lobes are separated by a thin layer of plasma called the tail current sheet (orange layer in the middle). Like Earth's, the Jovian tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere, where it is heated and forms the radiation belts at distances closer than 10RJ from Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E

5|$|Jamal, Muhammad, the Associated Press cameraman, and Shams Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, took cover {{against the}} {{concrete}} {{wall in the}} south-east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost. Jamal, Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum, apparently part of a culvert, that was sitting against the wall. A thick paving stone sat {{on top of the}} drum, which offered further protection. Abu Rahma hid behind a white minibus parked across the road about 15metres away from the wall. The Reuters and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad's shoulders—the cameras <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> the Israeli outpost—before the men moved away. Jamal and Muhammad did not move away, but stayed behind the drum for 45 minutes. In Enderlin's view, they were frozen in fear.|$|E
5|$|Oberon orbits Uranus at a {{distance}} of about 584,000km, being the farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Oberon's orbit has a small orbital eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 13.5days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Oberon is a synchronous satellite, tidally locked, with one face always <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> the planet. Oberon spends a significant part of its orbit outside the Uranian magnetosphere. As a result, its surface is directly struck by the solar wind. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by the magnetospheric plasma, which co–rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).|$|E
5|$|Umbriel orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of about , being the third farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Umbriel's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 4.1Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Umbriel is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> its parent planet. Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment {{may lead to the}} darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles, which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit as observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, a team informally {{dubbed the}} Andrew Irvine Search Committee led by American Everest {{historian}} Tom Holzel conducted a new photographic search for Irvine using a computer-assembled montage of aerial photographs taken in 1984 by Brad Washburn and the National Geographic Society. This search {{led to the}} identification of a possible object at about 8,425 metres, less than 100 m from the ice-axe location, {{which is consistent with}} an identification of that of a body lying in a slot of rock, feet <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> the summit, just as Xu described his sighting.|$|E
25|$|The {{content of}} the {{triangular}} tablet reiterates triplicity.

The name of the goddess appears above her head: Dione (ΔΙΟΝΗ), Phoebe (ΦΟΙΒΙΗ), and the obscure Nyche (ΝΥΧΙΗ). Amibousa, a word referring to the phases of the moon, is written under each goddess's feet. Densely inscribed spells frame each goddess: the inscriptions around Dione and Nyche are voces magicae, incantatory syllables ("magic words") that are mostly untranslatable. Melinoë appears in a triple invocation {{that is part of}} the inscription around Phoebe: O Persephone, O Melinoë, O Leucophryne. Esoteric symbols are inscribed on the edges of the triangle.|$|E

25|$|Expert ESA {{personnel}} were immediately dispatched from Europe to the United States to direct operations. Days passed without contact from SOHO. On July 23, the Arecibo Observatory and Goldstone Solar System Radar combined to locate SOHO with radar, {{and to determine}} its location and attitude. SOHO was close to its predicted position, oriented with its side versus the usual front Optical Surface Reflector panel <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> the Sun, and was rotating at one revolutions every 53 seconds. Once SOHO was located, plans for contacting SOHO were formed. On August 3 a carrier was detected from SOHO, the first signal since June 25. After days of charging the battery, a successful {{attempt was made to}} modulate the carrier and downlink telemetry on August 8. After instrument temperatures were downlinked on August 9, data analysis was performed, and planning for the SOHO recovery began in earnest.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{designed}} a two-story portico with five arches that faced east toward the city’s skyline. The arches and their tapered support columns were clad in creamy Texas shellstone. The remaining three {{sides of the}} 20,000-square-foot building were also covered with shellstone cladding. Sheltered by the arched portico, the museum's front wall consisted of a two-story curtain of glass windows with bronze mullions. The main entrance lead directly into a two-story hall adorned with {{the same type of}} shellstone used on the exterior, teak wall coverings, and a floor of pink and gray granite. Beyond the main hall were five small galleries of equal size for the display of art. On the mezzanine level were five similar galleries, each with a balcony that overlooked the main hall. These mezzanine galleries served as library and office spaces. To take advantage of the expanse between the two-story portico and the site’s eastern boundary, Johnson {{designed a}} series of broad steps and terraces extending away from the building, with an expansive sunken, grassy plaza as the centerpiece, <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> the city’s center.|$|E

500|$|When {{phospholipids}} {{are exposed}} to water, they self-assemble into a two-layered sheet with the hydrophobic tails <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> {{the center of the}} sheet. This arrangement results in two “leaflets” that are each a single molecular layer. [...] The center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like sugars or salts that dissolve in water. The assembly process is driven by interactions between hydrophobic molecules (also called the hydrophobic effect). [...] An increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules (causing clustering of hydrophobic regions) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other, increasing the entropy of the system. This complex process includes non-covalent interactions such as van der Waals forces, electrostatic and hydrogen bonds.|$|E
500|$|The film is set {{six months}} after the events of Iron Man, and takes place {{simultaneously}} with the events of The Incredible Hulk and Thor. The filmmakers continued to reference other Marvel films by again including Captain America's shield. Favreau explained, [...] "We introduced Captain America's shield briefly in one shot in the last film. So now it really was in his room, so we had {{to figure out how to}} deal with the reality that the shield was in his workshop." [...] A scene toward the end of Iron Man 2 in a S.H.I.E.L.D. safe house contains several Easter eggs, ranging from footage from The Incredible Hulk displayed on a monitor to pointers on a map indicating several locales related to other Marvel films, including one <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> a region of Africa in reference to the Black Panther. A young Peter Parker appears as the child wearing an Iron Man mask who Stark saves from a drone; the appearance was confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, Kevin Feige and [...] director Jon Watts. The film's post-credits scene showed the discovery of Thor's hammer in a crater.|$|E
