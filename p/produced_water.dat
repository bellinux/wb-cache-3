5|$|While moving erratically off {{the east}} coast of Florida, Tropical Storm Edouard {{produced}} rough surf conditions and rip currents along many beaches. Beachgoers and visitors were advised to exercise extreme caution. The storm <b>produced</b> <b>water</b> levels about 6inches above normal near Cape Canaveral, though elsewhere wave action and storm tides were not significant. Despite being a tropical storm at landfall, sustained tropical storm force winds were not observed. A rainband ahead of the storm produced a 39mph (63km/h) wind gust at Patrick Air Force Base, and a station in St. Augustine recorded a wind gust of 38mph (61km/h). Sustained winds peaked at 31mph (50km/h) at Patrick Air Force Base. Edouard dropped light to moderate rainfall in eastern Florida, primarily during 2 to 3hour periods. The highest official rainfall total peaked at 2.5inches (64mm) at Orlando Executive Airport, though unofficial totals reached as high as 4.8inches (122mm) in Rockledge. Rainfall was higher in western Florida, peaking at 7.64inches (194mm) in DeSoto County with an area near Tampa reporting over 7inches (175mm).|$|E

In the United States the prevailing management practice for <b>produced</b> <b>waters</b> is deep well injection, but {{this practice is}} costly. Therefore minimizing the need for deep well injection is desirable. A major treatment issue for <b>produced</b> <b>waters</b> is the reduction of total dissolved solids (TDS), which consist mostly of inorganic salts. A hybrid electrodialysis/reverse-osmosis (ED/RO) treatment process is being developed to concentrate the salts in <b>produced</b> <b>waters</b> and thereby reduce the volume of brine {{that needs to be}} managed for disposal. The desalted water can be used beneficially or discharged. In this study, laboratory feasibility experiments were conducted by using <b>produced</b> <b>waters</b> from multiple sites. A novel-membrane configuration approach to prevent fouling and scale formation was developed and demonstrated. Results of laboratory experiments and plans for field demonstration are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Geological Survey {{recently}} updated a geochemical database {{consisting of}} data for approximately 160, 000 <b>produced</b> <b>waters</b> samples, primarily from petroleum and geothermal reservoirs. Using major and trace elements from conventional and unconventional well types from the database, this thesis provides a comprehensive, national evaluation for mineral commodity potential in <b>produced</b> <b>waters.</b> <b>Produced</b> <b>waters</b> contain virtually every naturally occurring element and can range in salinity to {{several times that}} of seawater. Despite the typical outlook to view <b>produced</b> <b>waters</b> as a waste, they have potential for natural resource development. ^ This thesis provides, for each mineral commodity found in the <b>produced</b> <b>waters</b> database, maps showing the distribution of concentration, economic values of mineral commodities, and statistical analysis, for the contiguous United States. The maps identify areas of interest for both resource potential and show the largest priority for future mineral exploration; {{as well as to}} identify data gaps and needs for future exploration. Identified constituents in concentrations at some locations exceed disposal costs and hold the greatest potential for profit: cesium, bromine, lithium carbonate, iodine, lithium chloride, magnesium, potash, soda ash, rubidium formate, and rubidium chloride. From these commodities, further data exploration would be required for rubidium formate, rubidium chloride and cesium. To maximize potential for development of <b>produced</b> <b>waters</b> is grouping minerals commodities to increase revenues. Either through selective or grouped removal for commodities, <b>produced</b> <b>waters</b> have potential for economic development. It may be possible to no longer consider <b>produced</b> <b>waters</b> as a waste product and a new viable resource. ...|$|R

25|$|Though widespread, {{systematic}} contamination by {{hydraulic fracturing}} has been heavily disputed, one {{major source of}} contamination that has the most consensus among researchers of being the most problematic is site-specific accidental spillage of hydraulic fracturing fluid and <b>produced</b> <b>water.</b> So far, a significant majority of groundwater contamination events are derived from surface-level anthropogenic routes rather than the subsurface flow from underlying shale formations. Examples of such events include: a fracking fluid spillage in Acorn Fork Creek, Kentucky that caused a widespread death among aquatic species in 2007; a 420,000 gallon spillage of hyper-saline <b>produced</b> <b>water</b> that turned a once very-fertile farmland in New Mexico into a dead-zone in 2010; and a 42,000 gallon fracking fluid spillage in Arlington, Texas that necessitated an evacuation of over a 100 homes in 2015. While the damage can be obvious, and much more effort {{is being done to}} prevent these accidents from occurring so frequently, the lack of data from fracking oil spills continue to leave researchers in the dark. In many of these events, the data acquired from the leakage or spillage is often very vague, and thus would lead researchers to lacking conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Bioremediation Accelerator: Oleophilic, {{hydrophobic}} chemical, containing no bacteria, which chemically {{and physically}} bonds to both soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons. The bioremediation accelerator {{acts as a}} herding agent in water and on the surface, floating molecules {{to the surface of}} the water, including solubles such as phenols and BTEX, forming gel-like agglomerations. Undetectable levels of hydrocarbons can be obtained in <b>produced</b> <b>water</b> and manageable water columns. By overspraying sheen with bioremediation accelerator, sheen is eliminated within minutes. Whether applied on land or on water, the nutrient-rich emulsion creates a bloom of local, indigenous, pre-existing, hydrocarbon-consuming bacteria. Those specific bacteria break down the hydrocarbons into water and carbon dioxide, with EPA tests showing 98% of alkanes biodegraded in 28 days; and aromatics being biodegraded 200 times faster than in nature they also sometimes use the hydrofireboom to clean the oil up by taking it away from most of the oil and burning it.|$|E

40|$|The {{toxicity}} {{of crude oil}} effluent (<b>produce</b> <b>water)</b> was tested on Tilapia guinensis and mangrove swamp microbial community (bacteria and fungi) in the aquarium environment. One hundred percent mortality occurred in the Tilapia sp exposed to 60 % concentration of <b>produce</b> <b>water</b> within 24 hours. Mortality ranged between 50 % and 80 % when the same organism was exposed to 40 % concentration for 96 hours. No mortality was observed below 30 % concentration during 96 hours. Since total hydrocarbon levels in <b>produce</b> <b>water</b> were low with indicated value of ± 2. 19 part per million (ppm), observed mortalities were attributed {{to the presence of}} toxins other than the oil. The bacterial character of the effluent was also confirmed by the marked growth inhibition at 96 hours relative to controls. Inhibition of bacterial growth resulted in competitive advantage to fungi, which show enhancement in growth relative to controls. The effect of <b>produce</b> <b>water</b> on the microbial community clearly showed the extent of ecosystem alteration associated with chronic low-level pollution from oil field <b>produce</b> <b>water.</b> There was no indication that microbial growth affected the {{toxicity of}} effluent to fish. In the light of these results, the discharge of crude oil <b>produce</b> <b>water,</b> even if it meets the oil and grease limits, must be considered with caution until comprehensive analysis of effluent characteristics and subsequent treatment has been performed...|$|R

Several locations that were scouted for the episode proved difficult to use. Two churches that had been selected for the episode pulled out just before filming began and replacements had to be found immediately. The scenes in the woods were filmed at Griffith Park in Los Angeles. The location was chosen because it possessed [...] "probably the only pine trees in Los Angeles". Due {{to the fact that the}} actual park is rather sparsely populated by brush, the foliage was all created by the crew of the series. Manners shot several of the forest scenes with a 200 millimeter lens, so that the lights of Los Angeles would be disguised in the distance. Padgett's furnace was filmed on a set called the red/blue room. It had originally been created for the sixth seasoner opener [...] "The Beginning". The jail set was constructed in a large warehouse by a different production company. The X-Files rented the space for several days for filming, for five thousand dollars.

6000|$|I have said, {{the truly}} wise and learned disdain these shifts, and {{will open the}} said novel as avowedly as they would the lid of their snuff-box. I will only quote one instance, though I know a hundred. Did you know the celebrated Watt of Birmingham, Captain Clutterbuck? I believe not, though, from what I am about to state, {{he would not have}} failed to have sought an {{acquaintance}} with you. It was only once my fortune to meet him, whether in body or in spirit it matters not. There were assembled about half a score of our Northern Lights, who had amongst them, Heaven knows how, a well-known character of your country, Jedediah Cleishbotham. This worthy person, having come to Edinburgh during the Christmas vacation, had become a sort of lion in the place, and was lead in leash from house to house along with the guisards, the stone-eater, and other amusements of the season, which [...] "exhibited their unparalleled feats to private family-parties, if required." [...] Amidst this company stood Mr. Watt, the man whose genius discovered the means of multiplying our national resources to a degree perhaps even beyond his own stupendous powers of calculation and combination; bringing the treasures of the abyss to the summit of the earth--giving the feeble arm of man the momentum of an Afrite--commanding manufactures to arise, as the rod of the prophet <b>produced</b> <b>water</b> in the desert--affording the means of dispensing with that time and tide which wait for no man, and of sailing without that wind which defied the commands and threats of Xerxes himself.|$|E
60|$|I see {{you are not}} {{tired of}} the candle yet, or I am sure {{you would not be}} {{interested}} in the subject in the way you are. When our candle was burning, we found it <b>produced</b> <b>water</b> exactly like the water we have around us; and by further examination of this water we found in it that curious body, hydrogen--that light substance of which there is some in this jar. We afterwards saw the burning powers of that hydrogen, and that it <b>produced</b> <b>water.</b> And I think I introduced to your notice an apparatus which I very briefly said was an arrangement of chemical force, or power, or energy, so adjusted as to convey its power to us in these wires; and I said I should use that force to pull the water to pieces, to see what else there was in the water besides hydrogen; because, you remember, when we passed the water through the iron tube, we by no means got the weight of water back which we put in, in the form of steam, though we had a very large quantity of gas evolved. We have now to see what is the other substance present. That you may understand the character and use of this instrument, let us make an experiment or two. Let us put together, first of all, some substances, knowing what they are, and then see what that instrument does to them. There is some copper (observe the various changes which it can undergo), and here is some nitric acid, and you will find that this, being a strong chemical agent, will act very powerfully when I add it to the copper. It is now sending forth a beautiful red vapour; but as we do not want that vapour, Mr. Anderson will hold it near the chimney for a short time, that we may have the use and beauty of the experiment without the annoyance. The copper which I have put into the flask will dissolve: it will change the acid and the water into a blue fluid, containing copper and other things; and I propose then shewing you how this voltaic battery deals with it; and in the mean-time we will arrange another kind of experiment for you to see what power it has. This is a substance which is to us like water--that is to say, it contains bodies which we do not know of as yet, as water contains a body which we do not know as yet. Now, this solution of a salt[15] I will put upon paper, and spread about, and apply the power of the battery to it, and observe what will happen. Three or four important things will happen which we shall take advantage of. I place this wetted paper upon a sheet of tinfoil, which is convenient for keeping all clean, and also for the advantageous application of the power; and this solution, you see, is not at all affected by being put upon the paper or tinfoil, nor by anything else I have brought in contact with it yet, and which, therefore, is free to us to use as regards that instrument. But first let us see that our instrument is in order. Here are our wires. Let us see whether it is in the state in which it was last time. We can soon tell. As yet, when I bring them together, we have no power, because the conveyers--what we call the electrodes--the passages or ways for the electricity--are stopped; but now Mr. Anderson by that [referring to a sudden flash at the ends of the wires] has given me a telegram {{to say that it is}} ready. Before I begin our experiment I will get Mr. Anderson to break contact again at the battery behind me, and we will put a platinum-wire across to connect the poles, and then if I find I can ignite a pretty good length of this wire, we shall be safe in our experiment. Now you will see the power. [The connection was established, and the intermediate wire became red-hot.] There is the power running beautifully through the wire, which I have made thin on purpose to shew you that we have those powerful forces; and now, having that power, we will proceed with it to the examination of water.|$|E
