50|$|The most {{important}} of these is hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, a pale blue, nearly colourless liquid that has a lower volatility than water and a higher density and viscosity. It is important chemically as it can be either oxidised or reduced in solutions of any pH, can readily form peroxometal complexes and <b>peroxoacid</b> complexes, as well as undergoing many proton acid/base reactions. In its less concentrated form hydrogen peroxide has some major household uses, such as a disinfectant or for bleaching hair; much more concentrated solutions are much more dangerous.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of {{a study of the}} reactions of certain organic <b>peroxoacids</b> with certain model stain molecules. The <b>peroxoacids</b> in question were peroxobenzoic and monoperoxophthalic acid. The model compounds were; methyl orange, methyl red, flavone, alizarin, salicylaldoxime and salicylaldehyde. A brief study was also made of the reactions of peroxobenzoic acid with; para-vinylbenzoic acid, sorbic acid, cinnamic acid, ethanol and acetaldehyde. Rate versus pH plots were developed and, where possible, reaction products were identified and mechanisms suggested. In some cases activation parameters were measured. The possibility of transition metal ion catalysis was investigated in most cases...|$|R
