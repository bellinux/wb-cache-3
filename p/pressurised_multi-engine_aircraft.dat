50|$|The {{base was}} built in 1941 {{as the home of}} No. 6 Service Flying Training School (No. 6 SFTS) during World War II. The SFTS {{provided}} advanced training for RAAF pilots, including fighter and <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|Those {{pilots who}} train to fly transports, tankers and other <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> begin with small <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{such as the}} T-44A Pegasus variant of the Beechcraft King Air. Once they have {{mastered}} this, they may begin to fly in the right-hand seat of an operational type. Some airforces will seek to use a restricted number of multi-engined aircraft, with the derivatives of a basic aircraft filling different roles so that a pilot qualified on one of its types can easily convert {{to others in the}} same family. For example, the Boeing 707 was a popular airliner for conversion to tanker, transport and ELINT variants by numerous air forces.|$|R
50|$|Finch has logged {{more than}} 8,000 flying hours with {{approximately}} 5,900 of these flying hours in vintage <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> warbirds and tail draggers. She has flown in numerous air shows {{around the world}} for more than 20 years.|$|R
5000|$|Later, during Advanced Flight Training at Kelly Field, Texas, Davis {{was intent}} on {{piloting}} <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> - specifically B-17s. His flight instructor, however, told him, [...] "No Davis you're a fighter pilot and that's {{where you want to}} be".|$|R
50|$|When one of {{the engines}} on a typical <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> becomes inoperative, a thrust {{imbalance}} exists between the operative and inoperative sides of the aircraft. This thrust imbalance causes several negative effects {{in addition to the}} loss of one engine's thrust.|$|R
50|$|As of 2007, {{there are}} 74 {{aircraft}} based at this airport. These aircraft include 38 single-engine <b>aircraft,</b> 13 <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> 13 helicopters and 10 jets. In percent form 51.3% of the based aircraft are single-engine, 17.5% are multi-engine, 17.5% helicopter and 13.5% jet.|$|R
50|$|The {{base was}} {{reactivated}} on January 13, 1948, and its name changed to Enid Air Force Base, {{as one of}} the pilot training bases within the Air Training Command (ATC). Its mission was to provide training for advanced students in <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> each thrust lever {{displays}} {{the engine number}} of the engine it controls. Normally, there is one thrust lever for each engine. The thrust levers are normally found in the aircraft's center console, or on the dashboard of smaller aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Though the F406 is more {{expensive}} to operate than single-engine aircraft of the same passenger capacity such as the Cessna 208 Caravan, having two engines makes it comply with European regulations regarding commercial operations, which only allow <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> for commercial instrument flight.|$|R
25|$|The {{requirements}} for an instrument rating {{are the same}} for both a private pilot licenceaeroplane and a private pilot licencehelicopter. Helicopters certified for IFR operations are generally complex multi-crew and <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> so a helicopter instrument rating is generally issued {{in conjunction with other}} ratings.|$|R
5000|$|For the 12-month period ending October 31, 2008, {{the airport}} had 20,164 {{aircraft}} operations, {{an average of}} 55 per day: 40% local general aviation and 60% itinerant general aviation. There are 18 aircraft based at this airport: 12 single engine <b>aircraft</b> and 6 <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of ATC operations, the Douglas C-47 Skytrain was the primary transport plane in use. At first, the C-47 was often fitted with long-range tanks for long flights, but as larger <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> became available, the C-47 was redeployed for use on shorter routes.|$|R
50|$|The B-24 was {{produced}} in very large numbers. At nearly 19,000 units, with over 8,000 manufactured by Ford Motor Company, it holds {{the distinction of being}} the most produced heavy bomber in history, the most produced <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> in history and the most-produced American military aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The 502 Squadron [...] "Elefantes" [...] (Esquadra 502) is a {{transport}} {{squadron of}} the Portuguese Air Force. Its primary mission is tactical air transport {{and has the}} secondary mission of providing additional pilot training in <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> and in navigation, search and rescue, and general air transport.|$|R
5000|$|Pilots {{of larger}} <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> are {{sometimes}} called transport pilots, although {{mostly in the}} realm of military aviation (see the article on military transport aircraft). The term transport pilot can be ambiguous in civil aviation, since the Airline Transport Pilot License is a very specific civil qualification.|$|R
50|$|For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2010, {{the airport}} had 56,920 general {{aviation}} aircraft operations, {{an average of}} 139 per day. At that time there were 109 aircraft based at this airport: 85 single-engine <b>aircraft,</b> 14 <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> 3 jet aircraft, 3 helicopters and 4 ultralight aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The airport cover {{an area of}} 110 acre and {{contains}} one asphalt paved runway. Mostly used for general aviation, the airport offers no commercial service. With 318 aircraft based at Auburn, including 293 single engine, 14 <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and 11 helicopter. The airport averages 450 operations per day.|$|R
50|$|The {{requirements}} for an instrument rating {{are the same}} for both a private pilot licence - aeroplane and a private pilot licence - helicopter. Helicopters certified for IFR operations are generally complex multi-crew and <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> so a helicopter instrument rating is generally issued {{in conjunction with other}} ratings.|$|R
50|$|Between October and November 1974 {{the first}} CASA C-212-100 Aviocar started being delivered, {{with the last}} {{aircraft}} being delivered on April 9, 1976. The navigation and <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> instruction and training mission of 32 Squadron is then given to 111 Squadron, which also receives the helicopter instruction and training mission.|$|R
5000|$|For the 12-month period ending June 27, 2014, {{the airport}} had 9,300 {{aircraft}} operations, {{an average of}} 25 per day, with 59% transient general aviation, 38% local general aviation and 3% air taxi. In June 2017, there were 16 aircraft based at this airport: 14 single-engine and 2 <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The airline {{has been}} in {{operation}} since 1985, offering charter and scheduled service with single and <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> on floats from Campbell River, British Columbia. The company was started by Larry Langford with a Cessna on floats and has grown to include five aircraft. It received media publicity during the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|R
25|$|The Rutan Model 202 Boomerang is an {{aircraft}} {{designed and built}} by Burt Rutan. The design {{was intended to be}} a <b>multi-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> that in the event of failure of a single engine would not become dangerously difficult to control due to asymmetric thrust. The result is an asymmetrical aircraft with a very distinct appearance.|$|R
