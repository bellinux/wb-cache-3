5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a {{detailed study of}} the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus was incapable of pronating its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb <b>pronation</b> meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in any other way) biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly {{twice as long as}} the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that the}} centre of mass rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of <b>pronation</b> or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
25|$|The tendon that {{attaches}} to the radial tuberosity is partially or completely surrounded by a bursa; the bicipitoradial bursa, which ensures frictionless motion between the biceps tendon and the proximal radius during <b>pronation</b> and supination of the forearm.|$|E
25|$|Dorsiflexion (extension) and plantar flexion occur {{around the}} {{transverse}} axis {{running through the}} ankle joint {{from the tip of}} the medial malleolus to the tip of the lateral malleolus. <b>Pronation</b> (eversion) and supination (inversion) occur along the oblique axis of the ankle joint.|$|E
25|$|Even when fully {{extended}} (straightened) at the elbow, the forearm did not form a straight angle, falling short of this by 22°. <b>Pronation</b> (twisting {{to make the}} palmar side of the hand face downwards) of the forearm was impossible, because the radius and ulna lacked rolling surfaces, meaning the forearm was in a permanent state of supination.|$|E
25|$|A {{primitive}} autonomization of {{the first}} carpometacarpal joint (CMC) may have occurred in dinosaurs. A real differentiation appeared perhaps 70 mya in early primates, while {{the shape of the}} human thumb CMC finally appears about 5 mya. The result of this evolutionary process is a human CMC joint positioned at 80° of <b>pronation,</b> 40 of abduction, and 50° of flexion in relation to an axis passing through the second and third CMC joints.|$|E
25|$|Elbow (Humeroulnar joint) – The biceps brachii also {{functions}} {{as an important}} flexor of the forearm, particularly when the forearm is supinated. Functionally, this action is performed when lifting an object, such as a bag of groceries or when performing a biceps curl. When the forearm is in <b>pronation</b> (the palm faces the ground), the brachialis, brachioradialis, and supinator function to flex the forearm, with minimal contribution from the biceps brachii. It {{is also important to}} note that regardless of forearm position, (supinated, pronated, or neutral,) the force exerted by the biceps brachii remains the same; however, the brachioradialis has a much greater change in exertion depending on position than the biceps during concentric contractions. That is, the biceps can only exert so much force, and as forearm position changes, other muscles must compensate.|$|E
25|$|Identification {{of major}} forces is {{critical}} to understanding insect flight. The first attempts to understand flapping wings assumed a quasi-steady state. This means that the air flow over the wing {{at any given time}} was assumed to be the same as how the flow would be over a non-flapping, steady-state wing at the same angle of attack. By dividing the flapping wing into a large number of motionless positions and then analyzing each position, {{it would be possible to}} create a timeline of the instantaneous forces on the wing at every moment. The calculated lift was found to be too small by a factor of three, so researchers realized that there must be unsteady phenomena providing aerodynamic forces. There were several developing analytical models attempting to approximate flow close to a flapping wing. Some researchers predicted force peaks at supination. With a dynamically scaled model of a fruit fly, these predicted forces later were confirmed. Others argued that the force peaks during supination and <b>pronation</b> are caused by an unknown rotational effect that fundamentally is different from the translational phenomena. There is some disagreement with this argument. Through computational fluid dynamics, some researchers argue that there is no rotational effect. They claim that the high forces are caused by an interaction with the wake shed by the previous stroke.|$|E
500|$|<b>Pronation</b> (...) and {{supination}} (...) refer most {{generally to}} assuming prone or supine positions, but {{often they are}} used in a specific sense referring to rotation of the forearm or foot {{so that in the}} standard anatomical position the palm or sole is facing anteriorly (supination) or posteriorly (<b>pronation).</b>|$|E
500|$|... at {{the forearm}} is a {{rotational}} movement where {{the hand and}} upper arm are turned inwards. <b>Pronation</b> of the foot refers to turning of the sole outwards, so that weight is borne on the medial part of the foot.|$|E
500|$|Velociraptor, {{like other}} dromaeosaurids, {{had a large}} manus ('hand') with three {{strongly}} curved claws, which were similar in construction and flexibility to the wing bones of modern birds. The second digit was the longest of the three digits present, while the first was shortest. The structure of the carpal (wrist) bones prevented <b>pronation</b> of the wrist and forced the 'hands' to be held with the palmar surface facing inwards (medially), not downwards. The first digit of the foot, as in other theropods, was a small dewclaw. However, whereas most theropods had feet with three digits contacting the ground, dromaeosaurids like Velociraptor walked on only their third and fourth digits. The second digit, for which Velociraptor is most famous, was highly modified and held retracted off the ground. It bore a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw, typical of dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, which could grow to over [...] long around its outer edge, was most likely a predatory device used to tear into or restrain struggling prey.|$|E
2500|$|... and [...] {{refer to}} {{rotation}} of the forearm or foot {{so that in the}} anatomical position the palm or sole is facing anteriorly (supination) or posteriorly (<b>pronation)</b> {{rotation of the}} forearm. For example, if a person makes a [...] "thumbs up" [...] gesture, supination will cause the thumb to point away from the body midline and the fingers and plam to be upwards, while <b>pronation</b> will cause the thumb to point towards the body midline with the back of the hand upwards.|$|E
2500|$|Anterior oblique {{ligament}} (AOL): A strong, thick, and intracapsular ligament originating on the palmar tubercle of the trapezium to {{be inserted}} on the palmar tubercle {{of the first}} metacarpal. [...] It is taut in abduction, extension, and <b>pronation,</b> and {{has been reported to}} have an important retaining function and to be elongated or absent in CMC joint arthritis.|$|E
2500|$|Ulnar {{collateral}} ligament (UCL): An extracapsular ligament, the UCL {{is located}} ulnarly to the AOL. [...] It has its origin on the flexor retinaculum and is inserted on the ulnopalmar tubercle {{of the first}} metacarpal. [...] It is taut in abduction, extension, and <b>pronation,</b> and often found elongated in connection to CMC joint arthritis.

2500|$|Most insects use {{a method}} that creates a {{spiralling}} leading edge vortex. These flapping wings move through two basic half-strokes. The downstroke starts up and back and is plunged downward and forward. [...] Then the wing is quickly flipped over (supination) so that the leading edge is pointed backward. The upstroke then pushes the wing upward and backward. Then the wing is flipped again (<b>pronation)</b> and another downstroke can occur. The frequency range in insects with synchronous flight muscles typically is 5 to 200 hertz (Hz). In those with asynchronous flight muscles, wing beat frequency may exceed 1000Hz. When the insect is hovering, the two strokes take {{the same amount of}} time. A slower downstroke, however, provides thrust.|$|E
2500|$|When {{holding a}} typical mouse, ulna and radius bones {{on the arm}} are crossed. Some designs attempt to place the palm more vertically, so the bones take more natural {{parallel}} position. Some limit wrist movement, encouraging to use arm instead that may be less precise but more optimal from the health point of view. A mouse may be angled from the thumb downward {{to the opposite side}} – this is known to reduce wrist <b>pronation.</b> However such optimizations make the mouse right or left hand specific, making more problematic to change the tired hand. Time magazine has criticized manufacturers for offering few or no left-handed ergonomic mice: [...] "Oftentimes I felt like I was dealing with someone who’d never actually met a left-handed person before." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second {{design flaw}} of the stirrup affects {{the health of}} the human foot. [...] The rider's whole weight is at times {{supported}} entirely by the stirrups. [...] During these periods, excessive pressure can be exerted on the peroneus tertius tendon, which runs along the lateral side of the foot. In extreme cases, stirrups have been found to cause damage to the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone. Over long periods of extreme use, this can cause various medical conditions ranging from simple impaired walking to severe <b>pronation</b> or supination of the foot. Normal riders, however, generally have no related problems, even over a lifetime of riding. [...] Disciplines that require long hours in the saddle, such as endurance riding and some types of western riding on a working ranch, often use a wider stirrup to provide more support to the foot.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{injuries}} in running involve the knees and the feet. Various {{studies have focused}} on the initial cause of these running related injuries and found that there are many factors that correlate to these injuries. Female distance runners who had a history of stress fracture injuries had higher vertical impact forces than non-injured subjects. The large forces onto the lower legs were associated with gravitational forces, and this correlated with patellofemoral pain or potential knee injuries. [...] Researchers have also found that these running related injuries affect the feet as well because runners with previous injuries showed more foot eversion and over <b>pronation</b> while running than non-injured runners. This causes more loads and forces on the medial side of the foot, causing more stress on the tendons of the foot and ankle (peroneal tendons). Most of these running injuries are caused by overuse and that running at longer distances weekly for a long duration is a risk for injuring the lower legs.|$|E

Be proud of those accomplishments, my dear, but beware of attempting to become a Masseuse. There are drawbacks in that vocation--and I am conscious of one of them at this moment." [...] She lifted her hands to her nose. [...] "Pah! my hands smell of other people's flesh. The delicious country air will blow it away--the luxury of purification!" [...] Her fingers twisted and quivered, and got crooked at one moment and straight again at another, and showed themselves in succession singly, and flew into each other fiercely interlaced, and then spread out again like the sticks of a fan, until it really made me giddy to look at them. As for Miss Jillgall, she lifted her poor little sunken eyes rapturously to the sky, as if she called the homiest sunlight to witness that this was the most lovable woman {{on the face of the}} earth.|$|E
50|$|In anatomy, <b>pronation</b> is a {{rotational}} {{movement of the}} forearm (at the radioulnar joint) or foot (at the subtalar and talocalcaneonavicular joints). <b>Pronation</b> of the foot refers to how the body distributes weight as it cycles through the gait. During the gait cycle the foot can pronate {{in many different ways}} based on rearfoot and forefoot function. Types of <b>pronation</b> include neutral <b>pronation,</b> underpronation (supination), and overpronation.|$|E
50|$|For ease of {{choosing}} corrective footwear, {{three types of}} <b>pronation</b> are recognized: neutral <b>pronation,</b> overpronation, and underpronation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pronation</b> is {{a natural}} {{movement}} of the foot that occurs during foot landing while running or walking. Composed of three cardinal plane components: subtalar eversion, ankle dorsiflexion, and forefoot abduction, these three distinct motions of the foot occur simultaneously during the <b>pronation</b> phase. <b>Pronation</b> is a normal, desirable, and necessary component of the gait cycle. <b>Pronation</b> is {{the first half of}} the stance phase, whereas supination starts the propulsive phase as the heel begins to lift off the ground.|$|E
50|$|Beneficial {{exercise}} will be {{any that}} strengthens the interosseous muscles and lumbricals. By exercising individual fingers and thumb in adduction and abduction motion in <b>pronation</b> position, interosseous muscles will gain strength. Exercises to strengthen lumbricals, strengthen flexion in the metacarpophalangeal joint, and extension in the interphalangeal joints are beneficial. Repetitive motion of <b>pronation</b> and supination are also effective exercises for rehabilitation. Exercising <b>pronation</b> and supination with a handle or screwdriver attachment will help stimulate the nerves. A lateral pinch and recurring grip can also be applied for supination and <b>pronation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>pronation,</b> {{also called}} eversion, is natural in the body’s regular movement. However, overpronation and underpronation (supination) can be {{potentially}} harmful. Neutral <b>pronation</b> {{occurs when the}} foot experiences a normal, healthy amount of <b>pronation</b> instead of overpronating or underpronating. In healthy movement more of the toe area will be used when pushing off than in unhealthy movement. [...] In neutral <b>pronation</b> the weight distributes fairly evenly among all of the toes with a slight emphasis on the big toe and second toe which are better adapted to handle more of the load.|$|E

5000|$|Specific {{patterns}} of lacing running shoes also reduce <b>pronation.</b> <b>Pronation</b> significantly decreases when {{the highest number}} of eyelets in the shoe is used for lacing and the shoes are tied as tight as possible, ...|$|E
5000|$|Foot <b>pronation</b> {{tends to}} {{increase}} in runners as mileage also increases, potentially increasing the risk for injury. [...] Motion control shoes are {{a specific type of}} running shoe designed to limit these excessive foot motions by reducing the amount of plantar force (a force generated by excess <b>pronation).</b> Motion control and stability shoes have increased medial support which may increase stability to the foot and leg and lower the amount of <b>pronation</b> in the foot.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pronation</b> at {{the forearm}} is a {{rotational}} movement where {{the hand and}} upper arm are turned inwards. <b>Pronation</b> of the foot refers to turning of the sole outwards, so that weight is borne on the medial part of the foot.|$|E
50|$|Abnormal <b>pronation</b> {{occurs when}} a foot pronates when it should supinate, or overpronates during a normal <b>pronation</b> period of the gait cycle. Approximately four degrees of <b>pronation</b> and {{supination}} are necessary to enable the foot to propel forward properly. In the neutral position, the foot is neither pronating nor supinating. If the foot is pronating or supinating during the stance phase of the gait cycle when {{it ought to be}} in the neutral position, a biomechanical problem may exist.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that running barefoot can {{decrease}} <b>pronation</b> on the foot’s impact with the ground. This is thought to be because running shoes have extra weight for cushioning at the heel of the shoe, causing the runner to heel-strike more, which in turn results in increased <b>pronation</b> during the step. According to researchers at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, “The least amount of <b>pronation</b> takes place when running barefoot." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pronation</b> and {{supination}} {{refer to}} {{rotation of the}} forearm or foot {{so that in the}} anatomical position the palm or sole is facing anteriorly (supination) or posteriorly (<b>pronation)</b> rotation of the forearm.
