5|$|The rider {{considered}} {{most likely}} to challenge Contador for the general classification was Richie <b>Porte</b> (Sky). <b>Porte</b> had already achieved nine race victories in 2015, including the overall victories in Paris–Nice, the Volta a Catalunya and the Giro del Trentino. <b>Porte</b> {{was expected to be}} particularly strong in the individual time trial, {{as well as in the}} mountains. <b>Porte</b> had not shown consistent form in a Grand Tour in recent years, however, and there were doubts about his ability to maintain his form over a three-week race.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Paris {{region is}} served by a light rail network of nine lines, the tramway: Line T1 runs from Asnières-Gennevilliers to Noisy-le-Sec, line T2 runs from Pont de Bezons to <b>Porte</b> de Versailles, line T3a runs from Pont du Garigliano to <b>Porte</b> de Vincennes, line T3b runs from <b>Porte</b> de Vincennes to <b>Porte</b> de la Chapelle, line T5 runs from Saint-Denis to Garges-Sarcelles, line T6 runs from Châtillon to Viroflay, line T7 runs from Villejuif to Athis-Mons, line T8 runs from Saint-Denis to Épinay-sur-Seine and Villetaneuse, {{all of which are}} {{operated}} by the Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens, and line T4 runs from Bondy RER to Aulnay-sous-Bois, which is operated by the state rail carrier SNCF. Five new light rail lines are currently in various stages of development.|$|E

5|$|Dolmabahçe Palace, {{the seat}} of {{government}} during the late Ottoman period, {{is located in the}} Beşiktaş district on the European shore of the Bosphorus strait, to the north of Beyoğlu. The Sublime <b>Porte</b> (Bâb-ı Âli), which became a metonym for the Ottoman government, was originally used to describe the Imperial Gate (Bâb-ı Hümâyûn) at the outermost courtyard of the Topkapı Palace; but after the 18th century, the Sublime <b>Porte</b> (or simply <b>Porte)</b> began to refer to the gate of the Sadrazamlık (Prime Ministry) compound in the Cağaloğlu quarter near Topkapı Palace, where the offices of the Sadrazam (Grand Vizier) and other Viziers were located, and where foreign diplomats were received. The former village of Ortaköy is situated within Beşiktaş and gives its name to the Ortaköy Mosque on the Bosphorus, near the Bosphorus Bridge. Lining both the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus are the historic yalıs, luxurious chalet mansions built by Ottoman aristocrats and elites as summer homes. Farther inland, outside the city's inner ring road, are Levent and Maslak, Istanbul's main business districts.|$|E

5|$|Stage 11 into L'Aquila {{provided}} for major {{changes to the}} overall standings. More than 50 riders formed the day's escape group, and they quickly took 20 minutes advantage. Among them were Sastre, Wiggins, and 's Richie <b>Porte,</b> who was holding the white jersey as best young rider and, at sixth overall, was the best-placed man in the group. Sastre, Wiggins, and <b>Porte</b> all had multiple support riders {{with them in the}} breakaway who set strenuous paces to keep the group away. The main field, containing the Giro's top favorites, pulled back a little time but was still nearly 13 minutes behind stage winner Evgeni Petrov at the finish. The day's result massively shuffled the overall classification. <b>Porte</b> was the only rider {{who had been in the}} top ten before the stage who remained there afterward, and took the pink jersey.

50|$|It is {{said that}} <b>Portes</b> {{suffered}} from {{the activities of the}} Ottoman pirate Barbarossa, so they built houses without windows, only with doors (<b>portes</b> or πόρτες in Greek) which is the origin of the name of the village. A second explanation is that the name <b>Portes</b> comes from the word porto (i.e. port) since the village has a port from which volcanic material, named Mavropetres, were loaded into ships that sailed to Crete.|$|R

He cleared the patriarchate's debt and sought to increase the provincial representation in the Armenian National Assembly. As the de facto political leader of the Christian Armenian millet {{in the eyes of}} the Sublime <b>Porte,</b> he prepared a detailed report documenting instances of oppression, persecution, and miscarriage of justice in the Armenian provinces and presented the document to the Sublime <b>Porte.</b> Khrimian used the position to advance the interests and conditions of the poor and oppressed provincial Armenians.|$|E
5|$|On Süleyman's {{explicit}} advice, {{a revolutionary}} delegation was dispatched to Istanbul, {{where it was}} to negotiate the movement's official recognition—among the envoys were Bălcescu, Ștefan Golescu, and Dimitrie Bolintineanu. By that moment, Russian diplomats had persuaded the <b>Porte</b> to adopt a more reserved attitude, and to replace Süleyman with a rapporteur for the Divan, Fuat Pasha. In parallel, Russia ordered its troops in Bessarabia to prepare for an intervention over the Prut River and into Bucharest—the prospect of a Russo-Turkish war was inconvenient for Abdülmecid, {{at a time when}} the French Second Republic and the United Kingdom failed to clarify their positions in respect to Ottoman policies. Stratford Canning, the British Ambassador to the <b>Porte,</b> even advised Ottoman officials to intervene against the Revolution, thus serving Prime Minister Palmerston's policy regarding the preservation of Ottoman rule in the face of outside pressures. The Wallachian delegation was denied reception, and, after a prolonged stay, had to return to Bucharest.|$|E
