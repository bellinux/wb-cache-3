25|$|In 1924, Vogt-Mugnier became {{co-editor of}} the Journal für <b>Psychologie</b> und Neurologie (Journal for Psychology and Neurology) {{along with her}} husband.

25|$|Poincaré's famous lectures {{before the}} Société de <b>Psychologie</b> in Paris (published as Science and Hypothesis, The Value of Science, and Science and Method) were cited by Jacques Hadamard {{as the source}} for the idea that {{creativity}} and invention consist of two mental stages, first random combinations of possible solutions to a problem, followed by a critical evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{representative}} study, {{published in}} 1999 by the German Institut für rationale <b>Psychologie,</b> found that about 2/3 of the interviewed women stated {{a desire to}} be at the mercy of their sexual partners from time to time. 69% admitted to fantasies dealing with sexual submissiveness, 42% stated interest in explicit BDSM techniques, 25% in bondage. A 1976 study in the general US population suggests three percent have had positive experiences with Bondage or master-slave roleplaying. Overall 12% of the interviewed females and 18% of the males were willing to try it. A 1990 Kinsey Institute report stated that 5% to 10% of Americans occasionally engage in sexual activities related to BDSM. 11% of men and 17% of women reported trying bondage. Some elements of BDSM have been popularized through increased media coverage since the middle 1990s. Thus both black leather clothing, sexual jewellery such as chains and dominance roleplay appear increasingly outside of BDSM contexts.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} psychology societies was La Société de <b>Psychologie</b> Physiologique in France, which lasted 1885–1893. The first meeting of the International Congress of Psychology took place in Paris, in August 1889, amidst the World's Fair celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. William James {{was one of three}} Americans among the four hundred attendees. The American Psychological Association was founded soon after, in 1892. The International Congress continued to be held, at different locations in Europe, with wider international participation. The Sixth Congress, Geneva 1909, included presentations in Russian, Chinese, and Japanese, as well as Esperanto. After a hiatus for World War I, the Seventh Congress met in Oxford, with substantially greater participation from the war-victorious Anglo-Americans. In 1929, the Congress took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, attended by hundreds of members of the American Psychological Association Tokyo Imperial University led the way in bringing the new psychology to the East, and from Japan these ideas diffused into China.|$|E

2500|$|Dilthey was {{interested}} in psychology. In his work Ideas Concerning a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology (Ideen über eine beschreibende und zergliedernde <b>Psychologie,</b> 1894), he introduced a distinction between explanatory psychology (erklärende Psychologie; also explanative psychology) and descriptive psychology (beschreibende Psychologie; also analytic psychology, zergliedernde Psychologie): in his terminology, explanatory psychology {{is the study of}} psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view, which involves their subordination to a system of causality, while descriptive psychology is a discipline that attempts to explicate how different mental processes converge in the [...] "structural nexus of consciousness." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1977 onwards he did {{research}} among {{followers of}} new religious movements. In 1979 he instigated a European platform of psychologists {{of religion and}} until 1997 he was chairperson of the International Committee of European Psychologists of Religion. [...] In 1992 he became {{a professor in the}} psychology of religion at the university. Van der Lans was involved in the International Association for the Psychology of Religion [...] (German: Internationale Gesellschaft für Religionspsychologie) and as of 1998 part of its executive committee. He was {{also a member of the}} Commission Internationale de <b>Psychologie</b> Religieuse Scientifique.|$|E
2500|$|Recent research, however, {{suggests}} that Nietzsche {{was exposed to}} the works of Kierkegaard through secondary literature. Aside from Brandes, Nietzsche owned and read a copy of Hans Lassen Martensen’s Christliche Ethik (1873) in which Martensen extensively quoted and wrote about Kierkegaard’s individualism in ethics and religion. Nietzsche also read Harald Høffding’s <b>Psychologie</b> in Umrissen auf Grundlage der Erfahrung (ed. 1887) which expounded and critiqued Kierkegaard’s psychology. [...] Thomas Brobjer believes one of the works Nietzsche wrote about Kierkegaard is in Morgenröthe, which was partly written in response to Martensen's work. [...] In one of the passages, Nietzsche wrote: Those moralists, on the other hand, who, {{following in the footsteps}} of Socrates, offer the individual a morality of self-control and temperance as a means to his own advantage, as his personal key to happiness, are the exceptions. [...] Brobjer believes Kierkegaard is one of [...] "those moralists".|$|E
2500|$|Mustafa Kemal {{dealt with}} the {{translation}} of scientific terminology into Turkish. He wanted the Turkish language reform to be methodologically based. Any attempt to [...] "cleanse" [...] the Turkish language of foreign influence without modelling the integral structure of the language was inherently wrong to him. He personally oversaw {{the development of the}} Sun Language Theory (...) , which was a linguistic theory which proposed that all human languages were descendants of one Central Asian primal language. His interest started with the works by the French scientist Hilaire de Barenton titled L'Origine des Langues, des Religions et des Peuples, which postulates that all languages originated from hieroglyphs and cuneiform used by Sumerians, and the paper of Austrian linguist Dr. Hermann F. Kvergić of Vienna titled [...] "La <b>psychologie</b> de quelques elements des langues Turques" [...] ("the psychology of some elements of the Turkic Languages"). He introduced the Sun Language Theory into Turkish political and educational circles in 1935, although he did later correct the more extremist practices.|$|E
2500|$|André Servier, a {{historian}} {{who lived in}} French Algeria {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century, studied the customs and manners of the North African people. He became one of the few French intellectuals to study the Sira of Ibn Ishaq in depth, and his research included the Ottoman Empire and the Panislamic movement. He criticized Islam in his book L’islam et la <b>psychologie</b> du musulman. Servier argued that [...] "Islam is Christianity adapted to Arab mentality," [...] and that it is [...] "incapable of adapting itself to civilization." [...] Similarly, he argued that Islamic law [...] "is only the Roman Code revised and corrected by Arabs," [...] Islamic science [...] "nothing but Greek science interpreted by the Arab brain," [...] and Islamic architecture [...] "a distorted imitation of the Byzantine style." [...] Servier described Islam as [...] "a doctrine of death" [...] and concluded that it had [...] "broken the impulse towards progress and checked the evolution of society" [...] in the Muslim world. As Servier put it: ...|$|E

60|$|If {{any desire}} or {{instinct}} {{leading to an}} action opposed to the good of others still appears, when recalled to mind, as strong as, or stronger than, the social instinct, a man will feel no keen regret at having followed it; but he will be conscious that if his conduct were known to his fellows, it would meet with their disapprobation; and few are so destitute of sympathy as not to feel discomfort when this is realised. If he has no such sympathy, and if his desires leading to bad actions are at the time strong, and when recalled are not over-mastered by the persistent social instincts, and the judgment of others, then he is essentially a bad man (30. Dr. Prosper Despine, in his <b>Psychologie</b> Naturelle, 1868 (tom. i. p. 243; tom. ii. p. 169) gives many curious cases of the worst criminals, who apparently have been entirely destitute of conscience.); and the sole restraining motive left is the fear of punishment, and the conviction {{that in the long}} run it would be best for his own selfish interests to regard the good of others rather than his own.|$|E
