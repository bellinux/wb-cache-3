40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the level of environmental impact and primary energy resulting from demands placed on residential ventilation and heating systems; a conventional residential house built to the 2007 Norwegian building code with a standard heating system was compared against three technology scenarios used in a passive house of the equivalent size. Both houses have wooden framework and cladding and are projected by the Norwegian building company Norbohus. An economical evaluation of the heating systems was also done. The alternative heating option for the conventional house, Stord TEK 07, was based on current Norwegian energy consumption patterns; a combination of electricity and firewood is used to meet heating demand. This heating mix was also modeled as an option for the heating requirements of the passive house, named Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 1. Additionally, a solar collector system (Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 2) and an air-to-water heat pump (Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 3) were modeled for the passive house. Finally, a balanced mechanical ventilation system was evaluated for both buildings. The life-cycle assessment method used was the ReCiPe method and the electricity used in the operation phase was based on the Nordic electricity mix. The results of this study indicate that Stord TEK 07 has the largest emission output in relation to output of CO 2 -eq, presented in the impact category &# 147;Climate change&# 148;. From a life-cycle perspective, the heating system requirements of a Stord TEK 07 house are 47. 5 and 45 percent higher than the renewable energy solutions of <b>passive</b> house scenarios <b>S</b> 2 and S 3, respectively. Total life-cycle primary energy requirements in the Stord TEK 07 house were almost twice that of the renewable solutions in the passive house. Using the Norwegian standard heating system of Stord TEK 07 in a passive house as was done in Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 1, also results in a large improvement; output of CO 2 -eq and use of primary energy was reduced by 34 - 35 percent. Stord TEK 07 has also the highest emission output in most of the other impact categories and the largest present value costs, when building constructing costs are excluded. The heat pump solution, Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 3, has the lowest impact in most categories; however, the solar collector system Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 2, had lower output of CO 2 -eq. Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 2 has also lower present value costs then the air-water heat pump Stord <b>Passive</b> <b>S</b> 3. A balanced ventilation system with 80 percent heat recovery was studied for both the houses. The benefit of heat recovery is recognizable in all the impact categories considered. The energy consumption and potential harmful emissions resulting from the electrical energy used by fans during the life cycle far exceed the environmental impacts that result from manufacture and transportation of the ventilation unit. The study revealed that the heat-recovery system must have efficiency greater than 15 percent to achieve reduction concerning output of CO 2 -eq and use of primary energy for Stord TEK 07; this requirement increases to 42 percent in houses built to the passive house standard house, Stord Passive. </p...|$|R

This system can reduce the consumption of system resources drastically, therefore fluent WAV broadcast can be guaranteed.

The ARM chipset of the LPC 2300 series is applied in this system, therefore, system’s reliability can be improved.

The macroscopic examination resulted from a literature review, project team brainstorming meetings, and input from the Federal Transit Administration. Several dozen issues were identified and were grouped into nine categories that formed the basis of the survey: intergovernmental and inter-organizational; intra-transit property; political; public relations and marketing; funding and finance; labor; safety and liability; planning and land use; and the physical environment. The survey was administered to members of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Bus</b> Rapid Transit Consortium and several Canadian BRT systems. Survey responses were analyzed to discern those issues that were deemed {{to be the most important}} and most difficult to resolve overall and with respect to distinct BRT system operational settings, respondents' organizational affiliation, and professional experience. In addition, those issues for whom the respondents were most unfamiliar as well as new issues identified by respondents were also examined. Recommendations for resolving the issues based on respondents' views are also presented. Finally, a closer examination of the findings from the perspective of the three California BRT systems was conducted to assess the state's BRT systems. Overall, the following issues were deemed the most important and most difficult to resolve: Local and business community opposition to the removal of/restrictions on parking spaces for BRT use; Availability and acquisition of right-of-way or physical space; Integration of multiple priorities, objectives, and agendas; Concerns over long term funding commitments to BRT; Impacts of BRT on roadway operations; Finding political champions to support BRT; Gaining community support for transit-oriented development; Educating the public on BRT, and managing perceptions and expectations. Valuable insight has been gained into the institutional issues of bus rapid transit that are actually experienced. Key Words: bus rapid transit, institutional issues, surve...|$|R

We first define lexical choice as the choice of open-class lexical items (whether phrasal patterns or individual words) appropriate to express the content units of the utterance being generated in a given situation of enunciation. We then distinguish between five major classes of constraints on lexical choice: grammatical, inter-lexical, encyclopedic, interpersonal and discursive. For each class we review how they have been represented and used in existing generators.
