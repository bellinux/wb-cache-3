30|$|Besides, for the {{research}} of <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> simulation, Huang [10] employees Exodus V 4.06 and Smartfire V 4.1 to simulate the evacuation under different risks in one metro station in Shanghai. Wang and Chen [11] use any logic to study the influence on evacuation time in different <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> simulation scenarios. Liu and Wu [12] use Simulex to carry out evacuation simulation analysis of fires. The object of researches [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] is <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> simulation inside the station, which does not combine with <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> simulation outside the station; therefore, these integrations are not proposed. In addition, {{in the event of}} disruption of rail link, traffic management plan shall consider the impact on background traffic, so traffic management plan evaluation needs to analyze comprehensive influence on traffic outside the station. In view of the above analysis, it need further research that how to combine simulation and comprehensive evaluation to evaluate traffic management plan.|$|R

40|$|The term Evacuability (<b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> {{performance}} capability) {{entails a}} wide range of capabilities encompassing evaluation of evacuation time, identification of potential bottlenecks, assessment of accommodation module layout, life saving appliances, passenger familiarisation with a ship’s environment, crew training, effective evacuation procedures/strategies, intelligent decision support systems for crisis management and design/modification for ease of evacuation. From a technical point of view, the mass evacuation of thousands of people from an extremely complex environment with unknown inaccessibility problems exacerbated by (potentially co-existing) incidents such as progressive flooding, cargo shift, foundering, fire/smoke and the inherent uncertainty deriving from unpredictability of human behaviour, is a problem with severe modelling difficulties at system, procedural and behavioural levels. In this respect, Evacuability represents a risk measure of <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> at sea, expressed as an index. Addressing the above, this paper focuses on the development of a <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> simulation model developed by SSRC in collaboration with Deltamarin, RCI and Color Line. Code-named Evi (Evacuability index), it represents the state-of-the-art computer simulation-based capability for the prediction of <b>passenger</b> mustering and <b>evacuation</b> whilst accounting realistically for human and ship behaviour in a sea environment. Unlike earlier models, Evi has been developed from the outset fo...|$|R

40|$|Unlike earlier models, Evi {{has been}} {{developed}} from the outset for application to passenger ships in a sea environment, targeting the largest cruise liners and ROPAX. Utilising an advanced evacuation simulation tool, code-named Evi (Evacuability index), it is the main target of the <b>Passenger</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Group of the SSRC to develop a risk-based framework to support a systematic analysis of <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> risk at sea for given pertinent (fire/smoke, flooding, stranding) scenarios, environment, passenger distribution and demographics {{in a way that}} allows for interaction and iteration to address risk prevention/reduction through passive (design) and active (operation) means to ascertain a priory that ALL people on board can be evacuated.

TWA 427 was cleared by ground control to taxi to runway 30R by crossing runway 30L then down taxiway P to the end. After receiving permission to take off, the copilot initiated the takeoff roll. When the captain called 80 knots an off-duty crewmember in the jumpseat yelled, [...] "There's an airplane!"

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a system for}} multi-agent simulation for <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> in case of the inclination of a ship under the storm. Evacuation process depends on many different factors such as environmental properties (e. g. wind velocity, intensity of waves), human behavioral aspects and so on. In order to describe passengers’ behavior in case of emergency evacuation considering the inclination of a ship, we applied a force-based model adapted from multi-agent system. Our approach provides an opportunity to estimate evacuation time depending on intensity of waves, rate of sailing and relative direction. Our proposed model can be coupled with the simulation of ship flooding or fire propagation. Having analyzed the results, these outputs {{could be applied to}} design contingency plans to assist the crew members in the frameworks of decision support systems (DSS) ...|$|R

In this paper, an agent-based microscopic evacuation model—CityFlow-M has been introduced by a <b>passenger</b> ship <b>evacuation</b> case, and then validated using data sets from a semi-unannounced assembly trail at sea, which consists of passenger response times, starting locations, ending areas as well as the arrival times in the assembling stations.

The transportation of passengers in water has also made a rapid development. It is expected that ships will be more and more widely used. Unfortunately, ship disasters occurred in these years caused serious losses. It raised the concern on effectiveness of <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> on ships. The present study thus focuses on pedestrian evacuation features on ships. On ships, passenger movements are affected by the periodical water motion and thus are quite different from the characteristic when walking on static horizontal floor. Taking into consideration of this special feature, an agent-based pedestrian model is formulized and the effect of ship swaying on pedestrian evacuation efficiency is investigated.

50|$|The use of {{overwing}} exits in a ditching {{varies from}} airline to airline but are generally a secondary (not primary) means of escape. On aircraft fitted with overwing exits, there is typically a raised escape rope bracket (about {{a third of}} the way from the door) attached to the wing's upper surface and typically painted yellow. This is accompanied by an escape rope found in the frame of the exit after opening the hatch. Once this rope is attached to the escape rope bracket, it will aid <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> onto the wing to await rescue or to enter the water (depending on the airline's procedures). On aircraft with life rafts to be launched via the overwing exit, the wing will be used to provide a boarding platform onto the life raft. On certain regional aircraft, the overwing exits are the only escape route in the event of a ditching.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{pedestrian}} evacuation {{model is}} presented, {{in which the}} social force model and a mathematical model are incorporated. The social force model is capable of describing the pedestrian behavior realistically under the non-panic evacuation situations.

Furthermore, different simulation scenarios on <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> from the platform of the Xizhimen Metro station in Beijing are carried out to validate the feasibility of the proposed method and to further evaluate the influence of evacuees’ number and pedestrian distribution on <b>evacuation</b> efficiency when <b>passenger</b> panic is spreading...|$|R

Used in the space shuttle, the material does not "outgas" until it begins to char making it safer than current materials with respect to toxic fumes. The polyimide {{can be made in}} two forms: a resilient foam and a rigid foam.

40|$|Efficient {{calculation}} on <b>passenger</b> <b>evacuation</b> performances under emergencies {{is crucial}} to the planning, design, and operation of metro systems as it is closely related to the safety of human lives. Four calculation methodologies including the China CDM, NFPA 130, control volume, and M/G/c/c models and a multiagent-based simulation approach are employed to calculate the evacuation time under a given number of evacuees in different application backgrounds by investigating impact factors and strategies of evacuation as well as moving speed of evacuees. The M/G/c/c model and multiagent-based simulation approach are also used to identify the bottleneck of evacuation in metro stations. A case study for the Xizhimen metro station in Beijing is carried out to validate the effectiveness of these methodologies to planners, designers, and operators in practice. The results show that the former two methodologies are concise quantitative methods while the latter ones are more capable of assessing the whole process and details of evacuation...|$|R
