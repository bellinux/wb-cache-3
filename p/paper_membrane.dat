In the current analysis, two different models (I-shaped and V-shaped) were used to perform the FSI simulation. In microvalve modeling, {{in order to reduce}} external actuator usage, interconnections are made between two similar microvalves. This typical interconnection creates a pressure distribution in a local environment. Furthermore, to differentiate the volume factor in a microvalve, a length/width (L/W) ratio term was used. Compared with higher- and lower-L/W-ratio models, the higher-L/W model eventually initiates more deflection in a low-pressure regime than the lower-L/W-ratio model. FSI simulations were performed for 4 μL/min, 6 μL/min, 8 μL/min, 10 μL/min, and 12 μL/min flow rates against membrane behavior, and performance evaluations of the microvalves were conducted. It was observed during an FSI simulation that the gate pressure applied to the lower surface deflects the membrane upward, thereby making contact with the wall.

40|$|From {{experiments}} on such membranes as apple skin, parchment <b>paper</b> <b>membrane,</b> and a membrane of completely dry collodion, {{results have been}} obtained which could be interpreted by the assumption that these membranes are less permeable for anions than for cations. In parchment paper {{there is only a}} relative diminution of the mobility of the anions, in the apple skin and in the dry collodion membrane there is practically no permeability for anions at all. The theory is developed which explains how the decrease or complete lack of mobility of anions influences the electromotive effects of the membrane and the diffusibility of electrolytes across a membrane. The results of the theory are compared with the experimental results. In membranes impermeable for anions the permeability for cations gives the same order of cations as for the mobilities in a free aqueous solution. But the differences of the mobilities are enormously magnified, e. g. the mobilities of H• and Li•, which are in the proportion of about 1 : 10 in aqueous solution, are in proportion of about 1 : 900 in the collodion membrane. The general cause for the retardation of ionic mobility within the membrane may be supposed to be the increased friction of the water envelope dragged along by the ion in the capillary canals of the membrane. The difference of the effect on the cations and on the anions may be attributed to the electric charge of the walls of the canals...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{demonstrated}} a multistep 2 -dimensional paper network immunoassay based on controlled rehydration of patterned, dried reagents. Previous work {{has shown that}} signal enhancement improves the limit of detection in 2 -dimensional paper network assays, but until now, reagents have only been included as wet or dried in separate conjugate pads placed at the upstream end of the assay device. Wet reagents are not ideal for point-of-care because they must be refrigerated and typically limit automation and require more user steps. Conjugate pads allow drying but do not offer any control of the reagent distribution upon rehydration and can {{be a source of}} error when pads do not contact the assay membrane uniformly. Furthermore, each reagent is dried on a separate pad, increasing the fabrication complexity when implementing multistep assays that require several different reagents. Conversely, our novel method allows for consistent, controlled rehydration from patterned reagent storage depots directly within the <b>paper</b> <b>membrane.</b> In this assay demonstration, four separate reagents were patterned in different regions of the assay device: a gold-antibody conjugate used for antigen detection and three different signal enhancement components that must not be mixed until immediately before use.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} <b>paper.</b> <b>Membrane</b> and {{microfluidic}} devices are new routes for controllable production of multiple emulsions with uniformly sized drops and accurate {{control of the}} internal drop structure. Membrane emulsification involves injecting single emulsion through a porous membrane into continuous phase in a stirred cell or cross-flow membrane module. In this work an alternative method to generate shear at the membrane surface was applied, based on the low frequency oscillation of the membrane at 10 - 90 Hz in a direction perpendicular to {{the flow of the}} injected phase. The advantage of oscillating membrane technique is that the risk of the drop breakage in the continuous phase is minimal, because the shear is generated only at the membrane surface. The oscillation signal was provided by an audio generator which fed a power amplifier driving the electro-mechanical oscillator on which the inlet manifold was mounted. The membrane was a microsieve-type membrane with regular pore spacing formed by Ni electroforming. At the constant maximal shear stress at the membrane surface the mean size of oil globules in W/O/W emulsions decreased with increasing the amplitude of oscillation. The most narrow drop size distribution with a span of 0. 36 was obtained at 70 Hz and the peak amplitude of about 0. 4 mm. A disadvantage of membrane emulsification is that the internal drop structure cannot be accurately controlled. Microfluidic devices with co-axial glass microcapillaries developed in Weitz Lab have been found convenient for controllable generation of both core-shell drops and multiple emulsion drops with a controlled number of inner drops in the outer drop. In this work core-shell drops with a size between 50 and 150 μm have been produced at the production rate ranging from 1, 000 to 10, 000 drops/s. The shell thickness was accurately controlled by adjusting the ratio of the middle fluid flow rate to the inner fluid flow rate and the drop size decreased with increasing the outer fluid flow rate...|$|E

However, the traditional treatment of black liquor is not economically viable for the small-scale kraft paper mills in India that uses waste agricultural products as raw material to produce brown <b>paper.</b> <b>Membrane</b> ultrafiltration treatment has been advocated by many scholars as a possible alternative treatment method for black liquor, and this study attempts to address industrial concerns on the cost-effectiveness of membranes for black liquor concentration and treatment. Utilizing a cross-flow hollow fiber membrane module in a recirculation system operating under constant pressure, black liquor is recirculated through the system {{over an extended period}} of time to observe the quantity and quality of the lignin in the concentrate and the permeate, and how they vary over time. Additionally, the permeate flux rate change over time is also observed to determine the required frequency of cleaning membranes from reversible fouling of membranes, as well as the frequency to replace membranes due to irreversible fouling. Cost of cleaning and changing membranes, as well as the profit gained from lignin retained can be estimated and compared with literature to determine the cost-effectiveness of ultrafiltration membranes in treating black liquor. Experimental results suggest that operating at a pressure of 207 kPa and a cross-flow velocity of 1. 06 m/s, the average permeate flux of black liquor is 7 - 21 LMH when concentrating lignin in black liquor from a concentration of 38 g/L to 185 g/L, which compares favorably to literature results. However, a membrane cleaning frequency of every 4 to 6 hours and an estimated membrane lifetime of several weeks, predicted by experimental results, significantly raises the cost of cleaning and changing membranes in comparison to the commonly estimated membrane cleaning frequency of once per day and lifetime of 1. 5 year in literature. The permeate lignin concentration, which increased up to 40 g/L at the end of a concentration cycle, would also decrease the profit gained from reusing the permeate stream in the cooking process. The increased cost factors associated with both intense membrane fouling and the need for permeate stream retreatment require to be addressed in future research, in order to more comprehensively evaluate membrane filtration process as a cost-effective alternative for treating black liquor. by Xiaoyuan "Charlene" Ren.
