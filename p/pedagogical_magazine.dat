In 1877, he became inspector for the province's Romanian-language primary schools. In 1880, he was elected a member of the city council, and from 1890 headed the local museum. He was involved in promoting the establishment of Romanian schools in the villages, including the province's first kindergartens, and the drafting of textbooks. From 1873, he edited Bukowinaer Pädagogische Blätter, the province's first <b>pedagogical</b> <b>magazine,</b> which advocated on behalf of Romanian schools and teachers. In addition to textbooks, his writings include pedagogical and historical works; some were published, while others remain in manuscript.|$|E
50|$|In 1932 {{he was the}} {{director}} of a <b>pedagogical</b> <b>magazine</b> Escuela del Trabajo (School of Work), published by A.T.E.O. (Ourense Teachers Association), of which he was president. The magazine had a successful two-year run, with twenty-six published editions, and caused an authentic revolution within the education system, which was anchored in the old methods of the time. Nuñez imposed on this system a distinctively technical and pedagogical character, rejecting the old methods of memorisation and excessive intellectualism completely. He introduced methods from the new school, based on the latest pedagogical doctrines, and worked tentatively, yet steadily towards their establishment. It {{was the beginning of the}} introduction of new pedagogical techniques to schools in Ourense, and Nuñez was the central figure in this change (Montessori, Kerschensteiner, Ovide Decroly, Dewey, Cousinet, etc.).|$|E
40|$|The paper reconstructs {{the main}} tendencies of the Italian {{educational}} thought using the academic pedagogical magazines as {{a mirror of}} the scientific and political developments through the years. Whereas many were the pedagogical and school journals in the XIXth century, written by teachers and educationalists, aimed at ameliorating teachers’ culture and also at defending their economic rights, the first academic journals came out only {{at the beginning of}} the XXth century: directed by famous professors of general pedagogy, they were the expressions of the late Positivism, of Herbartism and of Neo-Idealism. Fascism then gradually closed or extinguished the independent journals. After the Second world war no academic <b>pedagogical</b> <b>magazine</b> existed. The ones that were set up between 1946 and 1955 are still living. They were expressions of the pedagogical tendencies of the time: the Catholic Rassegna di pedagogia of Giuseppe Flores D’Arcais, Pedagogia e vita of Mario Casotti and the Salesian Orientamenti pedagogici; the lay Scuola e città of Ernesto Codignola, which published and commented Dewey’s articles; Riforma della Scuola, the <b>pedagogical</b> <b>magazine</b> of the Communist Party. They published learned articles on epistemology, school policy, didactics and history of education and they were the arena of relevant scientific disputes and of battles on school policy, particularly about the teaching of religion and the statute of private schools and about the Reform of compulsory middle school (1962) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{reconstruct}} the main strands of Italian educational thought using academic <b>pedagogical</b> <b>magazines</b> as a mirror for scientific and political developments through the years. I shall follow a chronological order, indicating the main changes which have occurred in Italy since its unification, concentrating on cultural turns and academic shifts. <b>Pedagogical</b> and school <b>magazines</b> have been the object of {{quite a number of}} extensive historical works, followed by other studies on school and educational publishing houses. Giorgio Chiosso has been the leading figure in this research for many years, having directed national projects in pedagogical journals and publishing houses, which have provided important historical tools, such as the catalogues of Italian school and educational magazines 1820 - 1945 (Chiosso, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1997) and the catalogues of Italian pedagogical publishing houses in the XIX and XX centuries (Chiosso, 2003 a, 2008). Whilst the <b>pedagogical</b> <b>magazines</b> before and after unification have been carefully catalogued, the educational journals of Republican Italy have yet to be researched. An updated short biography and bibliography of the quoted educationalists {{can be found in the}} recent biographical dictionary directed by Chiosso and Sani (2013) ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{shows the}} first {{results of a}} {{research}} that is in progress about the magazine ESCOLA from publisher Abril. It´s a short-lived magazine: 27 copies from october, 1971 to april, 1974. The first edition was number 0, and number 1 was published some months later, in March, 1972, and then, it was published monthly up to its last copy (n. 26). At this time, many editions showed prospectus {{that would be used}} for the construction of two books: the Book of reformation (october, 1971 to june, 1972) and Helpful resources for teaching (between november, 1973 and april, 1974). In the first copy the magazine is shown as dialogue and co-operative instrument with elementary teacher as the first <b>pedagogical</b> <b>magazine</b> that was created with the resources of journalism, with journalistic form at the service of pedagogical contents. In this production, this publication is known as a specific kind of press that has two strategies of cultural interference: editorial interference that assumes pedagogical knowledge by means of the journalistic pattern, to increase the market of publisher Abril products; as interference in the educational field, by publishing, organizing, and prescribing the necessary actions for the accomplishment of reformation. In this perspective, one can analyze the main resources the magazine used, emphasizing the ones that remain during its existence and planned the editorial form that was used. ESCOLA is also related to the history that publisher Abril has constructed on its trajectory in this period...|$|E

In this sense, we focus an national context (Portugal) and a specifically historical period (last decades of the century). The primary sources were the <b>pedagogical</b> <b>magazines,</b> that was used as strategical vehicule of scientific knowledge difusion, teacher education and improvement of pedagogical experts powerty. The cientificist perspective, refered to Spencer s positivist model of science, characterized the magazine. Into this perspective, is possible to identify the epistemological references of the cientific discourses about the individual development, that changed during the period. If in the first numbers of the vehicule, Comtes historical perspective of understanding the individual development was central, gradually lost its importance. The higienism, recorring to the concept of race to understand and quantificate the fisiological characters of the students turned {{to be the most important}} knowledge about the individual developmet, racially defined.

40|$|The {{theme of}} my thesis is the {{patriotic}} pedagogue Josef Věnceslav Soukup (1819 - 1882) whose life {{was full of}} feverish activity in the educational system. Moreover he was a prolific author of textbooks (one of his famous is The Technological Natural History) and musical works - we can mention his Wreath of fine songs which includes the song Wayfarer that is known for today. In music he paid attention to carols and Christmas songs and plays as well (the most famous is The Young Shephers of Bethlehem). J. V. Soukup excelled in almost every field, not only in pedagogy and music but also in drawing (he even taught Mikoláš Aleš, the well-known Czech painter), chemistry, technology and cultivation of plants. Moreover he contributed to many <b>pedagogical</b> <b>magazines.</b> The beginnins of his teacher's career were not easy, he strained for an appropriate position {{and during that time}} he had hardly anything to eat. He gave private lessons for food and played in pubs with the band of musicians to earn some money. However, as really hardworking and diligent student he got stipendium and thus he had not have any financial problems since that time. He knew K. S. Amerling (a great pedagogue who participated in the efforts of a higher girls' education) whose lectures he attended and was influenced by his philosophy. Josef Věnceslav [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A edição no. 1377, de abril de 2013, marca o início de uma nova fase {{editorial}} da Placar. Neste trabalho, debruçamos sobre as 12 primeiras edições dessa nova fase, investigando a produtividade da revista na construção de um discurso sobre a mulher no futebol. Para isso, aproximamo-nos dos Estudos Culturais pós-estruturalistas. Optamos por esse referencial por ele fornecer instrumentos que permitam reconhecer o caráter pedagógico da revista. Isso implica compreender que a forma como ela veicula suas informações e conhecimentos, o modo como organiza as narrativas, o que valoriza ou ignora, “ensina” sobre o esporte, institui uma forma de conhecê-lo e vivenciá-lo. A análise das revistas nos indica que, no que diz respeito à representação da mulher no futebol, nada mudou. A presença feminina no futebol continua marginal, quase invisível. Referências às mulheres são raras, quase sempre em uma situação específica: como esposa, namorada ou affaire. Nesse caso, ou se exalta o companheirismo que há entre os casais, ou a mulher é apresentada como uma façanha, uma conquista do atleta. A prática do futebol por mulheres só aparece uma vez. Mesmo assim, trata-se de um ensaio fotográfico onde garotas disputam uma partida de “altinha”. Neste caso, a prática do jogo parece ser um mero pretexto para exibir os corpos das jogadoras. Concluímos que ao ignorar a presença feminina, a revista contribui para que o futebol seja tratado como um assunto exclusivamente masculino. The issue no. 1377, of April of 2013, {{marks the}} beginning of a new editorial phase of Placar. In this work, we look at the first 12 editions of this new phase, investigating the magazine's productivity in the construction of a discourse about women in the football. For that, we approach post-structuralist cultural studies. We have chosen this referential because it provides instruments that allow us to recognize the <b>pedagogical</b> nature of <b>magazine.</b> This implies to understand that the way in which it carries its information and knowledge, how it organizes narratives, what it values or ignores, "teaches" about sport, institutes a way of knowing and experiencing it. The analysis of the magazines shows us that, with regard to the representation of women in football, nothing has changed. The female presence in football remains marginal, almost invisible. References to women are rare, almost always in a specific situation: as wife, girlfriend or affair. In that case, either the exuberance of the companionship between the couples, or the woman is presented as a feat, an achievement of the athlete. The practice of women's football only appears once. Even so, it is a photographic essay where girls compete a game of "altinha". In this case, the practice of the game seems to be a mere pretext to display the bodies of the players. We conclude that by ignoring the female presence, the magazine contributes to the fact that football is treated as an exclusively male issue...|$|R
