As they chat, Nealon asks whether Pat has a biological clock; Siobhan says, [...] "I think you'd make {{a really great}} moth... fath... role model," [...] but Pat tells them about a dysfunctional family and unhappy childhood. Hartman makes the next attempt: [...] "Pat, {{would you say that}} you are more like your mother or your father?", but they reply, [...] "I'm a perfect combination of both!" [...] One of their estranged parents (Kirstie Alley), also androgynous and named Francis or Frances, comes into the party; when Nealon asks about Pat's birth, again there are only ambiguous answers, as well as the parent saying [...] "I had to be both mother and father to you ever since (Jean or Gene) ran off with...that thing".

500|$|<b>Phil</b> <b>Hogan</b> of Fine Gael, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, {{attacked}} Martin McGuinness {{claiming that}} US multinational companies would be [...] "appalled" [...] if Martin McGuinness were elected and {{foreign direct investment}} would drop. This {{was followed by a}} tweet made by Government Chief Whip Paul Kehoe which claimed that McGuinness profited from the Northern Bank robbery. This was in response to a pledge made by McGuinness to only take the average industrial wage, if elected President. McGuinness dismissed both charges as [...] "black propaganda". It was reported in The Irish Times that Fine Gael's [...] "strategy of levelling strongly worded accusations at Mr McGuinness was part of a drive to motivate party voters to come out in support of Mr Mitchell in the October 27th election".|$|E
500|$|Several {{other critics}} praised {{the way that}} the film had kept the tone of James's story and the subtle {{approach}} to horror. This subtlety, according to a review in the Western Morning News, hit [...] "exactly the right note of terror", and the film was praised as genuinely scary by some critics. Whittaker, though generally critical of the film, felt it strongest when focussed on the house, children and ghosts. Paul Whitelaw, writing in The Scotsman, commended Welch and Fywell for sustaining a horrific atmosphere, and noted that the soundtrack added to the horror. For him, even the use of horror clichés was effective, contributing to the film's atmosphere. The Guardians <b>Phil</b> <b>Hogan</b> expressed a contrary opinion: while he thought The Turn of the Screw [...] "exquisitely turned out", he felt the film's use of clichés limited {{the extent to which it}} was actually scary. In a review for The Leader-Post, Andy Cooper praised the [...] "creepy atmosphere" [...] and tension, but said that the film [...] " [...] short in the chills department" [...] and [...] "could have done with a few jolts of terror to breathe more life into it".|$|E

2500|$|Fine Gael is seen {{as being}} a {{constitutional}} party, with members and public representatives always showing considerable deference to the institutional organs of the Irish state.

He also stated that the character of Agnes Towler was [...] "the heart of the show". Benjamin Secher from The Daily Telegraph said that Mr Selfridge is a [...] "less cosy, more charismatic" [...] production of The Paradise. A [...] "sumptuous, frothy drama" [...] and [...] "entertaining spectacle", but ultimately Secher did not believe the story. MSN critic Dan Owen branded it [...] "sumptuous Sunday evening viewing". He thought the [...] "wonderful" [...] sets and costumes were better than those featured in fellow period drama Downton Abbey.|$|E
