5|$|Pork steaks are {{generally}} {{cut from the}} shoulder of the pig, but can also be cut from the loin or leg of the pig. Shoulder steaks are cut from the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, <b>pork</b> <b>shoulder</b> steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{barbecue}} restaurants {{may offer}} dishes that are slow-smoked or barbecued over a grill. Fare includes barbecue sandwiches, brisket, barbecue chicken, pulled pork, <b>pork</b> <b>shoulder,</b> pork ribs, beef ribs, beefsteak and other foods. Various side dishes are typically available, such as baked beans, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and {{corn on the}} cob, among others. A variety of barbecue sauces may be available, and some barbecue restaurants bottle their own sauces for customer purchase. Some barbecue restaurants prepare their foods without any sauces, and may not offer any as condiments. This may occur per a preference for {{the flavor of the}} meats to stand on their own, rather than being accentuated with flavors from sauces. Some barbecue restaurants use a dry spice rub to flavor meats.|$|E

Harrod explained [...] "Turnips don't deserve their unloved image, {{they add}} a wonderful freshness to a dish." [...] The {{signature of the}} restaurant is a suckling pig themed dish, incorporating a <b>pork</b> <b>shoulder</b> which is cooked over two days in a bain-marie, served with shallot and mugwort. This {{is accompanied by a}} croquette made from pig's head and a pork cutlet with celeriac, pear, sorrel and cauliflower mushrooms.

2500|$|A culinary {{staple of}} North Carolina is pork barbecue. There are strong {{regional}} differences and rivalries over the sauces and methods used {{in making the}} barbecue. The common trend across Western North Carolina {{is the use of}} premium grade Boston butt. Western North Carolina pork barbecue uses a tomato-based sauce, and only the <b>pork</b> <b>shoulder</b> (dark meat) is used. Western North Carolina barbecue is commonly referred to as Lexington barbecue after the Piedmont Triad town of Lexington, home of the Lexington Barbecue Festival, which attracts over 100,000 visitors each October. [...] Eastern North Carolina pork barbecue uses a vinegar-and-red-pepper-based sauce and the [...] "whole hog" [...] is cooked, thus integrating both white and dark meat.|$|E
2500|$|The Lexington {{style of}} {{barbecue}} (occasionally {{referred to as}} Piedmont style) uses a vinegar-based [...] "red" [...] sauce that is seasoned with ketchup, vinegar, and pepper, along with other spices that vary from recipe to recipe. [...] It is most common in the Piedmont (central) and western areas of the state. [...] This style uses only the <b>pork</b> <b>shoulder</b> section of the pig. [...] As with other styles of barbecue, the recipes vary widely, and can include many different ingredients, and range from slightly sweet to hot and spicy. [...] The sauce also serves as the seasoning base for [...] "red slaw" [...] (also called [...] "barbecue slaw"), which is coleslaw made by using Lexington-style barbecue sauce in place of mayonnaise.|$|E
2500|$|Spam was {{introduced}} by Hormel in 1937. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America states that the product was intended to increase the sale of <b>pork</b> <b>shoulder</b> which {{was not a very}} popular cut. Ken Daigneau, brother of a company executive, won a $100 prize that year in a competition to name the new item. Hormel claims that the meaning of the name [...] "is known by only a small circle of former Hormel Foods executives", but popular beliefs are that the name is an abbreviation of [...] "spiced ham", [...] "spare meat", or [...] "shoulders of pork and ham". Another popular explanation is that Spam is an acronym standing for [...] "Specially Processed American Meat" [...] or [...] "Specially Processed Army Meat".|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} characterise and to assess the quality of ripened sausages produced from different raw materials. Samples were prepared using the same production technology, starting from <b>pork</b> <b>shoulders</b> from extensively versus intensively reared animals. Chemical, sensory, and microbiological analyses were performed. The results obtained showed that the sausages made from extensively reared pigs showed a significantly higher moisture content and higher scores for red intensity and global flavour. Microbiological analyses showed {{no significant difference between}} the two kinds of sausage. Contents of lactic acid bacteria and Micrococcaceae were high in both cases...|$|R
50|$|Indirect {{grilling}} is {{a barbecue}} cooking technique {{in which the}} food is placed {{to the side of}} or above the heat source instead of directly over the flame as is more common. This can be achieved by igniting only some burners on a gas barbecue or by piling coals to one side of a charcoal pit. A drip tray is placed below the food to prevent fat from the food igniting and generating a direct flame. Indirect grilling is designed to cook larger (e.g. <b>pork</b> <b>shoulders,</b> whole chicken) or tougher foods (e.g. brisket, ribs) that would burn if cooked using a direct flame. This method of cooking generates a more moderate temperature (about 275-350 °F) and allows for an easier introduction of wood smoke for flavoring.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to assess the actual degree of oxidative degradation of the lipid fraction of 30 -day-ripened sausages using both commonly used investigations and nonconventional means, such as the high-performance size-exclusion chromatography analysis of polar compounds. Sausages made from <b>pork</b> <b>shoulders</b> from extensive and intensive pig rearing were considered. The obtained results showed {{a high degree of}} primary oxidative degradation of the sausage lipid fraction, as evidenced by oxidized triacylglyrerol and peroxide values, while a low secondary oxidation of fats was found, as evidenced by triacylglycerol oligopolymers and 2 -tiobarbituric acid test values. Moreover, the degree of oxidative degradation did not show any significant difference between the two types of sausage, although the samples prepared from extensively reared pigs, as compared with those from intensively reared pigs, showed significantly (p < 0. 001) higher contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids and significantly (p < 0. 01) lower amounts of saturated fatty acids...|$|R
2500|$|Galician cuisine often uses {{fish and}} shellfish. The {{empanada}} is a meat or fish pie, with a bread-like base, top and crust with the meat or fish filling usually {{being in a}} tomato sauce including onions and garlic. Caldo galego is a hearty soup whose main ingredients are potatoes and a local vegetable named grelo (Broccoli rabe). The latter is also employed in Lacón con grelos, a typical carnival dish, consisting of <b>pork</b> <b>shoulder</b> boiled with grelos, potatoes and chorizo. Centolla {{is the equivalent of}} king crab. It is prepared by being boiled alive, having its main body opened like a shell, and then having its innards mixed vigorously. Another popular dish is octopus, boiled (traditionally in a copper pot) and served in a wooden plate, cut into small pieces and laced with olive oil, sea salt and pimentón (Spanish paprika). This dish is called Pulpo a la gallega or in Galician [...] "Polbo á Feira", which roughly translates as [...] "Galician-style Octopus". There are several regional varieties of cheese. The best-known one is the so-called tetilla, named after its breast-like shape. Other highly regarded varieties include the San Simón cheese from Vilalba and the creamy cheese produced in the Arzúa-Ulloa area. A classical dessert is filloas, crêpe-like pancakes made with flour, broth or milk, and eggs. When cooked at a pig slaughter festival, they may also contain the animal's blood. A famous almond cake called Tarta de Santiago (St. James' cake) is a Galician sweet speciality mainly produced in Santiago de Compostela and all around Galicia.|$|E

50|$|Prices {{of related}} goods: For {{purposes}} of supply analysis related goods refer to goods from which inputs are derived {{to be used}} in the production of the primary good. For example, Spam is made from <b>pork</b> <b>shoulders</b> and ham. Both are derived from pigs. Therefore pigs would be considered a related good to Spam. In this case the relationship would be negative or inverse. If the price of pigs goes up the supply of Spam would decrease (supply curve shifts left) because the cost of production would have increased. A related good may also be a good that can be produced with the firm's existing factors of production. For example, suppose that a firm produces leather belts, and that the firm's managers learn that leather pouches for smartphones are more profitable than belts. The firm might reduce its production of belts and begin production of cell phone pouches based on this information. Finally, a change in the price of a joint product will affect supply. For example beef products and anani sikim leather are joint products. If a company runs both a beef processing operation and a tannery an increase in the price of steaks would mean that more cattle are processed which would increase the supply of leather.|$|R
50|$|Pulled <b>pork,</b> usually <b>shoulder</b> cut (sometimes {{referred}} to as mixed cuts), is commonly slow-cooked by a smoking method, though a non-barbecue method might also be employed using a slow cooker or a domestic oven. In rural areas across the United States, either a pig roast/whole hog, mixed cuts of the pig/hog, or the shoulder cut (Boston Butt) alone are commonly used, and the pork is served {{with or without a}} vinegar-based sauce. Before cooking, it is common to soak the meat in brine; it provides the extra moisture needed for a long, slow cooking process.|$|R
