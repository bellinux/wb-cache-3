5000|$|Aesthetic value, {{immediate}} usability {{and highly}} randomized results are often {{factors in the}} process of successfully bending electronics. Although the history of electronic music is often associated with unconventional sonic results, such innovators as Robert Moog and LÃ©on Theremin were electrical engineers, and more concerned with the consistency and sound design of their instruments. Circuit bending is typified by inconsistencies in instruments built in an unscientific manner. While many pre-fitted circuit bent machines are on offer for sale at auction sites such as eBay, this somewhat contravenes the intention of most practitioners. Machines bent to a repeated configuration are more analogous to the well known practice of [...] "mods", such as the Devilfish mod for the Roland TB-303, the famous Speak and Spell toys or various Analogman or Pedaldoc guitar <b>pedal</b> <b>circuit</b> modifications.|$|E
50|$|East has {{endorsed}} Yamaha instruments since 1981 and developed his own custom 5-string signature model in 1994, the BBNE (modeled after his early 1980s BB5000 5-string bass). The 2nd and current Nathan East signature bass, the BBNE2 {{was released in}} 2001, though Nathan can be seen playing the original prototype as early as 2000. The original prototype has a solid Gotoh bridge where as the production model has the Yamaha BPZ-7 bridge which features individual, machined saddles that provide more precise intonation and clarity. The BBNE2 bass has a slightly smaller body than the BBNE as well as neck-thru construction where the BBNE was a bolt-on. The BBNE2 appears to be heavily influenced by Nathan's late 1980s custom black Yamaha LB-1 Motion 5-string bass. The BBNE2's electronics feature a custom preamp with a three band eq that includes the NE-1 (eq <b>pedal)</b> <b>circuit</b> built in with its own level control and on/off switch. The NE-1 circuit is a parametric mid control that allows the user to specifically target midrange frequencies to cut. The BBNE2's control switches for the on-board NE-1 have been confused for a piezo circuit by many people due to its resemblance to early piezo equipped TRBP models. The BBNE2 is available in both solid white or solid black finishes with gold hardware and an ebony fingerboard. Yamaha also released {{a small number of}} white BBNE2 basses that included all black hardware, this model was called the BBNE2 Artist model.|$|E
50|$|BJFE pedals are {{enclosed}} in a 110x60x30mm chassis, in an ELFA K-430 enclosure for most <b>pedals..</b> The <b>circuit</b> boards are wrapped in neoprene, {{which is a}} kind of rubber used in diving suits and capable of withstanding heat, water, and other fluids as well as to provide cushion for the electronic components inside. The circuit board is also sealed to provide protection, and to preserve trade secrets.|$|R
50|$|Diagonal split {{systems were}} used {{initially}} on American Motors automobiles in the 1967 production year. The right front and left rear {{are served by}} one actuating piston while the left front and the right rear are served, exclusively, by a second actuating piston (both pistons pressurize their respective coupled lines from a single foot <b>pedal).</b> If either <b>circuit</b> fails, the other, {{with at least one}} front wheel braking (the front brakes provide most of the braking force, due to weight transfer), remains intact to stop the mechanically damaged vehicle. By the 1970s, diagonally split systems had become common among automobiles sold in the United States. This system was developed with front-wheel-drive cars' suspension design to maintain better control and stability during a system failure.|$|R
