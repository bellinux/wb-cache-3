40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{diversification}} and <b>pluriactivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>farmers</b> and farming households has been increasing in EU- 27 countries. But the type of diver-sification activity encouraged, {{as well as their}} scale, appears to be very different across the EU. Therefore the analysis of spatial diversification of other gainful activity of farm households in EU countries is the main purpose of this paper. 27 UE coun-tries described with 9 variables relating to the non-agricultural activity of farms are the analysed objects. The carried survey helps to show spatial disparities and to discriminate groups of countries with a similar farmers non-agricultural activity. There were used chosen methods of multidimensional comparative analysis which enable clustering the multicriterial objects: Czekanowskis diagram, Wards method, and k-mean algorithm. As a final result there were formed 5 clusters with countries about similar level of farm diversification. It may be stated, that a development of diversifica-tion of agricultural holdings is correlated with a spatial arrangement. Neighbouring countries belong to the same clusters of other gainful activity kinds.

40|$|This {{article will}} only try to {{understand}} the role of these cultural elements on the development and the maintenance of the agricultural activity. Describing the word « culture », the dictionary « Petit Robert » gives as one of its definitions : « a complex of forms of behaviour acquired Human Society ». Applying this to the Aosta Valley, I would describe it as a totality of behaviours deriving from a relationship, or rather from a communion, necessarily closely tied between nature (sometimes hostile), the animal (in particular the cow) and Man. Nature and the cow have made a deep mark on Man and he has developed and grown inside this mutual exchange, reciprocal influence and interaction. Interviews. The elements, or cultural values, dealt with in this article and largely based on the interviews made in the agricultural world are the following : - Passion for cows (« love » for cattle). - Love of the countryside. - Love for well performed work. - Feeling of freedom in farming. - Love and maintenance of family property. - Pride in presenting a high-quality product. - Family unity and cooperation. Another aspect of the interview included the origin or the transmission of these value. Where is the source of these values ? And at what moment and by whom have they been transmitted (family education, social environment, school) ? A third aspect of the interview considered the role of fairs or traditional gatherings in maintaining and developing these agricultural values. By fairs or traditional gatherings we mean : - « Combats de reines « (cow fighting). - Competitions of various types. - Grape festival, Apple festival. - Clubs or folklore groups. - Traditional games : « tzan », « fiolet », « re- batta ». The interview included questions on the financial profitability, public assistance and also propositions for agricultural policies. This interview was carried out on a test group of approximately forty people, obviously including cattle breeders (whether alpine pasturers or not), vine-growers, fruit-growers, keeping in mind the <b>pluriactivity</b> <b>of</b> these <b>farmers.</b> A small sample of 18 / 19 year-old students, the sons and daughters <b>of</b> <b>farmers,</b> was also chosen. Results : The results reveal the fundamental importance of cultural elements in the choice of farming as a profession. In most cases, the efficiency element is absolutely not sufficient in justifying farming as a vocation. The « passion » for cows, taste for work and well-farmed land, feeling of freedom, love and maintenance of the family property, pride in presenting a personal product and a high-quality product are prevailing. In transmitting these values, the family environment and, to a lesser extent, the social environment, assume capital importance. Partly in contradiction with our predictions, the traditional fairs are, for the farmer, important occasions for cultural exchange and a notable stimulus; it would therefore be a great shame not to support them.

On the one hand, there is increasing uncertainty as to which agronomic systems and practices can enable farmers to integrate environmental and food safety issues e. g. pesticide use reduction, and to secure the economic performance of their farms. On the other hand, European agriculture is still characterised by a huge structural diversity in terms of farm size, level of specialisation or diversification, <b>pluriactivity</b> <b>of</b> agricultural households, etc. Such farm diversity generates {{a need for a}} variety of adapted technical solutions even when famers are confronted with a similar problem, e. g. how to cope with the diversification of crop rotation constraints. Thus, it is crucial to provide the diverse groups <b>of</b> <b>farmers</b> with empirical evidence on the effectiveness of alternative practices in their specific context of production. This article merges debates on the investments needed to produce relevant and robust evidence with those concerning the ongoing transformation induced by the privatisation of agricultural extension systems. It argues that if networking and brokering are key elements of the functioning of these systems, stronger attention should be given to back-office activities e. g. technology monitoring, training advisors, and production, collection and storage of technical knowledge...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to identify}} the specific characteristics of small farms in developed countries and {{the factors that influence}} their survival and growth. Using the case of France, we employ statistical and econometric analysis of data from the Farm Structure Survey ("N" = 70, 000) for the period 2000 - 2007. The principal findings suggest that small farms are no more likely than other farms to employ "alternative" strategies to the predominant model of increasing farm size, nor are they more likely to diversify on-farm activities or operate under quality-labeled production systems, with the notable exception of organic agriculture. However, where small farms do adopt or practice these activities, they are seen to have a favorable effect in ensuring their survival and growth. In contrast, we are unable to conclude that <b>pluriactivity</b> <b>of</b> farm households has a positive impact on the survival of small enterprises. The effect of geographical location on small farms is largely expressed in their concentration in mountainous or disadvantaged regions. Overall, the trajectory of small farms is marked by farm exit, principally as the result <b>of</b> <b>farmers</b> retiring {{at the end of their}} careers. The small farm sector is also revitalized by both larger farms declining and thus being reclassified as small farms, as well as the progressive entry into agriculture of small farm holders whose income was previously derived largely off-farm.

40|$|Abstract – Multifunctionality of {{agriculture}} (MFA) {{has become a}} key issue on the European Agenda {{as well as in}} WTO talks. In this paper, we compare two dif-ferent EU NUTS 3 areas (UKM 41 and AT 322) to evalu-ate the extent to which multiple functions of agricul-ture are linked to <b>pluriactivity</b> <b>of</b> farms and farm households. The paper presents some initial results from the FP 6 project TOP-MARD and highlights one aspect of MFA which is particularly relevant for the two study areas compared. The comparison highlights structural differences and similarities of the chosen areas and gives some indication as to how pluriactiv-ity and MFA are linked. The comparison shows that the prevalence <b>of</b> on-farm <b>pluriactivity</b> is linked with extensive on-farm production and low on-farm in-comes. On the other hand, high regional economic importance of nature-based tourism is often but not always an indicator of high MFA. ...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{business}} ownership {{has become}} an important theme within the small firms research literature. While early studies emphasised its role in reducing business risk, more recently portfolio entrepreneurship has been recognised as an important growth strategy, particularly in sectors where economies of scale can be achieved at a relatively low level. Research studies specifically examining multiple business ownership are still scarce, but the parallels between portfolio entrepreneurship in non-farm sectors and farm pluriactivity have been noted. Although pluriactivity has been subject to extensive investigation in recent years, analysis has generally focused on farm-centred diversification, rather than the wider entrepreneurial activities <b>of</b> the <b>farmer.</b> Using a survey of nearly 300 farm owners in Cambridgeshire, this exploratory study analyses the incidence of portfolio entrepreneurship in the farm sector and assesses its contribution to enterprise and employment creation. The results demonstrate that a core <b>of</b> <b>farmers</b> have multiple business interests and that these additional business activities make a substantial contribution to both numbers of enterprises and employment creation. While previous studies <b>of</b> <b>pluriactivity</b> have generally used the farm business as the main unit of analysis, {{it is argued that}} including the wider business activities of the farm owner enables a more precise estimation of the total contribution <b>of</b> <b>farmers</b> to rural economic development...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the recent {{evolution}} of Romanian small farms. As a result of complex historic process the category of subsistence and semi-subsistence farms is well represented within Romanian Farm structure (Mathijs and al., 2004; Giruca and al., 2006). The recent data collected by the General Census and Farm Structure surveys gave some signs of the recent evolution. We focus specifically on the smallest categories and try to differentiate their evolution among different factors. Farm survival and Farm growth literature is abundant and focuses especially on initial farm size, specialisation or <b>pluriactivity</b> <b>of</b> the farm (Weiss, 1999). In contrast, the role of localization, linked to historical background or physical constraints, as a factor is more limited in the literature. Other institutional factors such as inheritance and succession have not really been approached until now. We choose to investigate those factors using a multiple regression on the 3 recent data collections in Romania.
