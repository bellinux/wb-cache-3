5|$|Contracts {{were signed}} at Spring's tavern {{and it was}} {{arranged}} for the fight to take place at Hanslope, Buckinghamshire. But as a vast crowd of spectators began <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> Hanslope the venue was switched {{at the last minute}} to Salcey Green, just inside Northamptonshire, thus rendering the Buckinghamshire constables powerless to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|As {{the press}} conference had been {{broadcast}} live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at the Berlin Wall demanding that the guards open the gates. The border guards were unable to contact their superiors for instructions and, fearing a stampede, opened the gates. The iconic scenes that followed– people <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> West Berlin, standing on the Wall and attacking it with pickaxes– were broadcast worldwide.|$|E
5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not have a public address system– and told them to go to the Boat Deck.|$|E

5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of the ROK 6th Infantry Division and the ROK 10th Infantry Regiment from the ROK 8th Infantry Division, the ROK II Corps was devastated, and {{effectively}} ceased to be an organized fighting force. This meant the right flank of the US Eighth Army was completely open to the Chinese forces, which were now advancing south to overwhelm the UN forces. Exploiting the situation, the Chinese launched another attack on the now exposed Eighth Army center, resulting in {{the loss of}} the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment and the US 8th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of Unsan. With the Chinese forces <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> the rear of the UN lines, the Eighth Army was forced to retreat to the Ch'ongch'on River. Only the stubborn defense of Kunu-ri by the US 5th Regimental Combat Team and the ROK 7th Infantry Division on November 4 managed to stop the Chinese advance and prevented a disastrous defeat for the Eighth Army. By November 5, logistics difficulties forced the Chinese to end the First Phase Campaign.|$|E
5|$|With the {{new orders}} on November 28, the US 5th Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division left Kunu-ri {{to rejoin the}} {{division}} to the northeast of Sunchon. With the US 5th Cavalry Regiment absent and the 8th Cavalry Regiment still recovering from devastating losses from the battle at Unsan, Major General Hobart Gay of the US 1st Cavalry Division placed the US 7th Cavalry Regiment {{to the south of}} Pukchang-ni, behind the remnants of the ROK 6th Infantry Division. Lacking reinforcements, the ROK 6th Infantry Division was quickly routed by the PVA 42nd Corps on the night of November 28. Chinese forces then attacked the 7th Cavalry Regiment under the cover of the fleeing Korean soldiers and refugees <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> the American front. Under Gay's order, the 7th Cavalry Regiment withdrew southwest to the town of Sinchang-ni on the morning of November 29, and the Chinese resumed the drive southward. A fierce battle between the PVA 125th Division and the 7th Cavalry Regiment broke out during the night of November 29, but by the morning of November 30 the PVA 42nd Corps' advance was halted.|$|E
