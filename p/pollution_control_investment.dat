Based on {{the essence}} {{principles}} of Input-Output analysis, Econometrics methods, Extended Lin-earity Expense Systems (ELES) and the Many Elements Linearity Regress Forecasting model (MELRF), the paper built the Environmental and Economic Computable (EEC) Model for middle-long term forecasting, {{which is the}} integrated models of environmental and economic Input-Output model and Macro-econometrics models and include 38 industrial sectors. Using the EEC model and the econometrics software of Eviews, the paper simulated and analyzed these scenario problems as follows: (1) <b>Pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>investment</b> and its running cost act on the primary indicators of national economic, such as GDP, urban consumption, county consumption, capital asserts, etc. (2) Energy consumption amounts act on the main indicators of national economic. By the integrated model and analysis, we can research on the relationships among economic de-velopment, economic structure changing and environment pollution in quantity. We can also research on the influence which technology progress acts on environment, and environmental <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>investment</b> act on economic development. Thus, we may constitute the middle-long term targets of national economic development and environment protection, and provide science evidences for the decision and implementation of national economic development and environmental security strategies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Environmental {{problems}} have been obstacles hindering the countries and regions healthy development. How to scientifically and efficiently use the relatively limited fund to control environmental pollution problem is significant. Based {{on the model of}} DEA, this paper builds the evaluation index system of environmental pollution treatment investment to analyze environment <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>investment</b> efficiency. Results show that the main factor leading to the poor government efficiency is not the mount of money, but the unreasonable capital utilization. Nationwide 31 provinces and cities analysis data in China shows that the total investment waste reaches 1. 97342 trillion yuan and the gap of emissions of three wastes including waste gas, waste water, solid waste between actual quantity and the ideal target quantity is respectively 26. 49738 billion tons, 16. 17551 billion tons and 26. 49738 billion tons.

30|$|The {{empirical}} analysis provides {{support for}} the hypotheses developed in Linking Supply Chain Uncertainty to Environmental Management section. While supply chain uncertainty has a limited impact {{on the level of}} resources devoted to environmental management (“the size of the pie”), it has {{an important role in the}} allocation of these resources (“how the pie is shared”). In particular, organizations with higher supply chain uncertainty taking the form of unreliable supplier performance (i.e., lots quality and delivery) or unpredictable demand, are likely to favor structural investment that are more peripheral in nature such as remediation projects, end-of-pipe technologies, or proper discharging mechanisms. Supply chain uncertainty as a contextual variable might explain the observed bias for <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>investments</b> and expenditures found in Canadian macro data presented in the introduction.|$|R
40|$|Advocates {{claim that}} {{voluntary}} programs can help shore up poorly performing command-and-control environmental regulation in developing countries. Although literature {{on this issue}} is quite thin, research on voluntary environmental programs in industrialized countries suggests that they are often ineffective because they mainly attract relatively clean plants free-riding on prior <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>investments.</b> We use plant-level data on some 59, 000 facilities to identify the drivers {{of participation in the}} ISO 14001 certification program in Mexico. We find that regulatory fines spur certification: on average, a fine roughly doubles the likelihood of certification for three years. Hence, the program attracts dirty firms and at least has the potential to improve environmental performance. We also find that plants that sold their goods in overseas markets, used imported inputs, were relatively large, and were in certain sectors and states {{were more likely to be}} certified. voluntary environmental regulation, duration analysis, Mexico...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: While the environments of {{more and}} more Chinese cities are {{becoming}} less polluted following successful introduction of pollution control and environment renovation measures in recent years, more attention is now being given to the livability of cities. However, these successes are often not quantifiable and are not universally recognized. Based on a survey of globallyrecognized urban livability indices and their monitoring systems, the paper is to develop and agree with the government counterparts on a verifiable and measurable environmental livability index system targeting the PRC cities, and find a suitable approach for investment assessments in reaching the benchmarks, i. e. the costs of producing changes in environmental livability. With the Chinese Environmental Liveability Index System developed in the paper, environmental performance of 33 Chinese cities were ranked and the environmental challenges of these cities are identified with the further Pressure-State-Response analysis and trend analysis. With a comprehensive analysis with the trends of long-term environmental livability and the <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>investment</b> of Chinese cities, more effective and aim-oriented incentives and investment policies for urban environmental livability improvement are put forward in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 134 - 147. Pollution control {{regulations}} {{directed at}} the land-based factories of the Southern African fish processing industry {{do not appear to}} promote the required level of investment in pollution control systems. Two self-administered mail-questionnaires comprising undisguised fixed-alternative and open-ended questions were constructed to survey the opinions and viewpoints of a census consisting of twenty-seven senior managers responsible for making pollution control investments in the demersal and pelagic sectors of the fish processing industry. The first questionnaire was directed at establishing the relative importance of factors that influence waste and <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>investment</b> decisions as well as the perceptions and preferences of managers with regard to various pollution control policy options. Descriptive statistics such as the modal class were used to summarize the distribution of opinions and viewpoints within the research population. Rank ordered preference data was analyzed using a multidimensional unfolding computer algorithm. This structural multivariate statistical method is a special case of non-metric multidimensional scaling that generates perceptual maps which can aid in the discovery of the hidden structure underlying multidimensional decisions. Investments in waste and pollution control do not appear to have a high priority when compared to other strategic investments that the fish processing industry managers may make. The relative importance of factors that could influence the managers of the industry to invest in waste control equipment appear to be determined by the perceived financial returns that can be expected from such investments. Findings suggest that pollution control legislation is rendered ineffective due to inadequate enforcement. However, it appears that existing legislation needs to be rationalized in order to facilitate compliance. The most favoured pollution control instruments were those that lowered the cost of legally mandated expenses such as subsidies and income tax allowances. These were followed by permit systems which specified the allowable characteristics of discharges while allowing individual companies freedom of choice as to the method of achieving compliance. The second questionnaire was used to verify the researcher's interpretation of the findings and preliminary conclusions drawn from the replies to the first questionnaire...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sets up a}} model using {{stochastic}} {{dynamic programming}} to analyze <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> decisions. Environmental decision making is characterized by both uncertainty and irreversibility: Uncertainty {{might be related to}} future costs and benefits of adopting a particular control policy. Irreversibility may arise when investments in abatement capital are irreversible, or when environmental damage becomes irreversible at a certain point in time. Under such circumstances, the question of the optimal timing of <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> arises. This paper shows that: (1) Increases in the uncertainty of future control benefits lead to a lower current degree of <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> if <b>investment</b> in <b>control</b> facilities is irreversible, (2) ignoring the possibility of new information in the future leads to a higher level of control than it is optimal, and (3) the possibility of a major catastrophe may result in a lower optimal degree of <b>pollution</b> <b>control.</b> ...|$|R
