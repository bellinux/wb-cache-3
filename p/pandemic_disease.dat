Pupils' knowledge and attitudes are quite good and students are able to voice their opinion. Females have better knowledge than males and older students are better too. The thesis is further focusing on how are the infectious diseases included in the National Curriculum and examine the prevention programmes for schools.

50|$|Another {{potential}} drawback of thorough standardization is {{a threat}} analogous to monoculture (where lack of biodiversity creates higher risk of <b>pandemic</b> <b>disease)</b> or a ship without bulkhead compartmentalization (where even a small hull leak threatens the whole vessel). If an enemy discovers a drawback in a standardized system, the system's uniformity leaves it vulnerable to complete incapacitation via what might otherwise have been a limited compromise. Also, if standardization promotes use by allies, it may also ease an enemy's task of using materiel that is lost as a prize of war. However, this threat is somewhat academic, as even poorly standardized materiel presents a likelihood of supplying an enemy if overrun.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Pandemic</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{extremely}} infectious <b>disease</b> outbreaks. <b>Pandemic</b> viruses can easily spread worldwide within months, or weeks, and to cause infections in all age groups. There {{is a need}} for appropriate control measures to hinder the spread of such infectious diseases. One of the most effective ways of controlling the spread of infectious diseases is early detection of its onset at pointsof-entry to decrease introduction and spread of the pandemic. Observation of spatial and non-spatial patterns of disease spread necessitates good analysis and visualization of data related to such pandemic outbreaks. In this project, modeling the available real-life data into time-and collocation based sequence of events to observe patterns for disease spread, has been done since it is the pre-requisite for the visualization of such data.

5000|$|The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREPA), {{passed by}} the United States Congress and {{signed into law by}} President of the United States George W.

PREPA strengthens and consolidates the oversight of litigation against pharmaceutical companies under the purview of the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).
