40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{research on}} <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{and provides a}} bibliography. (<b>Product</b> <b>characteristics</b> are objective properties of products.) Its purpose is to facilitate and encourage further research on the economics of <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Study of <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> is relevant to various problems: quality, grades, standards, product differentiation, and technological change, among others. The report presents a model of consumer behavior and a model of firm behavior, both of which lead to three hypotheses, (a) Price paid for a product equals {{the sum of the}} monetary values of the <b>product’s</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Monetary value of each <b>characteristic</b> of a <b>product</b> equals the product’s marginal yield of the characteristic multiplied by the marginal implicit price paid for the characteristic. (b) Demand for a product is a function of product prices and <b>product</b> <b>characteristics,</b> (c) Total demand for a characteristic depends upon prices of <b>products</b> containing that <b>characteristic,</b> or, alternatively, upon prices of <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Statistical studies that bear on these three hypotheses are summarized. Linear programming models of blending operations also are used to derive the hypotheses. Results of applying one of the programming models to corn-blending operations are used in an evaluation of com grades. Work on accuracy of pricing of live slaughter cattle and hogs is reported.

40|$|Background : Due {{to current}} market globalization, a single {{electronic}} product {{such as the}} iPhone is used by many users worldwide. However, the ways that consumers perceive products cannot be necessarily the same because consumers belong to their own inherent culture and individual characteristics. Recently, the electronics industry has realized the importance of local and personal influences of product perception. Nonetheless, there have been very few studies on how individual characteristics may influence perceived <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Personality has been recognized as a representative variable of individual characteristics. Therefore, this exploratory study investigates how user personality {{can make a difference}} in the perception of <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Methods : The iPhone was selected among various popular electronic products as a target product. A questionnaire survey and interview were conducted to discover the correlation between user personality traits and perceived <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Twenty Dutch iPhone users participated in the study. Results : The overall results indicate that there is a relationship between user personality traits and perceived <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Each personality trait showed a significant correlation with the perception of particular <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> However, function did not show a significant correlation. Conclusion : The personality traits of the user influenced the perception of <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Therefore, it is imperative to figure out how the personality of the user correlates with particular <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> while increasing user satisfaction. These findings can provide designers a better understanding of how <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> are differently perceived, depending on particular user personality traits, and help designers map the design direction of their target user group. clos...|$|R

In the case of embedded software, engineers at companies that undertake outsourced work must possess not only knowledge of software developed by the outsourcer but also technical information and knowledge regarding hardware <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> that can only be acquired from the same client. This accumulation of firm-specific knowledge and information occurs on a continual basis, and is necessary for this type of outsourcing business.

40|$|The food {{industry}} is a complex supply chain, where {{the path of a}} specific food product may vary and the supply chains within the {{food industry}} may have different structures from each other. Another important characteristic of the food industry is the high frequency of new product introductions; this increases choice for consumers and initiates uncertainty related to product issues such as high product failure rates, short product life cycles and high inventory holding costs. Consequently, {{it is important to understand}} <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> as a source of supply chain uncertainty, how they can be managed and the resulting impact on performance. This paper presents a review of the available literature on supply chain uncertainty and related fields, highlights that although <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> has been identified as a source of uncertainty, insufficient empirical evidence has been presented. Multi-case study research, using semi-structured interviews, has been conducted across a group of inter-related companies in the food industry in Indonesia to investigate the role of <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> in creating uncertainty. The result of analysis helps to refine the concept and provides a basis for detecting and managing <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> uncertainty, critical in the current competitive context...|$|E
40|$|When {{screening}} {{a production}} process for nonconforming items {{the objective is}} to improve the average outgoing quality level. Due to measurement errors specification limits cannot be checked directly and hence test limits are required, which meet some given requirement, here given by a prescribed bound on the consumer loss. Classical test limits are based on normality, both for the <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> and for the measurement error. In practice, often nonnormality occurs for the <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{as well as for the}} measurement error. Recently, nonnormality of the <b>product</b> <b>characteristic</b> has been investigated. In this paper attention is focussed on the measurement error. Firstly, it is shown that nonnormality can lead to serious failure of the test limit. New test limits are therefore derived, which have the desired robustness property: a small loss under normality and a large gain in case of nonnormality when compared to the normal test limit. Monte Carlo results illustrate that the asymptotic theory is in agreement with moderate sample behaviour...|$|E

The characteristics {{can be identified}} and models can be formed about them. However, {{there is no single}} model that could be applied to every purchase situation to fully explain the influence of different <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Research that has investigated the effects of innovation characteristics has generally endorsed evaluating the innovations along the dimensions of relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, observability and complexity. Additional <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> have arisen to complement the comprehension of innovation adoption. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify, which characteristics of an innovative product influence potential consumers´ buying decision. In order to do this, the study reviewed theories and models about the <b>product</b> <b>characteristics.</b> An empirical research was conducted via theme interviews and a mail survey. The respondents and interviewees were consumers, who were potential users of the Nokia 9110 Communicator. The Nokia 9110 Communicator was selected to be the studied device. It is an innovative product that combines both a mobile phone and a personal digital assistant (PDA). The study applied the knowledge gained from theory with the information gained from the empirical research to form a framework for the <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a communicator product. The traditional framework of the innovation characteristics has enjoyed wide acceptance within marketing. This study suggests that the conceptualisation of perceived innovation characteristics may not be equally appropriate when considering a communicator product. The results of this study provide evidence suggesting that the suitability of the previous models about the <b>product</b> <b>characteristics</b> should be re-evaluated when investigating a communicator product. The identification of communicator characteristics in this study offers several implications. The results call for attention to the fact that consumer may employ discrepant sets of characteristics to evaluate the acceptability of a communicator product.

In the second stage, if the product space is continuous and the functional form of utility is known then there exists an inversion between the consumer’s choices and her preference parameters. This inversion can be used to recover the distribution of random coecients nonparametri-cally. For the more common case when the set of products is nite, we use the revealed preference conditions from the hedonic model to develop a Gibbs sampling estimator for the distribution of random coecients.
