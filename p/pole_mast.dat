5|$|The ships {{initially}} {{carried a}} <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> above the conning tower, though shortly after commissioning, both ships had lattice masts added aft, and in 1910, the forward masts were also replaced with lattice masts.|$|E
5|$|A Type 271 surface {{search radar}} {{replaced}} the fire-control director and rangefinder above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added {{at the top}} of the foremast. A High frequency direction finding system was added on a <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> aft. The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and aft, and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun amidships was also removed, but the number of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E
5|$|In early 1924, Florida {{took part}} in the Fleet Problem III maneuvers, where she and her sister Utah acted as stand-ins for the new s. In June 1924, Florida was taken out of service for a {{modernization}} at the Boston Navy Yard, which lasted from 1 April 1925 to 1 November 1926. During the reconstruction, her deck armor was strengthened and anti-torpedo blisters were installed to increase her resistance to underwater damage. Her secondary battery was rearranged to improve its efficiency, and four of her 5-inch guns, which were mounted in sponsons, were removed. She was also reboilered with four White-Forster oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and battlecruisers scrapped {{as a result of the}} Washington Naval Treaty. Her Parsons turbines were replaced with new Curtis geared turbines and her two funnels were trunked into one stack. The rear lattice mast was replaced with a <b>pole</b> <b>mast,</b> which was moved further aft. Her two submerged torpedo tubes were also removed.|$|E
50|$|She had {{a single}} funnel, a cruiser stern and two <b>pole</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a <b>pole</b> <b>mast,</b> not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
25|$|Recommissioned 8 September 1951, {{she cleared}} San Diego on 4 January 1952 {{for her new}} home port, Newport, Rhode Island. In September 1952 she entered Dry Dock #1 in the Boston Navy Yard {{for the first of}} four major {{overhauls}} she would undergo in this shipyard. At this time the ship was updated to its current configuration. Two Hedgehog anti-submarine (ASW) launchers and two torpedo carriages for the Mark 32 torpedo were added, with one 21 inch (533 mm) quintuple torpedo tube mount removed. Also, four 40 mm Bofors twin mounts were replaced by two quadruple mounts. The forward <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> was replaced by a tripod mast to accommodate improved radar and electronics systems. Local operations and refresher training in the Caribbean preceded a period of antisubmarine exercises off Florida from 7 May to 12 June 1953. Her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean took place from 16 September to 30 November 1953. After another period of local operations, and exercises in the Caribbean Sea early in 1954, she cleared Newport on 3 May for a round-the-world cruise, which included exercises with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific, patrols off Korea, and good-will visits to Far Eastern and Mediterranean ports. She returned to Newport on 28 November 1954. Her operations from that time until 1960 included training exercises in the Caribbean and off the eastern seaboard as well as tours of duty in the Mediterranean in 1956, winter 1956-57, and 1959, and a round of visits to ports of northern Europe in 1958. During that last overseas deployment an issue was discovered with her rudder that put her into dry dock in France. At that point the repair costs outweighed retaining the aging ship. On 6 February 1960 she arrived at Norfolk Naval Shipyard to be decommissioned because of that. The ship was put into long-term storage at the Philadelphia Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility 29 April 1960.|$|E
500|$|The {{two ships}} were modernized in 1925–27; among the {{improvements}} were {{the addition of}} torpedo bulges, which were designed to increase resistance to underwater damage—this widened the ships to [...] The ships also had their rear lattice masts removed and replaced with a <b>pole</b> <b>mast.</b> A catapult for launching aircraft was mounted on the number 3 gun turret.|$|E
50|$|All {{ships of}} the class were built with three masts and a barquentine rig of sails. Trent had her rig reduced {{to a pair of}} <b>pole</b> <b>masts</b> in 1892.|$|R
50|$|The masts and sails {{were removed}} {{after four years}} in service, and {{replaced}} by simple <b>pole</b> <b>masts</b> for carrying signal flags and circular fighting tops, platforms carrying quick firing guns.|$|R
50|$|The Amur-class {{ships were}} 300 ft long at the waterline; {{they had a}} beam of 41 ft and a draft of 18 ft. They had two <b>pole</b> <b>masts</b> and a ram bow.|$|R

They were {{designed}} for a standard displacement of , and a full-load displacement of [...] However, neither completed ship reached this weight, displacing [...] and , respectively. The ships featured two distinctive raked funnels, a tripod foremast, and a small tower and <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> aft. In 1943, light tripods were added forward of the second funnel on each ship, and a prominent Naval director was installed aft.|$|E
500|$|Pietro Micca was [...] long between perpendiculars {{and had a}} beam of [...] and {{an average}} draft of [...] She {{displaced}} [...] normally and [...] at full load. The ship had an iron-built hull with a flat bottom. Much of the ship's internal space was reserved for propulsion system and coal storage, with only the forward quarter reserved for crew spaces and stores. The ship had a very minimalist superstructure, with a small conning tower and a single <b>pole</b> <b>mast.</b> She had a crew of 73officers and men.|$|E
500|$|She {{was fitted}} with a fore and main <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> with {{spotting}} tops to aid her gunnery. The ship had a crew of 13officers and 289enlisted men. She carried {{a number of small}} boats, including one picket boat, one pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy. Gefion was , rolled badly, and made severe leeway, and her decks were wet in a head sea. She nevertheless maneuvered well and had a tight turning radius. She had a metacentric height of [...] Steering was controlled by a single rudder.|$|E
25|$|All {{ships of}} the class were built with three masts and a barquentine rig of sails. Surviving members {{of the class}} had their sailing rig {{replaced}} by a pair of <b>pole</b> <b>masts</b> in the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|Tripod masts were predated by <b>pole</b> <b>masts</b> and {{lightweight}} lattice masts, {{a system}} which used an array of thin columns at angles, crossing {{each other in a}} double helical spiral configuration in a form of hyperboloid structure. The US Navy favoured the lattice mast which they used on their first battleships in 1906. The Royal Navy preferred <b>pole</b> or tripod <b>masts.</b>|$|R
500|$|She had a {{freeboard}} of only [...] and her deck {{was often}} awash in {{any sort of}} moderate sea. Smerch rolled heavily and was fitted with three telescoping iron <b>pole</b> <b>masts,</b> probably fore-and-aft rigged, {{that were used to}} steady the ship rather than for propulsion.|$|R
500|$|Brennus was [...] long between perpendiculars, {{and had a}} beam of [...] and a {{draft of}} [...] She had a {{displacement}} of [...] As built, the ship was significantly overweight, and her draft was [...] greater than intended, without a full load of ammunition. Most of her armored belt was submerged. Her superstructure had to be cut down and her mainmast, {{intended to be a}} fighting mast, had to be replaced with a lighter <b>pole</b> <b>mast.</b> Unlike most battleships of the period, she was built without a ram bow. Brennus had a crew of 673 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
500|$|The {{ships were}} [...] long between perpendiculars {{and had a}} beam of [...] and a {{full-load}} draft of [...] République displaced [...] at full load, and Patrie displaced slightly more, [...] at full load. The ships were built with a tall forecastle deck that extended {{all the way to}} the mainmast. République and Patrie retained a small fighting mast for the foremast, but had a lighter <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> for the mainmast. They had a crew of between 766 and 825 officers and enlisted men. The ships had a metacentric height of , and were equipped with bilge keels to increase their stability.|$|E
500|$|While under repair {{after being}} torpedoed in January 1942, Saratoga {{received}} a [...] bulge on {{the starboard side}} of her hull. This was primarily intended to increase the ship's buoyancy, improve stability and allow her full fuel capacity to be utilized. The bulge was estimated to increase her metacentric height by [...] and decrease her speed by one-quarter of a knot. It was also used to store additional fuel oil and increased her capacity {{to a total of}} [...] At the same time, her funnel was shortened by [...] and her tripod foremast was replaced by a light <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> to reduce her topweight.|$|E
50|$|Some navies {{considered}} {{lattice masts}} for their ships. Following {{their experience with}} the Andrei Pervozvannys, the Russians initially designed the four s with lattice masts, but constructed with pole ones. The German Imperial Navy designed its first battlecruiser, , with lattice masts, but she was instead completed with <b>pole</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|R
500|$|Tiger was [...] long at the {{waterline}} and [...] long overall. She had {{a beam of}} [...] and a draft of [...] on a displacement of [...] Her crew numbered 13officers and 175men, though this later decreased {{to a total of}} 177officers and men. She was fitted with two <b>pole</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other sources {{indicate}} that ulin wood {{is often used}} for marine constructions such as pilings, wharfs, docks, sluices, dams, ships, bridges, but also used for power line <b>poles,</b> <b>masts,</b> roof shingles and house posts and to a minor extent as frame, board, heavy duty flooring, railway sleepers, fencing material, furniture etc.|$|R
500|$|The Project 26 class {{ships were}} [...] long overall. They had {{a beam of}} [...] and at full load a draft of [...] They {{displaced}} [...] at standard load, and [...] at full load. Their single rudder meant {{that they were not}} very maneuverable. Kirov and Voroshilov were fitted with a massive quadruped foremast, but this proved to restrict the view from the conning tower as well as the fields of fire of the 100mm anti-aircraft guns and greatly increased their silhouette. It was reduced to a simple <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> in the later ships and the superstructure enlarged to accommodate the fire control facilities formerly housed in the foremast.|$|E
500|$|In 1935, {{the ship}} had an {{aircraft}} catapult installed, along with cranes to handle float planes. A <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> was also installed on the rear side of the aft funnel. Köln continued {{to serve as a}} training ship until early 1936, when she was transferred to fishery protection duty. Later that year, she joined the non-intervention patrols off Spain during the Spanish Civil War. After the German heavy cruiser [...] was attacked by Republican bombers in the so-called [...] "Deutschland incident", Köln transported wounded crew members from Deutschland back to Germany. Köln conducted a further four patrols off Spain before returning to fishery protection in the North Sea in 1938. Late in the year, she went into drydock for a refit in Kiel.|$|E
500|$|Mississippi {{was heavily}} modernized {{in the early}} 1930s. Her {{original}} turbines were replaced with new geared models manufactured by Westinghouse, and she received six express boilers designed by the Bureau of Engineering. This improved her performance to {{a top speed of}} [...] from [...] Her armament was also revised, with the main battery turrets being modified to allow elevation to 30degrees, greatly extending the range of the guns. Two of the 5-inch guns were removed, and eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed. She received an additional [...] armored deck, and her underwater protection was improved. Both lattice masts were removed; a heavy tower bridge was built in place of the fore mast, and a light <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> was erected in place of the main mast. These alterations greatly increased her displacement, to [...] standard and [...] full load. Her crew increased significantly, to 1,443.|$|E
500|$|Sankt Georg was [...] long at the {{waterline}} and was [...] long overall. She had {{a beam of}} [...] and a draft of [...] She displaced [...] as designed and up to [...] at full load.

The nobby ranged in size from about [...] for single-handed boats and from [...] for two-man boats. They were all <b>pole</b> <b>masted</b> cutters with gaff topsail.|$|R
50|$|Sankt Georg was 123.23 m long at the {{waterline}} and was 124.3 m long overall. She had {{a beam of}} 19.01 m and a draft of 6.83 m. She displaced 7289 t as designed and up to 8070 t at full load. Her crew numbered 630 officers and men. Sankt Georg was fitted with two <b>pole</b> <b>masts</b> for observation.|$|R
500|$|The ship {{began an}} {{extensive}} reconstruction in 1902 at Brest, with {{the installation of}} 20 new Guyot–du-Temple water-tube boilers, that took four years to complete. The boilers had an operating pressure of [...] and they required that a third funnel be added which necessitated extensive structural modifications. The rear military mast {{was replaced by a}} simple <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> and sea trials in July 1906 showed that the ship could only attain [...] from [...] Dupuy de Lôme was placed in reserve after completing her refit in October 1906 and was not recommissioned until September 1908 for service on the Moroccan station. By this time many of the ship's plates were rusting and her entire water distribution system had to be dismantled for cleaning in 1909. Later that year, she was placed into reserve again and deemed uneconomical to repair. Dupuy de Lôme was decommissioned on 20 March 1910, but the final decision to strike her from the Navy List was not made until 20 February 1911.|$|E
500|$|On 31 May, Derfflinger {{was heavily}} engaged during the Battle of Jutland, {{as the second}} ship in the German battlecruiser line. She {{sustained}} 21 major hits during the battle, but dealt considerable damage to the British battlecruiser force as well. At 16:26, [...] sank after a magazine explosion that tore the ship apart; she had been targeted with a hail of heavy-caliber gunfire from Derfflinger and Seydlitz. Two hours later, at 18:30, [...] suffered a similar fate, though Derfflinger was assisted by her sister Lützow. During the engagement, Derfflinger had both of her rear turrets knocked out by British gunfire. Her crew suffered 157 men killed and 26 wounded, which was the highest casualty figure for any German ship not sunk. The resilience of the vessel earned her the nickname [...] "Iron Dog" [...] from her British adversaries. Repair work lasted until 15 October, during which the ship had her <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> removed and replaced with a tripod mast. The ship conducted training operations until November, at which point she returned to active duty with the fleet.|$|E
500|$|The new cruiser {{was ordered}} as [...] "Cruiser C" [...] {{and given the}} {{temporary}} name Ersatz Medusa {{as a replacement for}} the old cruiser [...] Construction of Karlsruhe began on 27 July 1926 with her keel laying at the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel. She was launched on 20 August 1927, and she was commissioned into the Reichsmarine on 6 November 1929. Karlsruhe completed sea trials in the Baltic Sea after entering service, after which she was assigned to training ship duty. In May 1930, she departed on her first overseas training cruise, to Africa and South America. After returning to Germany, she was modernized late in the year; her foremast was shortened, and her rear superstructure was slightly enlarged. Over the next five years, she embarked on four more world cruises for naval cadets, traveling as far as Japan. Between each cruise, she conducted exercises {{with the rest of the}} fleet in German waters. Günther Lütjens served as the ship's commander from September 1934 to September 1935. In 1935, she had more modifications made, including the installation of a <b>pole</b> <b>mast</b> aft of the funnels, along with an aircraft catapult amidships with a crane to handle floatplanes.|$|E
500|$|Carnot was [...] long between perpendiculars, {{and had a}} beam of [...] and a draught of [...] She had a {{displacement}} of [...] Her bridge was cut down compared to Charles Martel to save weight, and she was equipped with lighter <b>pole</b> <b>masts</b> instead of the heavy fighting masts used on her half-sister. She had a crew of 647 officers and enlisted men.|$|R
500|$|The ships had a {{freeboard}} of only [...] {{and their}} decks were often awash in {{any sort of}} moderate sea.
