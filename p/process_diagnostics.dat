40|$|Fourier {{transform}} {{infrared absorption}} spectroscopy (FTIR), optical emission spectroscopy (OES), self-bias voltage and plasma impedance controls were applied as in situ <b>process</b> <b>diagnostics</b> during the deposition of amorphous silicon thin-films. The diagnostic abilities of OES and FTIR are compared. The FTIR in-situ direct measurement of silane concentration in exhaust line is more precise than OES control. All in situ <b>process</b> <b>diagnostics</b> clearly indicates the inconsistency of plasma properties and therefore of deposition conditions. The drifts are comparable with the film deposition time. The FTIR measurement of reactant concentration in the process chamber evidence that the strong silane concentration drop (about 50 %) in a plasma {{is the cause of}} the short-term drift of OES signals (SiH* emission), plasma impedance and self-bias voltage signals. The influences of the deposition chamber geometry and technological parameters on process drifts are considered. The decrease of the gas residence time in the reactor leads to a decrease of Initial Transient State phenomena. Finally, the improvement of solar cell performance based on thin silicon films is demonstrated when drifts are reduced. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{efficient}} model based <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process</b> is described for systems whose components possess a causal relation between their inputs and their outputs.

Both these steps of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process</b> have a worst case time complexity of O(n 2) where n {{is the number of}} components. If the connectivity of the components is low, however, the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process</b> shows a linear time complexity.

40|$|Abstract Background Diagnostic {{error is}} an {{important}} error type since diagnostic adverse events are regularly judged as being preventable and the consequences {{are considered to be}} severe. Existing research often focuses on either diagnostic adverse events or on the errors in diagnostic reasoning. Whether and when an incorrect <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process</b> results in adverse outcomes has not been studied extensively. The present paper describes the design of a study that aims to study the relationship between a suboptimal <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process</b> and patient outcomes. In addition, the role of personal and circumstantial factors {{on the quality of the}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process</b> will be examined. Methods/Design The research questions were addressed using several data sources. First, the differential diagnosis was assessed concurrently to the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process.</b> Second, the patient records of 248 patients suffering from shortness of breath were reviewed by expert internists in order to reveal suboptimal cognitive acts and (potential) consequences for the patient. The suboptimal cognitive acts were discussed with the treating physicians and classified with the taxonomy of unsafe acts. Third, workload, fatigue and work experience were measured during the physicians work. Workload and fatigue were measured during the physicians shift using the NASA tlx questionnaire on a handheld computer. Physicians participating in the study also answered questions about their work experience. Discussion The design used in this study provides insight into the relationship between suboptimal cognitive acts in the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process</b> and possible consequences for the patient. Suboptimal cognitive acts in the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process</b> and its causes can be revealed. Additional measurements of workload, fatigue and experience allow examining the influence of these factors on the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process.</b> In conclusion, the present design provides a method with which insights in weaknesses of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>process</b> and the effect on patient outcomes can be studied and opportunities for improvement can be obtained. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define a}} quality {{assurance}} instrument to evaluate errors in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>processes</b> made by physicians {{in the emergency}} department (ED). METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical investigation of inpatient ED records. Over a six-year period, 5, 000 medical records of admitted patients were randomly selected for evaluation.

If the primary ED diagnosis differed from the primary discharge diagnosis, the ED record was inspected to determine reasons for the misdiagnosis.
