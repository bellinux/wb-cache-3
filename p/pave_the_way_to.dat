25|$|Although the University {{was officially}} desegregated in summer 1963, full {{integration}} of the athletic teams did not occur at that time. By spring 1967, the athletic program was warned by the Office of Education {{that the lack of}} African Americans under athletic scholarship was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In February 1967, Dock Rone, an African American student enrolled at the University from Montgomery, met with coach Bryant about potentially trying to make the football team as a walk-on. At that time Bryant believed a non-scholarship, African American walk-on would help <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> complete {{integration of the}} football team.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century Uchida Ryogoro arrived in Tokyo {{and set up}} shop, {{teaching}} jōjutsu to high-rankers in the Japanese society at the time. His students included Nakayama Hakudo (1873–1958), founder of Muso Shinden-ryū, and Komita Takayoshi, founder of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai ("Great Japan Budō Preservation Society"). It was during this time that Jigoro Kano was first invited to Fukuoka to observe SMR which would herald the cooperation between the two arts in Tokyo. Uchida Ryogoro also taught at the Naval Officers Club and later at the Shiba Kōen park. Ryogoro's son, Uchida Ryōhei, joined him in Tokyo and studied under his father there and was instrumental in developing his father's Tanjōjutsu art into a working set of techniques. Uchida Ryogoro died in 1921. Uchidas efforts in Tokyo greatly assisted in establishing a connection with the various martial arts communities already based in Tokyo and would help <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Shimizu Takajis own efforts at popularizing SMR and establishing a new SMR presence.|$|E

25|$|While epigenetics is of {{fundamental}} importance in eukaryotes, especially metazoans, it plays a different role in bacteria. Most importantly, eukaryotes use epigenetic mechanisms primarily to regulate gene expression which bacteria rarely do. However, bacteria make {{widespread use of}} postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria also use DNA adenine methylation (rather than DNA cytosine methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, Haemophilus, and Brucella. In Alphaproteobacteria, methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In Gammaproteobacteria, adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression. There exists a genetic switch controlling Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) that allows the bacterium to randomly change its characteristics into six alternative states that could <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> improved vaccines. Each form is randomly generated by a phase variable methylation system. The ability of the pneumococcus to cause deadly infections is different {{in each of these}} six states. Similar systems exist in other bacterial genera.|$|E
500|$|Owen's later {{views on}} {{international}} affairs did not escape controversy. [...] Though initially a firm {{supporter of the}} Treaty of Versailles, including its assertion of German responsibility for the outbreak of [...] World War I, during 1923 his views changed radically {{under the influence of}} [...] "revisionist" [...] studies, including the publication of extensive (though incomplete) materials from the diplomatic archives of the pre-War Tsarist Russian Foreign Office. [...] He made a major speech in the Senate on 18 December 1923 attributing primary responsibility for the war to France and (especially) Russia rather than Germany. [...] Owen hoped that a public revisiting of the issue of war guilt might encourage reversal of some of the penal clauses imposed on Germany under the Versailles settlement, and <b>pave</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reconciliation between Germany and France, but his attempts to promote a Senate investigation of the war guilt question were narrowly defeated, largely along party lines — with many of his fellow Democrats concerned not to undermine the reputation of Woodrow Wilson — while an expert report prepared by the Legislative Research Service of the Library of Congress, though broadly supportive of Owen's arguments, was in the event never published as it was considered unlikely to obtain the support of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [...] In 1926, following his retirement from the Senate, Owen was to publish a book advancing his revisionist thesis, under the title: The Russian Imperial Conspiracy, 1892-1914: The Most Gigantic Intrigue of all Time.|$|E
