Moreover, we prove that a priori knowledge of the erasure at the encoder does not increase the feedback capacity. The feedback capacity was calculated using an equivalent dynamic programming (DP) formulation with an optimal average-reward that is equal to the capacity. Furthermore, we obtained an optimal encoding procedure from the solution of the DP, leading to a capacity-achieving, zero-error coding scheme for our setting. DP is, thus, shown to be a tool not only for solving optimization problems, such as capacity calculation, but also for constructing optimal coding schemes.
