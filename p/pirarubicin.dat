50|$|The {{first is}} {{sometimes}} referred to as random collection and screening of material, but in fact the collection is often far from random in that biological (often botanical) knowledge is used about which families show promise, based on a number of factors, including past screening. This approach is {{based on the fact that}} only a small part of earth’s biodiversity has ever been tested for pharmaceutical activity. It is also based on the fact that organisms living in a species-rich environment need to evolve defensive and competitive mechanisms to survive, mechanisms which might usefully be exploited in the development of drugs that can cure diseases affecting humans. A collection of plant, animal and microbial samples from rich ecosystems can potentially give rise to novel biological activities worth exploiting in the drug development process. One example of a successful use of this strategy is the screening for antitumour agents by the National Cancer Institute, started in the 1960s. Paclitaxel was identified from Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia. Paclitaxel showed anti-tumour activity by a previously undescribed mechanism (stabilization of microtubules) and is now approved for clinical use for the treatment of lung, breast and ovarian cancer, as well as for Kaposi's sarcoma. Early in the 21st century, Cabazitaxel (made by Sanofi, a French firm), another relative of taxol has been shown effective against prostate cancer, also because it works by preventing the formation of microtubules, which pull the chromosomes apart in dividing cells (such as cancer cells). Other examples are: 1. Camptotheca (Camptothecin · Topotecan · Irinotecan · Rubitecan · Belotecan); 2. Podophyllum (Etoposide · Teniposide); 3a. Anthracyclines (Aclarubicin · Daunorubicin · Doxorubicin · Epirubicin · Idarubicin · Amrubicin · <b>Pirarubicin</b> · Valrubicin · Zorubicin); 3b. Anthracenediones (Mitoxantrone · Pixantrone).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of anthracyclines (daunorubicin and idarubicin) with monolayers of zwitterionic palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) and anionic dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid (POPC-DPPA 80 – 20 mol%) was studied by surface pressure measurements and compared with previous results obtained with other anthracyclines (<b>pirarubicin</b> and adriamycin). These anthracycline/phospholipid monolayers were next transferred by a Langmuir-Blodgett technique onto planar supports and studied by surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS), which gave {{information about the}} orientation of anthracycline in the monolayers. On the whole, the adsorption of anthracyclines in zwitterionic monolayers increases with the anthracycline hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, which underlines {{the role of the}} hydrophobic component of the interaction. On the contrary, the anthracyclines remain adsorbed on the polar headgroups of the phospholipids in the presence of DPPA and form a screen that limits a deeper penetration of other anthracycline molecules. To study by SERRS measurements the crossing of <b>pirarubicin</b> through a phospholipid bilayer used as a membrane model, asymmetrical POPC-DPPA/POPC or POPC/POPC-DPPA bilayers were transferred by the Langmuir-Schäfer method, thanks to a laboratory-built set-up, and put in contact with a <b>pirarubicin</b> aqueous solution.

The study aimed to clarify the role of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and enhanced drug sequestration in lysosomes to confer the multi{{drug resistance}} K 562 cells with varied degree of Pgp expression. Approach: Erythromyelogenous leukemic K 562 and its corresponding Pgp-over expression K 562 /adr (RF = 26. 5) and K 562 / 10000 (RF = 39. 6) cells were used. The transport of intrinsic fluorescence molecules including acridine orange and <b>pirarubicin</b> across plasma membrane of living cells was performed by using spectrofluorometric and flow cytometric analysis. Results: <b>Pirarubicin</b> passively diffused through the plasma membrane of K 562, K 562 /adr and K 562 / 10000 cells with the same values of k+ = 3. 4 ± 0. 3 pL. s - 1. cell - 1. Similar results were found for acridine orange, which passively diffused through plasma membrane of these cell lines about 30 -fold faster than <b>pirarubicin.</b> The mean rate of Pgp-mediated efflux coefficient (k a) of <b>pirarubicin</b> was equal to 2. 6 ± 0. 9 pL. s - 1. cell - 1 for K 562 /adr and 4. 7 ± 1. 0 pL. s - 1. cell - 1 for K 562 / 10000 cells. The Pgp-mediated efflux of acridine orange could not be determined for K 562 /adr cells while an enhancement of exocytosis in K 562 / 10000 cells was characterized. The acridine orange exhibited antiproliferative activity and IC 50 for K 562, K 562 /adr and K 562 / 10000 cells was 447 ± 40, 715 ± 19 and 1, 719 ± 258 nM, respectively.

To provide a strategy for constraining or minimizing the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP, a <b>pirarubicin</b> liposome powder (L-THP) was appropriately prepared, and the cumulative cardiotoxicity of L-THP and free THP (F-THP) were investigated on Sprague-Dawley rats after 3 successive doses. Urinary samples for metabonomic study, serum samples for biochemical assay, and heart samples for histopathology test were collected. As a result, the metabonomics-based findings such as PLS-DA plotting showed minimal metabolic alterations in L-THP as compared to F-THP, and correlated with the changes of serum biochemical assay and cardiac histopathology as measurements of damage to heart tissue. Our results confirm that when encapsulated into liposomes, the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP can be greatly ameliorated. Lipophilic aglycone metabolites of THP associated with redox cycling are cardiotoxic for the possibility of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Also, metabonomic analysis shows that the successive doses of THP will lead to severe metabolic pathways disturbances in the cell energy production.

His level of consciousness deteriorated after TACE, and non-contrast computed tomography revealed a CLE. The cerebral conditions improved after supportive therapy. The complication might {{have been due to}} hepatic arterio-pulmonary vein shunt caused by direct invasion of the tumor. Even though CLE is an uncommon complication of TACE, we should be aware of these rare complications in patients with high risk factors...|$|E
40|$|Desmoplastic {{small round}} cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare, {{aggressive}} and malignant tumor that predominantly affects young males. No standard therapy is currently available {{for patients with}} DSRCT and the prognosis remains extremely poor. In this study, we report a thought-provoking DSRCT case. A 24 -year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of hematemesis. Computed tomography revealed a retrovesical mass with a splenic hilar tumor, multiple lung and liver tumors and marked lymph node swellings. The source of hematemesis was gastric varices caused by the compression of the splenic vein by a splenic hilar tumor. The patient was provided with a histological diagnosis of DSRCT based on needle biopsy from the liver tumors and the pelvic mass {{was thought to be}} the primary lesion. This is a long-term survival case of metastatic DSRCT treated with multimodal therapy including 15 courses of multiagent chemotherapy, radiation therapy for the hepatic portal region using 42. 5 Gy, and four instances of therapeutic endoscopy. The prolonged progression-free survival period (15 months) obtained following chemotherapy suggests the chemosensitive feature of the disease. We used a modified P 6 regimen (cyclophosphamide, <b>pirarubicin,</b> vincristine, ifosfamide and etoposide) and a modified PAVEP regimen (cyclophosphamide, <b>pirarubicin,</b> etoposide and cisplatin) to decrease severe adverse events and to improve the completion rate of chemotherapy. DSRCT is an aggressive but chemo-sensitive disease, and continuous chemotherapy using an appropriate regimen with possible supportive care is essential for long-term survival. This case report may represent a treatment option for this rare disease...|$|E
40|$|Objective　To {{compare the}} {{biological}} difference between CD 13 +CD 133 + and CD 13 －CD 133 － hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in HuH 7 cell line and its clinical significance. Methods　The status of proliferation, {{phase of the}} cell cycle, tumor formation in vivo, differentiation, and their chemoresistance to 5 -FU and <b>pirarubicin</b> of CD 13 +CD 133 + and CD 13 －CD 133 －HCC cells were studied to analyze the clinical implication of CD 13 +CD 133 +HCC cell subset. Results　The proliferation rate of CD 13 +CD 133 +HCC cells {{was significantly higher than}} that of CD 13 －CD 133 －HCC cells. The cell-cycle phase study showed that 78. 45 % of the CD 13 +CD 133 +HCC cells were in the G 0 /G 1 phase, 2. 19 % in G 2 /M phase, and 19. 36 % in S phase, while 62. 18 % CD 13 －CD 133 －HCC cells were in the G 0 /G 1 phase, 11. 88 % in G 2 /M phase, and 25. 95 % in S phase. Limiting dilution analysis of HuH 7 cells revealed that 1 × 103 CD 13 +CD 133 + cells could form the tumor, while 1 × 105 CD 13 －CD 133 － cells did. CD 13 +CD 133 + cells showed chemoresistance to 5 -FU and <b>pirarubicin,</b> while other three subsets succumbed to the drugs. Conclusion　CD 13 +CD 133 + cancer cells in HuH 7 showed the characteristics of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which might contribute to the relapse and metastasis of liver cancer, and they may be the main target for chemotherapy in human liver cancer...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of retroperitoneal Castleman's disease {{associated}} with bladder tumor. The patient was a 62 -year-old man, who underwent partial cystectomy under a diagnosis of bladder tumor in 1989. Subsequently, recurrent bladder tumor was detected and he consulted the outpatient clinic at our University Hospital in November, 1990, at which time computerized tomography (CT) revealed a retroperitoneal tumor. From February, 1991 four courses of combined chemotherapy (methotrexate, vinblastine, <b>pirarubicin,</b> cisplatin) were administered for the tumor. The tumor reduction rate after the chemotherapy was 60 % on CT, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and left nephroureterectomy were performed in July, 1991. Histological examination revealed Castleman's disease, hyaline-vascular type. Fifty-nine reported cases of retroperitoneal Castleman's disease in Japan are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of 29 -year-old Japanese female {{with a history of}} {{resection}} of primary carcinoma of the right breast. After a partial response by chemotherapy with <b>pirarubicin</b> and docetaxel for lung metastasis, the patient developed multiple brain and bone metastases. As the degree of overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER 2) was (2 +), trastuzumab was administered in combination with paclitaxel. Asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction evaluated by echocardiography was observed ten weeks after the beginning of the treatment. After two weeks of discontinuation of the therapy, however, LV function showed rapid recovery and the resumed use of trastuzumab did not cause further cardiac deterioration. The patient died of sudden respiratory failure due to cerebral herniation and not to heart failure...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of left renal cell {{carcinoma}} extending into vena cava with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. A 41 -year-old man presented to our outpatient clinic with macroscopic hematuria. Upon laparotomy, numerous white nodules were identified on diaphragm and serosa of liver, stomach, small intestine and mesentery. Biopsied specimen showed malignant mesothelioma of peritoneum and renal cell carcinoma of left kidney. He was treated with intraperitoneal cisplatinum and intravenous <b>pirarubicin</b> for mesothelioma, and chemoembolization for renal tumor. After two courses of therapy, he suffered from disseminated intravascular coagulation and died of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autopsy revealed that intraperitoneal nodules were markedly decreased in number and renal tumor had changed into hemorrhagic necrosis, but tumor thrombus in vena cava had little necrotic change...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Small cell {{osteosarcoma}} (SCO) is {{the most}} rare subtype of osteosarcoma and has a poor prognosis. An 11 -year-old boy presented with 2 -month history of painful tumefaction in the lower leg. Imaging analysis demonstrated a mixture of osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions in the proximal tibia and extraskeletal area. Histology of the open biopsy showed small round cells producing mucous matrix. Based on these findings, SCO was suspected. The patient received three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using high-dose ifosfamide, high-dose methotrexate, <b>pirarubicin</b> and carboplatin. Wide-margin resection was performed followed by tibial lengthening using the Ilizarov method and two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with the same drugs as for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Histology of the resected specimen showed that almost all tumor cells were necrotized...|$|E
40|$|The {{risk factors}} of bladder cancer {{recurrence}} after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBt) were poorly understood, especially in Chinese population. This study evaluated the potential {{risk factors of}} recurrence based on a Chinese population. A total of 698 patients that received TURBt procedure in our institute from 2000 to 2012 were recruited in this study. Clinical information was collected. The patients were followed up according to the schedule recommended by Chinese guideline. A total of 583 males (83. 5 %) and 115 females (16. 5 %) were enrolled in our study. The median follow-up duration was 51. 5 months. Gender, chief complain, tumor size, number of lesions, histological grade and chemotherapeutic agents were found significantly associated with patients' short-term recurrence (less than 1 year) (All p< 0. 05). In the multivariate analysis, tumor size, number of lesions, histological grade and chemotherapeutic agents {{were significantly related to}} patients' short-term recurrence (less than 1 year) (All p< 0. 05). A multivariate model based on tumor size, number of lesions, histological grade and chemotherapeutic agents had an AUC of 0. 697, which significantly improved the prediction utility for bladder cancer short-term recurrence (less than 1 year) than any single factor In the multivariate Cox regression, tumor size greater than 3 cm, multifocal lesions, worsen histological grade and non-urothelial carcinoma was related to time to recurrence (TR). Patients with larger tumor size, multifocal number of lesions, higher tumor grade and who received chemotherapeutic agents other than Epirubicin and <b>Pirarubicin</b> might have higher risks of recurrence less than 1 year. Tumor size, number of lesions, pathology and histological grade might be associated with TR. As Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is currently not approved for bladder cancer in China, Epirubicin and <b>Pirarubicin</b> might be considered prior to other chemotherapy medications when providing post-operative instillation of chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|The role of Quercetin in {{ovarian cancer}} {{treatment}} remains controversial, and the mechanism is unknown. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of Quercetin in combination with Cisplatin and other anti-neoplastic drugs in ovarian cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, along with the molecular mechanism of action. Quercetin treatment at various concentrations was examined in combination with Cisplatin, taxol, <b>Pirarubicin</b> and 5 -Fu in human epithelial ovarian cancer C 13 * and SKOV 3 cells. CCK 8 assay and Annexin V assay were for cell viability and apoptosis analysis, immunofluorescence assay, DCFDA staining and realtime PCR were used for reactive oxygen species (ROS) -induced injury detection and endogenous antioxidant enzymes expression. Athymic BALB/c-nu nude mice were injected with C 13 *cells to obtain a xenograft model for in vivo studies. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out to evaluate the ROS-induced injury and SOD 1 activity of xenograft tumors. Contrary to the pro-apoptotic effect of high concentration (40 µM- 100 µM) of Quercetin, low concentrations (5 µM- 30 µM) of Quercetin resulted in varying degrees of attenuation of cytotoxicity of Cisplatin treatment when combined with Cisplatin. Similar anti-apoptotic effects were observed when Quercetin was combined with other anti-neoplastic agents: Taxol, <b>Pirarubicin</b> and 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -Fu). Low concentrations of Quercetin were observed to suppress ROS-induced injury, reduce intracellular ROS level and increase the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, suggesting a ROS-mediated mechanism of attenuating anti-neoplastic drugs. In xenogeneic model, Quercetin led to a substantial reduction of therapeutic efficacy of Cisplatin along with enhancing the endogenous antioxidant enzyme expression and reducing ROS-induced damage in xenograft tumor tissue. Taken together, these data suggest that Quercetin at low concentrations attenuate the therapeutic effects of Cisplatin and other anti-neoplastic drugs in ovarian cancer cells by reducing ROS damage. Quercetin supplementation during ovarian cancer treatment may detrimentally affect therapeutic response...|$|E
