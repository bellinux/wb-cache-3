With 51.1% of the popular vote, Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice. President Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: [...] "Tonight you voted for action, not <b>politics</b> <b>as</b> <b>usual.</b> You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties." ...|$|E

Skoble wrote that [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain" [...] in detail explores [...] "the {{possibility}} of a utopian alternative to <b>politics</b> <b>as</b> <b>usual</b> in Springfield". They described [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain" [...] as an [...] "epitome" [...] of The Simpsons diverse comedic humor, and wrote {{that it can be}} [...] "enjoyed in two levels", as both [...] "broad farce" [...] and [...] "intellectual satire". As an example of the episode's farcical humor, they referred to the episode's subplot, which, they wrote, [...] "contains some of the grossest humor in the long history of The Simpsons." [...] At the same time, the episode is [...] "filled" [...] with what they described as [...] "subtle cultural allusions", such as the design of Mensa group's locale, which is based on American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's house. Likewise, Lisa's challenge to Springfield calls attention to the [...] "cultural limitations of small-town America", while the episode also argues that intellectual disdain for the common man can be carried too far and that theory can [...] "all too easily lose touch with common sense". They also argued that the episode, as well as the series as a whole, offers a kind of intellectual defense of the common man against intellectuals, which they opined [...] "helps explain its popularity and broad appeal [...] defends the common man against the intellectual, in a way that both the common man and the intellectual can understand and enjoy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dissatisfaction on {{the part}} of the growing middle class with the {{corruption}} and inefficiency of <b>politics</b> <b>as</b> <b>usual,</b> and the failure to deal with increasingly important urban and industrial problems, led to the dynamic Progressive Movement starting in the 1890s. In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change. Leading politicians from both parties, most notably Theodore Roosevelt, Charles Evans Hughes, and Robert La Follette on the Republican side, and William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson on the Democratic side, took up the cause of progressive reform. Women became especially involved in demands for woman suffrage, prohibition, and better schools; their most prominent leader was Jane Addams of Chicago, who created settlement houses. [...] "Muckraking" [...] journalists such as Upton Sinclair, Lincoln Steffens and Jacob Riis exposed corruption in business and government along with rampant inner city poverty. Progressives implemented anti-trust laws and regulated such industries of meat-packing, drugs, and railroads. Four new constitutional amendments– the Sixteenth through Nineteenth– resulted from progressive activism, bringing the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, prohibition, and woman suffrage. The Progressive Movement lasted through the 1920s; the most active period was 1900–18.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1900 the Spanish {{hierarchy}} {{started to}} abandon their traditional strategy of influencing key individuals within the liberal monarchy and began to switch to mass mobilization, carried by means of broad popular structures and party <b>politics.</b> The Integrists, <b>as</b> <b>usual</b> reluctant {{to be one of}} many Catholic parties, despised the semi-democratic format of policy-making and refused to accept malmenorismo; as a result, in the 1910s and 1920s Partido Católico Nacional was dramatically outpaced by new breed of modern Christian-democratic organizations. In 1919 Integrists commenced war against a new trend, the emerging social-Catholicism, targeting syndical thought of Arboleya, Gafo and López-Dóriga; the conflict continued until the late 1920s. [...] The official position of the hierarchy changed slightly in favor of Integrism in 1927, once Pedro Segura became the Primate. [...] His voice on Christian syndicalism and his vision of integral re-Christianization resembled a typical Integrist concept rather than accidentalist and possibilist strategy. Cordial relations between Segura and some Integrists, especially Senante, continued until the late 1950s.|$|R

60|$|At {{that time}} I was {{connected}} with men of high {{place in the}} community. They loved liberty {{as much as the}} Duke of Bedford can do; and they understood it at least as well. Perhaps their <b>politics,</b> <b>as</b> <b>usual,</b> took a tincture from their character, and they cultivated what they loved. The liberty they pursued was a liberty inseparable from order, from virtue, from morals, and from religion,--and was neither hypocritically nor fanatically followed. They did not wish that liberty, in itself one of the first of blessings, should in its perversion become the greatest curse which could fall upon mankind. To preserve the Constitution entire, and practically equal to all the great ends of its formation, not in one single part, but in all its parts, was to them the first object. Popularity and power they regarded alike. These were with them only different means of obtaining that object, and had no preference over each other in their minds, but as one or the other might afford a surer or a less certain prospect of arriving at that end. It is some consolation to me, in the cheerless gloom which darkens the evening of my life, that with them I commenced my political career, and never for a moment, in reality nor in appearance, for any length of time, was separated from their good wishes and good opinion.|$|E
