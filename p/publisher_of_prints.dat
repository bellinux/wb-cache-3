[...] For Adam von Bartsch, although he did not usually design or draw, the quality of his work, along with that of Hans Lützelburger and Hieronymus Andreae, was such that he should be considered as an artist. [...] Some prints where the designer is unknown are described as by de Negker, but it is assumed there was an artist who drew the design, although {{it has been suggested that}} de Negker might fill in a landscape background to a drawing of a figure.|$|E

50|$|Van den Enden, {{the son of}} weavers, {{was baptized}} in Antwerp on 6 February 1602. He was a pupil at the Augustinian and the Jesuit colleges of that city. In 1619 he entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus, but in 1633 he was {{dismissed}} from the order. In the later 1630s he contributed some Neo-Latin poems to devotional works by the Spanish Augustinian Bartholomé de los Rios y Alarcón. In about the same period he also {{seems to have been}} active in the Antwerp art trade, in which his brother Martinus van den Enden played an important role, as a <b>publisher</b> <b>of</b> <b>prints</b> by Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck. In 1640 Van den Enden married Clara Maria Vermeeren at Antwerp and in 1641 a first child was born, named after her mother Clara Maria.

5000|$|For {{much of the}} painting's {{early history}} (until 1797), it was owned {{together}} with The Astronomer, which it strongly resembles, and the two have long been considered pendants, although their measurements are not identical. The paintings were not among the works in the Dissius sale of 1696, a collection apparently originally owned by the artist's supposed patron, Pieter van Ruijven, and the earliest record of the painting is from 1713. Up until the late 18th century, they were referred to as [...] "Astrologers". The pair were sold by an anonymous owner together in Rotterdam on April 27, 1713 (No. 10 or 11), for 300 florins (a [...] "considerable sum", according to Wheelock). Hendrik Sorgh, an art broker, may have bought the paintings at that point. They were among his effects {{when he died in}} 1720, and both were sold on March 28 of that year in Amsterdam (No. 3 or 4 in the sale; for 160 florins; described as [...] "An Astrologer" [...] and [...] "a repeat"). Govert Looten, a neighbor of Sorgh at the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam bought the paintings, which were sold from his estate on March 31, 1729 (this painting was No. 6 and went for 104 florins, both were described in the catalog as [...] "sublimely and artfully painted"). Jacob Crammer Simmonsz of Amsterdam (1725-1778) owned the pair before 1778, hanging them in his home on the Prinsengracht (Simonsz also owned The Lacemaker and another Vermeer, now unknown, depicting a lady pouring wine). He sold The Astronomer and The Geographer together on November 25 of that year to a Huguenot banker, Jean Etiènne Fizeaux of Amsterdam, who owned The Geographer until his death in 1780. His widow owned the work until perhaps 1785. As of 1794 it was owned by Jan Danser Nijman of Amsterdam, who sold it on August 16, 1797 to Christiaan Josi, a <b>publisher</b> <b>of</b> <b>prints,</b> for 133 guilders. It later was bought by Arnoud de Lange of Amsterdam. This transaction separated the two paintings. De Lange sold it on December 12, 1803 for 360 florins.|$|E
40|$|The {{university}} {{as a producer}} and <b>publisher</b> <b>of</b> <b>prints</b> {{is not a new}} concept when we consider established US-based institutes such as Graphicstudio in Tampa, Florida, (part of the University of Southern Florida) and the Tamarind Institute, {{which is part of the}} University of New Mexico. Similar UK-based publishing enterprises have emerged in more recent years including the Royal College of Art and the Royal Academy, each displaying prints from their extensive collections and graduate portfolios. International print fairs such as The London Original Print Fair at the Royal Academy cater for university publishers, although the costs of attending such events on an annual basis can prove to be difficult – especially if the Universities do not reside in the fair’s host city. Within an art market context, one might also consider the fundamental divides between the university and industry based print gallery/publisher. The latter often boasts (or is set up in such a way to develop) an established list of artists and clients – resulting in a tried and tested model with an economic return for sustaining such a business. That said (and to keep this article relatively short – because we promised) we aim to elaborate on the article’s snazzy title – well, actually it’s probably the start of a larger conversation, or at least we hope so...|$|E
