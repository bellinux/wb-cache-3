Interaction of pure polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with phosphoric acid (PA) produced partially phosphorylated poly vinyl alcohol (PPVA) {{and the addition}} of aluminum (Al) source produces a PPVA-AlPO 4 composite. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectra of PPVA confirmed the phosphate group in PPVA-AlPO 4 composite. The phosphate group had bonded with aluminum at C-O-P- AlPO 4, O-P-O- AlPO 4 and also OH-Al. The optical properties of these PPVA and PPVA-AlPO 4 nanocomposite samples were examined by UV-visible and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.

40|$|Graphene is a 2 -dimensional (2 D) {{material}} that attracts many researches interest {{due to its}} significant properties and applications. Graphene can be synthesize from oxidation of graphite flakes and reduced by using reductant to become graphene nanosheets. Graphene oxide can be reduced chemically by using reducing agents such as hydrazine or dimethlyhydrazine. However, these chemicals are highly poisonous and toxic, which will bring harmful effect to human beings and environment. Therefore great care is needed when handling these materials and it requires extra routes to remove the impurities introduced by the chemical reduction of graphene oxide such as C-N. To ease the synthesis of good quality and environment friendly graphene, green reduction of graphene oxide becomes an alternative way. In this study, phytoextracts from banana peels {{was used as the}} reducing agent due to its high phenolic contents and antioxidant activity. Graphite oxide was fabricated using graphite flakes before undergoing ultrasonication for exfoliation to form the graphene oxide. The graphene oxide was reduced by using phytoextracts from banana peels at room temperature and refluxed temperature. Optimization of phytoextracts reduction was carried out by varying the phytoextracts concentration, reduction time and reduction temperature.

40|$|International audienceRaman {{scattering}} is used {{to investigate}} the vibrational spectrum of a sodium silicate glass around the boson <b>peak</b> frequency <b>range</b> <b>at</b> temperatures between 10 and 450 K. The comparison with the density of states measured with coherent neutron scattering allows one to determine the Raman coupling function. This quantity presents a linear frequency dependence in the boson peak region and a negligible temperature dependence, confirming similar observations in other glasses. The Raman spectra at different temperatures scale according to the Debye frequency determined from the sound velocity measured at terahertz frequency with inelastic x-ray scattering. This result confirms previous neutron scattering data {{and the importance of}} measuring the elastic properties of the glass in the proper frequency range...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using an exploding mercury jet {{as a high}} current opening switch has been evaluated <b>at</b> <b>peak</b> currents <b>ranging</b> from 7 kA to 125 kA. To provide a more realistic measure of actual performance, a spark gap was used to switch peak currents into varying RL loads. The roles of magnetic pinching, ionization, and skin effects in determination of scaling behavior and reproducibility are discussed for the range of currents studied. Supporting evidence for the roles pinching and ionization in scaling is provided by spatially and temporally resolved spectra, which {{have been used to}} estimate the iodneutral temperature and electron temperature in the plasma column formed by the exploding jet...|$|R
