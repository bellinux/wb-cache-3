50|$|A <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meter</b> may be {{compared}} to a bucket or a stopwatch. The stopwatch is started when the flow starts, and stopped when the bucket reaches its limit. The volume divided by the time gives the flow rate. For continuous measurements, we need a system of continually filling and emptying buckets to divide the flow without letting {{it out of the}} pipe. These continuously forming and collapsing volumetric displacements may take the form of pistons reciprocating in cylinders, gear teeth mating against the internal wall of a meter or through a progressive cavity created by rotating oval gears or a helical screw.|$|E
50|$|A <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meter</b> {{is a type}} of {{flow meter}} that {{requires}} fluid to mechanically displace components in the meter in order for flow measurement. Positive displacement (PD) flow meters measure the volumetric flow rate of a moving fluid or gas by dividing the media into fixed, metered volumes (finite increments or volumes of the fluid). A basic analogy would be holding a bucket below a tap, filling it to a set level, then quickly replacing it with another bucket and timing {{the rate at which the}} buckets are filled (or the total number of buckets for the “totalized” flow). With appropriate pressure and temperature compensation, the mass flow rate can be accurately determined.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{displacement}} flowmeters {{are very}} accurate and have high turndown. They {{can be used}} in very viscous, dirty and corrosive fluids and essentially require no straight runs of pipe for fluid flow stream conditioning though pressure drop can be an issue. They are widely used in the custody transfer of oils and liquid fluids (gasoline) and are applied on residential home natural gas and water metering. A diaphragm meter, with which most homes are equipped, {{is an example of a}} <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meter.</b> This type of meter is appealing in certain custody transfer flow applications where it is critical that the metering be functional in order for any flow to take place.|$|E
50|$|Diaphragm gas <b>meters</b> are <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rotary <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meters</b> have a {{turndown}} ratio of between 10:1 and 80:1, {{depending on the}} manufacturer and the application. Diaphragm meters are considered to have a {{turndown ratio}} of 80:1.|$|R
50|$|For example, in {{the case}} of an orifice flow meter, the {{differential}} pressure across the orifice plate is the primary flow element. A turbine meter is equipped with a magnetic pickup that senses the proximity of the turbine blades as the fluid motion causes the turbine to spin; this pickup is the primary flow element for a turbine meter. Diaphragm <b>meters</b> and other <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meters</b> are equipped with a crank shaft, the rotation of which acts as the primary flow element.|$|R
50|$|Some designs {{require that}} only {{lubricating}} fluid be measured, because the rotors {{are exposed to}} the fluid. PD meters differ from turbine meters in that they handle medium and high-viscosity liquids well. For this reason, they are often used to measure the flow of hydraulic fluids. Compared with orifice-type meters, PD meters require very little straight upstream piping since they are not sensitive to uneven flow distribution across the area of the pipe. Positive displacement flow meters can provide better relative accuracy at low flows than orifice-type flow meters. However, a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meter</b> can be considerably heavier and more costly than non-positive-displacement types such as orifice plates, magnetic or vortex flow meters.|$|E
50|$|An oval gear meter is a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meter</b> {{that uses}} {{two or more}} oblong gears {{configured}} to rotate {{at right angles to}} one another, forming a T shape. Such a meter has two sides, which can be called A and B. No fluid passes {{through the center of the}} meter, where the teeth of the two gears always mesh. On one side of the meter (A), the teeth of the gears close off the fluid flow because the elongated gear on side A is protruding into the measurement chamber, while on the other side of the meter (B), a cavity holds a fixed volume of fluid in a measurement chamber. As the fluid pushes the gears, it rotates them, allowing the fluid in the measurement chamber on side B to be released into the outlet port. Meanwhile, fluid entering the inlet port will be driven into the measurement chamber of side A, which is now open. The teeth on side B will now close off the fluid from entering side B. This cycle continues as the gears rotate and fluid is metered through alternating measurement chambers. Permanent magnets in the rotating gears can transmit a signal to an electric reed switch or current transducer for flow measurement. Though claims for high performance are made, they are generally not as precise as the sliding vane design.|$|E

5000|$|Flow meters for the {{measurements}} {{in the oil}} and gas upstream industry are chosen based on type of measurement, performance and accuracy requirements, and the type of medium to be measured. Available meters in the market are characterized by properties such as accuracy, operational rangebility: flowrate, viscosity, velocity, pressure and temperature conditions, durability and demand with respect to calibration and monitoring, the ability to withstand contaminants, injected chemicals, salty and acidic environment. For the application of custody transfer measurements of fluid hydrocarbons, <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meters</b> and turbine meters have been preferred. [...] For gas metering, gas orifice meters and ultrasonic flow meters are most common. Coriolis meters are in use for liquid measurements, but can also take gas measurement applications.|$|R

50|$|These devices {{consist of}} a chamber(s) that obstructs the media flow and a {{rotating}} or reciprocating mechanism that allows the passage of fixed-volume amounts.

Both elements were situated within a curb valve based prototype design having a test section inner diameter of one inch. As predicted, experiments demonstrate a repeatable, linear relationship between frequency of oscillation and volume flow for flow rates between 200 and 1000 CFH. A requirement of less than one inch of water column pressure drop across the test section was also achieved. The output signal of the bimorph varied from millivolts to several volts throughout the same specified flow range. In addition, the oscillations may be simply counted to yield and integration of the total volume delivered.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the flow rate of various liquids and gases is critical in industrial automation. Rotary <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meters</b> (rotary PD meters) are highly accurate flowmeters that are widely employed in engineering applications, especially in custody transfer operations and hydraulic control systems.

40|$|An {{acoustic}} {{model is}} developed {{to predict the}} acoustic pressure waves generated by rotary <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> gas <b>meters.</b> The meter is approximated, in the long wavelength limit, to a small, rigid and circular piston, pulsating with harmonic time dependence inside an infinite baffle. The acoustic source volume velocity is first derived from the geometry of the measuring part of the meter. Rayleigh's formulation is then applied to derive the acoustic pressure fields of the meter for both the unducted and the ducted situations. The effects of the self-induced pressure waves on the registration of the meter are then considered. The performance of the meter {{is dependent on the}} configuration of the pipe network to which the meter is attached. The meter calibration curve can be seriously distorted by the self-induced acoustic pressure waves. The effectiveness of concentric Helmholtz type resonators to suppress undesired sound pressure waves in meter systems is discussed.

40|$|Apparent losses form an {{important}} component of the International Water Association's water balance. While apparent losses look like real losses to a municipality, this is not actually the case. The main components of apparent losses are water meter under-registration and unauthorised consumption. Water utilities in South Africa and internationally are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of good meter management practices based on the vast amount of literature published and work done by municipalities in recent years. Water meters are known to increasingly under-register as they age and register consumption. They register consumption the least accurate at low flowrates and their accuracy in this range deteriorates the fastest. This study investigates the extent of the apparent loss problem in selected areas of South Africa due to meter inaccuracy in a number of different ways, including an inspection of new residential consumer meters, interrogation of a metering database, flow logging of domestic consumers with and without an Unmeasured Flow Reducer (UFR) installed and a compilation of reports on bulk consumer meters. It was found that 16 % of 402 properties investigated in the City of Cape Town had an on-site leakage and their median flowrate was 10 litres/ hour. In Bloemfontein, it was found that 28 % of the 167 properties investigated had an on-site leakage with a median flowrate of 20 l/h. An investigation into the performance of 15 mm <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meters</b> based on eThekwini's water meter database showed that the under-registration from these meters increase by 0. 36 %-points per year and 0. 9 %-points per 1000 kL registered. Flow logging of domestic consumers with and without UFRs, showed that there was no genuine improvement in meter accuracy with meters that had UFRs installed in-line with it. However, there were only 8 properties (3 of which having a UFR installed) in the study that were investigated and no statistical conclusive conclusions could be made. Bulk meter audits in Ekurhuleni and Tshwane showed apparent losses of 18 % and 19 % respectively...|$|R
50|$|As earlier stated, flow {{instruments}} that function with the separator in an {{oil and gas}} environment include the flow indicator, flow transmitter and the flow controller. Due to maintenance (which will be discussed later) or due to high usage, these flowmeters do need to be calibrated from time to time. Calibration {{can be defined as}} the process of referencing signals of known quantity that has been predetermined to suit the range of measurements required. Calibration can also be seen from a mathematical point of view in which the flowmeters are standardized by determining the deviation from the predetermined standard so as to ascertain the proper correction factors. In determining the deviation from the predetermined standard, the actual flowrate is usually first determined {{with the use of a}} master meter which is a type of flowmeter that has been calibrated with a high degree of accuracy or by weighing the flow so as to be able to obtain a gravimetric reading of the mass flow. Another type of meter used is the transfer meter. However, according to Ting et al (1989), transfer meters have been proven to be less accurate if the operating conditions are different from its original calibrated points. According to Yoder (2000), the types of flowmeters used as master meters include turbine <b>meters,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>meters,</b> venturi meters, and Coriolis meters. In the U.S., master meters are often calibrated at a flow lab that has been certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST). NIST certification of a flowmeter lab means that its methods have been approved by NIST. Normally, this includes NIST traceability, meaning that the standards used in the flowmeter calibration process have been certified by NIST or are causally linked back to standards that have been approved by NIST. However, there is a general belief in the industry that the second method which involves the gravimetric weighing of the amount of fluid (liquid or gas) that actually flows through the meter into or out of a container during the calibration procedure is the most ideal method for measuring the actual amount of flow. Apparently, the weighing scale used for this method also has to be traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as well.In ascertaining a proper correction factor, there is often no simple hardware adjustment to make the flowmeter start reading correctly. Instead, the deviation from the correct reading is recorded at a variety of flowrates. The data points are plotted, comparing the flowmeter output to the actual flowrate as determined by the standardized National Institute of Standards and Technology master meter or weigh scale.|$|R
40|$|This degree {{project has}} been {{conducted}} to study flow meters and develop firmware for EC Instrument’s Reciflow. Flow rate is the volume of a fluid or mass of a substance which passes through a surface per time unit. Conversion can be made between volumetric and mass flow rate if the gas density is known. A market survey showed that Coriolis and thermal mass flow <b>meters</b> and <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> (volumetric) flow <b>meters,</b> as the Reciflow, {{are the most common}} kinds. The Reciflow consist of a system-on-board and a <b>displacement</b> <b>meter</b> with an optical encoder. The <b>displacement</b> <b>meter</b> is a cylinder with a piston within and valves at the ends. The firmware controls the valves so that the piston can reciprocate.

It is measured under normal conditions to be ± 0; 2 %normalized, relative to a reference. Further experiments must be performed to verify the accuracy and also the precision. The actual measurement of flow rate and volume is made with the encoder: as a difference in time between signal edges and the total number of edges accounted for.

40|$|Accuracy in {{the liquid}} {{hydrocarbons}} custody transfer is mandatory {{because it has}} a great economic impact. By far the most accurate <b>meter</b> is the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> (PD) <b>meter.</b> Increasing such an accuracy may adversely affect the cost of the custody transfer, unless simple models are developed in order to lower the cost, which is the purpose of this work. PD meter consists of a fixed volume rotating chamber. For each turn a pulse is counted, hence, the measured volume is the number of pulses times the volume of the chamber. It does not coincide with the real volume, so corrections have to be made. All the corrections are grouped by a meter factor. Among corrections highlights the slippage flow. By solving the Navier-Stokes equations one can find an analytical expression for this flow. It is neither easy nor cheap to apply straightforward the slippage correction; therefore we have made a simple model where slippage is regarded as a single parameter with dimension of time. The model has been tested for several PD meters. In our careful experiments, the meter factor grows with temperature at a constant pace of 8 ? 10 ? 5 ?ºC? 1. Be warne...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we have {{examined}} the convective flow boiling performance of R- 134 a on various micro-structured aluminum surfaces produced using advanced manufacturing techniques. More specifically, we have calculated the boiling heat transfer coefficient of R- 134 a on a bare aluminum surface and three micro-structurally enhanced surfaces. Two of these surfaces were produced using photolithography and reactive ion etching techniques, and the third surface was produced by means of laser-ablation. Experiments were performed in a conventional two-phase, single-pass loop which allowed for heat transfer and pressure drop measurements over a range of inlet qualities with only small quality changes occurring in the test section. There was also optical access to the test specimen to permit flow visualization. To begin, both single-phase and two-phase flow experiments were performed on the bare aluminum surface to compare these baseline results with data found in the literature. Once baseline testing and validation were complete, the sample was exchanged and the three micro-structured surfaces were then each subsequently tested. The temperature and pressure of the refrigerant were measured at stations in the flow upstream and downstream of the test section, and {{the temperature of the}} test surface was measured using five T-type thermocouples in contact with the sample.
