30|$|In {{most cases}} of orthognathic surgery of {{skeletal}} class III malocclusion, the surgery aims <b>mandibular</b> <b>retrusion</b> by causing maxillary retrusion and posterosuperior rotation.

Therefore, it is crucial to screen patients with airway APL at the level of soft palate, have narrow LTW, or patients who already snores before performing the surgery. If a retrusion, which does not involve posterosuperior rotation of maxilla in STO, is planned, it would be necessary to sufficiently inform the patient of the possibility of snoring.

40|$|Introduction: The {{relationship}} of the mandible to the cranial base influences both sagittal and vertical facial disharmonies. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the relationship between facial height and sagittal position of the glenoid fossa in subjects with Class II malocclusion associated with <b>mandibular</b> <b>retrusion.</b> Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was carried out on 60 subjects (21 males and 39 females, aged 7 ‒ 12 years), with Class II malocclusion associated with <b>mandibular</b> <b>retrusion,</b> who had different facial heights (normal, short, long). The cephalometric measurements were carried out based on three parameters of GF-S on FH, GF-PTM on FH and GF-FMN. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 using one-way ANOVA and Duncan analysis (α = 0. 05). Results: The means of GF-FMN distances in subjects with short, normal and long faces were 72. 6 mm, 70. 4 mm and 69 mm, respectively. The means of GF-S distances on FH in the three groups were 11. 6 mm, 12. 7 mm and 11. 27 mm, respectively and the means of GF-PTM distances on FH were 30. 09 mm, 28. 6 mm and 28 mm, respectively.

Later, a preadjusted edgewise appliance was applied to the maxillary and mandibular teeth. After 3 days, a mandibular distraction osteogenesis was performed. During and after the distraction, the open bite between the upper and lower dental arches was corrected using up and down elastics. The total treatment time with the edgewise appli-ance was 14 months. A skeletal Class I apical base relationship, good facial profile, and optimum intercuspation of the teeth were achieved with the treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the morphological changes of upper airway after Twin Block (TB) treatment in growing patients with Class II division 1 malocclusion and <b>mandibular</b> <b>retrusion</b> compared with untreated Class II patients by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty growing patients who have completed TB treatment were recruited into TB group. The control group (n = 30) was selected from the patients with the same diagnosis and without TB treatment. CBCT scans of the pre-treatment (T 1) and post-treatment (T 2) data of TB group and control data were collected. After three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction and registration of T 1 and T 2 data, the morphological changes of upper airway during TB treatment were measured. The statistical differences between T 1 and T 2 data of TB group as well as T 2 and control data were accessed by t-test. RESULTS: During the TB treatment, the mandible moved advanced by 3. 52 ± 2. 14 mm in the horizontal direction and 3. 77 ± 2. 10 mm in the vertical direction. The hyoid bone was in a more forward and inferior place. The upper airway showed a significant enlargement in nasopharynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx. In addition, the nasopharynx turned more circular, and the oropharynx became more elliptic in transverse shape. However, the transverse shape of the hypopharynx showed no significant difference. After comparison between T 2 and control data, only the horizontal movement of the hyoid bone, the volumetric expansion of the oropharynx and hypopharynx, and changes of the oropharyngeal transverse shape showed significant difference. CONCLUSION: Compared to the untreated Class II patients, the upper airway of growing patients with Class II division 1 malocclusion and <b>mandibular</b> <b>retrusion</b> showed a significant enlargement in the oropharynx and hypopharynx as well as a more elliptic transverse shape in the oropharynx, and the hyoid bone moved to an anterior position after TB treatment...|$|R

30|$|In {{our class}} II controls, the PAP {{dimension}} change was very minimum. Hänggi et al. [8] also reported {{no significant change}} in the PAP dimensions during adolescence. However, we observed significant improvements in the depth of the oropharynx and hypopharynx, and inclination of the soft palate following correction of <b>mandibular</b> <b>retrusion</b> in class II malocclusion subjects. The backward position of the tongue in subjects with retrognathic mandible pushed the soft palate posterior and decreased the dimension of the upper airway [2]. When the mandible was displaced anteriorly by the twin-block appliance, it influenced the position of the hyoid bone and consequently the position of the tongue and thus improved the morphology of the upper airway [30]. Recently, Jena et al. [14] also reported increase in the PAP dimension following twin-block therapy among subjects with retrognathic mandible. Schutz et al. [13] found that after class II correction, the anterior displacement of the mandible and the hyoid bone caused an anterior traction of the tongue, which increased the posterior airway space by 3.2  mm and reduced the airway resistance. However in contrast to our study, Fastuca et al.

The comparison of these angles among the three groups before treatment revealed that the skeletal class II individuals were mainly due to <b>mandibular</b> <b>retrusion,</b> whereas retrusive maxilla was the significant cause of class III malocclusions, {{which is consistent with}} the report of Ellis and McNamara [29]. Comparing the difference within each group, significant changes of SNA, SNB angulation (p < 0.05) were found in class II individuals, with the ANB angle decreased 1.29 ° after orthodontic treatment, which corrected the skeletal disharmony of maxilla and mandible. No significant changes of SNA angle or SNB angle were observed in class I and class III groups (p > 0.05), while the ANB angle decreased significantly in class I group (p < 0.05). The changes of ANB angle in class I subjects agreed with normal growth conditions, by observing 28 untreated class I malocclusion subjects from 6 to 20  years of age, in which studies showed that the ANB angle decreased continuously until age 14  years [30]. Ochoa and Nanda [30] also stated that the maxillomandibular convergence increased with age as described by decreasing in MP-SN angle, but {{in the present}} study, we found that the angle between the mandibular plane and SN plane remained stable after treatment in all of the three groups (p > 0.05).|$|R
