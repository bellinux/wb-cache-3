40|$|The present paper {{analyses}} {{the performance}} of CrN single-layers produced by electron beam PAPVD (EBPAPVD), finding that both corrosion and wear resistance are directly dependant on the structure and stoichiometry of the nitride.

This fact, {{which has not been}} described in the literature, causes different structure and morphology of the individual films <b>providing</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>properties</b> to the coating. For corrosion resistance, the CrN layer's greater compactness impedes penetration of the electrolyte and thus prevents the formation of a galvanic couple between the coating and the substrate.
