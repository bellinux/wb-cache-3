Because the area model that can completely describe the characteristics of area grid is complex and difficult for the design of <b>area</b> <b>controller,</b> the balanced truncation method is used to reduce the order of the area model in advance. Considering that the reduced model has the same physical meanings of the input and output variables to the original area model, an area power system stabilizer (PSS) is designed using the output-feedback control method based on the reduced model. The simulation results demonstrate that the reduced model can keep the input-output dynamic characteristics of the original model well, and that the designed area PSS is effective...|$|R

40|$|Significant IP {{mobility}} mechanisms {{have been}} designed to minimize the handover overhead of mobile nodes. Although many efficient algorithms such as Mobile IP, HMIP and PMIP have been proposed, they did not attempt to upgrade their paging mechanisms that also heavily affect the power consumption of mobile nodes. Considering a good paging scheme is important because more than 95 % of mobile nodes are moving in the idle state and change their states to active only for <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> updates. However, existing paging schemes assume the configuration of fixed <b>paging</b> <b>areas</b> and do not explore the dynamic nature of a <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> size depending on the states of mobile nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic IP paging scheme, where a <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> size is configured dynamically based on the speed and direction of a mobile node. The performance evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed IP paging scheme reduces the power consumption, compared to a fixed IP paging scheme...|$|R

40|$|Cellular {{telephones}} save {{power by}} {{switching to a}} low power, or dormant, mode {{when there is no}} active traffic. In dormant mode, the telephone periodically checks for a beacon, and if the beacon indicates that the phone has moved to a new <b>paging</b> <b>area,</b> the telephone performs a <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> update. <b>Paging</b> <b>area</b> update signaling requires considerably less power than is required to move an active traffic channel. When a call comes in, the network pages the telephone by flood signaling the <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> on a special channel, and the telephone brings up an active traffic channel. Recent work has attempted to extend paging to IP networks, in particular, networks running the Mobile IP mobility management protocol. In this paper, we compare Mobile IPv 6 and IP paging for dormant mode location updating. Simulations are presented for a typical macrocellular scenario and a hotspot scenario, where broadband microcells supplement the narrowband macrocells. The results show that Mobile IPv 6 dormant mode location management is roughly comparable to IP paging...|$|R
