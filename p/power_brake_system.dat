40|$|Abstract：The full <b>power</b> {{hydraulic}} <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{has several}} advantages over traditional <b>brake</b> actuation <b>systems.</b> These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume service brakes with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>systems.</b> Implementation of full <b>power</b> hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> and develop a dynamic model for a hydraulic brake valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of full <b>power</b> hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (brake valve, accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full <b>power</b> hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> using a test bench, which is a loader <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full <b>power</b> hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> dynamics...|$|R

50|$|The term 'power {{hydraulic}} brakes' {{can also}} refer to systems operating on very different principles where an engine-driven pump maintains continual hydraulic pressure {{in a central}} accumulator. The driver's brake pedal simply controls a valve to bleed pressure into the brake units at the wheels, rather than actually creating the pressure in a master cylinder by depressing a piston. This form of brake is analogous to an air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> but with hydraulic fluid as the working medium rather than air. However, on an air brake air is vented from the <b>system</b> when the <b>brakes</b> are released and the reserve of compressed air must be replenished. On a <b>power</b> hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> fluid at low pressure is returned from the brake units at the wheels to the engine-driven pump as the brakes are released, so the central pressure accumulator is almost instantly re-pressurised. This makes the power hydraulic system highly suitable for vehicles that must frequently stop and start (such as buses in cities). The continually circulating fluid also removes problems with freezing parts and collected water vapour that can afflict air systems in cold climates. The AEC Routemaster bus is a well-known application of <b>power</b> hydraulic <b>brakes</b> and the successive generations of Citroen cars with hydropneumatic suspension also used fully <b>powered</b> hydraulic <b>brakes</b> rather than conventional automotive <b>brake</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{structural}} flaws of the funicular trains, {{especially the}} lack of safety mechanisms, {{were found to have}} played a role in the tragedy. Each funicular unit had its fire extinguishers out of the passengers' reach in the sealed attendants' compartments. No smoke detectors were installed. There was no cellphone reception within the tunnels, which meant that passengers had no method of contacting the attendant. Professor Joseph Nejez, a funicular train expert, said that the designers throughout the years had a perception that a fire could not occur since no fire had occurred in a funicular cabin prior to the Kaprun disaster. The train complied with area safety codes, which did not address the systems installed on the train during its 1993 upgrade.

Because of numerous advantages in comparison to a traditional air block brake, disc brakes, {{are more and more}} often utilized in passenger carriages and other railway vehicles. Stable and constant – in the whole speed range – coefficient of friction µ, with the value: µ = 0. 35 is a basic advantage of disc <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> [7]. Attempt to increase train speed, triggers application of greater <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> i. e. <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> rapidly absorbing and dispersing stored heat energy. For stimulation of cooling processes of friction set (brake disc and friction pad), discs with ventilation canals shaped by various vanes, are used.

However, natural ventilation causes losses of energy for rotation of the disc during ride with switched off brakes, which is especially important for trains with little frequency of brakings and in cases when the profile of the track does not stimulate long-lasting braking. This article presents selected issues of operational use of rail disc brake such us total resistance generated by brake disc divided into resistance of disc inertia as mass in rotational motion and resistance generated by disc’s ventilator, and influence of blocked ventilation canals on braking process...|$|R

50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>brakes</b> are a <b>system</b> of {{hydraulics}} used to {{slow down}} or stop most motor vehicles. It uses a combination of mechanical components to multiply the force applied to the brake pedal by the driver into enough force to actuate the brakes and stop a vehicle that can weigh several tons. The brake pedal {{is connected to the}} vacuum booster which is the first step of the force multiplication. The booster passes the force to the master cylinder which compresses a liquid and forces it through the brake lines to the brakes themselves. The liquid that is pushed into the brakes activates the brake calipers which in the case of disc brakes, push against the brake rotor causing friction that slows and eventually stops the rotation of the vehicles wheels. In drum brakes, pistons push two shoes against the brake drum accomplishing the same effect.|$|R
