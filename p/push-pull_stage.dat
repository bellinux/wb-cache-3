5000|$|For example, in a {{push-pull}} {{power amplifier}} using vacuum tubes, the signal {{is most often}} split by a phase splitter (aka phase inverter) stage which produces two signals, one in phase, and the other out of phase, that is, phase inverted. These two complementary signals then drive {{the two halves of}} the first <b>push-pull</b> <b>stage,</b> which may be either the output stage or the driver stage. The other common arrangements for driving a <b>push-pull</b> <b>stage</b> are by using an isolation transformer to produce the split signals, or by using the in-phase half of the first <b>push-pull</b> <b>stage</b> to drive the other half. A common circuit using this last technique is the long-tailed pair, often seen in television sets and oscilloscopes. In solid state electronics all of these techniques can be used, and phase inversion can also be produced by the use of NPN/PNP complementary circuitry, which has no corresponding technique in vacuum tube designs.|$|E
50|$|If {{the output}} of an {{amplifier}} stage is simply tuned to a multiple of {{the frequency with which}} the stage is driven, the stage will give a large harmonic output. Many transmitters have used this simple approach successfully. However these more complex circuits will do a better job. In a push-push stage, the output will only contain even harmonics. This is because the currents which would generate the fundamental and the odd harmonics in this circuit are canceled by the second device. In a <b>push-pull</b> <b>stage,</b> the output will contain only odd harmonics because of the canceling effect.|$|E
5000|$|A {{practical}} circuit using class-B elements is the <b>push-pull</b> <b>stage,</b> such as {{the very}} simplified complementary pair arrangement shown at right. Complementary devices are each used for amplifying the opposite halves of the input signal, which is then recombined at the output. This arrangement gives good efficiency, but usually suffers from the drawback {{that there is a}} small mismatch in the cross-over region at the [...] "joins" [...] between the two halves of the signal, as one output device has to take over supplying power exactly as the other finishes. This is called crossover distortion. An improvement is to bias the devices so they are not completely off when they are not in use. This approach is called class AB operation.|$|E

50|$|A class - B {{push-pull}} amplifier {{is more efficient}} than a class-A power amplifier because each output device amplifies only half the output waveform and is cut off during the opposite half. It can be shown that the theoretical full power efficiency (AC power in load compared to DC power consumed) of a <b>push-pull</b> <b>stage</b> is approximately 78.5%. This compares with a class-A amplifier which has efficiency of 25% if directly driving the load {{and no more than}} 50% for a transformer coupled output. A {{push-pull amplifier}} draws little power with zero signal, compared to a class-A amplifier that draws constant power. Power dissipation in the output devices is roughly one-fifth of the output power rating of the amplifier. A class-A amplifier, by contrast, must use a device capable of dissipating several times the output power.|$|E
50|$|In early {{vacuum tube}} audio amplifiers, {{center-tapped}} transformers were sometimes {{used as the}} phase inverter to drive the two output tubes of a <b>push-pull</b> <b>stage.</b> The technique is nearly as old as electronic amplification and is well documented, for example, in The Radiotron Designer's Handbook, Third Edition of 1940. This technique was carried over into transistor designs also, {{part of the reason}} for which was that capacitors were large, expensive and unreliable. However, since that era, capacitors have become vastly smaller, cheaper and more reliable, whereas transformers are still relatively expensive. Furthermore, as designers acquired more experience with transistors, they stopped trying to treat them like tubes. Coupling a class A intermediate amplification stage to a class AB power stage using a transformer doesn't make sense anymore even in small systems powered from a single-voltage supply. Modern higher-end equipment is based on dual-supply designs which eliminates coupling. It is possible for an amplifier, from the input all the way to the loudspeaker, to be DC coupled without any capacitance or inductance.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, high-efficiency low-noise power {{supplies}} for portable {{equipment such as}} cellular phones and personal digital assistance (PDA) are in great demand. Low-dropout regulators (LDRs) are usually used to obtain this stable and low-noise supply voltage. Therefore, the stability and {{the accuracy of the}} output voltage of the LDR are very important {{in the design of the}} power supply. Generally, a cascade error amplifier for achieving a high loop gain is commonly employed in the design of the LDR in order to obtain an accurate output voltage. However, as the input voltage of the portable equipment decreases, the supply voltage of the LDRs is also reduced. This will lower the design margin of the LDR and the cascade error amplifier can no longer be used. One way to solve this problem is to use the cascade error amplifier. Nevertheless, the poles introduced by the high impedance nodes of the error amplifier will cause the LDR to be unstable and make the frequency compensation of the LDR very difficult. In this thesis, the loop-gain frequency compensation on LDRs with low supply voltage is discussed. A systematic loop-gain compensation method based on the nested Miller compensation (NMC) is introduced. Theoretical analysis on the proposed loop-gain compensation is studied thoroughly.
