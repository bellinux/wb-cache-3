25|$|In 1961, Family Radio {{began running}} the Open Forum, a live, weeknight call-in program that Camping hosted until 2011. Listeners {{were invited to}} call in, {{primarily}} with questions {{about the meaning of}} certain passages from the Bible, and Camping answered them by means of interpretations, often with reference to other Biblical passages. Occasionally, questions were posed relating to general Christian doctrine, ranging from the nature of sin and salvation, to matters involving everyday life, such as marriage, sexual morality and education. The Open Forum continued running until Camping's <b>partial</b> <b>retirement</b> in July 2011, and was broadcast on the more than 150 stations owned by Family Radio in the United States. The Open Forum was also translated into many foreign languages and (together with other Family Radio programming) was broadcast worldwide via shortwave station WYFR, a network of AM and FM radio stations, a cable television station and the Internet. In October 2012, over a year after the failure of Camping's prophecies, Family Radio began airing repeats of his broadcasts.|$|E

Extensions in unemployment benefit for older claimants were introduced, while the benefit for the young unemployed was extended to age 21. In 1986, a child-rearing allowance was introduced to benefit parents when at least one was employed. Informal carers were offered an attendance allowance together with tax incentives, both of which were established with the tax reforms of 1990, and were also guaranteed up to 25 hours a month of professional support, which was supplemented by four weeks of annual holiday relief. In 1984, an early retirement scheme was introduced that offered incentives to employers to replace elderly workers with applicants off the unemployment register. In 1989 a <b>partial</b> <b>retirement</b> plan was introduced under which elderly employees could work half-time and receive 70% of their former salary [...] "and be credited with 90 per cent of the full social insurance entitlement." [...] In 1984, a Mother and Child Fund was established, providing discretionary grants [...] "to forestall abortions on grounds of material hardship," [...] and in 1986 a 10 Bn DM package of Erziehungsgeld (childcare allowance) was introduced, although according to various studies, this latter initiative was heavily counterbalanced by cuts. In 1989, special provisions were introduced for the older unemployed.|$|E
40|$|This study {{comprises}} three essays exploring {{new questions}} {{in regard to}} the role of health insurance in retirement decisions and the financial value of avoiding perceived crime. In ``Love, Toil, and Health Insurance: Why American Husbands Retire When They Do,'' the chapter examines the relationship of both spouses' health insurance options to the household's timing of the husband's retirement. Previous literature has largely ignored the inter-spousal dependence of health insurance benefits. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, an important finding is that a wife's health insurance options have an independent impact on the timing of her husband's exit from the labor force. This impact is similar in magnitude to that of a husband's own health insurance options. In ``The Lasting Effects of Crime: The Relationship of Methamphetamine Laboratory Discoveries and Home Values,'' the chapter presents estimates of a household's willingness to pay to avoid crime while minimizing concerns of omitted variable bias. By assuming methamphetamine producers locate approximately at random within a narrowly defined neighborhood, this study has been able to use hedonic estimation methods to estimate the impact of the discovery of that lab on the home values near that location. Though more evidence is necessary, one interpretation is that the impact on property values reflects the valuation of the perceived risk of crime. The estimates found in this study range from a decrease in sale prices of six to ten percent in the year following a laboratory's discovery compared to the prices for homes that are slightly farther away. The third essay, ``The Impact of Health Insurance Availability on Retirement Decision Reversals,'' also uses the longitudinal aspect of the Health and Retirement Study to explore the characteristics associated with reversals in retirement. Through the use of survival time analysis, this essay shows that health insurance plays a significant role in unretirement decisions. This role is underestimated when a static probit analysis is used with characteristics at the time of an individual's retirement. The results are robust to various definitions of retirement prompted by the difficult question of how to classify <b>partial</b> <b>retirements...</b>|$|R

30|$|Therefore, {{the aim of}} {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the determinants of two forms of accessing pension benefits by men aged between 60 and 65 in Spain: either <b>partial</b> or full <b>retirement.</b> Special interest is devoted both to assess the explanatory power of different measures capturing the economic incentives embedded in the social security system into the alternative retirement routes and to identify if these incentives can influence the choice between them. It is of main interest to know what drives retirement decisions in order to design suitable policies. The idea is that if a policy whose aim is to retain old workers at work is not well designed, it will create greater incentives to leave earlier the contributory life.|$|R

(2002), who use data on the preferred labour supply—respectively in Ireland and the Netherlands—to estimate labour supply, wage elasticities and the impact of tax reforms. van Soest and Vonkova (2014) exploit stated preferences collected by the Dutch CentER Panel about different hypothetical retirement trajectories with different ages of (<b>partial</b> or full) <b>retirement</b> and different replacement rates. They use the information to estimate parameters of the utility function in order to simulate the sensitivity of retirement decisions to financial incentives, showing substantial differences between results based on observed or desired labour supply.|$|R

40|$|The {{changing}} social, {{financial and}} regulatory frameworks, {{such as an}} increasingly aging society, the current low interest rate environment, {{as well as the}} implementation of Solvency II, lead to the search for new product forms for private pension provision. In order to address the various issues, these product forms should reduce or avoid investment guarantees and risks stemming from longevity, still provide reliable insurance benefits and simultaneously take account of the increasing financial resources required for very high ages. In this context, we examine whether a historical concept of insurance, the tontine, entails enough innovative potential to extend and improve the prevailing privately funded pension solutions in a modern way. The tontine basically generates an age-increasing cash flow, which can help to match the increasing financing needs at old ages. However, the tontine generates volatile cash flows, so that - especially {{in the context of an}} aging society - the insurance character of the tontine cannot be guaranteed in every situation. We show that <b>partial</b> tontinization of <b>retirement</b> wealth can serve as a reliable supplement to existing pension products...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper investigates whether permanent, {{one-time}} retirements {{are coming}} to an end just as the trend towards earlier and earlier retirements did nearly 20 years ago. We explore how common bridge jobs are among today’s retirees, and how uncommon traditional retirements have become. Methods: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we explore the work histories and retirement patterns of a cohort of retirees aged 51 to 61 in 1992 over a ten-year time period in both a cross-sectional and longitudinal context. Bridge job determinants are examined using bivariate comparisons and a multinomial logistic regression model of the bridge job decision. Results: We find that one-half to two-thirds of the HRS respondents with full-time career jobs take on bridge jobs before exiting the labor force completely. We also find that bridge job behavior is most common among younger respondents, respondents without defined-benefit pension plans, and respondents at the lower- and upper-end of the wage distribution. Implications: The evidence suggests that changes in the retirement income landscape since the 1980 s appear to be taking root. Going forward, traditional retirements will be {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Economics of Aging; <b>Partial</b> Retirement; Gradual <b>Retirement...</b>|$|R
40|$|In a 2 ̆ 7 greying 2 ̆ 7 Australia {{demographic}} realities {{should be}} articulated clearly {{so as to}} meet the challenges of the future. The aged population will 2 ̆ 7 peak 2 ̆ 7 in 2021 A. D., and there is an increasing social awareness of this population trend. While the causes of longevity remain to be established, the improvement of individual life expectancy means that many seniors will spend decades in 2 ̆ 7 retirement 2 ̆ 7. Women, those of non- English speaking backgrounds, and aboriginals are sections of the aged population having special prob+ems. Comparative social policy, however, suggests that the future funding of aged care is not problematical, though national commitment is required. These demographic changes are likely to suggest a range of investigations for 2 ̆ 7 theoretical 2 ̆ 7 gerontology, along with improving career opportunities for the range of aged care professionals. As a discipline, gerontology has shifted over time from mostly medical orientations to include more of a societal approach. Gerontology, concerned with the ageing of individuals and populations within their historical, cultural and societal contexts, exhibits a pluralist diversity with regard to its disciplinary origins and paradigmatic orientations. Applied gerontological research, particularly at the local level, often concentrates on seniors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and upon aged services. While the social custom of retirement remains as the main definitional determinant of 2 ̆ 7 old age 2 ̆ 7, ongoing social change renders prediction about this institution difficult. While the typical Australian can now expect to enjoy a 2 ̆ 7 third age 2 ̆ 7 of active retirement, contending social forces seem to be pushing for both 2 ̆ 7 early 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 postponed 2 ̆ 7 retirement. Hence maximum feasible personal choice should exist with regard to the timing and extent of retirement, with options such as <b>partial</b> and phased <b>retirement</b> being given greater social acceptance. The greying Australian population is gaining attention at all levels of government, which should enhance future social planning and program provisions, so with the vigorous development of gerontology and the diminution of ageist prejudice within the general society, seniors of the future should enjoy greater opportunities for a 2 ̆ 7 successful 2 ̆ 7 ageing process in terms of biographical adjustment and continuing intergenerational contribution to the community...|$|R
