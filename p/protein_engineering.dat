25|$|In bio{{technology}}, {{flow cytometry}} is a laser- or impedance-based, biophysical technology employed in cell counting, cell sorting, biomarker detection and <b>protein</b> <b>engineering,</b> by suspending cells {{in a stream}} of fluid and passing them through an electronic detection apparatus. A flow cytometer allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical and chemical characteristics of up to thousands of particles per second.|$|E
25|$|The {{technology}} has applications {{in a number}} of fields, including molecular biology, pathology, immunology, plant biology and marine biology. It has broad application in medicine especially in transplantation, hematology, tumor immunology and chemotherapy, prenatal diagnosis, genetics and sperm sorting for sex preselection. Also, it is extensively used in research for the detection of DNA damage, caspase cleavage and apoptosis. In neuroscience, co-expression of cell surface and intracellular antigens can also be analyzed. In marine biology, the autofluorescent properties of photosynthetic plankton can be exploited by flow cytometry in order to characterise abundance and community structure. In <b>protein</b> <b>engineering,</b> flow cytometry is used in conjunction with yeast display and bacterial display to identify cell surface-displayed protein variants with desired properties.|$|E
500|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>engineering</b> with {{homologous}} recombination develops chimeric proteins by swapping fragments between two parental proteins. [...] These techniques exploit {{the fact that}} recombination can introduce {{a high degree of}} sequence diversity while preserving a protein's ability to fold into its tertiary structure, or three-dimensional shape. [...] This stands in contrast to other <b>protein</b> <b>engineering</b> techniques, like random point mutagenesis, in which the probability of maintaining protein function declines exponentially with increasing amino acid substitutions. [...] The chimeras produced by recombination techniques are able to maintain their ability to fold because their swapped parental fragments are structurally and evolutionarily conserved. [...] These recombinable [...] "building blocks" [...] preserve structurally important interactions like points of physical contact between different amino acids in the protein's structure. [...] Computational methods like SCHEMA and statistical coupling analysis can be used to identify structural subunits suitable for recombination.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} work {{is to develop a}} {{computational}} method based on machine learning techniques for predicting disulfide-bonding states of cysteine residues in proteins, which is a sub-problem of a bigger and yet unsolved problem of protein structure prediction. Improvement in the prediction of disulfide bonding states of cysteine residues will help in putting a constraint in the three dimensional (3 D) space of the respective protein structure, and thus will eventually help in the prediction of 3 D structure of proteins. Results of this work will have direct implications in site-directed mutational studies of <b>proteins,</b> <b>proteins</b> <b>engineering</b> and the problem of protein folding. We have used a combination of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), the so-called Hidden Neural Network (HNN) as a machine learning technique to develop our prediction method. By using different global and local features of proteins (specifically profiles, parity of cysteine residues, average cysteine conservation, correlated mutation, sub-cellular localization, and signal peptide) as inputs and considering Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes separately we have reached to a remarkable accuracy of 94...|$|R

Cyclosporin A is an immunosuppressive agent in organ transplantation, while statins produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus serve as blood cholesterol lowering agents, competitively inhibiting the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol.|$|E
500|$|Techniques {{that rely}} on {{homologous}} recombination {{have been used to}} engineer new proteins.

[...] The chimeric proteins acquired an ability to catalyze an essential reaction in isoprenoid biosynthesis—one of the most diverse pathways of biosynthesis found in nature—that was absent in the parent proteins.

500|$|The {{importance}} of antibodies {{in health care}} and the biotechnology industry demands knowledge of their structures at high resolution. This information is used for <b>protein</b> <b>engineering,</b> modifying the antigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody. X-ray crystallography is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However, crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time-consuming. Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but their results are more equivocal, since they do not produce empirical structures. Online web servers such as Web Antibody Modeling (WAM) [...] and Prediction of Immunoglobulin Structure (PIGS) [...] enables computational modeling of antibody variable regions. Rosetta Antibody is a novel antibody FV region structure prediction server, which incorporates sophisticated techniques to minimize CDR loops and optimize the relative orientation of the light and heavy chains, as well as homology models that predict successful docking of antibodies with their unique antigen.|$|E

500|$|Complementary to {{the field}} of {{structural}} genomics, protein structure prediction develops efficient mathematical models of proteins to computationally predict their structures in theory, instead of detecting structures with laboratory observation. The most successful type of structure prediction, known as homology modeling, relies on the existence of a [...] "template" [...] structure with sequence similarity to the protein being modeled; structural genomics' goal is to provide sufficient representation in solved structures to model most of those that remain. Although producing accurate models remains a challenge when only distantly related template structures are available, {{it has been suggested that}} sequence alignment is the bottleneck in this process, as quite accurate models can be produced if a [...] "perfect" [...] sequence alignment is known. Many structure prediction methods have served to inform the emerging field of <b>protein</b> <b>engineering,</b> in which novel protein folds have already been designed. A more complex computational problem is the prediction of intermolecular interactions, such as in molecular docking and protein–protein interaction prediction.|$|E

The well-known optimisation algorithms are usually applied {{on the model}} which contains hard constraints over coordinates of the atoms.
