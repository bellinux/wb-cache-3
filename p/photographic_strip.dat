50|$|In {{response}} to the Caucasian characters that dominated {{the market in the}} 1960s and 1970s, James Richard Abe Bailey was inspired to produce African Film. The magazine was a look-read or Photo-comic designed for Pan-African distribution and readership, and was published under the banner of Drum Publications of South Africa. Drum Publications bought the stories from local African students, and had them edited in Johannesburg, South Africa. Malcolm Dunkfeld, a white South African, was the editor in charge of the African Film in Johannesburg. The scripts were then sent to Swaziland, where photographers led by Stanley N. Bunn and Trevor Barrett took photos of black actors acting out the stories. The completed <b>photographic</b> <b>strips</b> were then sent to London, where they would be printed, before being shipped back to South Africa for distribution to West Africa, East Africa, and South Africa.|$|R
50|$|As {{one would}} weave a {{traditional}} grass mat in Vietnam, Dinh Q. Lê uses <b>photographic</b> <b>strips</b> and weaves {{them into an}} image. His woven photographs consist of several layers, which immediately attract and combine one's perception into mixed feelings. A mixture of joyfulness and sorrow {{is seen in the}} interlacing of a colorful fantasy and mournful pictures of the Vietnam War. Viewers need to spend some time in seeking and following the woven patterns in order to fully appreciate the intricate composition of imagery. Viewers enjoy searching for the significance and deep feelings in one strip overlapping another. While visually entering a state of seeking the cinematic montage fading {{in and out of the}} images, Dinh Q. Lê's meticulous effort in creating these unique images is being admired. Francesco Bonami (curator of the 50th Venice Biennale) highlighted his distinctive photo-weavings artwork, and an entire room is dedicated for his works in the Italian Pavilion in 2003.|$|R

This unique circle of strong radar backscatter distinguishes the solitary impact structure from numerous dayas (similarly appearing karstic depressions) which characterize the region. The crater is prominent on radar, but is obscure on optically obtained satellite and aircraft images, as are partly buried fluvial drainage systems and fault-block traces developed in bedrocks of the Chebka. Radar detection of an annular drainage system indicates possible presence of a ring graben at the crater.

40|$|From 14 March to 6 April 2002 aerial {{surveys were}} {{carried out in the}} Greenland Sea packice to assess the pup {{production}} of the Greenland Sea population of harp seals Pagophilus groenlandicus. One xed-wing twin-engined aircraft was used for reconnaissance rights and <b>photographic</b> <b>strip</b> transect surveys of the whelping patches once they had been located and identifed. A helicopter assisted in the reconnaissance rights, and was used subsequently to by visual strip transect surveys over the whelping patches. The helicopter was also used to collect data for estimating the distribution of births over time. Three harp seal breeding patches (A, B and C) were located and surveyed either visually and/or photographically. Using traditional strip-transect analysis, the total estimate of pup production, including the visual survey of Patch A, both visual and photographic surveys of Patch B, and photographic survey of Patch C, was calculated at 98 500 (SE = 16 800), giving a coencient of variation for the survey of 17. 9 %. A new approach in analysis of this type of data, using a spatial analysis method, has been developed recently. It is the aim of this work to apply this new method to the data obtained in the 2002 photographic surveys (i. e., patches B and C), and to compare the results obtained (both point estimates and variances) with previous results obtained in the traditional strip-transect analysis...|$|E
40|$|MSc (Computer Science), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 In the 1930 s, the Carnegie Institute in Washington DC {{initiated}} {{the construction of}} cosmic ray observation centres around the world. Cosmic ray activity was recorded using the model C cosmic ray ionization chamber which uses a Lindemann electrometer. Seven of these chambers were constructed at seven stations around the world. These chambers recorded cosmic ray data by projecting {{the shadow of the}} electrometer needle onto a continuously moving strip of 60 mm photographic paper. Hour markers were recorded by dimming the lamp for three minutes at the start of each hour, while also grounding the ionization chamber. By grounding the ionization chamber the electrometer needle was returned to the zero position. The photographic paper moved about 25 mm an hour. Approximately 114 station-years of data was recorded between 1935 and 1960 (Hardy, 2006). It is important to digitize these recordings in order to preserve the data for further study of cosmic rays from this time period. This digitization process consists of binarizing digital images of the <b>photographic</b> <b>strip</b> to extract the cosmic ray data. By binarizing these images the data is recorded in an easily usable format for future research. This study focuses on extraction of the cosmic ray data using an adaptive binarization method that is able to cope {{with a wide variety of}} images, ranging from images that are almost too bright to distinguish the data lines from the background, to images that are too dark to distinguish the data lines at all. This study starts off with a brief explanation of cosmic rays, how these were recorded before the 1950 s and how the rays are recorded today. Two research methodologies were used to create a method to adaptively binarize and extract data from the historic cosmic ray recordings. A literature study of image processing techniques was conducted, focusing specifically on popular adaptive document binarization methods. During the experimental phase of this study, these methods or parts thereof were applied to the data to determine which techniques would give the most accurate results. Experimentation is the primary research methodology. The iterative experimental phase is discussed in detail as an algorithm is formed to successfully binarize and extract the historic cosmic ray data as well as the temperature of the electrometer while recording. The study concludes with an interpretation of the results obtained in the experimental phase. The success of the algorithm is measured by comparing the resulting data graph to the original. The conclusion of this study is that an adaptive method can be applied to historical recordings of cosmic ray activity to extract numerical data from a wide variety of images without any additional user input.

50|$|In May 1896 Auguste Berthier {{published}} {{an article about the}} history of stereoscopic images in French scientific magazine Le Cosmos, which included his method of creating an autostereogram. Alternating strips from the left and right image of a traditional stereoscopic negative had to be recomposed as an interlaced image, preferably during the printing of the image on paper. A glass plate with opaque lines had to be fixed in front of the interlaced print with a few millimeters in between, so the lines on the screen formed a parallax barrier: from the right distance and angle each eye could only see the <b>photographic</b> <b>strips</b> shot from the corresponding angle. The article was illustrated with a diagram of the principle, an image of the two parts of a stereoscopic photograph divided into exaggerated wide bands, and the same strips recomposed as an interlaced image. Berthier's idea was hardly noticed. After Frederic Ives' similar autostereograms were presented at the French Academy of Sciences in 1904, Berthier reminded the institute about his autostereograms that he in the meantime had also managed to create in color.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} cameras {{the circular}} flow camera used a single vertical slit {{instead of a}} shutter; a strip of film moved horizontally across the fine vertical opening located in the focal plane. This limited the field of vision {{to no more than}} a few inches, the restricted field being aligned with the vertical line on the winning post on which the lens was focused. The strip film moved across the slit in the opposite direction to the race and at substantially the same speed as the rate of movement of the image of the horses as each passed the finishing line. This kept the image of the horses more or less stationary with respect to the film. As soon as the first horse started to pass over the line, the camera began to record its image on the moving film from the nose backwards, progressively along the length of the body, with the arrival of every horse at the finishing post in succession. This produced a <b>strip</b> <b>photographic</b> record of the horses as they passed the vertical plane (winning post). Film was advanced continuously at a pace equivalent to the average speed of a racing horse, resulting in distortions of length (slower-moving horses appear to be stretched), but still preserving the order of finishers.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mechanical}} stress on a photographic emulsion, namely Kodak Royal-X Panchromatic, has been investigated. The effects {{are related to}} the phenomenon of 2 ̆ 2 Kink Desensitization 2 ̆ 2 of the photographic emulsion. Despite the numerous experiments, results and explanations by previous authors on this phenomenon, a model relating the effects of mechanical stress on emulsions and dislocation theory of strained crystals still evades the <b>photographic</b> scientist. <b>Strips</b> of emulsion were axially stressed, using a Dillon tensiometer modified for compression. To analyze the changes in photo graphic sensitivity of the emulsion, the characteristic curves of the developed internal and external images were compared {{as a function of the}} applied stress. Both surface and deep internal developers were utilized to analyze changes in the position of latent image formation in a strained crystal. The parameter used to correlate the effect of stress on the emulsion was the change in optical density, AD, between the stressed and unstressed portion of the emulsion. Then, aging experiments were conducted on the stressed samples to investigate the effect of time on surface desensitization. Aging experiments were conducted in the temperature range between 249 K and 318 K. This allowed the calculation of the activation energy of the aging process which was found to be 0. 42 0. 03 eV. In general, it was found that the effect of stress is to produce a surface desensitization and an internal sensitization of the stressed emulsion, and that both of these phenomena were related to the applied stress. Maximum surface desensitization AD equal to 0. 16, occurred at 3500 kg/cm 2. The effect of stress first becomes apparent at an applied stress of 400 kg/cm 2 which, in this study is assumed to be the yield stress of iodobromide crystals in a gelatin medium. Shifts in characteristic curves due to stress showed a decrease in surface sensitivity and an increase in internal sensitivity. Aging of stressed emulsions at room temperature after stressing but prior to exposure, indicated a process resulting in the decrease of surface desensitization. The value of the activation energy calcu lated for the aging process is similar to that found by previous authors to be for the diffusion of impurities to the dislocations mainly due to elastic forces. The results are discussed in terms of plastic deformation of silver halide crystals and subsequent formation of dislocations in the strained crystal. The forces associated with the dislocations and their associations with impurities were discussed in order to attempt a model explanation of the 2 ̆ 2 Kink Desensitization 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The Waitakaruru Arboretum and Sculpture Park {{is located}} on the Waikato-side of a border that {{separates}} the Waikato and Matamata-Piako district council areas. The arboretum {{can be found at the}} southern end of the Waikato/Matamata-Piako border. MÄ?ori first settled in the area in the early 1300 's, although little is known today of the area's pre-colonial history. European missionaries arrived in the 1830 's to establish the first missions. Traders then arrived in growing numbers during the 1850 's, and the first permanent PÄ?kehÄ? settlements were established from 1865 following the MÄ?ori land wars and subsequent land confiscations, which resulted in large tracts of swamp being cleared by PÄ?kehÄ? for agricultural farming. The original boundary line that separates the Waikato and Matamata/Piako Districts was first drawn in 1864 following the land wars, and was later used to determine the then new council boundaries in 1876 when the District Councils were first established. The boundary includes one particularly long perfectly straight line at about 10 degrees counter-clockwise from true north on the compass. This boundary line stretches for over 43 kms from the Orakei Stream in the north to Pukemoremore Hill just south of the Waitakaruru Arboretum. The boundary line encompasses mainly farmland plus 3 roads along its path: Manuel Road, Valentine Road and Pukemoremore Road. Although not easily visible from the ground, the scale of this 43 km long perfectly straight divide can be clearly seen from the air. absolute divide reflects the artificial border or aukati that separates the Waikato and Matamata-Piako districts. Using locally produced timber for fencing, plus sheets of marine plywood for the image substrate, a series of 180 vertical aerial photographs have been digitally stitched together to make one long single image that has been printed directly onto plywood using the latest eco-printing technology. Governments and the military use vertical aerial photography for land surveying and human surveillance purposes.
