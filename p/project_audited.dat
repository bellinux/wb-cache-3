40|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that {{benefits}} from successful project implementation can be achieved by governance over the formal controls and project practices, there is still evidence of high project failure rates across a broad range of industries. It is all too often found that significant effort and emphasis is placed on reviewing the project from the project managers' perspective (with the emphasis on financial and technical aspects), and that independent parties do not perform formal controls. It is understood that an independent <b>project</b> <b>audit</b> would result in an objective report and that all parties involved may not necessarily share the same view. A proposed approach is to have <b>project</b> <b>audits</b> carried out by reviewing the implementation of critical success factors against accepted project standards. These results are tabulated in a matrix that allows for the documentation of success factor implementation and opens up the possibility for scoring the extent of the implementation. This article adds to recent research done in an effort to identify critical success factors and identify new methods for determining them, while focusing on the concept of <b>project</b> <b>audit...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. 1996 {{will see}} the {{introduction}} of summative assessment of general practitioner registrars (trainees). One part of this assessment is the written submission of practical work. In the west of Scotland, <b>audit</b> <b>projects</b> have been chosen as the format for practical work. A valid and reliable marking schedule for such projects is needed. AIM. A study was undertaken to develop a criterion-referenced marking schedule for assessing registrars' <b>audit</b> <b>projects</b> for summative assessment. METHOD. Medical and non-medical professionals, {{in a series of}} workshops, compiled a list of essential elements of good audit. These features were tested and refined using registrars' <b>audit</b> <b>projects.</b> All trainers in the west of Scotland were then sent a list of 14 criteria and asked to indicate whether each criterion was an essential or desirable component of a registrar's <b>audit</b> <b>project</b> for summative assessment. A final workshop was held to develop an audit marking schedule. RESULTS. Of 155 trainers in the west of Scotland, 135 replied to the list of criteria for registrar <b>audit</b> <b>projects</b> (87 %). Ten criteria were deemed essential or desirable by 80 % or more of the respondents. Participants in the final workshop selected five criteria which would form the <b>audit</b> <b>project</b> marking schedule for registrars undergoing summative assessment. These were: defined reason for choice of <b>audit</b> <b>project,</b> relevance of criteria chosen, appropriate preparation and planning, appropriate interpretation of relevant data and detailed proposals for change. For an <b>audit</b> <b>project</b> to pass assessment all five criteria must be present. CONCLUSION. A criterion-referenced approach to assessing registrars' <b>audit</b> <b>projects,</b> developed from their trainers' opinions of essential or desirable criteria for good audit, is described. Further evaluation of the criterion-referenced marking schedule is required...|$|R

40|$|Many {{disasters}} {{are related}} to geotechnical failure. Both for risk management and for future research {{it is important to}} know what new knowledge is needed to prevent these disasters. Therefore elev-en geotechnical disasters or failing projects of the last ten years in modern countries are studied and com-pared in this paper. All examples show that the disasters or failing projects had nothing to do with a large spread of the strength or load in a foreseen failing mechanism. There was also not an unknown failure mechanism or a lack of existing scientifical knowledge. All cases show a lack of available knowledge (or incompetence) of the designing part of the construction management. The mistakes which were made were often of a level not higher than a BSc or MSc teaching level. In none of these cases these mistakes were tackled by an internal <b>project</b> <b>auditing</b> and in none of these cases these mistakes were tackled by an exter-nal project design control, for example for a building permit. The biggest risk parameter in geotechnical design is therefore not the spread of load or strength parame-ters, but by far the existence and quality of the internal <b>project</b> <b>auditing</b> and the external project design control...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{organizations}} implement {{projects for}} many purposes. Using {{the project as}} a strategic success factor for project-oriented companies is continuously increasing. However, most of the time, the results {{are not the same}} as planned. Some projects fail to achieve their objectives; others are canceled, whereas on some other cases, companies have to re-plan their strategy. Project-oriented companies know that maintaining an ideal and logical balance between the project’s time, cost, and quality constraints can vastly guaranty project success. Therefore, they should switch from traditional project management to modern and advanced project management methodology, which improves project performance and efficiency over its life cycle. One of the most applicable tools used to assess and monitor project performance and thus finding the associated issues is <b>Project</b> <b>Audit,</b> which is a comprehensive and organized assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of project performance, management, and compliance. In this research, an integrated <b>project</b> <b>audit</b> model is presented that incorporates a detailed design module, which shows the structure of the model, questionnaire module, and a scoring module. The model is developed as an integrated <b>project</b> <b>audit</b> application where the user is easily able to select, plan, implement, and report a <b>project</b> <b>audit.</b> The model’s output consists of two parts: 1) a comprehensive report that shows the project situation in five main project processes and nine project functions. This report presents the project’s score in a specific function and its related process (i. e., planning cost or closing procurement); 2) useful analytical reports and graphs of the project performance. In this part, the model compares the project’s planned and actual time and cost, calculates their variances, and forecasts the final cost and time based on the current performance. The model is validated by using an actual Oil and Gas project to test its workability and capabilities. Three groups will benefit from this model; 1) owners; 2) project managers and project team; 3) general contractors and construction companies. The model helps project owners to identify problems early on and reduce project waste in terms of time, effort, material and costs. Moreover, it provides owners the opportunity to identify the project performance from the cost and time constraints. Also, after using this model, project managers and project team have a list of findings that need to be addressed to enhance the overall project performance. The various reports of the model not only provide detail information about project constraints (time, cost, and quality) but it also present valuable analysis related to other aspect of the project (i. e. risk, scope, and communication) which are very useful for the project team. Furthermore, the developed lessons learned from the project can be documented with this model, which is very useful for general contractors and construction companies in future projects...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} (a) to determine consultant gynaecologists' awareness of and views on a national <b>audit</b> <b>project</b> (the gynaecology <b>audit</b> <b>project</b> in Scotland) and (b) to measure changes in their reported practice in relation to 12 specific elements of care related to three audit topics (induced abortion, endometriosis, and vulvar carcinoma) for which recommendations for change had been made within the project. The study comprised a postal questionnaire survey of all 128 consultant gynaecologists in NHS practice in Scotland. The response rate was 90 %. Of the respondents, 96 % (109 / 113) recalled receiving feedback material from the <b>audit</b> <b>project</b> team and around 75 % (range 66 / 89 to 84 / 105) had retained feedback reports for future reference. For the two more common clinical topics (induced abortion and endometriosis), over two thirds {{of the respondents indicated that}} they had been prompted to reconsider or change aspects of practice. Significant changes in reported practice, in line with project recommendations, were found for seven of the 12 specific elements of care examined. Thus, gynaecologists in Scotland showed a high level of awareness of and positive views towards a national <b>audit</b> <b>project.</b> Significant changes in reported practice, in accordance with circulated recommendations, were measurable in relation to several elements of clinical care...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. Departments {{of general}} {{practice}} increasingly provide formal teaching in audit. However, {{little is known}} about <b>audit</b> <b>projects</b> carried out by trainees in general practice. AIM. A study was undertaken to ascertain general practitioner trainees' experience of undertaking an <b>audit</b> <b>project</b> in the trainee year, with reference to their understanding of audit theory, perceived usefulness of the project in enhancing clinical knowledge, time taken to do the audit and practice team involvement in the project. METHOD. All 104 trainees in the west of Scotland region completing their trainee year on 31 July 1993 were sent a postal questionnaire that month. The replies to the questionnaire were analysed and compared with the <b>audit</b> <b>project</b> that each trainee had submitted in June 1993 as part of a pilot project for summative assessment. RESULTS. Responses were received from 103 trainees (99 %). Seventy trainees (68 %) felt strongly that their <b>audit</b> <b>project</b> was relevant to patient care but only 31 (30 %) felt strongly that the project was a useful way of enhancing clinical knowledge of the disease process. Data collection was the most time consuming aspect of the <b>audit</b> <b>project,</b> 23 % of trainees reporting taking a day or more to complete this stage. Trainees who chose their own <b>audit</b> <b>project</b> were more likely to complete two sets of data collection than those who had not chosen their own project. Seventy nine trainees (77 %) indicated that trainers had been involved in their project and 51 trainees indicated that one of the other practice partners had been involved in their project. CONCLUSION. Performing an audit as a trainee is feasible in the time limit of the one year in general practice. The educational benefit appears to be limited to the knowledge of audit process, rather than to clinical knowledge. <b>Audit</b> <b>projects</b> of relevant size and complexity, involving appropriate members of the practice team, are to be encouraged, as is the development of an instrument for assessing trainee audit...|$|R
50|$|Lev Virine and Michael Trumper applied choice {{architecture}} {{concept to}} project management. They proposed Choice Engineering as a choice architecture related framework for improving project decisions. Project managers make predictable, repeated mental mistakes {{which could lead}} to project failures. Choice Engineering is a creating of processes or environment in which project managers would be steered towards making better choices rather than mandating these choices. The examples of such processes would be using checklists and templates, introducing <b>project</b> <b>audit</b> rather than direct control, providing full disclosure of information for project team members, improving project management education, and other processes. Virine and Trumper argued that in many cases, especially for smaller projects, it would be more beneficial to use Choice Engineering rather than strict and complex project management processes.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether systematic audit and feedback {{of information about}} the process and outcomes improve the quality of surgical care. Systematic literature review. Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched for publications on 'quality assessment' and 'surgery'. The references of the publications found were examined as well. Publications were included in the review if the effect of auditing on the quality of surgical care had been investigated. In the databases 2415 publications were found. After selection, 28 publications describing the effect of auditing, whether or not combined with a quality improvement project, on guideline adherence or indications of outcomes of care were included. In 21 studies, a statistically significant positive effect of auditing was reported.
