40|$|Recently, we have {{developed}} a series of charge balanced polyampholyte (PA) physical hydrogels by random copolymerization in water, which show extraordinarily high toughness, self-healing ability and viscoelasticity. The excellent performance of PA hydrogels is ascribed to dynamic ionic bond formation through inter-and intra-chain interactions. The randomness results in ionic bonds of wide strength distribution, the strong bonds, which serve as permanent crosslinking, imparting the elasticity, while the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. In this work, we developed a simple physical method, called a <b>pre-stretching</b> method, to promote the performance of PA hydrogels. By imposing a <b>pre-stretching</b> on the sample in the as-prepared state, ion complexation during dialysis is prominently accelerated and the final performance is largely promoted.

Dielectric {{elastomers}} (DEs) {{have attracted}} significant attention {{in recent years}} and have been found to provide excellent overall performance in actuation-based application. This thesis will introduce the fundamentals of DEs, derive the field and finite element equations for simulating its deformation, and then focus on numerically studying electromechanical instabilities, in particular electrostatically driven creep and the effect of <b>pre-stretch</b> on surface (creasing) instabilities. First, a nonlinear, dynamic finite element model coupled with a finite deformation viscoelastic constitutive law is utilized to study the inhomogeneous deformation and instabilities resulting from the application of a constant voltage to dielectric elastomers. Theoretical studies are performed of two problems that have been experimentally observed, i. e. electromechanical snap-through instability and bursting drops in a dielectric elastomer. In general, increasing the viscoelastic relaxation time leads to an increase in time needed to nucleate the electromechanical instability. However, it is found that the time needed to nucleate the instability of these two cases scales with the relaxation time. Second, the effect of <b>pre-stretch</b> on the performance of dielectric elastomers is studied. Two cases are studied, the electromechanical snap-through instability under equibiaxial pre-stress, and a strip under uniaxial <b>pre-stretch.</b> It is found that prestress markedly increases the stability of the elastomers, while <b>pre-stretch</b> increases the critical field for electro-creasing instability. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of an elastic sheet {{with a thin}} viscous film appears {{in a wide range}} of natural phenomena and can be utilized as an actuation mechanism for surface deformations, applicable to microfluidics, optics, and soft robotics. Implementation of such configurations inherently takes place over finite domains and often requires <b>pre-stretching</b> of the sheet. Under the assumptions of strong <b>pre-stretching</b> and small deformations of the lubricated elastic sheet, we derive Green's functions describing the deformation in a finite domain due to external forces acting either directly on the sheet or through the fluid, accounting for both bending and stretching effects. Using these Green's functions we provide a closed-form solution for the case of a square-shaped actuation and present the effect of <b>pre-stretching</b> on the dynamics of the deformation. We further study the dependence of the deformation magnitude on the spatial wavenumber, revealing its effect on the transition between stretching and bending dominant regimes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the difference in the intrinsic stiffness of the active plantarflexor muscles between young and elderly human females, and to determine changes in this stiffness associated with a 6 -week strengthening exercise program. Intrinsic muscle stiffness was determined by measuring the resistance in the first 62 milliseconds offered by the muscle to multiple single stretch trials at 20 % to 60 % of maximal isometric contraction. Stiffnesses were related to <b>pre-stretch</b> torque (K/PST) by a linear fit. The KIPST relationship of the elderly subjects exhibited a steeper slope, indicating a greater increase in stiffness with an increase in <b>pre-stretch</b> torque. The effect of testing subjects at identical relative, but different absolute <b>pre-stretch</b> torque levels precluded definitive conclusions on possible stiffness differences between the age groups.

40|$|Effective cell {{invasion}} into thick electrospun biomimetic scaffolds is an unsolved problem. One possible {{strategy to}} biofabricate tissue constructs of desirable thickness and material properties {{without the need}} for cell invasion is to use thin (< 2 Âµm) porous electrospun meshes and self-assembling (capable of tissue fusion) tissue spheroids as building blocks. <b>Pre-stretched</b> electrospun meshes remained taut in cell culture and were able to support tissue spheroids with minimal deformation. We hypothesize that elastic electrospun scaffolds could be used as temporal support templates for rapid self-assembly of cell spheroids into higher order tissue structures, such as engineered vascular tissue. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how the attachment of tissue spheroids to <b>pre-stretched</b> polyurethane scaffolds may interfere with the tissue fusion process. Tissue spheroids attached, spread, and fused after being placed on <b>pre-stretched</b> polyurethane electrospun matrices and formed tissue constructs. Efforts to eliminate hole defects with fibrogenic tissue growth factor-Î² resulted in the increased synthesis of collagen and periostin and a dramatic reduction in hole size and number. In control experiments, tissue spheroids fuse on a non-adhesive hydrogel and form continuous tissue constructs without holes. Our data demonstrate that tissue spheroids attached to thin stretched elastic electrospun scaffolds have an interrupted tissue fusion process. The resulting tissue-engineered construct phenotype is a direct outcome of the delicate balance of the competing physical forces operating during the tissue fusion process at the interface of the <b>pre-stretched</b> elastic scaffold and the attached tissue spheroids. We have shown that with appropriate treatments, this process can be modulated, and thus, a thin <b>pre-stretched</b> elastic polyurethane electrospun scaffold could serve as a supporting template for rapid biofabrication of thick tissue-engineered constructs {{without the need for}} cell invasion...|$|E

In four cats, MG, tibialis anterior (TA) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles were implanted with electromyogram (EMG) electrodes. The cats walked on a row of elevated pegs, some of which were spring-loaded and could be triggered to pop up at the moment of foot touchdown, rapidly dorsiflexing the foot. <b>Pre-stretch</b> EMG activity in MG as well as short-, medium- and long-latency responses to the dorsiflexions were compared before and after unilateral denervation of synergists. Short- and medium-latency responses of MG to perturbations increased in proportion to the increase in <b>pre-stretch</b> EMG {{in the days and weeks}} after partial denervation. This argues against an adaptive increase in stretch reflex gain independent of centrally generated extensor drive. Local anaesthesia of the skin of the paw did not significantly change the sizes of the stretch responses of MG before or after partial denervation. We conclude that <b>pre-stretch</b> EMG activity as well as stretch reflexes in MG muscle increased substantially after denervation of synergistic muscles.
