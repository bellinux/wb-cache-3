5|$|Art Connections {{underwent}} a complete renovation in 2004. Most {{of the work}} went into installing new, high-tech activities, including a virtual canvas powered by a laser-light <b>paintbrush</b> and a room that turns dancers' shadows into art on the wall.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} persist on canyon bottoms {{and rocky}} ledges away from perennial streams. Sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian <b>paintbrush,</b> are common. Utah penstemon and golden aster {{can also be}} found. Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers, which bloom {{mainly in}} the spring and early summer, include pincushions, golden bee plant, dwarf purple monkey flower, and {{sagebrush}} mariposa lily at the Painted Hills Unit. Munro's globemallow, lupines, yellow fritillary, hedgehog cactus, and Applegate's Indian <b>paintbrush</b> are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is covered}} predominantly by temperate coniferous forest, which makes up approximately 64 {{percent of the}} total area. The primary species in these areas are Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, madrone, and incense-cedar. Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier chaparral regions. Several rare plants including Gentner's fritillary, oblongleaf stonecrop, Siskiyou lewisia, clustered lady's slipper, and splithair Indian <b>paintbrush</b> also grow in the watershed. Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified: three species of thistles, medusahead rye, Scotch broom, St. Johns wort, and tansy ragwort.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers bloom {{from early}} May to late September {{but most are}} gone by late August. Moisture from snow-melt along with some {{rainfall}} in late spring kick-starts the germination of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow {{in the area are}} the arrow-leaved balsamroot, bitterroot, blazingstar, desert parsley, dwarf monkeyflower, <b>paintbrush,</b> scorpionweed, scabland penstemon and the wild onion.|$|E
5|$|In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mario uses FLUDD {{as a new}} special {{move that}} does no damage, but pushes opponents away. Brawl also has the {{fighting}} stage Delfino Plaza, a replica of Isle Delfino's capital city, with a platform carrying the fighters to any location of the stage on occasion. The original background music of Delfino Plaza occasionally plays on the stage, {{as well as the}} BGM for Ricco Harbor. The game also features several stickers based on artwork from Super Mario Sunshine. Most of these features were retained in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and the Delfino Plaza was retained in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Bowser Jr. himself debuted as a new playable fighter in the game, and utilizes his Magic <b>Paintbrush</b> and Shadow Mario form from Super Mario Sunshine in his Final Smash.|$|E

5|$|West to east {{trending}} canyons provide {{easier access}} by foot {{into the heart}} of the range as no vehicular roads traverse the range except at Teton Pass, which is south of the park. Carved by a combination of glacier activity as well as by numerous streams, the canyons are at their lowest point along the eastern margin of the range at Jackson Hole. Flowing from higher to lower elevations, the glaciers created more than a dozen U-shaped valleys throughout the range. Cascade Canyon is sandwiched between Mount Owen and Teewinot Mountain to the south and Symmetry Spire to the north and is situated immediately west of Jenny Lake. North to south, Webb, Moran, <b>Paintbrush,</b> Cascade, Death and Granite Canyons slice through Teton Range.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta <b>paintbrush,</b> arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E
25|$|A garrote (made from {{a length}} of nylon cord and the broken handle of a <b>paintbrush)</b> was tied around JonBenét's neck and had {{apparently}} been used to strangle her. Part of the bristle end of the <b>paintbrush</b> {{was found in a}} tub containing Patsy's art supplies, but the bottom third of it was never found despite extensive searching of the house by the police in subsequent days.|$|E
25|$|The {{relatively}} short, stiff, {{coarse hairs}} of the pig are called bristles, and were once so {{commonly used in}} <b>paintbrushes</b> that in 1946 the Australian Government launched Operation Pig Bristle. In May 1946, {{in response to a}} shortage of pig bristles for <b>paintbrushes</b> to paint houses in the post-World War II construction boom, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flew in 28 short tons of pig bristles from China, their only commercially available source at the time.|$|R

50|$|PAFA's Bregler Collection {{consists}} of nearly 1,600 items - 29 paintings (most oil sketches for larger works), 12 sculptures, 261 drawings, 535 photographs, about 380 glass-plate negatives, 361 documents, and memorabilia such as Eakins's watercolor box and <b>paintbrushes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Subalpine areas {{include the}} upper limit {{for the growth of}} {{standing}} trees. From 8,000 feet to treeline, plants are fewer in overall number with exposed patches of bare ground providing a harsh environment. Rock spirea, lupin, Indian <b>paintbrush,</b> and penstemon {{are a few of the}} rugged members of this community. Trees in this community include Whitebark Pine and Mountain Hemlock.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{communities}} {{range from}} low-elevation grasslands and ponderosa pine forest to alpine meadows. Engelmann spruce, mountain hemlock, subalpine fir and whitebark pine {{can be found}} in the higher elevations, with Douglas-fir, white fir, western larch, and lodgepole pine elsewhere. Wildflowers include clarkia, Indian <b>paintbrush,</b> sego lily, elephanthead, larkspur, shooting star, and bluebell. Rocky bluffs in the Hells Canyon area support prickly pear cactus and poison ivy.|$|E
25|$|Spring and autumn are {{transitional}} {{seasons with}} moderate and pleasant weather. Vibrant wildflowers (such as the bluebonnet, Indian <b>paintbrush</b> and other flora) bloom {{in spring and}} are planted around the highways throughout Texas. Springtime weather can be quite volatile, but temperatures themselves are mild. The weather in Dallas is also generally pleasant from late September to early December and on many winter days. Autumn often brings more storms and tornado threat, but usually fewer and less severe than in spring.|$|E
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} his {{military}} training Byng is gifted with his pencil. Like Turner in the Lake District, {{he uses his}} <b>paintbrushes</b> to sketch charming but somewhat naïve watercolour scenes, as of Barfreston church, Greta Bridge [...] or the “tortur'd tree” at Bell Bar.|$|R
5000|$|The Flemish type of harpsichords is my {{favourite}} one, {{with very}} creative ornaments which never reoccur {{even though they}} create a style unity.

25|$|The {{eggs are}} usually laid in March and April. The adult female will lay {{up to five}} masses of eggs which contain 2 to 250 eggs each. The eggs are {{deposited}} {{at the base of}} the dwarf plantain plant or less frequently the owl's clover or <b>paintbrush.</b> The eggs take about ten days to hatch and upon emergence from the eggs the larvae grow for a period of two weeks or more during which they shed their skin until they reach their fourth instar. Any larvae that successfully enters the fourth instar enter a period of diapause that lasts through the entire summer. During diapause they spend time under rocks or within cracks in the soil. When the diapause ends they resume activity, feeding and move to complete their development into adult Bay checkerspot butterflies.|$|E
25|$|Gallery 30 also {{represented}} Metro the Painting Racehorse from 2012 to 2016. Metro Meteor was “once {{considered one of}} the fastest sprinters on the east coast, winning eight races and more than $300,000 at Belmont and Saratoga; that is until knee crippling injuries ended his racing career and almost ended his life.” In 2009, Gettysburg artist Ron Krajewski adopted Metro off the track and first gave the horse a <b>paintbrush.</b> Metro started making broad strokes against a canvas, and soon the horse was painting with Krajewski every day. Half of Metro’s profits from the sale of each painting are donated to New Vocations Racehorse Adoption Program, “an organization that retrains and finds new homes for retired racehorses.” As of July 2015, Metro had raised over $80,000 for the charity.|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{changes to}} the body schema are active and continuous. For example, gradual {{changes to the}} body schema must occur over the {{lifetime}} of an individual {{as he or she}} grows and absolute and relative sizes of body parts change over his or her life span. The development of the body schema has also been shown to occur in young children. One study showed that with these children (9-, 14-, and 19-month-olds), older children handled spoons so as to optimally and comfortably grip them for use, whereas younger children tended to reach with their dominant hand, regardless of the orientation of the spoon and eventual ease of use. Short-term plasticity has been shown with the integration of tools into the body schema. The rubber hand illusion has also shown the rapid reorganization of the body schema on the timescale of seconds, showing the high level of plasticity and speed with which the body schema reorganizes. In the Illusion, participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a <b>paintbrush,</b> while their own hand is stroked identically. Participants may feel that the touches on their hand are coming from the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand.|$|E
50|$|Dishwashers {{should only}} be used to wash normal {{household}} items, such as plates, cutlery, cups, mugs, kitchenware etc. Items such as <b>paintbrushes,</b> tools, furnace filters etc. should not be put into a dishwasher as this will cause the subsequent washes to become contaminated and may cause damage to the appliance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painter who}} {{decorated}} the karts was called Fileteador, because he performed {{the job with}} long-threaded <b>paintbrushes</b> also called [...] "Brushes for making filetes". This is a word derived from Latin [...] "Filum" [...] which means [...] "Thread", referring to the art in a fine line that serves as ornament.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, tools {{have been}} made by the {{artisans}} themselves for personal use. Tools include adzes, carving knives, stone axes, stone hammers and <b>paintbrushes.</b> Brushes were sometimes made from porcupine hair. [...] Later, the loom was used to weave blankets and curtains. Some tools were ceremonial, and thus decorated with carvings.|$|R
