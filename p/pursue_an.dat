5|$|According to {{the casting}} director, Newt was the most {{difficult}} role to cast: Schoolchildren were auditioned, but many of them had acted in commercials and were accustomed to smiling after saying their lines. Henn, from Atwater, California was chosen out of 500 children for the role, although she had no previous acting experience. She received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, but chose not to <b>pursue</b> <b>an</b> acting career, and became a teacher.|$|E
5|$|After {{a mental}} evaluation, a {{psychologist}} concluded Clemmons was competent {{to stand trial}} on the charges, which eliminated him {{as a candidate for}} involuntary commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to <b>pursue</b> <b>an</b> insanity or diminished-capacity defense. On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a Chehalis-based company, to secure his release. Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing to appear in court.|$|E

30|$|These results {{stand in}} {{contrast}} to those for students’ career interests {{and the likelihood of}} <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> STEM career. Unlike the career interest analysis, students seeking routine career activities are more likely to <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> STEM career. Also, students who ranked career interests involving helping others were more likely to pursue STEM careers, but this analysis showed that student preference for career activities involving helping others and being concerned for their welfare was not a statistically significant indicator of their likelihood to <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> STEM career. Further, these results differ somewhat in terms of students’ preferences for practical activities. While career interests involving manual or mechanical skills were not statistical indicators of the likelihood of <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> STEM career, career activities involving practical, productive, and concrete activities were statistically significant. The career activity involving reading, study, analysis, and investigation was also statistically linked to students’ likelihood to <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> STEM career, which seems reasonable given that such activities {{are at the heart of}} many STEM careers.|$|R

5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a test ban, despite the British public favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen bombs. In their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear program were {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was tempered by concern that resistance to a test ban might lead the US and Soviet Union to <b>pursue</b> <b>an</b> agreement without Britain having any say in the matter.|$|E

Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions {{in each of those}} states to <b>pursue</b> <b>an</b> anti-Spartan policy.

5|$|Along {{with the}} renewal {{of the civil war}} in 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to <b>pursue</b> <b>an</b> independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been spared the ravages of the civil war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last economic and cultural flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E
5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events of that meeting are vague, but what is clear was that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV. He instead chose to <b>pursue</b> <b>an</b> alliance with the BBC, aware of the cultural importance of Match of the Day. In February 1992, Quinton met Murdoch over lunch to go over his expectations, {{with the idea of}} a Premier League dedicated channel high on his priority. ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth's {{foreign policy}} was largely defensive. The {{exception}} was the English occupation of Le Havre from October 1562 to June 1563, {{which ended in}} failure when Elizabeth's Huguenot allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port. Elizabeth's intention had been to exchange Le Havre for Calais, lost to France in January 1558. Only through the activities of her fleets did Elizabeth <b>pursue</b> <b>an</b> aggressive policy. This paid off {{in the war against}} Spain, 80% of which was fought at sea. She knighted Francis Drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from 1577 to 1580, and he won fame for his raids on Spanish ports and fleets. An element of piracy and self-enrichment drove Elizabethan seafarers, over whom the queen had little control.|$|E

5|$|In August 2013, Yelp {{launched}} {{a series of}} town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities {{in an effort to}} address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues. A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews. The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014, most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise.
