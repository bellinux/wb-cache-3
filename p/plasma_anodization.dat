40|$|Oxidation in plasma {{environment}} offers the opportu-nities of fast oxidation rates and low temperature pro-cessing. An oxygen plasma can be formed in a micro-wave, RF, or dc discharge. Oxidation on externally biased substrates {{is referred to}} as <b>plasma</b> <b>anodization</b> while on unbiased substrates it {{is referred to as}} plasma oxidation (1 - 3). The origin of <b>plasma</b> <b>anodization</b> is believed to be due to negative oxygen ions, but the exact mechanism has been a subject of discussion, and no model has been generally accepted. The growth rate for constant voltage anodization was observed to be parabolic. The mecha-nism of plasma oxidation is seldom explained in litera-ture and its data are more limited. The growth rate in this case was also found to be parabolic (4). Nonparabolic be-havior was observed (5) but it was interpreted as bein...|$|E
40|$|Auger spectroscopic {{evidence}} is presented that cathode material is trans-ported to the anode during <b>plasma</b> <b>anodization,</b> {{even when the}} anode is facing away from the cathode and {{is located on the}} back of a shield. In the prepa-ration of the plasma oxide samples, anodes of Ta, Nb, and Cu and cathodes of Ta, Nb, A 1, and C have been used in various combinations. The Auger spectroscopic results indicate that cathode material does not deposit on the anode unless the anode is passing a current and that the oxide on the anode formed by <b>plasma</b> <b>anodization</b> generally has two layers, with the outer layer consisting of oxide of the cathode material and the inner layer consisting of oxide of the anode material. Evidence is presented which suggests that the transfer of cathode material to the anode is an integral part of plasma anod-ization.

As the thin anodization layer creates a capacitive charge buildup, large currents are observed during the arc.

40|$|The {{effect of}} growth {{conditions}} on the electrical properties of silicon dioxide grown in oxygen/argon plasma at 500 -degrees-C are described. The two process parameters whose effects were studied in detail were: gas pressure in <b>plasma</b> and <b>anodization</b> current density. MOS capacitors were fabricated with these oxides. These were subjected to a post oxidation anneal at 800 -degrees-C for 20 min and a post-metallization anneal at 450 -degrees-C for 30 min. Measurements on these capacitors indicated that the growth parameters have a marked effect on the density of interface states, fixed oxide charge and the electron trap density in plasma oxides. A qualitative model based on the mechanism of plasma oxidation is presented which explains the dependence of oxide properties over process conditions. Measurements on the thickness of oxides grown at various distances from the plasma have also been presented. It has been pointed out that our oxidation data are not in agreement with various growth kinetics models existing in literature. Hence, a suitable mechanism of plasma oxidation is required which must explain the dependence of electrical properties of plasma oxides on growth parameters...|$|R
30|$|The {{clinical}} {{success of}} orthopedic and dental implants {{depends on the}} interaction between the implanted surface and bone tissues and, consequently, their osseointegration [1]. Titanium implants are used widely in orthopedic surgery and dentistry for their favorable biocompatibility and corrosion resistance [2, 3]. Surface modification of the implanted material is a critical factor for tissue acceptance and cell survival. Among three different crystalline phases of titania (anatase, rutile, and amorphous titania), anatase phase is more favorable for cell adhesion and proliferation due to lower surface contact angles and/or wettability [4]. Several surface modification techniques, i.e., sol–gel techniques, chemical (alkali/acid) treatment, <b>anodization,</b> <b>plasma</b> spray, hydroxyapatite-coated surface, and self-assembled monolayers, have been developed and are currently used with the aim of enhancing the bioactivity of pure Ti surface [5 – 12].|$|R

The unifrom oxide layers with the same oxygen concentration as SiO_ 2 were obtained at low temperatures. The growth of the oxide layers was studied with relation to the electron temperature, electron density, and optical emission intensities from the activated particles in the ECR plasma, which were measured by a double probe method and an optical emission spectroscopy analysis, respectively.

40|$|Subsequent to {{previous}} work on modeling the <b>plasma</b> <b>anodization</b> of silicon at constant current, a model is presented {{here for the}} <b>plasma</b> <b>anodization</b> at constant voltage. The continuity equation for the charged oxidizing agent O- in the SiO 2 film was constructed considering O- ion transport by field-imposed drift and a loss process for O- ions by electron detachment. The resulting gradual drop of the O- current density with distance in the SiO 2 layer, together with the decrease of the total current as the film grows thicker, explains the decrease of the oxidation rate with time. Fits of the resulting three-parameter model equation to experimental data, from several sources, are excellent, with standard deviations on average < 1 % of the final oxide width. Parameter values obtained from different sources for similar experimental conditions are mutually consistent. Useful information can be deduced from the extracted parameters; {{the ratio of the}} O- mobility over the O- loss rate coefficient mu/k obtained for constant voltage Si anodization is in good agreement with the mu/k value derived from constant current anodization data-for which a different model equation applies-thus confirming the validity of the underlying physical concepts. Finally, a rationalization is given for the drop-off of the total current density and of the subsurface O- ion current density as the oxide layer becomes thicker. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Commercially pure {{titanium}} (cp-Ti) is {{an ideal}} biomaterial as it does not evoke an inflammatory foreign body response in the body. However, the low strength of cp-Ti prevents the use in most orthopaedic load bearing applications. Therefore, many metal orthopaedic implants are commonly made of higher strength metal alloys that are less biocompatible. Nanostructured materials exhibit superior mechanical properties compared to their conventional grain sized counterparts. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) of metals {{has been shown to}} produce nanostructured materials. SPD by machining is a single-step deformation route that refines the grain microstructure, to develop an ultrafine grained (UFG) microstructure. UFG cp-Ti strips were developed with induced shear strains of up to 4. 0 using a machining-based process. Both Vickers microhardness evaluation and microstructural analysis were used to characterize the as-received (annealed) and machined states. For induced shear strains between 1. 9 and 4. 0 in grade 2 cp-Ti the hardness was increased from 188 ± 7 kg/mm 2 in the as-received state to between 244 ± 6 and 264 ± 12 kg/mm 2 in the as-machined state, corresponding to an increase in hardness between 31 and 41 %. The microstructural analysis revealed a grain size reduction from 34 ± 11 μm in the as-received state to ∼ 100 nm for machined grade 2 -Ti. A complete annealing study suggested that recovery/recrystallization occurs between 300 and 400 °C, with a significant hardness drop between 400 and 600 °C, while grain growth is continuous, starting at the lowest annealing temperature of 300 °C. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is commonly applied to orthopaedic devices to promote bone growth. Machined Ti strips were coated with HA using conventional plasma spray as well as two alternative low-temperature application routes (sol-gel with calcination and anodization with hydrothermal treatment) to evaluate the thermal influence on the UFG-Ti substrate. Plasma spray produced a thick (20 to 70 μm) HA crystalline coating, sol-gel followed by calcination did not produce crystalline HA, while anodization with the proper hydrothermal treatment yielded a homogenous crystalline HA coating 5 to 15 μm thick based on the anodization condition. Mechanical and microstructural evaluation of the UFG-Ti substrates revealed that both the <b>plasma</b> spray and <b>anodization</b> followed by hydrothermal treatment (220 – 225 °C) did not affect the substrate grain size or hardness, while the thermal processing and calcination treatment at 313 – 446 °C for the sol-gel method caused recovery and grain growth, as well as a significant decrease in the hardness of the Ti-substrates. ...|$|R

40|$|Room {{temperature}} <b>plasma</b> <b>anodization</b> {{of silicon}} (growth rate {{of a few}} nm/min.) is possible through a thin calcia stabilized zirconia (CSZ) layer. The anodization kinetics, the composition and the electrical properties of the anodic SiO 2 films are studied. Constant voltage or low current anodization lead to quasi defect free films with reduced surface roughness. The dielectric breakdown field of as grown SiO 2 is about 5 x 106 V/cm. The minimum of density of traps at the SiO 2 /Si interface is in the 1010 - 1011 cm- 2. eV- 1 range after hydrogen annealing at 470 °C for 30 min. This is comparable to high temperature (above 400 °C) plasma grown SiO 2. The protective filter effect of the CSZ against contamination has also been demonstrated.

40|$|The yield for {{the plasma}} {{oxidation}} of silicon is defined for both ground state oxygen atoms (O 3 P) and oxygen atom ions (O-). On {{the basis of}} these yields it is shown that the role of oxygen atoms is negligible compared to the negative oxy-gen atom ions in plasma oxidation. The negative ion oxidation yield as a function of temperature follows an Arrhenius be-havior with an apparent temperature coefficient of 0. 20 -+ 0. 033 eV. Other factors such as the oxygen pressure, the silicon bias voltage, or the reactor geometry have only a minor effect on the oxidation yields. Calculated negative ion fluxes from the plasma toward the silicon substrate seem to be too low to explain the observed initial silicon dioxide growth rates, which supports a surface-catalyzed formation path for the negative oxygen atom ions. While {{it is well known that}} the oxidation of silicon pro-ceeds much faster in oxygen-containing plasmas than in conventional thermal oxidation systems (1 - 6), the overall oxidation mechanism is not completely characterized.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of plasma oxidation {{of silicon}} at constant anodization current have been investigated. Oxidation {{was performed in}} an inductively coupled rf <b>plasma</b> <b>anodization</b> setup. The oxidation model {{is based on the}} assumption that the oxidant from the plasma is neutral atomic oxygen which captures an electron inside the oxide and forms a negative oxygen ion (O-). The O- ion then hops through interstitial sites in the oxide due to the high drift field during the anodization. A photon-assisted oxidation mechanism is assumed to occur at the SiO 2 /Si interface in which the energy to break Si-Si bonds at the interface is supplied by UV photons which are generated in the plasma. Based on these assumptions an analytical model was developed that successfully explains the dependence of oxidation rate on the gas pressure in the plasma, which was not explained by previous investigators. It has been shown that during constant current anodization, the space-charge effects inside the oxide are negligible. It was found that the oxidation rate shows a weak temperature dependence with a thermal activation energy of 0. 04 eV. The data on oxide thickness versus the oxidation time were found to be in good agreement with the theory...|$|E
40|$|A new {{physical}} model is described for the <b>plasma</b> <b>anodization</b> of Si. The model is constructed from the continuity equation for the charged oxidizing agent O-, with transport by field-imposed drift and by diffusion. It {{is argued that}} at constant total current, {{the field in the}} oxide layer is constant in space and in time. A loss term for O- ions is also incorporated in the model; the resulting gradual drop of the O- contribution to the total (constant) current at increasing depth into the oxide explains the observed decrease of the oxidation rate with time. The O- loss can occur, i. a., by detachment O- [...] > O+e- or by two-step mechanisms resulting overall in 2 O- [...] > O 2 + 2 e-. The model predicts an exponential decay of O- in the oxide. At constant current the oxide width as a function of time is given by w=A ln (1 +Bt), where A is the characteristic penetration distance of O- in the oxide and AB is the initial oxide growth rate, determined by the subsurface O- current density. The two-parameter model provides excellent fits to available experimental data; standard deviations are approximately 1 % of the final oxide width. From the parameters, numerical values are derived of underlying physical constants. A lower limit is also deduced for the O- loss rate constant. status: publishe...|$|E

Growth rates in N 30 plasmas were lower than those in 07 plasmas. Angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) was used to study nitrogen incorporation in the oxides {{as a function of}} N 30 oxidation time and N 3 annealing temperature. At an oxide thickness of 4. 5 nm, a N-Si 3 bonding structure was observed in the Si-Si 03 interfacial region. Growth of a 9. 4 nm oxide revealed the same bonding structure at the interface, with low intensity and broad signals at higher binding ener-gies in the hulk oxide. Distinct peaks at higher binding energies in the bulk oxide corresponding to oxynitride bonding structures emerged in 15 nm oxides. Both 9. 4 and 15 nm oxides were etched to 4. 5 nm in HF solution and analyzed using angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for comparison of nitrogen incorporation within the same oxide/inter-facial region. Within the 4. 5 nm region, longer oxidation times yielded higher nitrogen concentrations and the formation of oxynitride bonding arrangements in addition to the N-Si 3 bonding structure. Nitrogen annealing at temperatures above 5 00 °C decreased the total nitrogen concentration, primarily due to a reduction of nitrogen in the oxynitride bonding arrangement.
