50|$|If {{the supply}} neutral is broken, phase-to-neutral voltage {{is no longer}} maintained. Phases with higher {{relative}} loading will experience reduced voltage, and phases with lower relative loading will experience elevated voltage, up to the <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
50|$|If no {{neutral wire}} is available, a 'delta' or 'phase to phase' {{transformer}} must be used.

50|$|High-leg delta {{service is}} {{supplied}} {{in one of}} two ways. One is by a transformer having four wires coming out of the secondary, the three phases, plus a neutral connected as a center-tap on one of the windings. Another method requires two transformers. One transformer is connected to one phase of the overhead primary distribution circuit to provide the 'lighting' side of the circuit (this will be the larger of the two transformers), and a second transformer is connected to another phase on the circuit and its secondary is connected {{to one side of the}} 'lighting' transformer secondary, and the other side of this transformer is brought out as the 'high leg'. The voltages between the three phases are the same in magnitude, however the voltage magnitudes between a particular phase and the neutral vary. The phase-to-neutral voltage of two of the phases will be half of the <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>voltage.</b> The remaining phase-to-neutral voltage will be √3/2 the <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>voltage.</b> So if A-B, B-C and C-A are all 240 volts, then A-N and C-N will both be 120 volts, but B-N will be 208 volts.|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} minimize the number of the used additional voltage sensors in a fault tolerant three-phase converter. In this paper, first a practical implementation of a very fast FD scheme with reduced sensor number is discussed. Then, an optimization in this scheme is also presented to decrease the detection time. For FD, special time and voltage criterion are applied to observe the error in the estimated <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>voltages</b> for a specific period of time. The proposed optimization is based on the fact that following a detectable fault, two line-to-line voltages will deviate from their respective estimated values. Fault detection is studied for a three-leg two-level fault tolerant converter. Control and FD systems are implemented on a single field-programmable gate array. First, hardware in the loop experiments are carried out to evaluate the implemented schemes. Then, fully experimental tests are performed. The results confirm good performance of the proposed detection schemes, the digital controller and the fault tolerant structure.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a new classification of voltage sags {{which is based}} on its types, characteristic voltage and zero-sequence component of voltage. It is extremely difficult to distinguish between the voltage sags which have same type, same characteristic voltage and same zero-sequence component of voltage due to load effects and hence such classification is significant. The proposed classification is mathematically justified by introducing two new indices, namely, phase-to-neutral and <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>voltage</b> indices. Using the theoretical relation between these two indices, it has been revealed that the voltage sags which have the same type, same characteristic voltage and same zero-sequence component of voltages, have same mathematical relations. Further, to reveal the accuracy of the proposed classification and type detection, it is validated through recorded waveforms available in IEEE database, Scottish Power, data obtained from Matlab simulation under different conditions of voltage sags and data of real power station. In addition, the proposed classification and type detection are compared with other established algorithms for type detection of voltage sags.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{grounding}} methods for distribution systems and the characteristics and behavior of earth fault currents. At First different existing grounding methods such as isolated neutral, solidly grounded, Resonant grounding, low and high impedance groundings are introduced. Secondly, focus is placed on further describing these methods and the viability {{of each of these}} methods in different scenarios. Then these methods are further analyzed by using equivalent circuit designs. Using the equivalent circuit helps to derive the formulations and equations. It is shown that the designing of these systems in fact follows basic electrical properties such as voltage dividing and current dividing principles. The derived equations are further tested experimentally to prove the characteristics and behavior of these methods. Finally, the report is concluded by testing some of these methods (isolated neutral and grounding via resistor methods) in the laboratory and the results obtained are analyzed with the theoretical results to determine the characteristics and behavior of these methods. In this manner it is shown experimentally that in case of isolated neutral systems the summation of currents through all the phases (current flow through the line model) is zero when there is no earth fault. In case of an earth fault occurring across one of the phases the neutral-to-ground voltage becomes equal to the voltage across the faulted phase and also the sum of currents passing through the healthy phases is equal to the current flowing through the faulted phase. This phenomenon is proved in the second experiment. The third experiment proves the relation between the earth fault current and current via the resistor and the currents via the healthy phases whereby it is shown that the fault current is equal to the root square summation of currents of resistor and healthy phases. This is one of the characteristics of grounded via resistor system. The next experimental setup also {{focuses on the}} characteristics of grounded via resistor system whereby it is shown that the fault current and the total phase current are independent of any external load. The last experiment proves the phenomenon that <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>voltage</b> remains intact during times of earth fault and the system continues the operation uninterrupted as it should be in case of isolated neutral grounding system...|$|E
40|$|The Early Flight Fission Test Facility (EFF-TF) was {{established}} by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to provide a capability for performing hardware-directed activities to support multiple in-space nuclear reactor concepts by using a non-nuclear test methodology. This includes fabrication and testing at both the module/component level and near prototypic reactor configurations. The EFF-TF is currently supporting an effort to develop an affordable fission surface power (AFSP) system that could be deployed on the Lunar surface. The AFSP system is presently based on a pumped liquid metal-cooled (Sodium-Potassium eutectic, NaK- 78) reactor design. This design {{was derived from the}} only fission system that the United States has deployed for space operation, the Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) 10 A reactor, which was launched in 1965. Two prototypical components recently tested at MSFC were a pair of Stirling power conversion units that would be used in a reactor system to convert heat to electricity, and an annular linear induction pump (ALIP) that uses travelling electromagnetic fields to pump the liquid metal coolant through the reactor loop. First ever tests were conducted at MSFC to determine baseline performance of a pair of 1 kW Stirling convertors using NaK as the hot side working fluid. A special test rig was designed and constructed and testing was conducted inside a vacuum chamber at MSFC. This test rig delivered pumped NaK for the hot end temperature to the Stirlings and water as the working fluid on the cold end temperature. These test were conducted through a hot end temperature range between 400 to 550 C in increments of 50 C and a cold end temperature range from 30 to 70 C in 20 C increments. Piston amplitudes were varied from 6 to 1 1 mm in. 5 mm increments. A maximum of 2240 Watts electric was produced at the design point of 550 hot end, 40 C cold end with a piston amplitude of 10. 5 mm. This power level was reached at a gross thermal efficiency of 28 %. A baseline performance map {{was established}} for the pair of 1 kW Stirling convertors. The performance data will then be used for design modification to the Stirling convertors. The ALIP tested at MSFC has no moving parts and no direct electrical connections to the liquid metal containing components. Pressure is developed by the interaction of the magnetic field produced by the stator and the current which flows {{as a result of the}} voltage induced in the liquid metal contained in the pump duct. Flow is controlled by variation of the voltage supplied to the pump windings. Under steady-state conditions, pump performance is measured for flow rates from 0. 5 - 4. 3 kg/s. The pressure rise developed by the pump to support these flow rates is roughly 5 - 65 kPa. The RMS input voltage (<b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>voltage)</b> ranges from 5 - 120 V, while the frequency can be varied arbitrarily up to 60 Hz. Performance is quantified at different loop temperature levels from 50 C up to 650 C, which is the peak operating temperature of the proposed AFSP reactor. The transient response of the pump is also evaluated to determine its behavior during startup and shut-down procedures...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Raylı sistemlerde cer gücü tedarik sisteminin birincil fonksiyonu trenlere hareketi için gerekli olan elektrik gücünü mümkün olan en verimli ve en ekonomik şekilde iletmektedir. Bu fonksiyonu sebebiyle cer gücü tedarik sistemleri kesintisiz ve kaliteli bir metro taşımacılığı için hayati öneme sahiptir.   Genel olarak cer gücü tedarik sistemi 3 temel sistemden oluşmaktadır. DC veya AC ihtiyaç duyulan hat geriliminin elde edildiği trafo merkezleri, elde edilen bu hat geriliminin akım toplayıcı sistemler tarafından trenlere taşındığı akım toplama sistemleri ve son olarak elektrik enerjisini tren hareketine dönüştüren cer elektrik motorları ve sürücü devreleri. Tüm bu sistemlerin herbirinin altında daha birçok bileşenler de olması sebebiyle cer gücü tedarik sistemi oldukça kapsamlı ve önemlidir. DC cer gücü tedarik sisteminin karekteristiklerini bilgisayar destekli inceleyebilmek, çeşitli benzetim ve analizler yapabilmek için öncelikle sistemin modeli oluşturulmalıdır. Ancak bileşenlerin çokluğu ve karmaşıklığı sebebiyle bu işlem oldukça zordur.   Yapılan bu tezde 750 V DC hat gerilimi kullanılan bir metro sisteminin cer gücü tedarik sisteminin modellemesi MATLAB ® Simulink ortamında Güç Sistemleri Blok Seti (Power System Blockset, PSB) kullanılarak yapılmıştır. Oldukça kapsamlı olarak yapılan bu modellemede Enerji İletim Şirketinin 154 kV iletim hatlarından alınan enerji, öncelikle indirici trafo merkezlerinde indirilerek istasyonlar arasında 34, 5 kV orta gerilim ring sistemi oluşturulmuştur. 34, 5 kV gerilim seviyesi trenleri beslemek için ihtiyaç duyulan 750 V DC üçüncü ray gerilimine redresör trafosu ve doğrultucu üniteleri vasıtasıyla dönüştürülmüştür.

Toplam 4 araçtan oluşan tren setinin yalnızca 3 aracı motorlu olup her bir araçta 2 boji ve 4 cer motoru olduğundan toplam 12 adet asenkron cer motoru bulunmaktadır. Modelde cer motorları PWM sinyali tarafından kontrol edilen 3 fazlı IGBT invertörü tarafından sürülmektedir. Tüm bu bahsedilen ana gruplar ve alt bileşenlerin her biri ayrı ayrı MATLAB ® Simulink altında modellenmiş ve bu alt birimler ile gruplar bloklar halinde işletme şekline göre birbiri ile irtibatlanmıştır. Çalışma için örnek olarak toplam iki adet 4 ’lü tren setinin aynı bölgeden kalkış yaptığı durum incelenmiştir. Fakat istenildiği takdirde tren sayısı ve istasyon sayısı rahatlıkla artırılabilir ve bloklar içindeki veriler rahatlıkla değiştirilebilir. İstasyonlar arası mesafe üçüncü ray eşdeğer direnç değeri değiştirilerek rahatlıkla ayarlanabilirken trenler birbiriyle eş olması sebebiyle bir tren bloğu kopyalanarak hatda bulunan toplam tren sayısı da rahatlıkla artırabilir. Böylece tüm hattın modellemesini ve benzetimi yapmak mümkün olacaktır.   Oluşturulan bu model genişletilebilir ve geliştirilebilir olup farklı işletme koşullarının kapsamlı incelemesini gerçekleştirmeye uygundur.

The primary {{function}} of railway traction {{power supply system}} is to provide necessary electrical power to operate the trains in the most efficient and the most cost-effective manner. This is especially important in today urban transportation where passengers cannot even accept minutes of delays. Reliability and availability of traction power supply systems at all the time is the key. Since, traction power supply system is vital for an efficient and reliable railway transport, {{it is important to}} study on modelling and simulation of this system which will enable to study and analyze different operating conditions including short circuit faults and energy quality issues.   A typical traction power supply system has three main subsystems which are power supply system, current collection system and traction drives and motors. The train draws electrical power from the distribution network via suitably spaced substations along the railway line. The electrical power from the substations is transferred to moving trains through a continuous conductor. In the case of overhead current collection system, the power is received from a contact wire that is suspended above track. Pantograph, which is an apparatus mounted {{on the roof of the}} car, is used to collect power through contact wire. In the case of third rail current collection, the power is received from a third rail laid along the side of the track by the help of trainborne collector shoes. In both cases return current usually flows through running rails when only one overhead contact wire or conductor rail is provided. The final part of traction power supply system consists of traction drives and electric motors. Either DC or AC traction motors are used to drive the trains. A 750 V DC traction power supply system, which is in use in Yenikapi-Taksim-Haciosman line of Istanbul Metro, is modelled using Matlab ® Simulink environment. 750 V DC line volatge and third rail current collection systems is used in this metro line. The model is very comprehensive since it consists of all three main systems of traction power supply system. In the developed model, first of all, necessary electrical traction power is received from national high voltage 154 kV network and then converted to 34, 5 kV medium voltage via power transformers. A medium voltage ring system is provided between all substations for the relaiblity of the supply power. This follows by further reducing the voltage by means of rectifier transformers and the reduced AC voltage is finally converted to 750 V DC by means of uncontrolled diode rectifer units. In the developed MATLAB model that is shown by step by step. The third rail current collection system is modelled as equivalent of resistance together with equivalent resistance between the third rail and trainborne collecter shoe. The metro train used in Yenikapi-Taksim-Haciosman metro line consists of 4 -car set. 3 of those 4 -car is motorized cars and each of motorized car consists of 4 traction motor. Thus, the metro train is modelled as total of 12 three-phase squirrel cage induction motor. Traction motor is fed by 3 -phase IGBT units which is controlled by PWM signal.   Only two 4 -car set trains are used in the simulation to study train starting current. It is assummed that two 4 -car train set start running at the same time and in the same zone. However, it is also possible to run the simulation with more trains and thanks to the Simulink environment, the parameters of all blocks can be changed easily. This enable to simulate different scenarios easily. For example, in case of using 8 -car train sets on the track, the two 4 -set car can be coupled easily and connected to any location between the substaions. In the developed model third rail current collection system is modelled as equivalent resistance of 1 km sections. This can be easily changed. A train set can be placed between two adjacent third rail blocks and in that way it will be possible to simulate complete track with desired numbers of trains on the desired location between the stations.   The developed DC metro model can be used in many different applications, however it is the primary objective of this project to use the model in order to study train starting current. It is very important to understand the distinction between train starting currents and the short circuit currents in railway systems since they have similar current magnitude and its rising rate. The phenomena of mis-operation and mal-operation cannot be avoided with the traditional protection. Because problems involved in providing protection to traction systems are very different from those faced in protecting other transmission and distribution lines. This is due to the continous movement of train load, which is in the range of a few MW, change in the lenght of the line during operation and high levels of harmonic currents.   Simulation results are given for both only one train set is running and two train set running at the same time. Third rail voltage, line current, 154 kV busbar voltage and currents, 154 kV busbar energy measurements, IGBT <b>phase-to-phase</b> <b>voltage,</b> tarction motor rotor and stator currents, traction motor voltage, traction motor speed-time graph and electromagnetic torque waveforms are all given in the results. Simulation results pointed out the diffuculty of discrimination remote short circuit current against train starting current. That is because the train starting current even for only one 4 -car train set is more than 4000 A. Train reach that current level in miliseconds. Results also shows that even using only two 4 -car train set 154 kV busbar voltage and current waveforms is not pure sinusoidal because of the excess harmonic currents driven by trains. In the simulation compensation system does not modelled in order to analyze harmonics at 154 kV busbar. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
