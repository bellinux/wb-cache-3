5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the <b>picture</b> <b>plane,</b> {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E
25|$|Op art is {{a method}} of {{painting}} concerning the interaction between illusion and <b>picture</b> <b>plane,</b> between understanding and seeing. Op art works are abstract, {{with many of the}} better known pieces made in only black and white.

25|$|In this work, one of Gleizes' most {{important}} {{paintings of the}} crucial year 1910, we see the artist's volumetric approach to Cubism and his successful union of a broad field of vision with a flat <b>picture</b> <b>plane.</b> Earlier studies, such as By the Seine (Bord de la Seine, Meudon) of 1909, and Road, Trees and Houses (Environs de Meudon) of 1910 (both {{in the collection of}} Walter Firpo), clearly anticipate this development.|$|E

Alberti {{had limited}} himself to {{figures on the}} ground plane and giving an overall basis for perspective. Della Francesca fleshed it out, explicitly covering solids in any area of the <b>picture</b> <b>plane.</b> Della Francesca also started the now common practice of using illustrated figures to explain the mathematical concepts, making his treatise easier to understand than Alberti's.

25|$|Cubist and Futurist devices appear {{superimposed}} in Metzinger's At the Cycle-Race Track, {{creating an}} image that is readable yet essentially anti-naturalistic. Cubist elements include {{the reduction of the}} geometric schema to simplified shapes, and the juxtaposition of rotating planes to define spatial qualities, printed-paper collage, the incorporation of a granular surface and multiple perspective. Parallels with Futurism include the choice of a subject in motion (the bicyclist), the suggestion of velocity (motion blur on the wheel spokes), and the fusing of forms in a static <b>picture</b> <b>plane.</b> Metzingers's work integrates the idea of an aesthetic generated by the modern myth of the machine and speed.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Seurat, {{the roots of}} cubism {{are to be found}} in the two distinct tendencies of Cézanne's later work: first his breaking of the painted surface into small multifaceted areas of paint, thereby emphasizing the plural viewpoint given by binocular vision, and second his interest in the simplification of natural forms into cylinders, spheres, and cones. However, the cubists explored this concept further than Cézanne. They represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single <b>picture</b> <b>plane,</b> as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time. This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.|$|E

25|$|The picture's {{theatrical}} design {{places the}} most prominent figures in a shallow foreground stage. Immediately behind them are a diverting company of pages, halberdiers, dwarfs, dogs and monkeys, and in the further distance looms an architectural screen, an arched promenade parallel to the <b>picture</b> <b>plane</b> and supporting more spectators. These are pictorial preferences typical of Veronese, with the placement of figures and edifices reinforcing a processional character. The curves of the distant arches echo {{the movement of the}} supplicated foreground figures, while the gesture of Sisygambis corresponds to and is reinforced by the verticals of the central fountain; the architectural geometry organizes the movement of the figures.|$|E
25|$|Cy Twombly's {{work can}} be {{understood}} as one vast engagement with cultural memory. His paintings, drawings and sculptures on mythological subjects have come to form a significant part of that memory. Usually drawing on the most familiar gods and heroes, he restricts himself to just a few, relatively well-known episodes, as narrated by poet-historians, given visible shape by artists and repeatedly reinterpreted in the literature and visual art of later centuries.....His special medium is writing. Starting out from purely graphic marks, he developed a kind of meta-script in which abbreviated signs, hatchings, loops, numbers and the simplest of pictographs spread throughout the <b>picture</b> <b>plane</b> in a process of incessant movement, repeatedly subverted by erasures. Eventually, this metamorphosed into script itself.|$|E
25|$|Ivey was {{acquainted with}} Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, {{and other members}} of the 'Northwest School', and was close friends with Richard Gilkey and many of the Skagit Valley-based {{painters}} who were considered by some critics to represent a second generation of the Northwest School. However, his deeply personal style of abstraction showed more of the influence of Still, Rothko, and others he studied under at the California School of Fine Arts. He found inspiration in observation of the real world, but his intense immersion in the painting process transformed what he saw into lush abstractions that emphasized color and the <b>picture</b> <b>plane.</b> In Ivey's paintings, shapes are secondary to color in the development of spaces, and delicate neutral grays set off glowing patches of bright color.|$|E

André Breton described him as [...] "the most Surrealist of us all." [...] Miró confessed to creating one of his most famous works, Harlequin's Carnival, under similar circumstances: ...|$|R

25|$|Van Gogh {{depicted}} the view {{at different times}} of day and under various weather conditions, including sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper; eventually he would base newer variations on previous versions. The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field. Van Gogh telescoped the view in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the <b>picture</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
25|$|In this {{adaptation}} of Primitivism and abandonment of perspective {{in favor of}} a flat, two-dimensional <b>picture</b> <b>plane,</b> Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. This proto-Cubist work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both Cubism and Modern art. Les Demoiselles was revolutionary and controversial, and led to widespread anger and disagreement, even amongst the painter's closest associates and friends. Matisse considered the work something of a bad joke, yet indirectly reacted to it in his 1908 Bathers with a Turtle. Braque too initially disliked the painting, yet perhaps more than anyone else, studied the work in great detail. And effectively, his subsequent friendship and collaboration with Picasso led to the Cubist revolution. Its resemblance to Cézanne's Les Grandes Baigneuses, Paul Gauguin's statue Oviri and El Greco's Opening of the Fifth Seal has been widely discussed by later critics.|$|E
25|$|The {{artist has}} broken down the <b>picture</b> <b>plane</b> into facets, {{presenting}} multiple aspects of the subject simultaneously. This concept first pronounced by Metzinger in 1910—since considered a founding principle of Cubism—would soon {{find its way into}} the foundations of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics; the fact that a complete description of one and the same subject may require diverse points of view which defy a unique description. The painting was owned by the poet Joseph Houot (known as Jacques Nayral). It was presumably bought by a Danish collector in 1918. The painting was subsequently sold at auction through art dealer Kai Grunth hos Winkel & Magnussen, auction no. 108, February 19, 1932, lot no. 119. Purchased by Danish physicist Niels Bohr. After his death Woman with Horse was sold by his widow Margrethe Bohr (through Ernest Bohr) to the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen. It is now in the Royal Collection of Paintings and Sculpture at the museum.|$|E

The first commercial version of the game was Salvo, published in 1931 in the United States by the Starex company. Other versions of the game were printed in the 1930s and 1940s, including the Strathmore Company's Combat: The Battleship Game, Milton Bradley's Broadsides: A Game of Naval Strategy and Maurice L. Freedman's Warfare Naval Combat. Strategy Games Co. produced a version called Wings which <b>pictured</b> <b>planes</b> flying over the Los Angeles Coliseum.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented for removing hidden lines for isometric and perspective projections of three-dimensional objects. An object {{can be regarded}} as being made up of a number of planes, and the whole picture can therefore be visualized as only a collection of planes. Considering planes as the basic element of a picture, non-convex polyhedra can be displayed directly without prior subdivisions into convex ones. Lines connecting nodal points are first retrieved from the model to be plotted by a simple but efficient technique. On the <b>picture</b> <b>planes,</b> each unique line is examined in turn to see if it is totally or partially hidden. The intersections between a unique line and a projected plane (with or without openings) are determined by a new method which, even in the presence of numerical errors, will always give correct intersection information. Unlike many classical algorithms, intersections are determined by a single formula without tedious case subdivisions. With little additional calculations, object penetrations can also be tackled. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|In the 1930s, {{she began}} {{studying}} modern art through learning {{the components of}} composition, technique, and theory. This initial investigation into modern art formed her work {{throughout the rest of}} her career. She began taking classes from Hans Hofmann in 1937, which modernized her approach to the nude and still life. He emphasized the two-dimensional nature of the <b>picture</b> <b>plane</b> and usage of color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons. Throughout her classes with Hofmann, Krasner worked in an advanced style of cubism, also known as neo-cubism. During the class, a human nude or a still life setting would be the model from which Krasner and other students would have to work. She typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings. She typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition of light and dark colors. The still lifes illustrated her interest in fauvism since she suspended brightly colored pigment on white backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|Gleizes' {{concern for}} construction, {{structural}} rhythms and simplification was dominant even through his short-lived Fauve-like period, when his color brightest and impasto thickest. By treating his subject matter in geometric terms and by modifying curves to become sharp, angled lines, Gleizes consistently held his compositions {{to the surface}} of the <b>picture</b> <b>plane.</b> He began to divide the surface into a series of interlocking angles and rectangles of contrasting forms. The overall rose tonality was employed by Gleizes to counter the illusion of depth. In the process Gleizes created some of his first Proto-Cubist works. His awareness of Paul Cézanne—even in the handling of paint—is evident during this period that lasted roughly from 1907 to 1909, though the process of geometric simplification is more akin to Symbolism, Pont Aven and Les Nabis principles than to Cézanne. Bords de la Marne and other painting by Gleizes during this phase (e.g., Paysage dans les Pyrènnes (Landscape in the Pyrenees Mountains), 1908, and Paris, Les Quais, 1908), also bear marked affinity to the work of Henri Le Fauconnier, despite the fact that the two artists had not yet become friends or known about each other's work.|$|E

500|$|The {{plates are}} set spaces without fixed boundaries; the mayhem extends outside the frames of the <b>picture</b> <b>plane</b> in all directions.

It is evident Goya viewed the Spanish war with disillusionment, and despaired both for the violence around him and for the loss of a liberal ideal he believed was being replaced by a new militant unreason. Hughes believed Goya's decision to render the images through etchings, which by definition are absent of colour, indicates feelings of utter hopelessness.|$|E
