5|$|In {{the event}} Scotland regained its {{independent}} system of law, its parliament and its kirk, {{but also the}} Lords of the Articles (through which the crown controlled <b>parliamentary</b> <b>business)</b> and bishops. It also had a king who did not visit the country and ruled largely without reference to Parliament {{through a series of}} commissioners. These began with Middleton, now an earl, and ended with the king's brother and heir, James, Duke of York (known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany). Legislation was revoked back to 1633, by the Rescissory Act 1661, removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops' Wars, but the discipline of kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods were renewed. Only four Covenanters were excluded from the general pardon and were executed, the most prominent being the Marquis of Argyll, but also including the Protester James Guthrie.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1450s, {{a great deal}} of the {{legislative}} business of the Scottish parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the 'Lords of the Articles', chosen by the three estates to draft legislation that was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. Before the sixteenth century, <b>parliamentary</b> <b>business</b> was also carried out by 'sister' institutions, including the General Council and the Convention of Estates. These bodies could deal with taxation, legislation and policy-making, but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. In the fifteenth century, parliament was being called on an almost annual basis, more often than its English counterpart, and was willing to offer occasional resistance or criticism to the policies of the crown, particular in the unpopular reign of James III. However, from about 1494, after his success against the Stewarts and Douglases and over rebels in 1482 and 1488, James IV managed largely to dispense with the institution, and it might have declined, like many other systems of Estates in continental Europe, had it not been for his death in 1513 and another long minority.|$|E

25|$|The Indian {{constitution}} draws {{a distinction}} between the language to be used in Parliamentary proceedings, and the language in which laws are to be made. <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>business,</b> according to the Constitution, may be conducted in either Hindi or English.

25|$|The abbots became {{increasingly}} important political figures. Since the confiscation of Earl Robert's lands by the Crown, each Abbot of Shrewsbury was a tenant-in-chief, {{and with the}} summoning of Parliament in the reign of Henry III, compelled to attend. Abbot Luke {{bought a house in}} London {{to make it easier for}} himself and his successors to attend Parliament and perform other important political business. This was a good buy, as when the number of abbots summoned to parliament was fixed at 28 during the reign of Edward III, the Abbot of Shrewsbury was one of them. The Victoria County History asserts that the abbots were permitted by the Pope to wear the mitre from 1397. Abbot Richard Lye actually died in London while on <b>parliamentary</b> <b>business</b> in 1512 and was buried at St Bartholomew-the-Less in Smithfield.|$|E
500|$|On 2 March 2006, a beam in {{the roof}} of the debating chamber swung loose from its hinges during a debate, {{resulting}} in the evacuation of the debating chamber and the suspension of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>business.</b> Parliament moved to other premises while the whole roof structure was inspected and remedial works were carried out. The structural engineers, Arup, stated that the problem with the collapsed beam was entirely due to the failure of one bolt and the absence of another. There was no design fault. The engineers concluded, in a report to MSPs, that the damage is likely to have been done during construction work on the chamber roof, in the latter phases of the project. [...] The report also indicated that whilst one of the bolts was missing, the other was broken and had damaged threads commensurate with being overtightened or jammed, which twisted the head off, or came close to doing so.|$|E
500|$|On 16 December, Murphy {{announced}} the lineup of his Shadow Cabinet, which included posts {{for the two}} people who had stood against him in the leadership contest.

Baillie was handed the post of Shadow Minister for Finance, Constitution and Economy, while Marra took on Health, Wellbeing and Sport. Other appointments to Labour's frontbench team were Mary Fee (Infrastructure, Investment and Cities), Gray (Education and Lifelong Learning), Ken Macintosh (Social Justice, Communities and Pensioners' Rights), Hugh Henry (Justice), Claire Baker (Culture, Europe and External Affairs), Kelly (<b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Business</b> Manager), Neil Bibby (Chief Whip), and Graeme Pearson (Enterprise). It was also announced that Dugdale would speak for Labour at First Minister's Questions. Lamont did not have a place in the new cabinet, but Murphy stated that she had not wanted one: [...] "Johann and I have been in touch with one another; she has wished me well. I'm looking forward to getting together with her, but Johann wasn't looking for a job in today's reshuffle. I think Johann will be {{a big part of the}} Scottish Labour Party for years to come".|$|E

500|$|<b>Parliamentary</b> <b>business,</b> in {{the form}} of the hotly contested Reform Bill campaign, delayed his taking command until May. His youth and inexperience, {{compared}} with that of the battle-tested officers whom he led (some were veterans of the battle of Waterloo) drew his naturally punctilious nature to manifest itself in petty-minded bullying. In 1833 he was publicly censured for [...] "reprehensible...conduct" [...] in a court martial held to determine charges he had laid against Captain Augustus Wathen, a subordinate. Brudenell was dismissed, by order of King William, early in 1834. He had, however, influence at court and he asked his sister Harriet, married to Queen Adelaide's chamberlain, Lord Howe, to get the decision reversed. He pestered senior officers and politicians until in March 1836 he was allowed command of the 11th Light Dragoons (later restyled the 11th Hussars), notwithstanding the view of his commander-in-chief, Lord Hill, that he was [...] "constitutionally unfit for command". After a leisurely passage with his wife, he joined his new command in India in October of the following year, just in time to enjoy some tiger-shooting before seeing the regiment off for Britain at the end of its long posting. He travelled separately in a hired vessel, disdaining to share the discomforts of the warship carrying his troops. Of the two years following his appointment, only four weeks were spent with his regiment.|$|E
500|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} {{body in the}} process of government was parliament, which had evolved by the late 13th century from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls into a 'colloquium' with a political and judicial role. By the early 14th century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and probably from 1326 burgh commissioners joined them to form the Three Estates, meeting in a variety of major towns throughout the kingdom. It acquired significant powers over particular issues, including consent for taxation, but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic. From the early 1450s, {{a great deal of the}} legislative business of the Scottish Parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the 'Lords of the Articles', chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>business</b> was also carried out by 'sister' institutions, before c. 1500 by General Council and thereafter by the Convention of Estates.

Uncompleted <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>business</b> is not affected by a prorogation, and is carried over from one session to the next. For instance, Standing Order 88(1) of the Standing Orders of Parliament states: [...] "A Bill before Parliament shall not lapse upon the prorogation of Parliament and all business and proceedings connected therewith shall be carried over to the next session of the same Parliament and continue from the stage that it had reached in the preceding session."

When the Liberal Party regrouped after the election, Atkinson was appointed as the party's spokesperson for small business.
