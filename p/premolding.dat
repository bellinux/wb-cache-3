40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} M 40 high modulus carbon fiber-reinforced {{polyimide}} (CFRPI) composites are prepared by laminating <b>premolding</b> PI films with unidirectional CF layers. After the imidization processing of <b>premolding</b> PI films is estimated, {{the effect of}} CF volume fraction, processing conditions, and PI molecular structure on the properties of CFRPI composites is studied in detail. In addition, SiO 2 nanoparticles are added as fillers to the <b>premolding</b> PI films at varying concentrations. The effect of the nanoparticles on the properties of CFRPI composites is also investigated. The surface characteristics of M 40 CF are measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The thermal and mechanical properties of CFRPI composites are measured by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, SANS testing machine, scanning electron microscopy, and other techniques. The experimental {{results show that the}} properties of CFRPI composites are mainly affected by the <b>premolding</b> PI film and molding conditions. The change of CF volume fraction from 55 to 65 % has little effect on the mechanical properties of the CFRPI composites. In addition, flexible PI as...|$|E

40|$|In-mold {{assembly}} is {{a promising}} process for producing articulated joints. It utilizes injection molding to automate assembly operations, which may otherwise require high labor times for production. Since injection molding {{is a high}} throughput process, in-mold assembly holds considerable promise in bulk production of assembled parts. However, current in-mold assembly methods cannot be used for manufacturing in-mold assembled products at the mesoscale. This is because the process changes considerably when the sizes of the molded parts are reduced. The <b>premolded</b> component in a mesoscale joint consists of miniature features. Hence, when a high temperature, high pressure polymer melt is injected on top of it, it is susceptible to plastic deformation. Due to presence of a mesoscale <b>premolded</b> component which is susceptible to deformation, traditional shrinkage models alone {{can not be used}} to characterize and control the clearances. This dissertation identifies and addresses issues pertaining to in-mold assembly of revolute joints at the mesoscale. First, this dissertation identifies defect modes which are unique to in-mold assembly at the mesoscale. Then it develops mold design templates which can be used for manufacturing in-mold assembled mesoscale revolute joints. Further, issues related to the deformation of the mesoscale <b>premolded</b> component are identified. Two novel mold design solutions to realize mesoscale in-mold assembled revolute joints are presented. The first involves use of mold inserts to constrain the <b>premolded</b> component to inhibit its deformation. The second involves use of a bi-directional flow of the polymer melt over the <b>premolded</b> component to balance the deforming forces experienced by it. Finally, methods to predict and control clearances that would be obtained in mesoscale in-mold assembled revolute joints are presented. To demonstrate the utility of the tools built as part of this research effort, a case study of a miniature robotic application built using mesoscale in-mold assembly methods is presented. This dissertation provides a new approach for manufacturing mesoscale assemblies which can lead to reduction in product cost and create several new product possibilities...|$|R
40|$|In-mold {{assembly}} {{process has been}} used for manufacturing articulated structures at the macro scale. But the in-mold {{assembly process}} at the mesoscale behaves differently and poses new challenges due to reduced structural rigidity of the mesoscale <b>premolded</b> component. One of the major challenges {{that need to be addressed}} is that of the plastic deformation of the <b>premolded</b> component during the second stage injection. This paper reports a mold design strategy and a detailed modeling approach to characterize and control this deformation. The following new results are reported in this paper. First, a mesoscale mold design with varying cavity shape is described to perform in-mold assembly of the mesoscale revolute joint. Secondly a transient flow based modeling approach to determine the forces experienced by the mesoscale parts due to injection molding is described. These forces are of particular interest in the in-mold assembly perspective since they are forces applied on the <b>premolded</b> component due to flow of the second stage melt. Finally, a mechanics-based model developed using experimental data and numerical CFD and FEA simulations is presented for the determination of critical mold design parameters that are necessary for repeatable fabrication of articulating mesoscale revolute joints.

40|$|Defect in a {{cable joint}} {{is one of}} the main reasons of a power system being faulty. A defect can cause the {{electric}} field in the cable joint to become higher than the material surrounding the defect. This may result in partial discharge (PD) activity to occur within the defect site. When PD is repeating at the defect site, the material surrounding the defect will be affected, where PD may extend its path in the material. This may result in a breakdown at cable joint and consequently causes breakdown on the whole system. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to study the electric field distribution in 132 kV one piece <b>premolded</b> cable joint with and without the presence of defects.

40|$|O trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar a resposta tecidual à implantação de discos de poliuretana derivada do óleo de mamona confeccionados de duas formas distintas, na forma pré-moldada fornecida pela indústria e em biomassa moldada no momento da aplicação, de forma a observar se haveria algum tipo de reação local tardia associada à possível continuidade do processo de endurecimento final do biomaterial. Foram utilizados 20 ratos, linhagem Wistar, fêmeas, com peso de 300 - 350 g, nos quais foi inserido o disco pré-moldado no tecido subcutâneo do flanco direito e o de biomassa moldada no flanco esquerdo. Ambos os discos tinham 0, 8 cm de diâmetro por 0, 5 cm de espessura. Para o procedimento histológico, cinco ratos foram submetidos à eutanásia aos 3, 7, 15 e 30 dias de pós-cirúrgico. Os implantes e tecidos circundantes foram colhidos, processados e corados pela técnica de hematoxilina-eosina. Foi observada inicialmente uma reação inflamatória moderada, composta especialmente por células polimorfonucleares e macrófagos. Os linfócitos variaram de ausentes a discretos. A reação inflamatória diminui de intensidade à medida que se intensificou a formação de tecido conjuntivo fibroso ao redor dos implantes, porém sem modificação dos números de macrófagos. Sendo assim, conclui-se que ambos os discos de poliuretana induzem uma reação inflamatória similar, que varia de moderada a discreta na dependência do momento de avaliação. The aim of {{this study}} was to histologically {{evaluate}} the tissue reaction to implantation of polyurethane disks containing castor oil produced in <b>premolded</b> form, supplied commercially, and biomass molded at the moment of application; since a late tissue reaction may occur during the total hardening process of the biomaterial. Twenty female Wistar rats, about 3 months of age, weighing 300 - 350 g, and polyurethane disks 0. 8 cm in diameter and 0. 5 cm in thickness were used. The <b>premolded</b> disk was implanted into the subcutaneous tissue at the right flank and the molded biomass disk at the left flank. Five rats each were submitted to euthanasia at 3, 7, 15 and 30 days after surgery, and the polyurethane disks and surrounding tissue were collected. The specimens were processed for HE staining and examined microscopically. A moderate inflammatory reaction was primarily composed of polymorphonuclear cells and macrophages. The lymphocytes varied from absent to discreet. The intensity of the inflammatory reaction decreased at the same time the formation of fibrous conjunctive tissue increased around the implants. However, the numbers of macrophages remained the same. In conclusion, both polyurethane disks induce the same type of inflammatory reaction that varies from slight to moderate according to evaluation time...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of movement activities and alternative fitting procedures on protection levels afforded by four hearing pro-tection devices (HPDs). Psychophysical attenuation measurements at nine one-third-octave bands from 125 to 8000 Hz were obtained prior to, during, and fol-lowing a 2 -hr wearing stint that included periods of either highly kinematic but controlled work activity or vigorous temporomandibular movement. The 40 sub-jects, who were nonusers of HPDs, initially fit the protectors according to either the instructions on the package (i. e., subject fit) or after receiving interactive train-ing on proper fit (i. e., trained fit). Thereafter no further protector adjustments were allowed during the wearing period. The subject-fit condition resulted in signifi-cantly lower protection levels, from 4 to 14 dB, at 1000 Hz and below for a pre-molded polymer earplug, a user-molded foam earplug, and a double protector consisting of a muff over the foam plug. The muff alone was significantly more resilient to fitting effects on attenuation than were the plugs. Movement activity caused up to a 6 -dB significant reduction in frequency-specific attenuation over time for the <b>premolded</b> plug, muff, and muff-plug combination. The compliant foam earplug was largely resistant to either type of movement effect but did ben-efit more than the other devices from use of the trained-fit procedure.

40|$|Recreational music {{exposure}} {{is a potential}} risk factor for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Augmented hearing protectors have been designed with modified attenuation characteristics to combine hearing protection and listening comfort. However, to date, only a few independent studies have assessed the performance of those augmented protectors in realistic exposure conditions. This study compares the listening experience and temporary effects on cochlear status with different types of earplugs after exposure to contemporary club music. Five different types of commercially available hearing protectors were worn, all commonly used during leisure-time music exposure. Four of them were augmented <b>premolded</b> earplugs and the fifth type was an inexpensive, standard earplug frequently distributed for free at music events. During five different test sessions of 30 min each, participants not professionally involved in music wore one particular type of protector. Contemporary club music was played at sound pressure levels (SPLs) representative of concerts and bars. After each listening session, a questionnaire on sound quality and general appreciation was completed. In addition, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were measured directly before and after music exposure. The reported appreciation clearly differed depending on the addressed characteristics and the specific earplug type. In this test group, the reported appreciation mainly depended on comfort and looks, while differences in sound quality were less noticeable. The changes in OAE amplitude before and after noise exposure were small in terms of clinical standards. Nevertheless, the observed temporary shifts differed systematically for {{the different types of}} hearing protectors, with two types of musician earplug showing a more systematic decline than the others.

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{sponsored}} {{tests of}} three earplug fit-test systems (NIOSH HPD Well-Fit, Michael & Associates FitCheck, and Honeywell Safety Products VeriPRO). Each system {{was compared to}} laboratory-based real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) measurements in a sound field according to ANSI/ASA S 12. 6 - 2008 at the NIOSH, Honeywell Safety Products, and Michael & Associates testing laboratories. An identical study was conducted independently at the U. S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), which provided their data for inclusion in this article. The Howard Leight Airsoft <b>premolded</b> earplug was tested with twenty subjects {{at each of the}} four participating laboratories. The occluded fit of the earplug was maintained during testing with a soundfield-based laboratory REAT system as well as all three headphone-based fit-test systems. The Michael & Associates lab had the highest average A-weighted attenuations and smallest standard deviations. The NIOSH lab had the lowest average attenuations and the largest standard deviations. Differences in octave-band attenuations between each fit-test system and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) sound field method were calculated (Attenfit-test - AttenANSI). A-weighted attenuations measured with FitCheck and HPD Well-Fit systems demonstrated approximately 21220 dB agreement with the ANSI sound field method, but A-weighted attenuations measured with the VeriPRO system underestimated the ANSI laboratory attenuations. For each of the fit-test systems, the average A-weighted attenuation across the four laboratories was not significantly greater than the average of the ANSI sound field method. Standard deviations for residual attenuation differences were about 21220 dB for FitCheck and HPD Well-Fit compared to 21420 dB for VeriPRO. Individual labs exhibited a range of agreement from less than a dB to as much as 9. 420 dB difference with ANSI and REAT estimates. Factors such as the experience of study participants and test administrators, and the fit-test psychometric tasks are suggested as possible contributors to the observed results.
