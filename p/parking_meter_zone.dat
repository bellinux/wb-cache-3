50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Babson filed several patents for a <b>parking</b> <b>meter.</b> The meters were {{suggested}} {{to operate on}} power from the battery of the parking vehicle and required a connection from the vehicle to the meter.

40|$|Cars {{are a great}} modern convenience, but {{the number}} of car owners has grown {{exponentially}} {{in the past couple of}} decades. In busy cities, it is almost impossible to find temporary parking and people often take advantage of the current <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> knowing that there will be a slim chance of being penalized for their actions. This project aims to alleviate this problem by developing a system that will allow the authorities to effectively and efficiently monitor the parking resources within a city. A city-wide wireless network will be used to form a sensor network among the <b>parking</b> <b>meters.</b> These “smart ” <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> will have a dual purpose: to monitor the parking spot in front of them and to collect information from nearby <b>parking</b> <b>meters.</b> This collected information can be relayed to a central station through other <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> or directly through the city’s wireless network. At the central station, the data will be processed and can be used in several ways. The location of empty parking spots can be determined so that people looking for a spot can call a number to find out the closest open spot. Depending on the capabilities of th...|$|R

50|$|A <b>parking</b> <b>meter</b> is {{a device}} {{used to collect}} money in {{exchange}} for the right to park a vehicle in a particular place for a limited amount of time. <b>Parking</b> <b>meters</b> can be used by municipalities as a tool for enforcing their integrated on-street parking policy, usually related to their traffic and mobility management policies, but are also used for revenue.|$|R

In a 1937 case in Oklahoma, H.E. Duncan contended that the ordinances impose a fee for the free use of the streets, which is a right of all citizens of the state granted by state law. The Courts ruled that free use of the streets is not an absolute right, but agreed with an unpublished 1936 Florida court decision that said, [...] "If it had been shown that the streets on which <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> have been installed under this ordinance are not streets where the traffic is sufficiently heavy to require any parking regulations of this sort, or {{that the city was}} making inordinate and unjustified profits by means of the <b>parking</b> <b>meters,</b> and was resorting to their use not for regulatory purposes but for revenue only, {{there might have been a}} different judgment." ...|$|R
