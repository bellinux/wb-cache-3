The headset is a NeuroSky MindWave unit with two motors on the headband where a cat's ears might be. Slipcovers shaped like cat ears sit over the motors so {{that as the}} device registers emotional states the ears move to relate.

500|$|The 2001 film Legally Blonde {{marked a}} turning point in Witherspoon's career; she starred as Elle Woods, a fashion-merchandising major who decides to become a law student in order to follow her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School. Witherspoon said about the role, [...] "When I read Legally Blonde, I was like, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.' So we had to make sure she was the kind of person you just can't hate." [...] Legally Blonde was a box-office hit, {{grossing}} US$96 million domestically. Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics, as the press began referring to her as [...] "the new Meg Ryan". Roger Ebert commented, [...] "Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit", and Salon.com noted that [...] "she [...] delineates Elle's character beautifully". Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer concluded, [...] "Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can <b>perk</b> <b>up</b> a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly." [...] For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer likened {{preparing}} {{herself for}} the role to a musician preparing to record an album, describing the process as twice as much work. At one point, she confessed to Kloves that {{she felt she was}} performing terribly; Kloves insisted that Pfeiffer is a poignant and insightful perfectionist. Producer Mark Rosenberg appreciated Pfeiffer for portraying Susie as a character who is [...] "so colorful and full of life that even Jack... has to <b>perk</b> <b>up</b> and pay attention". Pfeiffer decided to play her character in a way that ultimately uncovers [...] "the scared kid inside" [...] despite her profane and world-weary introduction. Although Pfeiffer was ultimately pleased with her singing, she sometimes doubted her own abilities while filming in fear that she might have [...] "outdone" [...] herself. Pfeiffer slightly slurred her speech to portray her character. Pfeiffer identified Susie's first scene, in which she walks into her audition demanding attention, as her most difficult to film because she initially struggled to channel her character's outgoing personality, which is different than her own introverted nature. A scene originally intended for the film in which Pfeiffer's character accidentally allows a bath she has begun pouring herself to overflow because she has become distracted thinking about Jack was ultimately edited out of the final film. Pfeiffer initially had reservations about performing atop a grand piano, fearing that it would appear [...] "silly" [...] and cause audience members to laugh. However, Kloves encouraged her to commit to the scene. Pfeiffer's short evening dress worn during the musical sequence was designed to be revealing enough without exposing Pfeiffer while she moves, which was choreographed by dancer Peggy Holmes. Pfeiffer touted her character [...] "one of the most alive characters that I've played", describing her as an [...] "emotional creature" [...] who is [...] "not afraid to take risks... doesn't lie to herself. If she makes a mistake, she doesn't blame anybody else. There's a purity in her honesty that I really respect", becoming a strong role model for the actress herself. Pfeiffer also credits Susie with helping her discover her own sexuality, prior to which she had felt uncomfortable exploring. According to the Orlando Sentinels Kathy Huffhines, Susie [...] "has a harder shell, a sharper edge, and a franker sexiness" [...] than previous characters Pfeiffer has played. According to film critic David Thomson of The Independent, the role of Susie allowed Pfeiffer to add an aspect to her filmography, prior to which had been [...] "dutiful" [...] yet [...] "routine".|$|E

2500|$|Facial expression: Facial {{gestures}} play {{an important}} role in animal communication. [...] Often a facial gesture is a signal of emotion. [...] Dogs, for example, express anger through snarling and showing their teeth. In alarm their ears <b>perk</b> <b>up,</b> in fear the ears flatten while the dogs expose their teeth slightly and squint their eyes. Jeffrey Mogil studied the facial expressions of mice during increments of increasing pain; there were five recognizable facial expressions; orbital tightening, nose and cheek bulge, and changes in ear and whisker carriage.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{time when}} average male {{earnings}} were around £200 per annum (around £11,000 at 2016 prices) and he was earning around £150 per annum at De La Rue, Macleod sometimes made £100 in a night gambling, but on another occasion had to borrow £100 off his father to pay his debts. Macleod was often too tired {{to work in the}} mornings after gambling for much of the night, although he tended to <b>perk</b> <b>up</b> as the day went on; he was popular with colleagues and on at least one occasion mucked in to work overtime for a last-minute order for Chinese banknotes. His biographer comments that he [...] "might have stayed" [...] had he found the work more interesting, but after tolerating him {{for a number of years}} De La Rue sacked him in 1938.|$|E

60|$|I served my time--never mind {{in whose}} office--and I started in {{business}} for myself {{in one of our}} English country towns, I decline stating which. I hadn't a farthing of capital, and my friends in the neighborhood were poor and useless enough, with one exception. That exception was Mr. Frank Gatliffe, son of Mr. Gatliffe, member for the county, the richest man and the proudest for many a mile round about our parts. Stop a bit, Mr. Artist, you needn't <b>perk</b> <b>up</b> and look knowing. You won't trace any particulars by the name of Gatliffe. I'm not bound to commit myself or anybody else by mentioning names. I have given you the first that came into my head.|$|E
6000|$|But in {{the hall}} she paused a minute to peep into the glass and {{see if she was}} all right, for somehow she was more anxious to look neat and pretty to Tom in his hour of trouble than she had ever been in his prosperous days. In lifting her arms to <b>perk</b> <b>up</b> the bow at her throat she knocked a hat off the bracket. Now, a shiny black beaver is not an object exactly {{calculated}} to inspire tender or romantic sentiments, one would fancy, but that particular [...] "stove pipe" [...] seemed to touch Polly to the heart, for she caught it up, as if its fall suggested a greater one, smoothed out a slight dint, as if it was symbolical of the hard knocks its owner's head was now in danger of receiving, and stood looking at it with as much pity and respect, {{as if it had been}} the crown of a disinherited prince. Girls will do such foolish little things, and though we laugh at them, I think we like them the better for it, after all.|$|E

6000|$|The first I shall mention, {{was that}} of {{introducing}} certain new phrases into the court style, which had been very seldom or never made use of in former times. They usually ran in the following terms: [...] "Madam, I cannot serve you while such a one is in employment: I desire humbly to resign my commission, if Mr. ------ continues secretary of state: I cannot answer that the city will lend money, unless my L-- ------ be pr[esiden]t of the c[ounc]il. I must beg leave to surrender, except ------ has the staff. I must not accept the seals, unless ------ comes into the other office." [...] This has been the language of late years from subjects to their prince.[9] Thus they stood upon terms, and must have their own conditions to ruin the nation. Nay, this dutiful manner of capitulating, had spread so far, that every understrapper began at length to <b>perk</b> <b>up</b> and assume: he [...] "expected a regiment"; or [...] "his son must be a major"; or [...] "his brother a collector", else he threatened to vote [...] "according to his conscience." ...|$|E
6000|$|After dinner we {{commenced}} descending towards Martigny, alternately {{riding and}} walking. Here, while I was on foot, my mule took {{it into his}} head to run away. I was never more surprised in my life than to see that staid, solemn, meditative, melancholy beast suddenly <b>perk</b> <b>up</b> both his long ears, thus, and hop about over the steep paths like a goat. Not more surprised should I be to see some venerable D. D. of Princeton leading off a dance in the Jardin Mabille. We chased him here, and chased him there. We headed him, and he headed us. We said, [...] "Now I have you," [...] and he said, [...] "No, you don't!" [...] until the affair began to grow comically serious. [...] "Il se moque de vous!" [...] said the guide. But, at that moment, I sprang and caught him by the bridle, when, presto! down went his ears, shut went the eyes, and over the entire gay brute spread a visible veil of stolidity. And down he plodded, slunging, shambling, pivotting round zigzag corners, as before, in a style which any one that ever navigated such a craft down hill knows without further telling. After that, I was sure that the old fellow kept up a [...] "terrible thinking," [...] {{in spite of his}} stupid looks, and knew a vast deal more than he chose to tell.|$|E
