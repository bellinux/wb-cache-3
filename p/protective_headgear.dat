The Gothenburg study {{analyzed}} temporary levels of neurofiliment light in cerebral spinal fluid which they conclude is evidence of damage, even though the levels soon subside. More comprehensive studies of neurologiocal function on larger samples performed by Johns Hopkins University and accident rates analyzed by National Safety Council show amateur boxing is a comparatively safe sport.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were {{motivated}} by money, as the fighters competed for prize money, promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result. The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited {{to three or four}} rounds, scoring is computed by points {{based on the number of}} clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear <b>protective</b> <b>headgear,</b> reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts. Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an Automated Boxing Scoring System, which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career.|$|E

Due to the possibility that repeatedly [...] "heading" [...] a ball practicing soccer could cause cumulative brain injury, the idea of introducing <b>protective</b> <b>headgear</b> for players has been proposed. Improved equipment design can enhance safety; softer baseballs reduce head injury risk. Rules against dangerous types of contact, such as [...] "spear tackling" [...] in American football, when one player tackles another head first, may also reduce head injury rates.|$|E

2500|$|Mask: The <b>protective</b> <b>headgear</b> worn by goaltenders. The first goaltender {{to wear a}} mask in the National Hockey League was Clint Benedict in 1930 {{who wore}} a crude form made of leather. In November 1959, Jacques Plante, wore a self-made {{fiberglass}} mask after taking a New York Rangers shot to the face. Following his lead, goaltenders around the world began to don <b>protective</b> <b>headgear,</b> which is now a requirement. Masks have evolved from the flush style introduced by Plante, to the player's helmet/special [...] "birdcage" [...] style best associated with Vladislav Tretiak and Chris Osgood, to the modern hybrid helmet, made of advanced materials such as carbon fiber or Kevlar, increasing in safety as time went on. Especially at higher levels of hockey, many goaltenders have their masks painted to represent their team's colors/imagery, landmarks in the city they play in or personal interests/nicknames. Examples of this include Mike Richter's Statue of Liberty mask, Ed Belfour's Eagle on his mask (Eddie the Eagle nickname), Ryan Miller featuring the words [...] "Matt Man" [...] on his masks {{in honor of his}} late cousin, and motorsports fan Craig Anderson including the Corvette Racing logo on the backplate of his masks.|$|E
2500|$|A batting helmet is the <b>protective</b> <b>headgear</b> worn by batters in {{the game}} of {{baseball}} or softball. It is meant to protect the batter's head from errant pitches thrown by the pitcher. A batter who is [...] "hit by pitch", due to an inadvertent wild pitch or a pitcher's purposeful attempt to hit him, may be seriously, even fatally, injured. In 1905, a New York Giants (the team now known as the San Francisco Giants) baseball player named Roger Bresnahan, after missing thirty days of the baseball season and lying in a hospital bed due to a head injury (or beaning), created, with assistance from the A.J. Reach Company, a crude, leather, vertically sliced football helmet over his cap that is considered to be the first batting helmet. The headgear was unpopular, even with Bresnahan at the time, and it wasn't until the mid-1950s that his idea was accepted.|$|E

40|$|There is no {{standard}} test {{to assess the}} ability of soft headgear to prevent the likelihood of head injuries in the Australian football codes. Therefore the impact energy attenuation of <b>protective</b> football <b>headgear</b> was assessed using a yielding artificial headform and impact surface to characterise the impact scenario. Seven soft football headgear of varying mass, materials and thickness were dropped from a height to generate impact energy of 56 J. The headgear were tested {{for a number of}} different impact locations. Accelerometers within the headform monitored the impact mechanics. A Head Injury Criterion (HIC) of 1000 was selected as the injury threshold. Reliability data, collected one week apart, revealed that the results were highly reproducible. Although several of the headgear generated HIC values about 1000 for the various impact locations, only one of the headgear, that with the greatest thickness (15 mm) generated a HIC score below 1000 for impacts to the side and front of the headgear. There was a significant correlation between headgear thickness and HIC scores. It was concluded that {{all but one of the}} commercially available soft football headgear tested provided inadequate impact energy attenuation due to the limited amount of padding. It is postulated that the padding material of the headgear would need to be at least 15 mm thick to offer adequate protection...|$|R
40|$|Sports-related {{orofacial}} {{trauma is}} a serious problem that can be prevented by wearing <b>protective</b> mouthguards and <b>headgear.</b> While this equipment is available, few studies have been done of wearing practices. This study assesses the wearing practices using data from the Child Health Supplement of the 1991 National Health Interview Survey. Results indicate that football was the only sport in which the majority of children used mouthguards and headgear. While statistically significant differences (p<. 05) were found in use of the equipment in all sports by grade level, gender, parent's education, ethnicity, and by region of the the country, these differences were not consistent across sports. Healthy People 2000 calls for extending requirements for use of orofacial protective devices to all organizations sponsoring sports that pose risk to injury. Given the complex nature of the findings, multifaceted initiatives that include the promulgation of rules must be developed and tested to determine what approaches are effective in ensuring consistent use...|$|R
2500|$|Chapter 5. The Beanproof Cap of Foulproof Taylor. Chapter 5 {{begins by}} {{describing}} challenges fielders face when {{looking for a}} fly ball in the sun. [...] To see better, {{as well as to}} protect their eyes, players began wearing sun glasses during in the early 1900s. Protecting a players eyes, however was of secondary importance to protecting a player's head which could only be accomplished by a hardened shell worn under, over or in the place of a cap. One of the early inventors of <b>protective</b> <b>headgear</b> was James Philip Leo Taylor, a British immigrant and inventor, who after suffering a groin injury, developed one of the first protective cups designed to protect male genitalia. Taylor's version of a protective cap never became popular nor did he ever achieve fame or wealth {{as a result of his}} other safety inventions, but eventually, and mainly as the result of devastating accidents, safety gear was worn by all baseball players.|$|E
2500|$|Competitors wear <b>protective</b> <b>headgear</b> {{and gloves}} {{with a white}} strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not {{required}} but any solid color may be worn. The white end just {{is a way to}} make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless the fighters weigh under 165 pounds, thus allowing them to wear 10 ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches – any boxer repeatedly landing low blows below the belt is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced. Amateur bouts which end this way may be noted as [...] "RSC" [...] (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (RSCO), outscored opponent (RSCOS), injury (RSCI) or head injury (RSCH).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop advance, high {{performance}} polyurea foams for multi-hit capability in protective equipment that respond over a range of impact energies, temperatures, and strain rates. In addition, the microstructure of these materials should be tunable such that the peak stress (or force) transmitted across the foam section can be limited to a specific value defined by an injury threshold while maximizing impact energy absorption. Novel polyurea foams were manufactured and found to exhibit a reversible viscoelastic shear deformation at the molecular level. The intrinsic shear dissipation process is synergistically coupled to controlled collapse of a novel pore structure. The microstructure compromises of stochastic polyhedral cells ranging from 200 – 500 μm with perforated membranes with small apertures (~ 20 μm). This makes them strain rate sensitive as {{the rate at which}} the air escapes the cells depend upon the loading rate. These mechanisms operate simultaneously and sequentially, thereby significantly reducing the transmitted impact forces across the foam section. Thus, they behave as an elastically modulated layered composite because the cells stiffen or soften in response to the changing loading rate. Therefore, the newly developed polyurea foams are able to manage the varying material strain rate that occurs within the same loading event without the need to modulate the stiffness or density. Additionally, polyurea foams were found to retain its excellent impact properties over a range of temperatures (0 ï¿½C to 40 ï¿½C) by having a glass transition temperature well below 0 ï¿½C. This is in contrast to commercially available high performance foams that have the glass transition temperature near 0 ï¿½C and absorb energy through phase transformation at ambient conditions, but significantly stiffen at lower temperatures, and dramatically soften at higher temperatures. This expands the application domain of polyurea foam material considerably as it can be tailored to withstand a range of dynamic forces and impact velocities, showing further improvement over currently used protective foams. This thesis also presents a new composite foam concept that involves infiltrating a polyurea-based foam through an open 3 D lattice structure with a truss-like network of 2 mm-size struts. The combination of dynamic buckling at the macro (preform lattice struts) and the micro (foam pores) levels increases the stiffness and plateau strength of the composite polyurea foam. The composite foams absorb more impact energy in same section thickness, while keeping both the peak stress and impulse duration low compared to high performance expanded polystyrene (EPS) and Poron foam technology, but without the material crushing or undergoing phase shift, respectively. Most importantly, the composite foams display stability at both low (0 ï¿½C) and high temperatures (40 ï¿½C) because of its extremely low Tg of - 50 ï¿½C. Being viscoelastic, they recover fully within 30 s after each impact, without loss of any energy absorption capability. These properties should allow these materials to have a wide range of military and civilian applications, especially in advance armors and <b>protective</b> body and <b>headgear</b> systems...|$|R
