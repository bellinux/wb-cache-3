50|$|Steroid {{injections}} {{are helpful}} {{in the short}} term (first approximately 4 weeks) however, their long term effectiveness is not known, and quality of evidence for its use remains poor and controversial.Other, more conservative and non-surgical, treatment options available for the management and treatment of tendinopathy include: rest, ice, massage therapy, eccentric exercise, NSAIDs, ultrasound therapy, LIPUS, electrotherapy, taping, sclerosing injections, blood injection, glyceryl trinitrate patches, and (ESWT) extracorporeal shockwave therapy. Studies with a rat model of fatigue-damaged tendons suggested that delaying exercise until after the initial inflammatory stage of repair could promote remodelling more rapidly. There is insufficient evidence on the routine use of injection therapies (Autologous blood, Platelet-rich plasma, Deproteinised haemodialysate, Aprotinin, <b>Polysulphated</b> <b>glycosaminoglycan,</b> Corticosteroid, Skin derived fibroblasts etc.) for treating Achilles tendinopathy. As of 2014 there was insufficient evidence to support the use of platelet-rich therapies for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries such as ligament, muscle and tendon tears and tendinopathies.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the histopathological {{alterations}} in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) of horses with experimentally-induced tendinitis and treated with <b>polysulphated</b> <b>glycosaminoglycan</b> (PSGAG). Tendini-tis of the SDFT was induced in two groups (I and II) of five Arabian horses each (both sexes, 2 - 6 years old) by the intratendineous injection of 1 ml of collagenase (2. 5 mg/ml). Seven days after injury, the horses in group I received five intralesional injections of 1 ml of PSGAG (125 mg/ml), every four days, whereas the horses in group II received saline injections of the same volume and frequency. The macroscopic changes observed 150 days after injury in-cluded thickening of the paratenon, an increase in vascularity and adhesions to the palmar surface of the SDFT. Histopathological examination revealed an extensive area of fibroplasia and neovascularization, with poorly orga-nized collagen fibers and hypercellular thickening of the endotenon. There were no significant differences in the regeneration of the tendon between collagenase-treated and control groups, thus indicating that the intralesional ad-ministration of PSGAG had no beneficial effect in the treatment of experimentally-induced tendinitis.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} for separating free 35 SO 4 [...] from 35 SO 4 labelled proteoglycans synthesised by rabbit articular chondrocytes cultured {{in the presence}} of excess 35 SO 4 [...] . The procedure uses the low solubility product of barium sulphate to remove, by precipitation, free 35 SO 4 [...] from culture medium. Optimum recovery of 35 SO 4 labelled proteoglycans was achieved after papain digestion to release 35 SO 4 -glycosaminoglycans, and addition of chondroitin sulphate before the precipitation step. Using this assay, we studied the effect of six drugs-indomethacin, diclofenac, sodium pentosan <b>polysulphate,</b> <b>glycosaminoglycan</b> <b>polysulphate</b> ester, tiaprofenic acid, and ketoprofen-on the secretion into the medium of labelled proteoglycans by lapine chondrocytes. The six drugs were tested at 0. 1, 1, 10, 50, and 100 micrograms/ml over four consecutive 48 hour culture periods. A consistent concentration-response pattern was found for the four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) studied. Generally they inhibited proteoglycan secretion at 50 and 100 micrograms/ml but had no effect at lower concentrations. Inhibition of secretion was strongest with indomethacin and diclofenac at 50 and 100 micrograms/ml. In contrast with the NSAIDs studied, the two sulphated polysaccharides (sodium pentosan <b>polysulphate</b> and <b>glycosaminoglycan</b> <b>polysulphate</b> ester) at low concentrations increased proteoglycan secretion by chondrocytes, with maximal stimulation occurring at 1 microgram/ml.

Ultrasonographic examination was used to define the severity of injuries to the superficial digital flexor tendon in 73 National Hunt or point-to-point racehorses and the factors influencing {{the outcome of the}} cases were examined. Thirty-four of the horses (46 per cent) returned to work with an average time out of training of 13. 5 months. The rate of recurrence of the injury was 35 per cent. The severity of the lesions was related to the outcome; all the mildly affected horses returned to work, with 63 per cent of them racing and an average time out of training of 10. 2 months; 50 per cent of the moderately affected horses returned to work, and 30 per cent raced with an average time out of training of 11. 3 months; 30 per cent of the severely affected horses worked, and 23 per cent raced with an average time out of training of 18. 3 months. The differences in outcome between unilateral and bilateral injuries within each severity group were not statistically significant. Seventy-six per cent of horses treated with <b>polysulphated</b> <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> returned to work, compared with 46 per cent of conservatively managed horses and 50 per cent of horses treated with laser therapy.

40|$|Native {{platelet}} factor- 4 (PF 4) is an asymmetrically associated, homo-tetrameric protein (70 residues/subunit) {{known for}} binding <b>polysulphated</b> <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> like heparin. PF 4 N-terminal chimeric mutant M 2 (PF 4 -M 2), {{on the other}} hand, forms symmetric tetramers [Mayo, Roongta, Ilyina, Milius, Barker, Quinlan, La Rosa and Daly (1995) Biochemistry 34, 11399 - 11409] making NMR studies with this 32 kDa protein tractable. PF 4 -M 2, moreover, binds heparin with a similar affinity to that of native PF 4. NMR data presented here indicate that heparin (9000 Da cut-off) binding to PF 4 -M 2, while not perturbing the overall structure of the protein, does perturb specific side-chain proton resonances which map to spatially related residues within a ring of positively charged side chains {{on the surface of}} tetrameric PF 4 -M 2. Contrary to PF 4 -heparin binding models which centre around C-terminal alpha-helix lysines, this study indicates that a loop containing Arg- 20, Arg- 22, His- 23 and Thr- 25, as well as Lys- 46 and Arg- 49, are even more affected by heparin binding. Site-directed mutagenesis and heparin binding data support these NMR findings by indicating that arginines more than C-terminal lysines, are crucial to the heparin binding process...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of limb bone fracture and subsequent {{morbidity and mortality}} due to excessive bone loss is increasing in the progressively ageing populations of both men and women. In contrast to bone loss in the weight-bearing limb, bone mass in the protective skull vault is maintained. One explanation for this could be anatomically diverse bone matrix characteristics generated by heterogeneous osteoblast populations. We have tested the hypothesis that adult bones demonstrate sitespecific characteristics, and report differences at the organ, cell and transcriptome levels. Limb bones contain greater amounts of <b>polysulphated</b> <b>glycosaminoglycan</b> stained with Alcian Blue and have significantly higher osteocyte densities than skull bone. Site-specific patterns persist in cultured adult bone-derived cells both phenotypically (proliferation rate, response to estrogen and cell volumes), and {{at the level of}} specific gene expression (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1, reelin and ras-like and estrogen-regulated growth inhibitor). Based on genome-wide mRNA expression and cluster analysis, we demonstrate that bones and cultured adult bone-derived cells segregate according to site of derivation. We also find the differential expression of genes associated with embryological development (Skull: Zic, Dlx, Irx, Twist 1 and Cart 1; Limb: Hox, Shox 2, and Tbx genes) in both adult bones and isolated adult bone-derived cells. Together, these sitespecific differences support the view that, analogous to different muscle types (cardiac, smooth and skeletal), skull and limb bones represent separate classes of bone. We assign these differences, not to mode of primary ossification, but to th...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} intratendineous {{injections}} of <b>polysulphated</b> <b>glycosaminoglycan</b> (PSGAG) as treatment of collagenase-induced tendonitis was studied.

Seven days after the induced-lesions were created, the horses of GI received five intralesional injections of 1. 0 ml (125 mg) of PSGAG, every four days. Horses of GII received injections of saline in the same dose and rate. Clinical and ultrasonographic evaluations were performed periodically, during 150 days.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the hypothesis that}} local administration of a <b>polysulphated</b> <b>glycosaminoglycan</b> (PSGAG) in the early phase of healing of a standard collagenase-induced tendon injury in the superficial digital flexor tendon of the rabbit would reduce the degenerative effects of inflammatory mediators and proteases and preserve normal tendon morphology, composition, and biomechanical properties. Histological and ultrastructural changes together with the mechanical properties, dry weight, collagen content, and amount of DNA in healing tissue {{at the site of}} the lesion were assessed in treated and untreated animals. In treated lesions 28 days after injury, the normal orientation of tenoblasts and collagen fibrils was well preserved compared with the disorganized scar formation seen in untreated animals. The degree of cellularity was significantly higher in the untreated lesions. At the ultrastructural level the collagen in the healing tissue of the treated animals consisted of a mixture of small diameter, new regenerated fibrils intermingled with well-preserved large diameter, old fibrils, aligned to the long axis of the tendon; in untreated animals small, randomly arranged new fibrils predominated. The diameters of treated tendons had returned to normal, but in untreated animals the injured tendons remained significantly thicker than their controls. The percentage dry weight and collagen contents of treated injured tendons approximated those of control normal tendons, whereas those of untreated tendons were significantly less than those of the control values. The DNA content of injured treated tendons was not significantly different from that of normal contralateral controls, while in the untreated tendons it was significantly higher. There were no significant differences between the normal and the contralateral treated injured tendons in ultimate strength, fatigue strength, stiffness, and maximum absorbed energy. However in the untreated animals, although the tendon diameter was significantly greater, the ultimate strength, fatigue strength, stiffness, and maximum absorbed energy were significantly lower than the contralateral control. These data suggest that polysulphated glycosaminoglycans are effective in restoring the morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical properties of injured soft connective tissues and may be of clinical value in the treatment of acute tendon injury.

40|$|The use of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) in {{orthopedic}} {{practice has}} recently and rapidly acquired an important role. Therapies {{based on the}} use of MSCs for the treatment of acute injuries as well as chronic inflammatory disorders are gradually becoming clinical routine. These cells have demonstrated intriguing therapeutic potentialities (i. e. : inflammation control, tissue regeneration and pathological scar prevention), that have been taken into consideration for use in both human and veterinary medicine. In particular, horses represent high performance athletes considered models for human pathologies since musculo-skeletal disorders frequently occur in this species. In the past, repair of tendon injures were performed by different methods. In particular, clinical therapy was based on ice application, bandage, box rest and controlled exercise. An alternative approach consisted {{on the use of}} corticosteroid (inflammation reduction) and other drugs (sodium hyaluronate, <b>polysulphated</b> <b>glycosaminoglycans,</b> beta aminoproprionitrile fumarate). Furthermore, surgical treatments like accessory ligament desmotomy, local irritation by line firing or pin firing were commonly used. More recently ultrasound, laser therapy, electromagnetic field therapy have been considered. Unfortunately, they did not allow complete tissue healing and quite often animals did not regain competitiveness. In order to minimize this inconvenience, the use of MSCs has been introduced {{as an alternative to the}} traditional approach since it represents a potential tool to improve tissue regeneration. Aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of MSCs to improve the functional outcome of horses affected by tendonitis and desmitis. Thirty-three breed and activity-matched horses affected by tendonitis or desmitis, were included in clinical trial scored for lesions and subdivided into two groups. Group 1 animals were treated with autologous MSCs, associated with platelet rich plasma (group 1). Bone marrow samples were collected from the sternum of the treated horses and processed in order to isolate MSCs. Following cell therapy, they were subjected to a rehabilitation period and their ability to resume training was evaluated. In this study, implanted MSCs caused no adverse reactions and thirteen out of the eighteen inoculated horses returned to race competitions. On the contrary, no improvement was seen in the twelve animals of group 2 treated with pin firing, that were not able to resume sport activity. In conclusion the clinical trial proves the safety of equine bone-marrow derived MSCs and a successful outcome of the treated animals that returned to their previous level of sport activity...|$|R
30|$|Injection {{therapy for}} chronic lateral elbow {{tendinopathy}} (LET), known commonly as tennis elbow, remains a popular treatment choice (Sahbudin & Peall, 2013; Titchener et al., 2015).

Estudou-se o efeito de aplicações intratendíneas do polissulfato de glicosaminoglicanas (PSGAG) no tratamento de tendinite induzida pela colagenase. Dois grupos (GI e GII) de cinco eqüinos da raça Puro-Sangue Árabe, machos e fêmeas, com idades entre dois e seis anos, foram submetidos à tendinite do tendão flexor digital superficial do membro torácico esquerdo por aplicação intratendínea de 1, 0 ml de colagenase (2, 5 mg/ml). Decorridos sete dias da indução da lesão, os eqüinos do GI receberam cinco aplicações intralesionais de 1, 0 ml (125 mg) de PSGAG, a intervalos de quatro dias, enquanto que os do GII receberam aplicações de solução fisiológica em igual volume e freqüência. Efetuaram-se avaliações clínicas e ultra-sonográficas, periodicamente, durante 150 dias. Todos os animais apresentaram claudicação e aumento local de sensibilidade, de temperatura e de volume 24 horas após a indução da lesão. Com exceção do aumento de volume, que permaneceu visível até o final do experimento, observou-se regressão de todos os sinais em todos os animais. A avaliação ultra-sonográfica evidenciou lesões de tamanho, forma e posição variados, de maior severidade entre o sétimo e 23 º dia. Ao término do experimento, o grau de ecogenicidade encontrava-se entre 1 e 2, e o grau de paralelismo entre 0 e 2. A análise histopatológica evidenciou áreas cicatriciais com intensa fibroplasia e neovascularização, fibras colágenas pouco organizadas e endotendão hipercelular e espessado.
