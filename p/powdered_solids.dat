Particles are trapped in a deep energy well at the oil-water interface, stabilising emulsions.

Exposing particle-stabilised drops to surfactant concentrations above to the critical micelle concentration enhances the rate and extent of creaming and flocculation. Mixing particle-stabilised emulsions with surfactant solutions causes drop fragmentation. As the surfactant concentration increases, the average drop size decreases and particles are displaced from the interface during the mixing process. ...|$|E

40|$|Cross {{polarisation}} is extensively used {{in solid}} state NMR for enhancing signals of nuclei with low gyromagnetic ratio. However, {{the use of}} the method for providing quantitative structural and dynamics information is limited. This arises {{due to the fact that}} the mechanism which is responsible for cross polarisation namely, the dipolar interaction, has a long range and is also anisotropic. In nematic liquid crystals these limitations are easily overcome since molecules orient in a magnetic field.

The driving force for powder spreading over a liquid surface is not clearly understood. The Marangoni effect due to a temperature gradient and the spreading coefficient for <b>solid</b> <b>powder</b> over liquid (lambda S/L) have both been proposed as causes for powder spreading over liquids. The proposed lambda S/L {{was based on the}} same form of the spreading coefficient for a liquid over a solid surface (lambda L/S). Whereas lambda L/S has a clear thermodynamic definition, the spreading coefficient of <b>solid</b> <b>powder</b> over liquid, lambda S/L, which was defined by simply interchanging the subscripts of the interfacial energy terms, has not been thoroughly analysed.

Breakup of solid clusters in nonhomogeneous flows is studied by dynamic modeling. Complex how behavior is simulated by means of a chaotic flow; breakup is characterized by the 'fragmentation number', F alpha, which is the ratio of deforming viscous forces to resisting cohesive forces. A condition for rupture, F alpha > F alpha(sep), developed using a two fragment model cast in terms of a microstructural vector model, is presented. Clusters rupture and erode causing the population to evolve in space and time; conditions based on the magnitude of F alpha determine whether or not rupture occurs, and the probability of erosion. Results are analyzed by means of fragmentation theory. It is shown that the polydispersity is not constant, that the cluster size distribution resulting from dispersion is not self-similar, and that erosion in a nonhomogeneous flow leads to a wider size distribution than predicted by mean-field approaches. It is shown as well that regardless of the mixing, that the mass fraction of ultimate size clusters can be predicted by a polynomial relation derived via fragmentation theory and that the overall rates of erosion in both poorly mixed or well mixed flows can be described by a power law.

Their classification as a hazardous waste is due to their high aluminium content as metallic aluminium or in compounds such as aluminium nitride. These compounds can react with a very low moisture content to release toxic or hazardous gases such as hydrogen and ammonia. This paper presents a low-cost process for the full recovery of this hazardous waste in three steps leading to the production of two different added-value materials. In the first step, mild acid hydrolysis of the waste is carried out to obtain a concentrated aluminium solution and an inert cake. The following steps consist of hydrotalcite synthesis with the resulting solution, and the production of transparent glasses in the CaO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 system with the cake. Characterisation of the products obtained indicates that the hydrotalcites can adsorb anionic pollutants (molybdates) in a simple way, while the glasses afford improved optical properties in comparison with those prepared by direct vitrification of the waste.
