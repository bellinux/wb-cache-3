5|$|In {{addition}} to Hanna-Barbera's Speed Buggy (1973) and Wonder Wheels (1977–78), the three series were commonly grouped together {{due to the}} similarities in plot and characters. Reception-wise, several critics reacted negatively to the violence and portrayal of motorcycles in the series, prompting viewers to write letters to NBC in hopes that the show would be <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air. Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch had a total of 13 episodes, each consisting of 3 segments, or a total of 39 segments. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.'

5|$|Häkkinen pitted on lap 53 and {{remained}} in the lead, having built a 20-second lead over Michael Schumacher. Frentzen became the last driver to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 56. At the end of lap 57, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the running order was Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Frentzen, Button, Trulli, Diniz, Irvine, Salo, Wurz, Herbert, Villeneuve, Verstappen, Zonta, Gené, Mazzacane and de la Rosa. Herbert spun while battling for 13th position with Villeneuve. Diniz retired from the race when his engine failed on lap 63. Herbert came under pressure from Verstappen on lap 67 and suffered his second spin, losing the position to Verstappen. Herbert retired on lap 69 {{as the result of}} gearbox problems. Mazzacane <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track on lap 70 and retired because of an engine failure.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> heist.|$|E

Frish goes to see Mulder and Scully, telling them that he lied before and that his commanding officer had ordered him to track the plane's coordinates as it was being intercepted by a second aircraft. Seconds later, {{there was an explosion}} and the plane disappeared from his radar. Mulder believes that a third aircraft, a UFO, approached the plane and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing the Flight 549 crash.

5|$|Following the Belgian Grand Prix on 27 August, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a four-day testing {{session at the}} Monza circuit and concentrated on optimising their car set-ups for low downforce. Jos Verstappen set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of Pedro Diniz. Coulthard was quickest on the second day. Fisichella suffered a high speed crash going into the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. He visited Rome to undergo a medical examination and was diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his right ankle, but was cleared to race having been advised to take five days of rest. Jacques Villeneuve set the quickest times {{on the third day}} as rain shortened the team's running. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane suffered a high speed accident at the Ascari chicane, forcing testing to be stopped. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the fourth and final day of testing. Michael Schumacher's car developed a malfunction and <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> race track, limiting Ferrari's testing time as the car's power unit was changed.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen passed Villeneuve on lap 28 {{although}} {{he went off}} the track in the process. Herbert made his only pit stop on the same lap {{although he}} stalled and rejoined in twelfth place. Gené, Mazzacane, Ralf Schumacher and Verstappen made pit stops between laps 28 and 29. Villeneuve tried to retake fourth position from Häkkinen on the 30th lap but overshot the manoeuvre. Häkkinen made a pit stop on lap 35, emerging behind Villeneuve and Irvine. Coulthard managed to close to within 2 seconds of Michael Schumacher {{when he made his}} second pit stop on lap 38. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on the following lap and remained in the lead. Barrichello became the leader for one lap and made his pit stop on lap 41. This allowed Michael Schumacher to reclaim the first position. By the start of lap 45, Coulthard had closed to within two seconds of Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher was called into his garage by his team to retire on the 45th lap. Zonta <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> race track with an blown engine two laps later.|$|E
5|$|The safety car was {{withdrawn}} {{at the end}} of lap 31 and the race got underway again with Häkkinen in the lead.

Button pitted on the following lap and his Williams pit crew changed his dry tyres to wets. Gené became the race's seventh retirement with a failed engine. All drivers, apart from Barrichello, Coulthard, Frentzen and Zonta, pitted for wet tyres. Villeneuve spun after minor contact with teammate Zonta but managed to continue. Trulli was issued with a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap 37 because he was observed overtaking Barrichello under yellow flags. He took the penalty immediately and rejoined in 11th. Zonta was also issued with a penalty but spun into the tyre wall at turn 12 and retired. Coulthard became the final driver to have pitted on the 38th lap and rejoined in fifth. Button then passed de la Rosa for sixth place.|$|E

Da Matta moved back into first place on the next lap, but Gidley reclaimed the position four laps later. Tracy slowed on the backstraight on lap 64 and drove to pit road to retire {{with a loss of}} engine power. On the 72nd lap, Vasser took over the lead from Papis. Franchitti lost engine power after leaving turn one and drove down the backstraight to retire, necessitating the second caution. All drivers chose to make pit stops under caution. The race resumed on lap 80 with da Matta passing Castroneves to move back into first place.

5|$|On 11 September, the {{division}} {{returned to the}} line near Gouzeaucourt; the Germans had dug in along a ridge line from Épehy to Trescault intending to delay the British from reaching the Hindenberg Line. The Fourth Army was tasked with clearing these positions. On 18 September, the Battle of Épehy was fought. The division attacked at 05:40 with the 113th and 114th Brigades. For his role during the assault, William Allison White earned the VC. Alone, he assaulted a machine gun post that was hindering the advance, killing the defenders and capturing the gun. He then launched a second attack, accompanied by two others who were killed, to seize another German machine gun position killing a further five and again capturing the gun. In a third action, White led a small group to overwhelm a German defensive position that was also holding up the advance. He proceeded to organise the defence of the position, and fought off a German counterattack with heavy losses using captured machine guns. Both brigades were able to reach their objectives despite flanking fire, and fought off numerous counter-attacks. Despite this, the Germans were able to cling on to Gouzeaucourt. The battle cleared the German outposts {{in front of the}} Hindenburg Line, preparing the way for future operations. On 20 September, {{the division}} was <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> line for a period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Roald Goethe {{was caught}} off guard as Hülkenberg lapped his No. 96 Aston Martin in Corvette Corner, causing Goethe to spin and heavily impact a {{concrete}} barrier leaving the turn. Goethe was conscious but needed aid in {{getting out of the}} Aston Martin requiring the intervention of a fourth safety car period. He was transported to a local hospital where he remained for several days and underwent surgery to two vertebra which had been fractured in the crash. Oliver Turvey had been the fastest driver in LMP2 at the time, bringing the Jota Gibson-Nissan into third place. The No. 64 Corvette came to the pit lane during the safety car period to change brakes, but was unable to get back out of pit lane in time before the exit was closed, forfeiting the class lead to the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari. When racing resumed Webber was able to attack the No. 9 Audi after driving through traffic and take second position. The No. 42 Strakka Dome <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track on the front stretch with gearbox issues and fluids leaked from his car, requiring a local slow zone. The No. 7 Audi of Lotterer made contact with Tandy's leading Porsche while both cars were in the slow zone, earning Lotterer a drive-through penalty. Viktor Shaitar overran the Indianapolis corner and became stuck in the gravel, losing two laps as it was extracted by recovery vehicles and went into the pit lane but remaining in second place in LMGTE Am.|$|E
5|$|The {{capsizing}} of {{the battleship}} Novorossiysk in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on Stalingrad {{until the end}} of the year. The hull had to be patched, the water pumped out and all the projections removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons, pivot into deeper water, then trim it down to elevate the bow off the bottom and pull it free. These preparations were very time-consuming and it wasn't until mid-July 1956 that it could be <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs. She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P-1 or KSS anti-ship missiles fired from the converted Sverdlov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in December 1956. The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull, but there was no appreciable change in the ship's draught. Details are not known about other tests, although she reportedly served as a target for P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 Styx) missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing munitions. By the early 1960s her usefulness had come to an end and she was scrapped, possibly in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Trulli {{became the}} first driver to make a second pit stop on lap 28. Light rain began to fall on lap 29 and track started to become slippery. The gap between Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher fell by one second after the McLaren driver {{encountered}} lapped traffic on lap 30. Ralf Schumacher lost sixth position to teammate Button after making a mistake on the same lap, while Frentzen <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track at the entry of First Curve to retire from a hydraulic pump issue which caused his gearbox to fail. Michael Schumacher closed the gap to Häkkinen by 0.7 seconds by lap 31, although he made minor contact with Zonta two laps later. Further down the order, Heidfeld overtook Trulli for 13th position on lap 34. The second round of pit stops began on the same lap when Irvine made a pit stop. Häkkinen made his second stop on lap 37, and {{came out of the}} pit lane 25.8 seconds behind rival Michael Schumacher but ahead of Coulthard. Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull away from Häkkinen. Coulthard, Barrichello and Button remained in third, fourth and fifth positions respectively, during their second stops on lap 38 and 39. Wurz went into retirement when he spun sideways near the entry of the pit lane on lap 40. Michael Schumacher took his final pit stop on the same lap, and emerged 4.1 seconds in front of Häkkinen.|$|E
5|$|After the {{crossing}} was complete, the division was relieved from V Corps and assigned to Major General Wade H. Haislip's XV Corps. The division was allowed a one-month rest, resuming its advance on 25 November, attacking the forts north of Mutzig. These forts {{had been designed}} by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1893 to block access to the plain of Alsace. The 45th Division next crossed the Zintzel River before pushing through the Maginot Line defenses. During this time much of the division's artillery assets were attached to the 44th Infantry Division to provide additional support. The 45th Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Robert T. Frederick, who had previously commanded the 1st Special Service Force, was reassigned to VI Corps on New Year's Day. From 2 January 1945, the division fought defensively along the German border, withdrawing to the Moder River. It sent half of its artillery to support the 70th Infantry Division. On 17 February the division was <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> line for rest and training. Once this rest period was complete, the division was assigned to XV Corps for the final push into German territory. The 45th moved north to the Sarreguemines area and smashed through the Siegfried Line, on 17 March taking Homburg on the 21st and crossing the Rhine between Worms and Hamm on the 26th. The advance continued, with Aschaffenburg falling on 3 April, and Nuremberg on the 20th. The division crossed the Danube River on 27 April, and liberated 32,000 captives of the Dachau concentration camp on 29 April 1945. The division captured Munich {{during the next two}} days, occupying the city until V-E Day and the surrender of Germany. During the next month, the division remained in Munich and set up collection points and camps for the massive numbers of surrendering troops of the German armies. The number of POWs taken by the 45th Division during its almost two years of fighting totalled 124,840 men. The division was then slated to move to the Pacific theater of operations to participate in the invasion of mainland Japan on the island of Honshu, but these plans were scrubbed before the division could depart after the surrender of Japan, on V-J Day.|$|E
