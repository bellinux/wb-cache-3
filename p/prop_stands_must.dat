2500|$|Early K-M20 {{models from}} 1939 {{were made from}} {{standard}} civilian parts {{with the addition of}} military fittings, such as a [...] large 8-inch Lucas DUl42 headlight (fitted with a black out mask), a timing-gear cover with a screw-in plug for access to the magneto drive-pinion nut and special filler caps for the petrol and oil tanks. These early military M20 models were also fitted with a long spiked <b>prop</b> <b>stand</b> on the rear nearside pivoted from a lug brazed on to the rear frame tube. Factory ledgers show that BSA exported K-M20 models to Sweden, South Africa and India, as well as civilian dealers and distributors.|$|R

2500|$|From 1942 {{there was}} a {{shortage}} of rubber so handlebar grips and foot pegs were replaced by canvas covered metal items and production was standardised, with only minor modifications {{until the end of}} World War II. [...] By early 1942 a new large rear carrier was fitted to hold universal WD steel pannier-frames and bags. This meant repositioning the long <b>prop</b> <b>stand</b> to forward of the nearside rear wheel spindle nut. In 1943 further modifications were made including redesign of the crankcase sump shield and fitting of the Vokes high capacity air cleaner, which was a box shaped canister on top of the fuel tank and was intended to assist operations in dusty environments. [...] In early 1945 a push-button switch was introduced for the headlight and the main lighting switch relocated to a bracket beneath the offside of the saddle.|$|R

A little above Mapledurham lock you pass Hardwick House, where Charles I. played bowls.

2500|$|In ritual, the barsom bundle {{is either}} {{held in the}} left hand, or placed across a pair of {{metallic}} stands about 20cm in height, with one stand {{at each end of}} the bundle. These stands have a crescent-shaped brace at the top, so (also) preventing the rods from rolling off. The crescent shape gives them their name, mah-rui, literally [...] "moon-faced." [...] Dadestan-i Denig 48.17 states the <b>stands</b> <b>must</b> be of metal.|$|R
5000|$|Monolights are {{sometimes}} referred to as monoblocks [...] due to the containment of all power and controls in each individual flash unit. Consequently, monolights usually weigh more than on-camera flashes. As monolights need to be placed on light stands, the size and weight of each light <b>stand</b> <b>must</b> also be considered. This size and weight must also be weighed against a pack and head system, which typically have a much weightier generator box.|$|R
50|$|The cutscenes were filmed {{with live}} actors {{in front of}} a blue screen, who were {{superimposed}} on the digital backgrounds with Ultimatte. Each filming would require proper camera angles and lensing before shooting to ensure matching quality with the digital background. Occasionally masonite <b>props</b> would <b>stand</b> for foreground objects. The actors were found by talent agencies and were coached by Bales, producer Wendy Albee and director Tony Ober.|$|R
2500|$|As well {{as being}} {{painstakingly}} restored by enthusiasts to accurate wartime specification, the M20 has also been developed by specialists for speed trials. A 1938 BSA M20 ridden by Bill Jenkins from Dallas achieved {{a top speed of}} 108mph at Bonneville Salt Flats making it the fastest M20 for this venue in the world. The original side-valve engine was extensively modified and fuelled with nitrous oxide. [...] The intake port fed by the carburetor, originally horizontal, was re-drilled at a steep angle into the cylinder casting so it pointed up at the underside of the intake valve. The motorcycle did however retain the long BSA <b>prop</b> <b>stand</b> that hinged under the seat and clipped to the rear mudguard when not in use [...] so it looked like a stock M20. [...] In October 1995 an M20 fitted with a BSA Gold Star [...] crankshaft sprocket and running on a 95% methanol / 5% acetone mix ridden by Pat Jeal achieved a terminal speed of 112mph at the disused airfield of RAF Elvington, Yorkshire.|$|R

Supporters wishing to reach the Ganay or North <b>stands</b> <b>must</b> alight at the Sainte-Marguerite Dromel station whereas the Rond-Point du Prado station caters for the South stand and the Jean Bouin stand. This line, which also serves the Marseille Saint-Charles train station, has additional trains on matchdays.|$|R

5000|$|Augustine {{does not}} believe that the Christian can in this life know with infallible certitude that he is in fact among the elect and that he will finally persevere. According to Augustine [...] "it is {{uncertain}} whether anyone has received this gift perseverance so long as he is still alive."

2500|$|An {{aquarium}} can {{be placed}} on an aquarium stand. Because {{of the weight of}} the aquarium, a <b>stand</b> <b>must</b> be strong as well as level. A tank that is not level may distort, leak, or crack. These are often built with cabinets to allow storage, available in many styles to match room decor. Simple metal tank stands are also available. Most aquaria should be placed on polystyrene to cushion any irregularities on the underlying surface or the bottom of the tank itself that may cause cracks. [...] However, some tanks have an underframe making this unnecessary.|$|R
30|$|Rigid {{multi-channel}} {{lines are}} commonly selected to transfer LHe {{over a long}} distance {{to take advantage of}} a small pressure drop and transfer heat load, but the piping path from the TLS cryogenic plant to the cryogenic test <b>stand</b> <b>must</b> pass through three separate buildings with varied piping elevation over a total piping length greater than 220  m. LN 2 -shielded, flexible cryogenic transfer lines of corrugated type were eventually chosen as a compromise considering several factors including the availability of the piping path, and quick, easy and cheap installation (Laeger et al. 1978; Blessing et al. 1990).|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "boom arm" [...] {{attaches}} {{to the top of}} the stand so the microphone can move in the horizontal plane. A guitar player, for example, might use this to place the microphone directly in front of his mouth without having the upright portion of the stand in the way of the guitar. It also lets musicians have the microphone closer to the sound source when floor space is at a premium. This can be particularly useful when placing microphones on a drum stand when the microphone <b>stands</b> <b>must</b> compete for space with things like cymbal stands. Boom arms are offered both in fixed length and adjustable (telescoping) lengths.|$|R
