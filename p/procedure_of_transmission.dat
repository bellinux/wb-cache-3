It interprets the notion of loss factors in an AC power flow model, and develops a method for finding zonal prices consistent with a restricted AC optimal power flow. The effects of decomposing the nodal prices to find a loss factor to cover the marginal cost of losses, and letting the congestion management be resolved by zonal prices based on a DC approximation of the flows, are evaluated by comparing the resulting net prices to those of an optimal AC power flow (AC-OPF).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{ultrastructure}} of the mitochondria in trophoblast cells of pregnant women with preeclampsia and to relate it with apoptotic events. Material and methods: Placentas at term were obtained immediately after cesarean delivery. Three biopsies per placenta were taken from the maternal basal surface in the delivery room. Specimens from peripheral ramifications of the villous tree (especially immature intermediate and terminal villi) were processed through conventional <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> electron microscopy and opportunely compared with controls obtained from normal placentas. Results: Ultrastructural degenerative changes in mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix of trophoblast cells (lysis of cristae and matrix vacuolization) were visualized. Swollen mitochondria in diverse degenerative grades were found. Two types of degenerated mitochondria in accordance with the mitochondrial matrix were detected in apoptotic trophoblast cells. Conclusion: Mitochondrial ultrastructural changes appear to be the origin of trophoblast cell death by apoptosis. Subsequently, trophoblast debris would fall from placental villi into the intervillous space and could become not only corpuscles damaging the endothelium of the fetal-placental maternal unit but one of the stimuli for endothelial dysfunction and the maintenance of the pathogenesis of preeclampsia...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Transmission housing {{protect the}} {{components}} of gearbox. It provides the fluid tight casing to hold the lubricants and provides support to moving components. Transmission housing or gearbox casing failure is the main problem for the vehicle manufacturer. Noise and vibration are {{the main reason for}} failure. So it is required to reduce the level of noise and vibration. In order to prevent failure the natural frequency and natural mode shapes should be known. In this paper,the vibration analysis <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> housing were performed by finite element simulation using ANSYS 14. 5 software. The vibration pattern for first twenty mode were studied. The analysis show that the natural frequency of vibration varies from 1306. 3 Hz to 3879 Hz. The External excitation on transmission housing must be eliminated to prevent the fracture of housing. The reason for the fracture is matching of external excitation frequency to natural frequency <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> housing.

40|$|The ongoing {{liberalization}} process {{around the}} world {{has led to the}} emergence of energy markets, facilitating more international trade between countries making the best use of energy resources and optimizing overall power systems. Consequently, inter-area power exchanges have significantly increased and further growth can be foreseen. In Europe, the planning of large energy infrastructures has entered a new dimension, namely the trans-European one. The way of thinking is gradually switching from national to regional (European) interests, as this is {{the most efficient way to}} attain a sustainable energy future. This brings many new challenges. Europe finds itself at the beginning of a transition towards a low carbon and sustainable electricity supply system, which is guided by the European Union (EU) Energy Policy core objectives: competitiveness, reliability and sustainability. This thesis looks at transmission expansion planning approaches under increased uncertainties. The liberalization of the electricity sector, the emergence of international electricity markets and increased penetration of renewable energy sources introduce many new challenges to transmission system operators. This is mainly because the complexity and related uncertainties in the power system have very much increased. These uncertainties are around the transmission scheduling and operation, and are especially related to the future needs for transmission capacity. Consequently, more advanced and robust methods for planning the transmission grid are needed. In addition, the building <b>of</b> new <b>transmission</b> lines is usually a lengthy process because of the authorization process duration. This process needs to become shorter in order to match the fast pace of changes in generation capacity and location. The main contributions of this thesis are: a new (round-the-year) method and new criteria for assessing the bottlenecks in the grid; a security-based iterative method for proposing network reinforcements; investigating the potential development of a transnational offshore grid in the North Sea and its effects on the onshore system; proposing an approach for streamlining approval <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> lines and fostering societal acceptance <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> lines.

40|$|International audienceA quantum {{transport}} model for atomic line radiation in plasmas is developed and analyzed. It is {{found that the}} Wigner phase space formulation of QED provides a consistent way to address the wave-particle duality in radiative transfer problems. If the photons' thermal de Broglie length is much smaller {{than all of the}} spatial scales of the problem under consideration (large spectral band limit), the radiation is not coherent and radiative transfer can be addressed with usual treatments. In the general case, the Heisenberg uncertainty relation yields ambiguities in the description of the radiation-matter interaction mechanisms. We examine this issue and show that an accurate description of radiative transfer should involve a model with nonlocal interactions, and requires an appropriate coarse-graining <b>procedure.</b> Calculations <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> factors and absorption spectra in ideal cases are performed, and indicate that significant misinterpretations can be done in spectroscopic diagnostics if the radiation coherence is not well accounted for.

As an intermediate data of 2 D and 3 D, intensity information of laser scanning is significant on texture mapping and rectification of mural images in grottos. However, the unusual phenomenon of laser intensity at near distance makes it very difficult on extracting feature points for image rectification needed. To eliminate the near distance effect on intensity-based mural rectification, the <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> laser <b>transmission</b> was studied and the intensity function of defocusing effect of laser receiving optics was deduced.

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{protocol}} for a large-scale WPCN, namely hybrid multiple access-based dual harvest-then-transmit (H-DHT). The proposed H-DHT protocol has a hybrid multiple access structure which employs both TDMA and CSMA, {{in order to}} manage different traffic patterns and requirements depending on applications. Thus, the H-DHT protocol provides transmission reliability for transmitting information of nodes by TDMA. Furthermore, we propose a novel wireless energy transfer method, named dual-WET, which improves the channel utilization and increases the amount of harvested energy at nodes. Specifically, from dual-WET, the nodes can perform energy harvesting at space holes in CSMA. In addition, we describe the novel <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> SI message <b>transmission</b> between the H-AP and nodes to reduce network overhead caused by numerous SI messages. For the consideration, simulation results reveal that the H-DHT outperforms the existing WPCN protocols in a large-scale network, in terms <b>of</b> sum-throughput, SI <b>transmission</b> overhead, and an amount of harvested energy at nodes.|$|R

Methods This was an international epidemiological and molecular investigation of HCV infection among a cohort of haemodialysis patients from nine countries.
