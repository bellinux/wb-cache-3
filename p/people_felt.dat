5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why think a lot of <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
5|$|One such {{success of}} {{diplomacy}} came with Willy Brandt's ascension to the West German chancellorship in 1969, as West GermanSoviet tension started to ease. Brandt's Ostpolitik policy, along with Brezhnev's détente, {{contributed to the}} signing of the Moscow and Warsaw Treaties in which West Germany recognized the state borders established following World War II, which included West German recognition of East Germany as an independent state. The foreign relations of the two countries continued to improve during Brezhnev's rule, and in the Soviet Union, where the memory of German brutality during World War II was still remembered, these developments contributed to greatly reducing the animosity the Soviet <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> towards Germany, and Germans in general.|$|E
5|$|Soviet air assaults {{against civilians}} in Estonian towns {{were a part}} of the offensive, aimed at forcing the Estonians away from {{supporting}} the German side. The Soviet Long Range Aviation branch assaulted the Estonian capital of Tallinn on the night of 8–9 March. Approximately 40% of the housing was destroyed in the city; 25,000 people were left homeless and 500 civilians were killed. The result of the air raid was the opposite of what the Soviets intended, as <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> disgusted by the Soviet atrocities; more men answered the German conscription call.|$|E
50|$|The American social {{commentator}} and poet Gary Snyder has related {{that there have}} been back-to-the-land population movements throughout the centuries, and throughout the world, largely due to the occurrence of severe urban problems and <b>people's</b> <b>felt</b> need to live a better life, often simply to survive.|$|R

5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E
25|$|Both the Tamil and Sinhala-speaking <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> that {{language}} {{was crucial to}} their identity. The Sinhala people associated the language with their rich heritage. They were also afraid that, given that there were only 9 million speakers of the language at that time, if Sinhala {{was not the only}} official language it would eventually be slowly lost. The Tamil <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> that the Sinhala-only policy would assert the dominance of the Sinhalese people and as such they might lose their language, culture and identity.|$|E
25|$|Durán fought Vinny Pazienza in 1994 and 1995 for the IBC Super Middleweight Championship and was {{defeated}} both times by unanimous decision, but many <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> Duran clearly {{won the first}} bout and he was robbed of the victory.|$|E
2500|$|Eliade {{attributes}} the well-known [...] "cyclic" [...] vision {{of time in}} ancient thought to belief in the eternal return. For instance, the New Year ceremonies among the Mesopotamians, the Egyptians, and other Near Eastern peoples re-enacted their cosmogonic myths. Therefore, by {{the logic of the}} eternal return, each New Year ceremony {{was the beginning of the}} world for these peoples. According to Eliade, these <b>peoples</b> <b>felt</b> a need to return to the Beginning at regular intervals, turning time into a circle.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there were}} {{debates about the}} apocalypse itself, few people {{actually}} understood the consequences {{of what would happen}} if the apocalypse occurred. Unfortunately few documents from around the year 1000 exist to actually interpret what people thought would happen, and because of this many scholars are unaware of what <b>people</b> actually <b>felt.</b> <b>People</b> do understand that the idea of apocalypticism has influenced several Western Christian European leaders into social reform.|$|R

25|$|Tjalie Robinson {{has been}} {{attributed}} to having single-handedly preserved the historic hybrid Indo culture of the Dutch East Indies in literature....with the wisdom of hindsight we now know that Tjalie Robinson {{was one of the most}} original writers of post war Dutch literature, that in the nick of time he secured something that otherwise would have been lost to us: how <b>people</b> <b>felt,</b> thought and spoke in the now lost world of the Indo community on Java. Rudy Kousbroek, 1989.|$|E
25|$|Gruesome {{images of}} two anti-war activists who set {{themselves}} on fire in November 1965 provided iconic images of how strongly some <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> {{that the war}} was immoral. On November 2, 32-year-old Quaker Norman Morrison set himself on fire in front of The Pentagon. On November 9, 22-year-old Catholic Worker Movement member Roger Allen LaPorte did the same in front of United Nations Headquarters in New York City. Both protests were conscious imitations of earlier (and ongoing) Buddhist protests in South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|With the NHL set {{to resume}} in 2005–06, Thornton became a {{restricted}} free {{agent in the}} summer of 2005 and was reportedly unhappy with the state of the Boston Bruins franchise, as well as the criticism of his play in the Bruins' early playoff exit in 2004. Thornton was under heavy scrutiny for his leadership style and was criticized for being unable to raise his level of play during the playoffs. Many <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> that Bruins Head Coach Robbie Ftorek gave Thornton the captaincy too early. Regardless, Thornton re-signed with the team on August 11, 2005, to a three-year deal worth US$20 million.|$|E
25|$|A secessionist revolt in 1975–76 on Bougainville Island {{resulted}} in an eleventh-hour modification of the draft Constitution of Papua New Guinea to allow for Bougainville and the other eighteen districts to have quasi-federal status as provinces. A renewed uprising on Bougainville Island started in 1988 and claimed 20,000 lives until it was resolved in 1997. Bougainville had been the chief mining region of the country, generating 40% of the national budget. The native <b>peoples</b> <b>felt</b> they were bearing the adverse environmental effects of the mining, which poisoned the land, water and air, without gaining {{a fair share of}} the profits.|$|R

25|$|Eva Perón was {{instrumental}} {{as a symbol}} of hope to the common laborer during the first five-year plan. When she died in 1952, the year of the presidential elections, the <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> they had lost an ally. Coming from humble origins, she was loathed by the elite but adored by the poor for her work with the sick, elderly, and orphans. It was due to her behind-the-scenes work that women's suffrage was granted in 1947 and a feminist wing of the 3rd party in Argentina was formed. Simultaneous to Perón's five-year plans, Evita supported a women's movement that concentrated on the rights of women, the poor and the disabled.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in May 1974, a wave {{of strikes}} hit Rangoon and {{elsewhere}} in the country against a backdrop of corruption, inflation and food shortages, especially rice. In Rangoon workers were arrested at the Insein railway yard, and troops opened fire on workers at the Thamaing textile mill and Simmalaik dockyard. In December 1974, the biggest anti-government demonstrations to date broke out over the funeral of former UN Secretary-General U Thant. U Thant had been former prime minister U Nu's closest advisor in the 1950s and was seen as a symbol of opposition to the military regime. The Burmese <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> that U Thant was denied a state funeral that he deserved as a statesman of international stature because of his association with U Nu.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{relatively}} peaceful situation, some {{member of the}} Sasak <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> huge pressure under Balinese rulership. Some Sasak people started a rebellion, which was unsuccessful. Frustrated, some Sasak leaders asked for assistance from the Dutch to drive away the Balinese. The Dutch managed to drive away the Balinese from Lombok, but instead of returning the power to the Sasak people, the Dutch conquered Lombok by taking over the lands previously occupied by the Balinese. In the 19th century, after heavy fighting, Lombok was conquered by the Dutch. This means that the Sasaks had been conquered by both the Christian Dutch and the Hindu Balinese. In this situation, Islam was readily accepted by many Sasak as a political marker of identity, differing them from the Hindu Balinese and the Christian Dutch.|$|E

25|$|Budget cuts caused Phelps to {{institute}} a serial killer storyline. Phelps decided to kill off one major character and it was originally decided that popular character, Donna Hudson, was to be offed, but massive fan protest caused Phelps to scrap that plan. Phelps then decided to kill off either Frankie Frame or Paulina Carlino. When a focus group responded lukewarm to Frankie but warmer to Paulina, Phelps gave the greenlight to axe Frankie. When word got out about Frankie's exit, another massive rampage of fan protests arose. Phelps quickly asked then-head writer Margaret DePriest to re-write Frankie's exit so that the character would at least still live. DePriest, eager to satisfy her wish to see Frankie's husband, Cass, return to his former rogue ways, vehemently refused. Frankie was murdered in what many <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> were overly brutal and gruesome scenes.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{the image}} was taken to Piat, and {{enshrined}} on a side altar. It was not long when the <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> special manifestations of divine favors through Our Lady. Their love and devotion to Our Lady had grown with the years, and attachment to her image bordered fantacism. This was clearly seen when Fr. Juan De Santa Ana sent the same image to Tuguegarao City in 1622 and ordered another one more beautiful from Manila to replace the image. The people promptly protested this, insisting that the original image be returned to them. Fr. de Santa Ana finally gave in, and {{the image was}} brought back amidst great rejoicing. There arose, however, a dispute between the peoples of Piat and Tuao as to where the image's sanctuary should be; both towns agreed to build the shrine midway between them.|$|E
25|$|Sammy led the West Indies in the 2012 World Twenty20 {{hosted by}} Sri Lanka. For {{the first time}} in a long time, the West Indies were {{considered}} realistic contenders for the title, a measure of how the team has matured under the auspices of Sammy. However, it was as an individual player that he came under scrutiny in the tournament. In the journey from group stages to the final, Sammy contributed 27 runs with the bat from four visits to the crease and overall bowling figures of 2/125, and drew a lot of criticism as many <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> he was keeping better players out of the side. But in the final, when it mattered most, Sammy scored 26 not out from 15 balls and took two key wickets (almost matching his batting and bowling tally for the rest of the tournament) to help his team overcome a slow start and defeat Sri Lanka.|$|E

25|$|Public {{transportation}} is currently {{served by the}} commuter boat ferry service from the Hingham Shipyard to Rowes Wharf in downtown Boston, the MBTA's Bus Route 220, with Route 222 also passing through a small section of town, and the MBTA Commuter Rail to Boston South Station. Commuter rail has been restored along the Greenbush Line through Hingham. Trains stop at two stations in town; West Hingham and Nantasket Junction. As part of the MBTA's agreement to restore train service, a tunnel has been built to carry the commuter trains under historic Hingham Square. There were disputes in Hingham about whether to allow the train {{to pass through the}} town. Some <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> that Hingham is becoming less like a town and more like a small city. Others felt that the line will benefit the town. Ferries also run from Hingham Shipyard to several islands in Boston Harbor during the summer as well as to Pemberton Point, Hull. There is no air service in the town; the nearest airport is Logan International Airport in Boston as well as smaller public airports in Norwood and Marshfield.|$|E
25|$|A {{review meeting}} {{was held in}} May 2008, {{approximately}} 8 months after the restrictions began, which was attended by the Director of Liquor Licensing {{and members of the}} Aboriginal community. Oscar said the meeting was ‘the most important mins of our lives’. The views of people who attended were that women now felt more empowered, confident and able to participate in community-level discussions, the Valley was a much more quiet and safe place to live, and other Aboriginal communities had noticed the positive example set in the Valley. Alcohol restrictions had encouraged government and non-government agencies to become more involved, a strong desire to not return to the chaos of pre-restriction times prevailed, and change needed to be substantial and long lasting. The <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> priority needed to be given to children’s health and welfare, and they wanted the next generation of children to be raised without alcohol affecting their lives, families were stronger and sober, old people were being cared for, young people were thinking about buying homes, and children were learning new skills. They also believed sly grogging had become an issue, communities with people suffering from FASD needed help, and if the restrictions were lifted, all of the confidence that now existed in the community would be ‘stripped away’.|$|E
25|$|The first bishop {{appointed}} to Saint Thomas of Mylapur on {{the conclusion of}} the new concordat was the princely Dom Henrique José Reed da Silva, who was at the time coadjutor to the Archbishop of Goa, and who took possession of his see in 1886. He was the first to sign himself for the sake of brevity, Bishop of Mylapur, a practice which his successors have adopted. Hence the diocese became better known in India as the Diocese of Mylapur. His was the arduous task of putting the broken shreds of the old historic diocese together and rendering it once again the thing of beauty it was. His first care was to reform the diocesan seminary, and in order to have an efficient body of European priests with their heart in their work, he brought out a number of young boys from Portugal and gave them a collegiate course in English, in the college to which he had raised the existing high-school, previous to their entering upon their ecclesiastical course of studies. His successors reaped the benefit of his policy. He opened a convent of European nuns at Saint Thomas, and another of Indian nuns in Mylapur, which have since thrown out branches into various parts of the diocese. He invited English-speaking priests to join his diocese (a call to which the present writer responded) and established the Catholic Register, a weekly newspaper. His courtly manners and noble bearing made him a favourite in society. Soon the <b>people</b> <b>felt</b> it an honour to point to him as their bishop. He pulled down the old cathedral, the chapel over the grave of St. Thomas and the old Augustinian priory, that had nothing antique to commend them, and built a magnificent cathedral in the centre of which, between the nave and chancel, lies the grave of St. Thomas. Despite the good he was accomplishing, he incurred the ill-will of certain parties connected with the churches situated in other dioceses, and when he found the accusations brought against him accepted without demur in Europe, he resigned and retired to Portugal, as titular Bishop of Trajanopolis.|$|E
