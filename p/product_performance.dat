It is up to individual designers of CD systems to decide on decoding methods and optimize their <b>product</b> <b>performance.</b> [...] Being of minimum distance 5 The D1,D2 decoders can each correct a combination of [...] errors and [...] erasures such that [...] In most decoding solutions, D1 is designed to correct single error. And in case of more than 1 error, this decoder outputs 28 erasures. The deinterlever at the succeeding stage distributes these erasures across 28 D2 codewords. Again in most solutions, D2 is set to deal with erasures only (a simpler and less expensive solution). If more than 4 erasures were to be encountered, 24 erasures are output by D2. Thereafter, an error concealment system attempts to interpolate (from neighboring symbols) in case of uncorrectable symbols, failing which sounds corresponding to such erroneous symbols get muted.|$|E

40|$|Purpose Intellectual capital {{reflects}} {{the sum of}} existing knowledge a manufacturer is able to leverage and plays {{a critical role in}} new product development. This study aims to empirically investigate the mechanisms through which intellectual capital enhances <b>product</b> innovation <b>performance</b> and how economic and institutional environments affect the mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach Using a knowledge-based view and institutional theory, this study proposes a model on the relationships among intellectual capital, supplier knowledge integration, supply chain adaptability, and <b>product</b> innovation <b>performance.</b> The hypotheses are empirically tested using multiple group structural equation modelling and data collected from 300 Chinese and 200 Indian manufacturers. Findings We find that intellectual capital improves <b>product</b> innovation <b>performance</b> both directly and indirectly through supplier knowledge integration. However, the effects are different in China and India. In particular, the direct effect of intellectual capital on <b>product</b> innovation <b>performance</b> is significantly higher in China than that in India, and intellectual capital improves <b>product</b> innovation <b>performance</b> indirectly through supplier knowledge integration only in India. We also find that supplier knowledge integration improves <b>product</b> innovation <b>performance</b> indirectly through supply chain adaptability in both China and India. Originality/value Using a moderated mediation model, this study provides insights into the joint effects of intellectual capital, supplier knowledge integration, and supply chain adaptability on <b>product</b> innovation <b>performance.</b> The findings enhance current understandings of how supply chain management helps a manufacturer develop new products using existing knowledge and the influences of economic and institutional environments on knowledge and supply chain management...|$|R
