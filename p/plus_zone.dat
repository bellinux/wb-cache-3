40|$|In his {{critique}} of my approach to Gauquelin's discovery of planetary relations, Ertel disagrees with six issues. My view of what he finds fault with is as follows: Regarding Point 1 Ertel asserts that the planetary effect is unrelated to planetary temperament, and that therefore the problem of temperament does not actually exist. In my view this is a somewhat hasty judgment. Gauquelin held that certain professional groups, for example champion sportsmen, display certain character or temperamental traits more distinctly and frequently than the general population. This assumption is reasonable and has been confirmed empirically. Successful sportsmen are generally ambitious, strong-willed, and have {{a high level of}} stamina. Since Mars is often present in the <b>plus</b> <b>zone</b> at birth times for this group there must exist some correlation between the traits associated with this group and Mars ' position. This does not of course apply to every individual case, and in various sub- groups of sports champions the degree to which this association emerges may vary. Nevertheless...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To compare {{stability}} and bone remodeling between a custom-made uncemented hydroxyapatite-coated femoral stem {{and a standard}} cemented femoral stem after five year follow-up. Materials and methods: In this prospective study, 37 patients (38 hips) with non-inflammatory arthritis were randomized to receive either the uncemented or the cemented femoral stem. The uncemented stem used was Unique®, and the cemented stem was Elite Plus. The goals were to compare the implants for bone remodeling using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and clinical outcomes, using Harris Hip Score, Visual Analogue Scale and Merle d’Aubigné-Postel. Results: Bone remodeling measured by DXA showed a statistical significant decrease of BMD for Gruen zones 1, 6 and 7 in the Unique group compared to Elite <b>Plus</b> (<b>Zone</b> 1 : - 18. 7 % and + 0. 5 %. Zone 6 : - 27. 4 % and - 4. 9 %. Zone 7 : - 37. 7 % and - 5, 4 %, respectively). For zones 3, 4 and 5, there were a BMD increase in both groups, with a statistical significant greater increase in the Unique group to the Elite Plus group (Zone 5 : + 17. 3 % and + 6. 5 %, respectively). Clinically we found a statistical significant better result for the Elite Plus patients on HHSpain (40 and 44, p= 0. 018) and on Merle d’Aubigné-Postel (15. 5 and 18. 0, p= 0. 028). Conclusion: The custom made uncemented stem does not prevent proximal bone loss, as does the cemented stem. Nevertheless, the BMD for the distal zones increased more in the Unique group compared to Elite Plus. Clinical results were better for the cemented stem...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE To {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome of edema-like bone marrow abnormalities seen on magnetic resonance (MR) {{images of the}} foot when their cause is unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical outcome of 31 patients (15 female patients, 16 male patients; mean age, 51; range, 10 - 79 years) with edema-like bone marrow abnormalities on MR images of the foot was determined. The relevance of three different edema patterns was compared: (a) exclusively ill-defined edema-like zones, (b) edema-like <b>zones</b> <b>plus</b> well-defined necrosis-like <b>zones,</b> and (c) edema-like <b>zones</b> <b>plus</b> linear structures indicating possible fractures. The different edema patterns were compared with persistence of pain. RESULTS Fifty-four percent of all patients had pain persisting after 1 year, as calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. The duration of pain in the various subgroups varied significantly (P =. 049, log-rank test). The subgroup of patients with a well-defined necrosis-like zone had substantially longer-lasting pain than those with edema-like abnormalities only (n = 16) (P =. 065). Only one of seven patients with a well-defined necrosis-like zone (n = 7) was pain free after 1 year. Conversely, patients with possible stress fracture (n = 8) had shorter pain compared with those with edema-like abnormalities only (P =. 036); six of eight patients were pain free after 1 year. CONCLUSION Edema-like bone marrow abnormalities of the foot predict long-lasting pain. Analysis of the image patterns of such abnormalities allows prediction of the clinical outcome to a certain degree...|$|R
