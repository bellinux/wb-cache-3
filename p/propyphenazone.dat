50|$|Contraindications are {{hypersensitivity}} to phenazone, <b>propyphenazone,</b> aminophenazone, metamizol, phenylbutazone, paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, or caffeine; {{bone marrow}} deficiencies; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; acute hepatic porphyria; alcoholism; gastrointestinal ulcera or bleeding; pregnancy and lactation; {{infants and children}} under 6 to 12 years (varying by country).|$|E
50|$|Pyrazolones are {{amongst the}} oldest {{synthetic}} pharmaceuticals, {{starting with the}} introduction of antipyrine (phenazone) in 1880's. The compounds generally act as analgesics and include dipyrone (Metamizole), aminopyrine, ampyrone, famprofazone, morazone, nifenazone, piperylon and <b>propyphenazone.</b> Of these dipyrone is perhaps the most widely used.|$|E
5000|$|Paracetamol, an {{analgesic}} and antipyretic substance, has {{slow onset}} {{but has a}} longer duration of action and is lacking anti-inflammatory properties. On the other hand, <b>propyphenazone,</b> a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is proven to have a faster onset but shorter duration of action. [...] The combination of paracetamol and <b>propyphenazone</b> increases and prolongs the therapeutic activity of propyphenazone: peak blood plasma concentrations increase by about 40%, and the elimination half-life is prolonged to about 77 minutes. Caffeine, with a stimulating effect, is a drug that wards off drowsiness and restores alertness. It also enhances the analgesic potency of paracetamol, although a Cochrane review concluded that a dose of 100 mg is needed for an effect - double the amount contained in Saridon.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{a report}} from Lareb, a Dutch {{pharmacovigilance}} center, {{it was noted that}} twenty adverse reactions to Saridon had been reported with no mention of fatal to near fatal cases. The report concluded by saying that there was no information available of the incidence of anaphylactic reactions to <b>propyphenazone,</b> and that the summary of product characteristics (SPC) states an incidence of less than 0.01%. The Lareb report suggests the actual incidence to be higher.|$|E

As it is structurally related to aminophenazone it has been associated with severe blood dyscrasias. However, it cannot be transformed into potentially carcinogenic nitrosamines and has therefore been widely used as a replacement drug for aminophenazone. In certain countries, products containing <b>propyphenazone</b> have now been restricted in their indications, whereas in others they are still available, sometimes as over-the-counter preparations.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Phenacetin {{was widely}} used until {{the third quarter}} of the twentieth century, often {{in the form of an}} [...] "A.P.C." [...] or aspirin-phenacetin-caffeine {{compound}} analgesic, as a remedy for fever and pain. An early formulation (1919) was Vincent's APC in Australia. However the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered the withdrawal of drugs containing phenacetin in November 1983, owing to its carcinogenic and kidney-damaging properties (Federal Register of October 5, 1983 (48 FR 45466)). It was also banned in India. As a result, some branded, previously phenacetin-based preparations continued to be sold, but with the phenacetin replaced by safer alternatives. A popular brand of phenacetin was Roche's Saridon, which was reformulated in 1983 to contain <b>propyphenazone,</b> paracetamol and caffeine. Coricidin was also reformulated without phenacetin. Paracetamol is a metabolite of phenacetin with similar analgesic and antipyretic effects, but the new formulation has not been found to have phenacetin's carcinogenicity.|$|E

40|$|Butalbital, a barbiturate, {{is present}} in {{analgesic}} combinations used by headache sufferers. Overuse/abuse of these combinations may cause dependence, chronic migraine, and medication-overuse headache (MOH). MOH is difficult to manage: it improves interrupting analgesic overuse, but requires monitoring, because relapses are frequent. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method for hair analysis has been developed and validated to document abuse of an analgesic combination containing butalbital and <b>propyphenazone</b> by a patient with MOH. For over ten years the patient managed her headache using eight suppositories/day of an analgesic combination containing butalbital 150 mg, caffeine 75 mg, and <b>propyphenazone</b> 375 mg per suppository. An outpatient detoxification treatment was carried out. After three weeks, the patient reduced the consumption to one suppository/day. At the first control visit, after three months {{from the beginning of}} detoxification, the patient increased the use of the combination to four suppositories/day and at the second control visit, after seven months from the beginning of detoxification, she was back to eight suppositories/day. At the two control visits, a hair sample was taken for determination of butalbital and <b>propyphenazone.</b> Moreover blood and urine samples for determination of butalbital were drawn at the beginning of detoxification treatment and at the two control visits. With the segmental analysis of two hair samples the medication history of ten months could be estimated. In the first hair sample, collected at the first control visit, in the distal segment, butalbital and <b>propyphenazone</b> concentrations were, respectively, 17. 5 ng/mg and 56. 0 ng/mg, confirming the prolonged abuse; in the proximal segment, concurrently with the detoxification treatment, butalbital and <b>propyphenazone</b> concentrations had reduced respectively to 5. 45 ng/mg and 11. 1 ng/mg. The second hair sample, collected at the second control visit, proved the fair course of the detoxification treatment in the distal segment and signalled relapse in the abuse of the analgesic combination in the proximal segment. In the clinical context, hair analysis can be advantageously used to monitor the abuse of analgesic combinations with butalbital, common among headache patients.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Although still used by {{hundreds}} of millions of people worldwide, the mechanism of the analgesic action of the pyrazolone derivatives (PDs), dipyrone, <b>propyphenazone</b> and antipyrine, remains unknown. The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA 1) channel, expressed by nociceptors, is emerging as a major pain transduction pathway. We hypothesized that PDs target the TRPA 1 channel and by this mechanism produce their analgesic effect. Experimental approach Calcium responses and currents were studied in cultured, TRPA 1 -expressing rodent dorsal root ganglion neurons and human cells. Acute nociception and mechanical hypersensitivity were investigated in naïve and genetically manipulated mice. Key results Pyrazolone and PDs selectively inhibit calcium responses and currents in TRPA 1 -expressing cells and acute nocifensor responses in mice evoked by reactive channel agonists (allyl isothiocyanate, acrolein and H 2 O 2). In line with recent results obtained with TRPA 1 antagonists or TRPA 1 gene deletion, the two most largely used PDs, dipyrone and <b>propyphenazone,</b> attenuate TRPA 1 -mediated nociception and mechanical allodynia in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain (formalin, carrageenan, partial sciatic nerve ligation, and the chemotherapeutic drug, bortezomib). Notably, dipyrone and <b>propyphenazone</b> attenuate carrageenan-evoked mechanical allodynia, without affecting prostaglandin E 2 levels. PD main metabolites do not target TRPA 1 and do not affect TRPA 1 -dependent nociception and allodynia. Conclusions and Implications Evidence that in rodents the nociceptive/hyperalgesic effect produced by TRPA 1 activation is blocked by PDs suggests that a similar pathway is attenuated by PDs in humans, and that TRPA 1 antagonists could be novel analgesics, devoid of the hematologic liability of PDs...|$|E

In this study phenazone, <b>propyphenazone,</b> AAA and FAA were treated with ozone under laboratory conditions and 17 degradation products were identified by an elucidation approach based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (LTQ Orbitrap). Typical oxidation of carbon-carbon double bonds by ozone was observed among other mechanisms of ring opening.

The existence of four crystal forms {{of one of the}} APIs, the sedative and hypnotic active pharmaceutical ingredient 3, 3 -diethyl- 2, 4 (1 H, 3 H) -pyridinedione, pyrithyldione (PYR), and of three crystal forms of the co-crystal-forming second API, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 1, 2 -dihydro- 1, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -(1 -methylethyl) - 2 -phenyl- 3 H-pyrazol- 3 -one, <b>propyphenazone</b> (PROP), has been reported previously, but they have only been partly characterised. For both compounds, none of the metastable forms exist at room temperature. DSC, hot-stage microscopy, X-ray diffraction and powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction were employed to characterise the polymorphic forms and to determine the crystal structures of forms I-III of PYR and forms I and II of PROP. Something old, something novel: Back in 1937, Hoffmann-LaRoche patented a co-crystal of the two active pharmaceutical ingredients pyrithyldione and <b>propyphenazone,</b> shown here prepared by the Kofler contact method.

To set up the individual baseline variability of testosterone and its main metabolites, urine samples were collected for 3 days, every 2 h prior to {{the administration of the}} drug(s); whereas the study of the effects of a single dose of each drug, here considered, on the endogenous androgen steroid urinary concentrations, was assessed by collecting urine samples for 2 days, every 2 h Data obtained after drugs administration were then evaluated taking into account the individual baseline variability The results showed that, only in the case of <b>propyphenazone</b> administration, the relative urinary concentrations of some testosterone metabolites were significantly altered More specifically, the urinary levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, 11 keto-etiocholanolone, 11 beta-hydroxyandrosterone. 11 beta-hydroxyetiocholanolone, androsterone, etiocholanolone and some metabolite ratios decrease significantly, generally between 2 and 10 h after administration of the drug, whereas no effects were observed on urinary calculated concentrations of testosterone, epitestosterone, 5 alpha-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol, 5 beta-androstane 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol and testosterone/epitestosterone ratio. The observed effects do not depend on alterations on pharmacokinetics (excretion/metabolism), but on steroid sample preparation steps (hydrolysis and derivatization) inhibition. More specifically the significant decrease of dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone metabolites urinary levels was due to a reduced yield of the steroid derivatization step for the presence in urine of the main metabolites of <b>propyphenazone,</b> namely hydroxyl-propyphenazone metabolites (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse, critically, both the characteristics of chronic headache patients and the way they are managed. Methods: We reviewed all the medical records of patients admitted to the Day Hospital of the Headache Centre in the second semester of 2012. Results: Eighty female patients (mean age 52 years) had been admitted to the Day Hospital; 42 % of them had already been hospitalized at least once, even in the 3 previous years. The headache had started as episodic with menarche in 38 % of patients and it had become chronic on average after 22 years. All patiens made overuse of prescription medications: 70 % NSDAIDs; 49 % triptans; 19 % combination of indomethacin, prochlorperazine and caffeine; 7. 5 % combination of codeine and paracetamol; 6. 3 % combination of butalbital, <b>propyphenazone</b> and caffeine; 6. 3 % tramadol. Fifty-two percent of the patients had previously taken at least three prophylactic treatments. During the hospitalization several lab tests and consultations had been carried out. Discussion: Medication-overuse no longer appears as a consequence of the barriers that the headache patients, particularly migraine sufferers, encounter to access to health care. In fact, most of the patients examined were taking prescription medications, prophylactic treatments and were regularly followed by the Centre and by other specialists for years. Conclusion: Patients with chronic headache and medication overuse are now intensely medicalized without decisive benefits and with the risk that their condition being crystallized even more as chronic and intractable.

These figures {{are less than}} previously, but considering the problems accompanying the postal strike the National Drugs Advisory Board was pleased' that so many practitioners continued to maintain contact. Eight of the reports concerned interactions between drugs. The complicated interaction between amitriptyline and rauwolfia alkaloids emphasises the difficulty that can arise with multiple therapy, in this case each drug nullified the desired effect of the other. The use of additional therapy with the anticoagulant warfarin always requires great caution {{as shown by the}} interaction with carbimazole resulting in a prolonged prothrombin time. Eighteen deaths were reported in association with the use of drugs. Two cases of hepatic failure occurred, one with an antidepressant and one with perhexiline. There was another case of cardiac asystole following the use of salbutamol by inhalation and 2 cases of myocardial infarction, one of these secondary to coma induced by a relative overdose of antidepressant. Four of the deaths were related to infants with congenital abnormalities. In view of the difficulty in obtaining information on the precise timing of the medications it is impossible to assign a relationship to the drug ingestion with any great certainty. The National Drugs Advisory Board can only reiterate its firm recommendation that no medication should be used in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy unless it is absolutely essential. There was one death in an older woman who was sensitive to. sulphonamides and developed an erythroderma with indapamide, this progressed to an exfoliative dermatitis and was complicated by a myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation and consequent brain damage. Lithium Carbonate has been known to have as one of its pharmacological actions, a capacity to inhibit antidiuretic hormone. However recent reports suggest that the drug may also have a more direct effect on renal tubules even at acceptable plasma levels of drug. The National Drugs Advisory Board has received one report of renal insufficiency {{associated with the use of}} lithium carbonate. It is recommended that in addition to frequent and regular assays of serum lithium, creatinine clearance and serum creatinine should also be checked. One study has suggested that a reasonably simple screening procedure is the assessment of renal concentrating ability or osmolality regularly to detect progressive change. The case of fatal aplastic anaemia reported in association with long term use of a product containing <b>propyphenazone</b> has stimulated the reformulation of the product to exclude this ingredient. Products available without prescription should not contain ingredients capable of producing such serious side-effects. Ibuprofen which has been on the market for about 10 years was claimed for a long time to be free of any capacity to affect peptic ulceration or induce haematemesis. The present reports suggest that these side effects can occur especially with long term use. In addition the National Drugs Advisory Board has had reports of 4 cases of thrombocytoperia, one of which was fatal. Until now relatively few cases have been reported in the literature and it is uncertain whether this is a direct toxic effect or an allergic reaction...|$|E
40|$|Die Pharmaka Phenazon, Propyphenazon und Dimethylaminophenazon (DMAA) wurden in einigen Wasserwerksbrunnen im Norden Berlins bis in den µg/l-Bereich detektiert. Das Verhalten dieser Arzneimittel bei verschiedenen Wasseraufbereitungsverfahren und insbesondere das Auftreten möglicher Metabolite wurde in der vorliegenden Arbeit intensiv untersucht. Die Identifizierung von Abbauprodukten und die anschließende Entwicklung einer empfindlichen und selektiven analytischen Methode zur Bestimmung der Arzneimittel und deren Metabolite standen hier im Vordergrund. Es wurden insgesamt sechs für die Trinkwasseraufbereitung {{relevante}} Metaboliten der Arzneimittel mit Phenazongrundgerüst identifiziert. Während Dimethylpyrazolon (DP) und iso-Propyldimethylpyrazolon (PDP) ausschließlich auf den mikrobiellen Abbau von Phenazon und Propyphenazon zurückzuführen sind, wurden Formylaminoantipyrin (FAA), Acetylaminoantipyrin (AAA), 1 -Acetyl- 1 -methyl- 2 -dimethyl-oxamoyl- 2 -phenylhydrazid (AMDOPH) und 1 -Acetyl- 1 -methyl- 2 -phenylhydrazid (AMPH) als Metabolite des DMAA identifiziert. Die Analysenmethode basiert auf Festphasenextraktion und Flüssigkeitschromatographie-Tandemmassenspektrometrie (LC-MSMS). Der heutige Einsatz der Pyrazolone Phenazon, Propyphenazon und Metamizol in Arzneimittelpräparaten kann zum Auftreten sämtlicher in dieser Methode untersuchten Verbindungen im kommunalen Abwasser, mit Ausnahme des nicht mehr zugelassenen DMAA führen. Diese Gruppe von Substanzen eignet sich deshalb besonders zur Untersuchung des Verhaltens von polaren Arzneimittelrückständen bei verschiedensten Wasserbehandlungsschritten und techniken. Die Sorption dieser Verbindungen an Klärschlamm, Boden oder Filtermaterial der Wasserwerksfilter konnte ausgeschlossen werden. Während Phenazon, Propyphenazon, FAA und AAA durch alle untersuchten Prozesse abgereichert wurden, zeigte sich die Persistenz von AMDOPH und dem ebenfalls untersuchten antiepileptischen Wirkstoff Carbamazepin. Der Vergleich der konventionellen Abwasserbehandlung mit Membranbioreaktoren zeigte, dass beide Techniken eine Abreicherung der meisten Pyrazolone bewirkte, wobei die membrangestützten Bioreaktoren eine geringfügig bessere Entfernung erreichten. Die Oberflächenwasseraufbereitungsanlage (OWA) in Tegel verringert ebenfalls die Konzentrationen der meisten untersuchten Arzneimittelrückstände. Die Uferfiltration und künstliche Grundwasseranreicherung von abwasserbelastetem Oberflächenwasser ist zur effektiven Entfernung von Phenazon, Propyphenazon, FAA und AAA bei den heute auftretenden Konzentrationen von unterhalb 1 µg/l geeignet. Die in einigen Wasserwerksbrunnen aufzufindenden Substanzen Phenazon, Propyphenazon, DMAA, FAA und AAA werden durch die Rohwasserfiltration zur Trinkwasserproduktion bis zu über 90 % abgereichert. Hierbei werden jedoch weitere Metaboliten wie DP und PDP gebildet, welche ihrerseits ebenfalls weiter abgebaut werden. Die vereinzelt im Trinkwasser auftretenden Arzneimittelrückstände liegen laut Gutachten des Umweltbundesamtes unterhalb der im Trinkwasser gesundheitlich lebenslang duldbaren Konzentrationen. Die Entwicklung einer selektiven und besonders sensitiven analytischen Methode zur Bestimmung der natürlichen estrogenen Steroide 17 b-Estradiol und Estron sowie des synthetischen 17 a-Ethinylestradiol stellte einen weiteren Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit dar. Die Bestimmung der toxikologisch besonders relevanten Estrogene ist in Grund-, Trink-, Oberflächen- und Abwasser bis deutlich unter 1 ng/l möglich. Alle drei Steroidhormone konnten im kommunalen Abwasser nachgewiesen werden. Durch die Abwasserbehandlung werden die natürlichen Estrogene zu über 90 % und Ethinylestradiol zu etwa 80 % entfernt. Das im Berliner Oberflächenwasser regelmäßig oberhalb der Bestimmungsgrenze von 0, 1 ng/l detektierte Estron wird durch die OWA Tegel zu etwa 80 % abgereichert, die Uferfiltration führt schon nach wenigen Metern Bodenpassage zu einer Entfernung bis unter die Nachweisgrenze. The {{presence of}} pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment {{is caused by}} their application in human medical care and may also be caused by manufacturing residues. It is supposed that at a former pharmaceutical production plant, located north of Berlin, production residues were released into the soil and into the neighboring Havel river. Thus, the analgesic and antipyretic pharmaceuticals phenazone, <b>propyphenazone</b> and dimethylaminophenazone (DMAA) entered the Berlin area and were, however, detected in a few drinking water supply wells downstream near the Havel river. The behavior of these analgesic compounds and especially the occurrence of metabolites was investigated in this study. At least six relevant metabolites were identified. A simple and rapid analytical method for the trace-level analysis of the polar pharmaceutical residues in various water samples from the aquatic environment was developed. Using this method, the pharmaceuticals and several of their metabolites can be analyzed in drinking, surface and wastewater (treated and untreated sewage) at concentrations down to 0. 01 µg/L. Samples are prepared by a simple in situ derivatization enabling the pre-concentration of very polar metabolites by automated solid phase extraction. The analytes were separated by liquid chromatography and detected with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In the receiving drinking water treatment plant a significant degradation of the three pharmaceuticals was observed. Any sorption of the polar compounds could be ruled out. The observed decrease of the concentration of DMAA during drinking water processing leads {{to the formation of}} acetylaminoantipyrine (AAA) and formylaminoantipyrine (FAA) as intermediates. 1 -Acetyl- 1 -methyl- 2 -dimethyl-oxamoyl- 2 -phenylhydrazide (AMDOPH) and 1 -acetyl- 1 -methyl- 2 -phenylhydrazide (AMPH) seem to be subject to an oxidative and photochemical transformation of DMAA. Due to the microbiological activity observed in the filters from the drinking water treatment plant, the degradation of phenazone and <b>propyphenazone</b> leads to the respective dephenylated metabolites. Thus, 1, 2 -dihydro- 1, 5 -dimethylpyrazol- 3 -one (DP) and 1, 2 -dihydro- 4 -isopropyl- 1, 5 -dimethyl-pyrazol- 3 -one (PDP) are being formed. All identified metabolites could be detected in raw and treated water of the concerning water works, and were more or less degraded during drinking water processing. A recent study commissioned by the Federal Environmental Protection agency concluded that a lifetime consumption of drinking water, containing the Metabolites DP and AMDOPH in concentrations of the Berlin drinking water, will not cause any adverse human health effects and is tolerable for lifetime consumption. Most of the investigated pharmaceuticals and metabolites were also present in raw and treated sewage. Sewage and surface water treatment causes slight reduction of the concentration of some analytes (e. g. AAA) whereas other compounds (e. g. AMDOPH) were persistent. Thus, some compounds were detected at the low µg/L level in treated sewage and could also be detected at the high ng/L range in surface and ground water samples. In a second part, a very robust and reliable LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the determination of Estron (E 1), Estradiol (E 2) and the synthetic hormone Ethinylestradiol (EE 2) has been developed. The recovery rates of all analytes were around 100 %, and limits of quantification (LOQ) were between 0. 1 and 2 ng/L depending on the analyte and the origin of the samples. The concentration of E 1, E 2 and EE 2 in the investigated untreated sewage was determined with about 200, 12 and 10 ng/l, respectively. Both, sewage and surface water treatment affected elimination of the estrogenic steroids. E 1, E 2 and EE 2 were removed of the aqueous phase in a municipal WWTP by more than 93, 92 and 80 %, respectively. E 1 was the only compound that could be detected in surface water samples. After surface water treatment it was, however, only detectable in the range of the LOQ (0. 1 ng/L). Bank filtration leads to decreasing concentrations of E 1 even at short distances between the bank and the observation wells of the investigated transects...|$|E
40|$|Medication-overuse {{headaches}} {{were first}} {{detected in the}} ‘ 80 s and since then considerable knowledge has been acquired about them. An important tool for this progress has been {{the introduction of the}} classification of the International Headache Society, which has included Medication-Overuse Headache (MOH) among secondary headache forms in the 2 nd edition of 2004 [1]. Furthermore, the severity of medication-overuse headaches has decreased with years, also {{as a consequence of the}} new drugs available for acute headache treatment. At the end of the ‘ 80 s, the most used drugs by patients coming to the Headache Centre of Modena were combinations of caffeine, butalbital, and ergotamine (Cafergot PB); amobarbital, paracetamol, and codeine (Lonarid); caffeine, metamizole, codeine, and chlormezanone (Eblimon); caffeine, <b>propyphenazone,</b> and ethylmorphine (Mindol Merck); caffeine, aminophenazone, and ergotamine (Virdex). All these analgesic combinations contained active principles which could often cause both overuse/abuse, as in the case of barbiturates, and organic damages, as in the case of ergot derivatives. Today it is much rarer to have patients using every day large and toxic quantities of analgesic combinations. The most common case is instead frequent or daily use of therapeutic dosages of triptans [2]. Even if it has been remarked that triptan overuse may increase migraine frequency sooner than other medications [3], in our experience, these drugs are often the only effective ones for acute treatment in chronic migraine patients. The present real cases of overuse concern almost only analgesic combinations still containing barbiturates or the combination of indomethacin, prochlorperazine, and caffeine. In spite of progress, there are still various sectors to improve and goals to reach. We think that the first one is prevention. In order to fully achieve it, we need first of all more effective and tolerated prophylactic treatments, specific for these patients. The second one is optimal ways of handling the most critical patients suffering from chronic headache, analgesic overuse, comorbidity, and organic complications. There are no guidelines to manage these patients, since studies published in literature are so heterogeneous that they do not allow comparing results and coming to strictly evidence-based conclusions. In this situation, recommendations based on experts’ consensus should at least be given, stressing that also minimal goals are important in the treatment of critical patients, such as: reducing the risks of organic damages deriving from analgesic overuse, reducing the frequency of use and/or the quantity overused, and hindering progressive worsening by periodic hospitalization. Experts’ intervention could also make these patients’ hospitalization easier. Chronic headache and analgesic overuse patients’ hospitalization is often fundamental, but hindered by hospital chief executives, since deriving DRG are not very remunerative. Finally, we must consider that growing attention is paid to chronic pain and people are more conscious of the disability associated to migraine. In this context, the conditions of a large number of patients that we are not able to treat should at least be recognised as disabling.

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the presence}} of twenty-five pharmaceutical compounds belonging to seven different therapeutic groups and one iodinated contrast media (ICM) in a Spanish medium-size hospital located in the Valencia Region. Analysis of the target compounds in the hospital wastewater was performed by means of solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (HPLC-MS/MS). A screening level risk assessment combining the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) with dose-response data based on Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) was also applied to estimate Hazard Quotients (HQs) for the compounds investigated. Additionally, the environmental hazard associated to the various compounds measured was assessed through the calculation of the Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) Index, which categorizes compounds according to their environmentally damaging characteristics. The {{results of the study}} showed {{the presence of}} twenty-four out of the twenty-six compounds analysed at individual concentrations ranging from 5 ngL - 1 to 2 mgL - 1. The highest concentrations corresponded to the ICM iomeprol, found at levels between 424 and 2093 μgL - 1, the analgesic acetaminophen (15 - 44 μgL - 1), the diuretic (DIU) furosemide (6 - 15 μgL - 1), and the antibiotics (ABIs) ofloxacin and trimethoprim (2 - 5 μgL - 1). The lowest levels corresponded to the anti-inflammatory <b>propyphenazone,</b> found at concentrations between 5 and 44 ngL - 1. Differences in terms of concentrations of the analysed compounds have been observed in all the therapeutic groups when comparing the results obtained in this and other recent studies carried out in hospitals with different characteristics from different geographical areas and in different seasons. The screening level risk assessment performed in raw water from the hospital effluent showed that the analgesics and anti-inflammatories (AAFs) acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen, the antibiotics (ABIs) clarithromycin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim, and the β-blocker (BBL) propranolol were present at concentrations leading to HQ values higher than 10, thus indicating high risk. When applying a factor to take into account potential dilution and degradation processes, only the compound ibuprofen showed a HQ higher than 1. Likewise, the cumulative HQ or Toxic Units (TUs) calculated in the raw water for each of the therapeutic groups studied showed that these three classes of drugs were at concentrations high enough to potentially generate high risk to aquatic organisms while taking into account possible dilution and degradation processes only one of them, the AAFs can be considered to represent high risk. Finally, the environmental hazard assessment performed showed that the AAFs diclofenac and ibuprofen and the ABI clarithromycin have the highest, maximum value of 9 of PBT Index due to their inherent environmentally damaging characteristics of persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. The methodology followed in the present case study can be taken as a novel approach to classify and categorize pharmaceuticals {{on the basis of their}} occurrence in hospital effluents, their derived environmental risks, and their associated environmental hazard. This classification becomes important because it can be used as a model or orientation for hospitals in the process of developing environmentally sustainable policies and as an argument to justify the adoption of advanced, specific treatments for hospital effluents before being discharged into the public sewage systemThe authors would like to thankt he financial support provided by the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness through the CarlosIII Health Institute with the program “Projects on Health Research 2011 - 2012 FIS(PI 11 / 00180) ” and through the SCARCE project (Consolider-Ingenio 2010 CSD 2009 - 00065), the European Commission through the project SOLUTIONS (contract 603437),as well as the support of the Generalitat de Catalunya (Consolidated Research Groups “ 2014 SGR 418 -Water and Soil Quality Unit” and 2014 SGR 291 -ICRA 65...|$|E
