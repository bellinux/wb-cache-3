Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92) and the Austro-Turkish War (1787–91)); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War (1788–90)).|$|E

5000|$|Each {{player has}} a board called a [...] "capital", which {{is divided into}} 3 zones: Battlefield, Quest, and Kingdom. The Battlefield is the area where attacks are launched, Quest determines how many cards are drawn each turn, and Kingdom determines how many {{resources}} are gathered each turn. Resources are spent to play cards. Each unit has a power rating that adds to the zone they are <b>played</b> <b>into.</b> For example, a unit with a power of 2 would add 2 damage to attacks when <b>played</b> <b>into</b> the Battlefield, 2 additional resources per turn if <b>played</b> <b>into</b> the Kingdom, or 2 additional cards drawn if <b>played</b> <b>into</b> the Quest zone.|$|R

5|$|In 1994, the Sydney Theatre Company {{commissioned}} Enright {{to develop}} the <b>play</b> <b>into</b> a feature-length production. The resulting play was titled Blackrock. Blackrock retained the original four characters from A Property of the Clan, and added nine others; it was considered a more fictionalised version of Leigh's murder. The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience rather than for a specifically educational environment.|$|E

McNamara and Warrick led the Orange to a 23-8 record and a five seed in the NCAA Tournament. McNamara scored 43 points, including a school-record nine three-point shots, as Syracuse outlasted Brigham Young University 80-75 in the tournament's first round.|$|E
5|$|Puccini saw Sardou's {{play when}} it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, {{obtained}} the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French <b>play</b> <b>into</b> a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered {{at a time of}} unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{was less}} {{successful}} in his penultimate season in 196768, with only 426 runs at 23.66, including two half-centuries, both against Victoria. A decision by administrators to introduce Sunday <b>play</b> <b>into</b> the Sheffield Shield ended his career, as {{he refused to}} make himself available for games that involved Sunday play. He played in only one match in his final season in 196869, scoring a duck and 15 as New South Wales lost to South Australia by three wickets. Booth continued to play grade cricket for the St. George club until 197677, leading the batting averages and aggregates in 197475. With 10,674 runs at 45.42, he was fifth on the all-time run-scoring aggregates in Sydney grade competition {{at the time of}} his retirement, but has now dropped to ninth.|$|E

5|$|In 1994 the Sydney Theatre Company {{commissioned}} Enright {{to develop}} the original 45-minute <b>play</b> <b>into</b> a full-length production. Blackrock retained the original four characters but also added nine others. It also extended {{the length of the}} play, and was considered to be a more fictionalised version of Leigh's murder, though many viewers still considered it to be a factual account of the crime. The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience outside of a specifically educational environment, also shifting the plays focus. While A Property of the Clan focused on the possible motives for rape, Blackrock was said to focus on the boys involved in the crime, portraying them as victims of the society they live in.|$|E
5|$|The filmmaker Derek Jarman {{adapted the}} Marlowe <b>play</b> <b>into</b> a film in 1991, {{creating}} a postmodern pastiche of the original, depicting Edward as a strong, explicitly homosexual leader, ultimately overcome by powerful enemies. In Jarman's version, Edward finally escapes captivity, following the {{tradition in the}} Fieschi letter. Edward's current popular image was also shaped by his contrasting appearance in Mel Gibson's 1995 film Braveheart, where he is portrayed as weak and implicitly homosexual, wearing silk clothes and heavy makeup, shunning the company of women and incapable of dealing militarily with the Scots. The film received extensive criticism, both for its historical inaccuracies and for its negative portrayal of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Events in {{the world}} {{appeared}} to <b>play</b> <b>into</b> the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War and the Austro-Turkish War); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War). At first, King Poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain Russian support for the reforms; they attempted to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans {{as an opportunity to}} strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line of reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. With the new Polish-Prussian alliance seeming to provide security against Russian intervention, King Poniatowski drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. This alliance was also helped as the 1790 elections were more supportive of the royal faction then Potocki's; and the conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten the reformers if they were to stay divided. With the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, Potocki and Poniatowski begun to reach a consensus on a more constitutional monarchy approach, and started to draft a constitutional document.|$|E

5|$|In English {{folklore}} and literature, green {{has traditionally been}} used to symbolize nature and its embodied attributes, namely those of fertility and rebirth. Critics have claimed that the Green Knight's role emphasizes the environment outside of human habitation. With his alternate identity as Bertilak, the Green Knight {{can also be seen}} as a compromise between both humanity and the environment as opposed to Gawain's representation of human civilization. Oftentimes it is used to embody the supernatural or spiritual other world. In British folklore, the devil was sometimes considered to be green {{which may or may not}} <b>play</b> <b>into</b> the concept of the Green Man/ Wild Man dichotomy of the Green Knight. Stories of the medieval period also portray the colour as representing love and the amorous in life, and the base, natural desires of man. Green is also known to have signified witchcraft, devilry and evil for its association with the fairies and spirits of early English {{folklore and}} for its association with decay and toxicity. The colour, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In the Celtic tradition, green was avoided in clothing for its superstitious association with misfortune and death. Green can be considered in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; displaying both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour. Given these varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} the final {{production}} and release of the Thanhouser Company and {{it was to be}} released through Pathé. Numerous factors would <b>play</b> <b>into</b> the winding down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser. Q. David Bowers writes that it was easy to understand Thanhouser's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through Pathé were based on their decision to release or discard the work, the New Rochelle studio was 2,500 miles {{from the center of the}} trade activity and the slump in industry tied to World War I. Weeks before the film was released, Variety told of the winding down of the Thanhouser with the studio's staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the bookkeeper, Jessie B. Bishop. The article concluded with the announcement that Lloyd F. Lonergan, the scenario writer of the company, had retired from the company. As it wound down, the Thanhouser Company was announced to have no liabilities would close with a positive bank balance. Little is known of the production of this final film, but it was directed by Emile Chautard from a scenario written by Lloyd F. Lonergan. The cameraman was Jacques Bizeul.|$|E
5|$|The Bucs won {{the coin}} toss and deferred. The Bears opened {{the game with}} a hurry-up offense and gained a first down, but were {{eventually}} forced to punt. Tampa Bay also later punted, but regained the ball at the Bears' four-yard line after a blocked punt; Jeremiah George escaped LaRoy Reynolds to block Pat O'Donnell's punt and Howard Jones recovered. The Bucs converted the <b>play</b> <b>into</b> a four-yard touchdown run by Martin. Both teams later punted on their next drives, Jay Cutler's screen pass was deflected and intercepted by William Gholston, who returned the pick to the Bears' 15-yard line, but Jacquies Smith's facemask penalty nullified the play. Afterwards, Ka'Deem Carey scored on a one-yard touchdown run to tie the score. On Tampa's next drive, Martin was stripped by Harold Jones-Quartey, and the fumble was recovered by John Timu; the takeaway led to Robbie Gould's 26-yard field goal. The Bucs were later forced to punt again with two minutes left in the first half, and the Bears offense drove 40 yards to the nine, where Gould kicked a 27-yard field goal with eight seconds left. Winston kneeled to end the half. On the first drive of the second half, the Bucs scored when Winston threw a 50-yard touchdown pass to Charles Sims, who took advantage of Tracy Porter to score. Although the Bears punted on their next drive, they regained possession after Christian Jones and Lamarr Houston's blitz forced Winston to throw to Charles Sims, where Jones-Quartey pulled the ball away. The Bears eventually punted, but got the ball back when Pernell McPhee stripped Martin, with the fumble being recovered by Timu. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Cutler's play-action pass to Carey resulted in a one-yard touchdown. The Bucs punted on their next series, and Gould kicked a 50-yard field goal to increase the score to 23–14; Connor Barth later missed a 52-yard field goal wide left, leading to Gould's 39-yard field goal. With one second left in the game, Winston threw a 43-yard touchdown pas to Austin Seferian-Jenkins, and on the ensuing onside kick, Cameron Meredith recovered as time expired.|$|E
