5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva {{had played a}} part in uncovering the conspiracy, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E
5|$|Lappius Maximus {{received}} the governorship {{of the province}} of Syria, a second consulship in May 95, and finally a priesthood, which he still held in 102. Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with Titus Petronius Secundus as his colleague. Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter had {{played a part in}} uncovering the conspiracy, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fashion similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{different}} genera of oviraptorids {{have been}} found on or near elongatoolithid nests indicating that oviraptorid parents would brood on their eggs, most likely for extended periods of time. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} oviraptorid and troodontid eggs were cared for by the father, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> polygamous system. Given the large size of eggs relative to the parent, a mother would only lay two eggs at a time, so the eggs of a single nest may have been contributed by multiple females.|$|E
50|$|Information {{essential}} to the main text is generally placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> set of explanatory notes, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> introduction, {{rather than in the}} foreword or preface.|$|R
50|$|The poem is {{narrated by}} Verulame, female spirit of Verulamium, and praises the late Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, though <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ironic tone.|$|R
50|$|Male {{artists have}} also {{depicted}} women readers within pastoral settings, like <b>in</b> Monet's Springtime, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to tame or domesticate the otherwise wild act of reading.|$|R
5|$|The forelimbs of Plesiorycteropus show specializations for scratch-digging, {{in which}} the forefeet are placed against the substrate, the claws are entered into the substrate, and the forefeet are then drawn back against the body. Other {{parts of the body}} also show such specializations, {{including}} large hindlimbs and a broad tail. Some aspects of the vertebral column and the pelvis suggest that the animal often assumed an erect, or sitting, posture. The animal may also have been capable of climbing, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner similar to gymnures and shrew tenrecs, which are small-eyed like Plesiorycteropus. It was probably myrmecophagous, eating insects such as ants and termites, but may also have eaten other soft food, and because of its small size probably did not forage in termite mounds, as the aardvark does.|$|E
5|$|Constantine I (r. 306–337) {{preferred}} chariot {{racing to}} gladiatorial combat, which he considered a vestige of paganism. However, {{the end of}} gladiatorial games in the Empire {{may have been more}} the result of the difficulty and expense that came with procuring gladiators to fight in the games, than the influence of Christianity in Byzantium. The Olympic Games were eventually ended by Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) in 393, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> move to suppress paganism and promote Christianity, but chariot racing remained popular. The fact that chariot racing became linked to the imperial majesty meant that the Church did not prevent it, although gradually prominent Christian writers, such as Tertullian, began attacking the sport. Despite the influence of Christianity in the Byzantine Empire, venationes, bloody wild-beast hunts, continued as a form of popular entertainment during {{the early days of the}} Empire as part of the extra entertainment that went along with chariot racing. Eventually, Emperor Leo (r. 457–474) banned public entertainments on Sundays in 469, showing that the hunts did not have imperial support, and the venationes were banned completely by Emperor Anastasius (r. 491–518) in 498. Anastasius was praised for this action by some sources, but their concern seems to be more for the danger the hunts could put humans in rather than for objections to the brutality or moral objections. There continued to be burnings and mutilations of humans who committed crimes or were enemies of the state in the hippodrome throughout the Byzantine Empire, as well as victory celebrations and imperial coronations.|$|E
5|$|The East Tilbury Blockhouse {{was built}} partly with stone taken from St Margaret's Chapel in Tilbury, which was {{dissolved}} in 1536. Its form {{is not known}} but it probably consisted of a brick and stone structure, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> D-shape, with a rampart and ditch to enclose its landward side. It was recorded as having fifteen iron and brass cannon of various calibres in 1540; these had been increased to 27 by 1539–40. It had a small permanent garrison, consisting of a commander and his deputy, a porter, two soldiers and four gunners. The blockhouse may have been altered in 1545 but in 1553 it was disarmed. Although the corresponding blockhouse at Gravesend continued in use and that at Tilbury was eventually incorporated into Tilbury Fort between 1670 and 1683, the one at East Tilbury {{seems to have been}} abandoned {{before the end of the}} 16th century. By 1735 it had been inundated by the river and was in ruins. Its site by the shoreline has since been eroded away by tidal action, though it is possible that remains from the blockhouse may still survive under the river mud.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of king K'iq'ab in 1475 the K'iche' were engaged in warfare against both the Tz'utujils and the Kaqchikels, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to recover the former power of Q'umarkaj.|$|R
50|$|A raven-haired copy, {{dying from}} a disease aboard a basestar, whom Baltar {{strangles}} after she hysterically accuses him of deliberately {{leading them to}} the disease-carrying beacon (<b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort {{to get him to}} kill her).|$|R
50|$|After Percival retired {{on account}} of illness in the 1890s, the church's {{fortunes}} declined. St. Martin's College for Indigent Boys was built <b>in</b> 1906, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to fight the decline and better connect with the non-Episcopalian neighborhood.|$|R
25|$|Heterozygote advantage. When {{applied to}} a {{particular}} allele, this theory posits that mutation carriers have a selective advantage, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of this gene {{in a variety of}} horse populations in North America suggests that the mutation occurred in early American history, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Spanish-type horse.|$|E
25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} of streamed events is processed through a causal vector engine, which performs a lookup based on recently viewed events and assigns a causal vector {{to an event}} if a relationship is discovered. If A causes B, the causal vector engine checks if B’s causal vector rule index contains a reference to A. The engine may handle events for different transactions simultaneously, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different order than they occurred.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} clough is haunted by a boggart, a mischievous spirit found mainly in Lancashire and Yorkshire, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to explain the unusual name.In 2008, Boggart Hole Clough {{attained}} the Green Flag Award for the eighth year running.|$|R
5000|$|The staff {{begin to}} search for Mrs. Paddy and the bonds. After much effort from all, Mrs. Paddy is found, {{but she does not}} have the bonds. Jeff and Florence both falsely confess to taking the bonds, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to protect whomever they believe to be the guilty party.|$|R
25|$|The most {{remarkable}} feature is their decorative motifs roughly divided in six groups which complement each other: social simbols, religious simbols, images of posthumous kolo, figural images, clear ornaments, and unclassified motifs (mostly simbolic, geometrical, or damaged). Many of them remain enigmatic to this day; spirals, arcades, rosettes, vine leaves and grapes, lilium, stars (often six-pointed) and crescent Moons {{are among the}} images that appear. Figural images include processions of deer, horse, dancing the kolo, hunting, chivalric tournaments, and, most famously, {{the image of the}} man with his right hand raised, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gesture of fealty.|$|E
25|$|Forced labour {{can also}} be imposed by governments who “conscript their own {{subjects}} and put them to work for minimal, or no pay, and for varying lengths of time”. When imposed by governments, forced labour does not include military conscription or penal labour. Forced labour can, likewise, be used simply to cut production costs by private and public industries (e.g. cocoa plantations), or can {{be a form of}} involuntary servitude in the private sector – sweatshops. Bales refers to this type of slavery as contract slavery, where “contracts are offered which guarantee employment, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> workshop or factory, but when the workers are taken to their place of employment they discover that they have instead been taken into slavery...it is a way of making slavery seem legitimate and necessary”.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} 1999 Act {{preserves}} the promisee's right {{to enforce the}} contract as it stood at common law, an outstanding issue is to what extent a promisee can claim damages for a benefit {{on behalf of a}} third party, if he has suffered no personal loss. In Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd, Lord Denning MR held that a father could claim damages for disappointment (beyond the financial cost) of a terrible holiday experience on behalf of his family. However, a majority of the House of Lords in Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK Ltd disapproved any broad ability of a party to a contract to claim damages on behalf of a third party, except <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> limited set of consumer contracts. There is disagreement about whether this will remain the case. Difficulties also remain in cases involving houses built with defects, which are sold to a buyer, who subsequently sells to a third party. It appears that neither the initial buyer can claim on behalf of the third party, and nor will the third party be able to claim under the 1999 Act, as they will typically not be identified by the original contract (or known) in advance. Apart from this instance relating to tort, in practice the doctrine of privity is entirely ignored in numerous situations, throughout the law of trusts and agency.|$|E
50|$|Tradition also fixes other factors. In England, the {{refectory}} {{is generally}} built on <b>an</b> undercroft (<b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{allusion to the}} upper room where the Last Supper reportedly took place) {{on the side of}} the cloister opposite the church. Benedictine models are traditionally generally laid out on an east-west axis, while Cistercian models lie north-south.|$|R
25|$|Following this, Stephenson {{published}} a novel titled Anathem (2008), {{a very long}} and detailed work, perhaps best described as speculative fiction. It is set <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Earthlike world (<b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> alternative reality), deals with metaphysics, and refers heavily to Ancient Greek philosophy, {{while at the same}} time being a complex commentary on the insubstantiality of today's society.|$|R
50|$|Given a {{model for}} a set of {{observed}} data, a set of manipulations of the data can result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> derived quantity which, assuming that the model is a true representation of reality, is a standard normal deviate (<b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> approximate sense). This enables a significance test to be made for the validity of the model.|$|R
500|$|The first {{influential}} philosopher {{to discuss}} this question specifically was Descartes, and the answer he gave is known as Cartesian dualism. [...] Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called res cogitans (the realm of thought), {{in contrast to the}} domain of material things, which he called res extensa (the realm of extension). [...] He suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small midline structure called the pineal gland.|$|E
500|$|Morten then {{stated that}} they did not feel that Keč was doing things the right way. If he chose to fly to a new airport, {{negotiations}} would have to start again, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different language. Morten urged Keč to calm down and that they wanted to solve the situation just as much as him. Keč responded by pleading for help for Bosnia. At 20:50, Keč stated [...] "I wish to release everyone and myself. Both Bosnians and Norwegians will understand this". After confirming his surrender would occur at 21:00, Keč stated that he was [...] "cold and calm" [...] and that he intended to surrender without any trouble. Directed by the negotiation, Keč went to the door, opened it and was arrested.|$|E
500|$|There is some {{evidence}} that horses were occasionally eaten, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hard winter, or ridden until five years of age and then slaughtered for meat; but there are many references in medieval sources indicating that the Anglo-Saxons placed a high value on horses. They were often included in the price paid for land and in bequests and other gifts, and kings' servants included horse-thegns, or marshals. Numerous horses and horse-breeding establishments were recorded in Domesday Book, though many more horses were probably omitted, given the need for horses for riding and pulling carts. Only 71smiths are recorded in Domesday Book, but others [...] "must be concealed under the heading of other classes." [...] Six smiths in Hereford were obliged to supply 120horseshoes each year for the maintenance of horses belonging to warriors.|$|E
50|$|His {{name and}} title was first {{mentioned}} by Gu Honse in Chapter 7 when he asks Gangryong if he knows him, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort {{to find out if}} Yoochun taught Gangryong Northern Broad Strike as well, which would go against the deal he made with Guk Taeyang. Hayato later confirmed that Gangryong was not taught this.|$|R
50|$|The {{nickel and}} iron of an iron rich {{asteroid}} could be extracted by the Mond process. This involves passing carbon monoxide over the asteroid at a temperature between 50 and 60 °C, then nickel and iron {{can be removed}} from the gas again at higher temperatures, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attached printer, and platinum, gold etc. left as a residue.|$|R
30|$|The {{surgeons}} were cautious {{regarding the}} use of 4 -mm screws to fix the pelvis given the small corridor <b>in</b> the sacrum. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> older patient, internal fixation with screws may be possible. However, to date there is no clear consensus in the literature regarding the appropriate age where a S 1 screw and S 2 screw might be feasible.|$|R
500|$|The couple's daughter, Kenshi (Kataiko), {{was born}} in 999. Two years later Nobutaka died during a cholera epidemic. As a married woman Murasaki would have had {{servants}} to run the household and care for her daughter, giving her ample leisure time. She enjoyed reading and had access to romances (monogatari) such as The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter and The Tales of Ise. Scholars believe she may have started writing The Tale of Genji before her husband's death; it is known she was writing after she was widowed, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband's death: [...] "I felt depressed and confused. For some years I had existed {{from day to day}} in listless fashion... doing little more than registering the passage of time... The thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable".|$|E

50|$|Little {{is known}} about the life of Telauges. According to tradition, {{he was the son of}} Pythagoras and Theano. Iamblichus claims that Pythagoras died when Telauges was very young, and that Telauges {{eventually}} married Bitale the daughter of Damo, his sister. It was said that Telauges was a teacher of Empedocles, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to link Empedocles to Pythagoras.|$|R
50|$|As the 1970s started, Haack's musical horizons {{continued}} to expand. After {{the release of}} The Electric Lucifer, he continued on Lucifer's rock-influenced musical approach with 1971's Together, an electronic pop album that marked his return to Dimension 5. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to differentiate this work from his children's music, he released it under the name Jackpine Savage, {{the only time he}} used this pseudonym.|$|R
5000|$|Kelley {{appeared}} {{three times}} on Gunfight at the O.K. Corral: first in 1955, where he portrayed Ike Clanton {{in the television}} series You Are There; again, two years later in the 1957 film of that name, playing Morgan Earp; and <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ironic salute, once again on October 25, 1968, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> third-season Star Trek episode titled [...] "Spectre of the Gun", this time portraying Tom McLaury.|$|R
