It is performed in tumbling mills that describe a class of mills delimited by a cylindrical chamber filled with balls and/or rock that rotate around its longitudinal axis. Tumbling mills, whether they are autogenous, semi-autogenous, ball or rod, are classed according {{to the nature of the}} discharge as centre <b>peripheral</b> discharge <b>mills,</b> end <b>peripheral</b> discharge <b>mills,</b> overflow mills, and grate discharge mills. These mills are used in at least three industries: mining, cement and metal powders industries to grind different materials (ore, clinker and metal powder) to desired quality specifications as principally described by a size distribution. These tumbling mills range in size from small 0. 3 m diameter lab mills to a 16 m diameter semi-autogenous industrial mill and are driven by chain and sprocket (lab mills), gear and pinion (pilot and industrial scale mills) and gearless drives in very large diameter mill (8 to 12 m dia.). All of these mill drives present advantages and limitations. In this thesis, we focus on the design and development of a cam-driven laboratory ball mill. An alternative drive system is presented that uses a newly patented speed-o-cam technology and applies it to a 5 ft diameter lab mill. We introduce polynomials to modify the cam profile around both the cusp and the blunt point of the profile to improve pressure angle and shock impact. We build models of mechanical systems, simulate the full-motion behavior of the models, and analyze multiple design variations. We integrate the theoretical, virtual and experimental analyses in order to design an optimal mechanical system.

The machining data, although covering {{a wide range of}} relevant cutting conditions, are only listed under discrete cutting conditions. Rough interpolation-based calculations are often needed in order to estimate the process parameter values at the desired cutting condition. In this work, a composite fitting model is presented to fit a composite functional curve through the discrete handbook data of recommended cutting speeds and feeds with respect to the cutting condition of radial depth of cut for <b>peripheral</b> end <b>milling.</b> The objective is to establish a functional relationship from the handbook data such that recommended cutting speed and feed can be obtained for any given radial depth of cut. According to the tabulated layout of the machining data, the entire range of the radial depth of cut is divided into three segments having distinctive formulations and trends. Constraints are then imposed to preserve the trends and smoothly connect the adjacent segments. As a possible application of the presented model, a case study of machining a rectangular pocket is provided.

As a result of these three high level needs, there is now an even greater need for comprehensive simulations that predict material behavior during a manufacturing process, the stresses and/or temperatures on associated tooling, and the final-product integrity. The phrase `manufacturing processes` of course covers a broad scope; it includes semiconductor manufacturing, injection molding of polymers, metal machining and precision lapping, wood and textile production, and the final assembly of piece-parts into a consumer product. It can be seen from this partial listing that the fields of fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, dynamics and tribology can all play a role. The introduction to the paper will contain a review of manufacturing processes and describe where simulations have been successfully applied, and where simulations are still lacking. The best of the simulations are those where the models accurately fit the physical phenomena, where accurate constitutive equations are available, and where boundary conditions are realistic. Thus, the body of the paper will focus on the results from one of these more successful simulations. It has been used to predict the deflections of tooling and the most appropriate operating conditions for the manufacturing process under study. A new method for manufacturing planning is described.

30|$|For the metal-working industry, a {{continuous}} reduction in manufacturing cost is desirable. An important issue related to reduce overall cost {{consists of the}} removal of undesirable or excess work piece material during the machining process. Among different types of material removal operations, end-milling is most important common milling operation due to its capability of producing complex geometric surfaces with reasonable accuracy and surface finish. Over the last two decades, several works focused on the optimum selection of machining parameters based on various criteria such as using basic mathematical models. Some contemporary literature is first presented. Brito et al. (2014) developed a robust parameter design for the process parameters using the multi-objective methods. The numerical results are validated with the experimental cutting tests. Mathivanan et al. (2016) studied the influence of cutting parameters on milling of the composite materials. A CNC end milling was used to machine the composite laminates at various combinations of speeds and depth of cuts. Numan durakbasa et al. (2015) presented the various end milling process parameters {{as well as the}} coatings on the surface quality of the machined parts of AISI H 13 hot work steel. Some researchers (eg., Hocheng et al. (1997), Arokiadass (2012) and Surinder (2015)) investigated the machining characteristics of an aluminium based composite alloy for the end-milling process. Experiments were conducted based on the central composite design and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to build the mathematical model. Zhang et al. (2016) implemented a systematic optimization approach to obtain the pareto-optimal values of cutting process parameters. Dikshit et al. (2014 a, 2014 b) studied the cutting process parameters in dry machining of aluminium alloys. Response surface methodology was planned to carry out the experiments and further genetic algorithms were implemented to obtain the optimal parameters such as the cutting speed, feed per tooth, axial and radial depth of cut. Karkalos et al. (2016) focused on the machining of Titanium alloy with the <b>peripheral</b> down <b>milling</b> process and further optimal control studies were implemented to minimize the surface roughness. Ratnam et al. (2016) studied the turn-milling process in tangential and orthogonal directions to minimize the surface roughness of extruded brass material. Several recent works focussed on the optimal machining parameters for multi-pass milling operations by considering the statistical and artificial intelligent techniques (Wang et al. 2005; Sukumar et al. 2014; Venkata Rao and Pawar 2010; Das et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2016). The efficiency of a neural network model was estimated by conducting the numerical simulations and experiments. Several studies had been focussed on the optimization of important cutting process parameters using intelligent optimization techniques like genetic algorithms and radial basis neural networks (Briceno et al. 2002; Mounayri et al. 2010; Mounayri et al. 2005). Using, different neural network models and optimization algorithms the impact of the surface roughness on the process parameters are extensively studied (Palanisamy et al. 2007; Palanisamy and Kalidass 2014; Zain et al. 2011; Saffar and Razfar 2010). Khorasani et al. (2016) studied the effects of cutting parameters and cutting fluid pressure intensity on the surface roughness of milled parts. The important parameters were modelled and analysed using both the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis neural networks.|$|R

Within the range of cutting speeds employed (190 m/min~ 300 m/min), the cutting performance of MQL has been investigated when <b>peripheral</b> <b>milling</b> the titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V in terms of cutting forces, surface roughness, tool life and wear mechanism. The results show that, compared to dry machining, MQL machining brings about a significant reduction in cutting forces and surface roughness, and it also gives rise to a notably prolonged tool life...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for generating a tool path for cutting a pocket with islands, which includes detecting when the tool {{is certain to}} be making a minimal engagement cut. Minimal engagement is defined as the amount of engagement present in <b>peripheral</b> <b>milling</b> of a flat side face of a workpiece in a straight line with constant stepover. Feed rates and spindle speeds are reset by the algorithm when machining conditions change from a minimal engagement cut to any other type of cut or vice versa.
