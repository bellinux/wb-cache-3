The chambers had nearly equal porosities (38 %) but different calculated pore sizes (range, 10 to 65 μm). Motile strains always penetrated faster than nonmotile strains, and nutrient conditions that resulted in faster growth rates (fermentative conditions versus nitrate-respiring conditions) resulted in faster penetration rates for both motile and nonmotile strains {{for all of the}} bead sizes tested. The penetration rate of nonmotile strains increased linearly when bead size was increased, while the penetration rate of motile strains became independent of the bead size when beads having diameters of 398 μm or greater were used. The rate of H 2 production and the final amount of H 2 produced decreased when bead size was decreased. However, the final protein concentrations were similar in <b>chambers</b> <b>packed</b> with 116 -, 192 -, and 281 -μm beads and were only slightly higher in <b>chambers</b> <b>packed</b> with 398 - and 767 -μm beads.

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{approaches}} to removing gaseous pollutants from effluent streams: absorption, adsorption, condensation, chemical reaction, incineration, and selective dif-fusion through a membrane. Absorption is an operation involving mass transfer of a soluble vapor component to a solvent liquid in a device that promotes intimate contact between the gas and the liquid. The driving force for absorption is the difference between the partial pressure of the soluble gas in the gas mixture and its vapor pressure just above the surface of the liquid. It is necessary to employ a liquid solvent within which the gas to be removed is soluble. Water is, by itself, quite efficient for removing soluble acidic gases such as HCl and HF and the soluble basic gas NH 3. Gases of more limited solubility, such as S 02, C 12, and H 2 S, can be absorbed readily in an alkaline solution such as dilute NaOH. Thus, when water is used as the solvent, it may contain added species, such as acids, alkalines, oxidants, or reducing agents to react with the gas being absorbed and enhance its solubility. Nonaqueous, organic liquids of low volatility can be used for absorption of gases with low water solubility, such as hydrocarbons. Examples of such solvents are dimethylaniline and amines. Organic solvents are often limited to treating particle-free gases to avoid sludge formation. To provide a large liquid surface area for mass transfer, a means of breaking the liquid stream into small droplets or thin films is provided in the gas absorber. The most commonly used devices are columns containing packing or reg-ularly spaced plates, open spray chambers and towers, and combinations of sprayed and <b>packed</b> <b>chambers.</b> Countercurrent contact of liquid and gas is employed to maximize the driving forces. Adsorption is employed to remove low concentration gases from exhaust streams by causing the gaseous solutes to intimately contact a porous solid to which the solut...|$|R

In this work, a laboratory method based on dynamic flux <b>chambers</b> <b>packed</b> with soil has been used to measure emissions from untreated pig slurry and slurry treated by solid-liquid separation and ozonation. Proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) was used to provide time resolved data for a range of VOC, NH 3 and H 2 S. VOC included organic sulfur compounds, carboxylic acids, phenols, indoles, alcohols, ketones and aldehydes. H 2 S emission was remarkably observed to take place only in the initial minutes after slurry application, which is explained by its high partitioning into the air phase. Long-term odor effects are therefore assessed to be mainly due to other volatile compounds with low odor threshold values, such as 4 -methylphenol. PTR-MS signal assignment was verified by comparison to a photo-acoustic analyzer (NH 3) and to thermal desorption GC/MS (VOC). Due to initial rapid changes in odorant emissions and low concentrations of odorants, PTR-MS is assessed to be a very useful method for assessing odor following field application of slurry.

How journalists use Twitter is studied extensively, particularly on a small scale (i. e., qualitative research, specific events, mostly descriptive).

This study focuses on the adoption of Twitter and its emerging community network structure in the Netherlands. Using the social network data of 2, 152 journalists as retrieved from Twitter, analysis shows that the social network among journalists is well connected. The journalists who are extremely popular are also able to influence the flow of information through the network more than others (cf. gatekeeper role). Still, even though gatekeeping positions in the network are present due to the absence of specific relations, and the network consists of eight tightly knit network communities, the entire network is very well connected.

Mass balance analysis of these images demonstrated several instances in which this method does not accurately predict carbon dioxide concentration due to, among other factors, sorption of the methyl red dye to the sand and changes in optical properties between sand textures.

USE - For use in contact with liquids and/or gases, particularly for passage of or filling with liquids and/or gases or for filling with solidified melts, as a filter (especially a metal melt filter, submerged filter or filtration support body), as a heat exchanger or regenerator, as a catalyst support or reaction <b>chamber</b> <b>packing</b> element, as a burner element, as a thermostatic heating or regulating element, for supporting mechanical loads, as a sound-proofing element, as a stiffening element for light structural elements, as a mirror support or heat shield tile, as a ceramic reinforcing material for metal matrix composites (MMCs) or light metal alloy MMCs, as a brake material, as a grinding body or as a support for grinding media (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The network has uniform cell wall thickness, can be produced with cells of large size, has high mechanical strength since it is free from cracks and has a structure which can be tailored according to its use...|$|R
6000|$|The great evil of {{the present}} system is the {{initiative}} of the king. By this reservation in the charter, the crown possesses more than a veto, all laws actually emanating from the sovereign. The tendency of such a regulation is either to convert the chambers into the old lits de justice, or to overthrow the throne, an event which will certainly accompany any serious change here. As might have been, as would have been anticipated, by any one familiar with the action of legislative bodies, in our time, this right is already so vigorously assailed, as to give rise to constant contentions between the great powers of the state. All parties are agreed that no law can be presented, that does not come originally from the throne; but the liberals are for putting so wide a construction {{on the right to}} amend, as already to threaten to pervert the regulation. This has driven some of the Bourbonists to maintain that the chambers have no right, at all, to amend a royal proposition. Any one may foresee, that this is a state of things which cannot peaceably endure for any great length of time. The ministry are compelled to <b>pack</b> the <b>chambers,</b> and in order to effect their objects, they resort to all the expedients of power that offer. As those who drew up the charter had neither the forethought, nor the experience, to anticipate all the embarrassments of a parliamentary government, they unwittingly committed themselves, and illegal acts are constantly resorted to, in order that the system may be upheld. The charter was bestowed ad captandum, and is a contradictory mélange of inexpedient concessions and wily reservations. The conscription undermined the popularity of Napoleon, and Louis XVIII. in his charter says, [...] "The conscription is abolished; the recruiting for the army and navy shall be settled by a law." [...] Now the conscription is not abolished; but, if pushed on this point, a French jurist would perhaps tell you it is now established by law. The feudal exclusiveness, on the subject of taxation, is done away with, all men being equally liable to taxation. The nett pay of the army is about two sous a day; this is settled by law, passed by the representatives of those who pay two hundred francs a year, in direct taxation. The conscription, in appearance, is general and fair enough; but he who has money can always hire a substitute, at a price quite within his power. It is only the poor man, who is never in possession of one or two thousand francs, that is obliged to serve seven years at two sous a day, nett.|$|R
40|$|M 30 {{propellant}} grains {{that had}} been ignited in interrupted closed bomb experiments were characterize by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Previous chemical analysis of extinguished grains had given no indications of plasma-propellant chemical interactions that could explain the increased burning rates {{that had been}} previously observed in full-pressure closed bomb experiments. (This {{does not mean that}} there is no unique chemistry occurring with plasma ignition. It may occur very early in the ignition event and then become obscured by the burning chemistry.) In this work, SEM was used to look at grain morphologies to determine if there were increases in the surface areas of the plasma-ignited grains which would contribute to the apparent increase in the burning rate. Charges were made using 30 propellant grains (approximately 32 grams) stacked in two tiers and in two concentric circles around a plastic straw. Each grain was notched so that, when the grains were expelled from the bomb during extinguishment, it could be determined in which tier and which circle each grain was originally packed. Charges were ignited in a closed bomb by either a nickel wire/Mylar-capillary plasma or black powder. The bomb contained a blowout disk that ruptured when the pressure reached 35 MPa, and the propellant was vented into a collection <b>chamber</b> <b>packed</b> with polyurethane foam. SEM analysis of the grains fired with a conventional black powder igniter showed no signs of unusual burning characteristics. The surfaces seemed to be evenly burned on the exteriors of the grains and in the perforations. Grains that had been subjected to plasma ignition, however, had pits, gouges, chasms, and cracks in the surfaces. The sides of the grains closest to the plasma had the greatest amount of damage, but even surfaces facing the outer wall of the bomb had small pits. The perforations contained gouges and abnormally burned regions (wormholes) that extended into the web. The SEM photos indicated that a grain from the top tier, which was farther away from the plasma ignition source, sustained more plasma-induced damage to the perforations and the web than did the grains on the bottom tier...|$|R
