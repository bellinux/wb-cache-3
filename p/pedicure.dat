25|$|Immediately {{after this}} agonizing <b>pedicure,</b> the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The {{bindings}} were pulled even tighter {{each time the}} girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated {{as often as possible}} (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants {{two or three times a}} week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.|$|E

These fish are used for the {{increasingly}} popular spa treatment called fish <b>pedicures.</b> During these sessions, spa patrons immerse their feet in water, allowing the live fish to feed on dead skin, mainly for cosmetic reasons.
