40|$|The {{emergent}} {{business model}} literature, revolving mainly around the mechanisms through which new business models create and deliver value, {{has left the}} value capture challenge under-explored. This paper examines how an incumbent firm profits from business model innovation through the study of <b>Pay-As-You-Drive</b> <b>auto</b> <b>insurance.</b> Although business models do not warrant formal intellectual property (IP) protection, their constituent components (e. g. business methods and brands) often do. Drawing on the profiting-from-innovation framework, we find that formal and strategic IP protection methods play complementary roles. Initially, formal IP rights are used primarily as a defensive strategy, as vehicles for packaging and trading know-how, and most importantly {{as a means of}} “buying time” to build specialised complementary assets. Long-term competitiveness, however, depends on whether the innovator builds a strong position in specialised complementary assets and is capable of reconfiguring them over time in line with changes in the market environment. Thus, we explicate the complex mechanism and dynamic capability for capturing value from business model innovation...|$|E
40|$|Gasoline {{taxes are}} widely {{perceived}} as the most efficient instrument for reducing gasoline consumption because they exploit all behavioral responses for reducing fuel use, including reduced driving and improved fuel economy. At present, however, higher fuel taxes are viewed as a political nonstarter. <b>Pay-as-you-drive</b> (PAYD) <b>auto</b> <b>insurance,</b> which involves replacing existing lump-sum premiums with premiums that vary in proportion to miles driven, should be more practical, since they do not raise driving costs for the average motorist. We show that when impacts on {{a broad range of}} motor vehicle externalities are considered, PAYD also induces significantly higher welfare gains than comparable gasoline tax increases, for fuel reductions below 9 %. The reason is that under PAYD, all of the reduction in fuel use, rather than just a fraction, comes from reduced driving; this produces a substantial additional efficiency gain because mileage-related external costs (especially congestion and accidents) are relatively large in magnitude. gasoline tax; pay-as-you-drive insurance; mileage tax; welfare effects; motor vehicle externality...|$|R
40|$|The current {{lump-sum}} pricing of <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> is {{inefficient and}} inequitable. Drivers who {{are similar in}} other respects—age, gender, location, driving safety record—pay nearly the same premiums if they drive five thousand or fifty thousand miles a year. Just as an all-you-can-eat restaurant encourages more eating, all-you-can-drive insurance pricing encourages more driving. That means more accidents, congestion, carbon emissions, local pollution, and dependence on oil. This pricing system is inequitable because low-mileage drivers subsidize insurance costs for high-mileage drivers, and low-income people drive fewer miles on average. A better approach is simple and obvious: <b>pay-as-you-drive</b> (PAYD) <b>auto</b> <b>insurance.</b> With PAYD, insurance premiums would be priced per mile driven. All other risk factors will still be taken into account, so a high-risk driver would pay a greater per-mile premium than a low-risk driver. With insurance costs that vary with miles driven, people {{would be able to}} save money by reducing their driving, and this incentive would lead to fewer driving-related harms. PAYD would also be more equitable because it would eliminate the cross-subsidization of insurance costs from lowmileage to high-mileage drivers. Given these potential benefits, there has been increased interest in California recently i...|$|R

We then turn to an analysis of the factors underlying the <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> price increases experienced in recent years. We find that the <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> inflation of the 1980 s was caused primarily by increases in cost factors, especially inflation in the severity of personal injury claims. There is no persuasive evidence that increasing profit rates or expense loadings contributed to inflation in premiums. The paper concludes with recommendations for bringing costs under control. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} structure-conduct-performance framework {{makes the}} explicit prediction that market structure determines market conduct, performance and power. The {{primary goal of}} this study is to evaluate this prediction using the South African (SA) short-term <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> market. The empirical evidence shows that a link between market structure and market conduct, performance and/or power is not present. "Prices" and profits are not statistically significantly related to various sellers' concentration measure and do not follow any explicit trend over time. By construction, profits are directly related to "prices" and follow a cyclical trend, as observed in other countries. A secondary goal of this paper is to compare the findings for the US <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> market with the empirical evidence on the SA <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> market. While there are few similarities, there is an underwriting cycle in the SA <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> market such as is observed for the US <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> market.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{regulation}} of <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> markets in the US has been a subject of considerable interest and empirical study. South Carolina provides an interesting test case for examining the effects of significant reforms of the regulation of <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> markets. Prior to 1997, South Carolina had a very strict regulatory regime for <b>auto</b> <b>insurance.</b> Rates were subject to prior approval and South Carolina regulators imposed tight constraints on overall rate increases and territorial and other rating factors. In addition, South Carolina established a Reinsurance Facility (“the Facility”) as a residual market mechanism which imposed a large subsidy from low-risk and high-risk drivers to medium-risk drivers. South Carolina’s approach to <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> regulation was motivated by concerns about escalating <b>auto</b> <b>insurance</b> costs stemming from high speeds on its rural highways, frequent and severe accidents, and a litigious environment. Legislators believed that imposing strict regulatory constraints on auto insurers would {{stem the tide of}} rising premiums and address concerns about the unfair treatment of certain drivers.
