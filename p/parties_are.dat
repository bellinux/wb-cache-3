5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views. These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition <b>parties</b> <b>are</b> tempered by the fear of defamation suits.|$|E

Chad remains plagued by political violence and recurrent attempted coups d'état. Chad is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world; most inhabitants live in poverty as subsistence herders and farmers. Since 2003 crude oil has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional cotton industry.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi {{said that}} she was ready to work with any party in Finland.

The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that the two <b>parties</b> <b>are</b> ideologically too far from each other to sit in the same coalition. The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Parliament of Norway {{are elected}} based on party-list {{proportional}} representation in plural member constituencies. This means that representatives from different political <b>parties</b> <b>are</b> elected from 19 constituencies, which are {{identical to the}} 19 counties. The electorate does not vote for individuals but rather for party lists, with a ranked list of candidates nominated by the party. This means that the person {{on top of the}} list will get the seat unless the voter alters the ballot. Parties may nominate candidates from outside their own constituency, and even Norwegian citizens currently living abroad.|$|E

5|$|The area's history {{begins with}} several {{indigenous}} groups, including the Powhatan. In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia {{as the first}} permanent New World English colony. Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each {{played a significant role}} in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution and joined the Confederacy in the American Civil War, during which Richmond was made the Confederate capital and Virginia's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of West Virginia. Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction, both major national <b>parties</b> <b>are</b> competitive in modern Virginia.|$|E
5|$|As a United States {{district}} court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri conducts civil {{trials and}} issues orders. The cases it hears concern either federal question jurisdiction, where {{a federal law}} or treaty is applicable, or diversity jurisdiction, where <b>parties</b> <b>are</b> domiciled in different states. The court also holds criminal trials of persons charged with violations of federal law. Appeals from cases brought in the Eastern District of Missouri are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). These cases can then be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three <b>parties</b> <b>are</b> from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E
50|$|The Independent Socialist <b>Party</b> <b>was</b> a {{political}} <b>party</b> in Greece. The <b>party</b> <b>was</b> formed in 1931, through a {{split in the}} Socialist Party of Greece.

5|$|However, the {{reference}} {{is part of}} a polemic against the moral decay of Florence, Lombardy, and the Italian Peninsula as a whole; Dante, through his characters, chastises German King Albert I for neglecting his responsibilities towards Italy ("you who are negligent"), and successive popes for their encroachment from purely spiritual affairs, thus leading to a climate of incessant bickering and warfare between rival political parties in Lombardy. History records the name of the family Montague as being lent to such a political party in Verona, but that of the Capulets as from a Cremonese family, both of whom play out their conflict in Lombardy as a whole rather than within the confines of Verona. Allied to rival political factions, the <b>parties</b> <b>are</b> grieving ("One lot already grieving") because their endless warfare has led to the destruction of both parties, rather than a grief from the loss of their ill-fated offspring as the play sets forth, which appears to be a solely poetic creation within this context.|$|E

A second class action lawsuit against Fyre Media, McFarland, Ja Rule, and the event promoters in Los Angeles. The plaintiff alleges that they deceived patrons into attending the festival by paying over 400 social media personalities and celebrities to promote it.

5|$|Legislative {{restrictions}} on immigration (such as the Continuous journey regulation and Chinese Immigration Act) that had favoured British and other European immigrants were amended in the 1960s, opening {{the doors to}} immigrants {{from all parts of}} the world. While the 1950s had still seen high levels of immigration by Europeans, by the 1970s immigrants were increasingly Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, Jamaican and Haitian. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Canada received many American Vietnam War draft dissenters. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Canada's growing Pacific trade brought with it a large influx of South Asians, who tended to settle in British Columbia. Immigrants of all backgrounds tend to settle in the major urban centres. The Canadian public, as well as the major political <b>parties,</b> <b>are</b> tolerant of immigrants.|$|E

5|$|MEPs in Parliament are {{organised}} into seven different parliamentary groups, including thirty non-attached members known as non-inscrits. The two largest groups are the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S). These two groups {{have dominated the}} Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats between them. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament. As {{a result of being}} broad alliances of national parties, European group <b>parties</b> <b>are</b> very decentralised and hence {{have more in common with}} parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than unitary states like the majority of the EU states. Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{fourteen}} current first ministers, two (Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne) are women. Two (Bob McLeod and Peter Taptuna) are indigenous. The longest-serving first minister is Brad Wall of Saskatchewan, who {{has held the}} position since November 21, 2007; the newest first minister is John Horgan of British Columbia, who assumed office on July 18, 2017. The oldest first minister, Bob McLeod of the Northwest Territories, was born in 1952, while the youngest, Brian Gallant of New Brunswick, was born in 1982. Of the current first ministers, eight are from a Liberal Party, two are from a New Democratic Party, one is from a Progressive Conservative Party, one is from the Saskatchewan Party, and two are non-partisan. Provincial <b>parties</b> <b>are</b> not, however, necessarily affiliated with or politically analogous to their federal counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Race is a {{significant}} force in politics, and many political <b>parties</b> <b>are</b> ethnically based. Affirmative actions such as the New Economic Policy and the National Development Policy which superseded it, were implemented to advance the standing of the bumiputera, consisting of Malays and the indigenous tribes who are considered the original inhabitants of Malaysia, over non-bumiputera such as Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians. These policies provide preferential treatment to bumiputera in employment, education, scholarships, business, and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings. However, it has generated greater interethnic resentment. There is ongoing debate over whether the laws and society of Malaysia should reflect secular or Islamic principles. Islamic criminal laws passed by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party {{with the support of}} UMNO state assemblymen in the state legislative assembly of Kelantan have been blocked by the federal government on the basis that criminal laws are the responsibility of the federal government.|$|E
