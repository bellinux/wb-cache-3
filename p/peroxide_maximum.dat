40|$|AbstractThe {{activity}} of the enzyme Iraqi Turnip peroxidase (ITP) is studied in a reverse microemulsion composed of chloroform, aqueous buffer, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and alcohols of the homologous series 1 -propanol to 1 -hexanol through the measurements of absorbancy of the product of oxidation at the wavelength of 470 nm {{in the course of}} reactions. The ITP catalyzed reaction is the oxidation of guaiacol by hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> <b>Maximum</b> enzyme activity was obtained at ω 0 (molar ratio of water to surfactant) = 8. It was found that the oxidation reaction obeyed Michaelis–Menten kinetics in the investigated concentration rang (0. 08 – 0. 8 mM) of the substrate, and the Michaelis constant Km and maximal reaction rate Vm were determined. The enzyme inhibition caused by the alcohols in microemulsions is a consequence of both the solubility of the alcohols in the buffer and the flexibility of the interfacial film...|$|E

However, {{this has a}} high risks for human health {{because of the presence}} of higher number of pathogenic organisms. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility use of Fenton and modified Fenton with copper for the disinfection of raw wastewater. Materials and Methods: After primarily laboratory physicochemical and biological analysis, the disinfection process was performed in three different phases in each process. First, the disinfectants were injected separately, then we performed disinfection using Fe++ and cu++ ions combined with hydrogen peroxide in order to determine synergistic effect of each catalyst. Direct method was used for fecal coliforms counting. &nbsp; Results: Hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> <b>maximum</b> efficiency for inactivation of fecal coliforms was only 0. 66 log inactivation. Fenton and modified Fenton with copper ions showed a remarkable effect on the bacterial inactivation so that Fenton and modified Fenton with 1 and 2 mg/l of Cu++ inactivated coliforms by 4. 73, 3. 28, and 4. 88 log respectively. Conclusion: Application of HP alone for the disinfection of raw wastewater is not practicable due to low observed efficiency. However, its combination with ions such as Fe++ and Cu++ increases HP performance in disinfection and has a notable synergistic effect on HP&nbsp; disinfection power, where, in the presence of each catalyst, hydrogen peroxide can reduce the fecal coliforms of raw wastewater to meet the Iranian Environmental Protection Agency Standards. /* Style Definitions */ table.

Vibrating membrane had shown good performance in chemical oxygen demand and oil removals and the mitigation of concentration polarization. However, the permeate after filtration processing still contained high content of organics. Thus, additional Fenton oxidation was applied to reduce the organic loading, and improve the biodegradability of the wastewater. The optimal molar ratio of ferrous iron to hydrogen peroxide was 0. 05 obtained from the jar-test experiments. Removal of organics was enhanced by increasing hydrogen peroxide dosage, while efficiency of hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> reached <b>maximum</b> of 1. 11 (w/w) at the hydrogen peroxide dosage of 6. 8 g/L. Furthermore, the biological experiments indicated that the high concentration of organics could inhibit microbial activity, which decreased the chemical oxygen demand degradation rates. The adaptive period of the microbe was greatly shortened using Fenton's reagent at the low dosages. The improvement of the biodegradability {{could be explained by}} partial mineralization and chemical transformation of parent organic compounds after Fenton oxidation...|$|R

The purpose of this investigation was to study the oxidation of beta-carotene and to identify volatile compounds arising from autoxidizing beta-carotene. Pure cyrstalline beta-carotene, mixed with Celite to accelerate oxidation, was oxidized at 50 °C by molecular oxygen in two different systems. The peroxide value and loss of beta-carotene were measured after controlled oxidation periods. In one system the <b>maximum</b> <b>peroxide</b> value, 295 milliequivalents per 1, 000 grams, occurred after three hours of oxidation. In the other system the <b>maximum</b> <b>peroxide</b> value, 586 milliequivalents per 1, 000 grams, was observed after six hours of oxidation. Approximately 80 percent of the beta-carotene was decomposed within the first ten hours of oxidation. Volatile compounds from autoxidizing beta-carotene were collected by a cold-trap gas-entrainment technique. The collected compounds were subjected to gas-liquid chromatography and rapidscan mass spectrometry, and the following compounds were identified: n-pentane, ethyl ether, acetaldehyde, acetone, propanal, methyl vinyl ketone, toluene, isobutanal, 2 -octanone and acetic acid. Compounds tentatively identified included diacetyl, 3 -methyl- 2 -pentanone, 4 -methyl- 3 -pentan- 2 -one, 2 -methylfuran, 1, 3, 3 -trimethylcyclohexene, rnethyl formate, butanone, 2 -methyl- 2 -heptenal, 1, 3 -dimethyl- 2 -ethylcyclohexane, 2 -ethyl- 2 -hexenal, 2 -formyl- 3, 3 - dimethylcyclohexene, 1, 1, 3 -trimethyl- 2 -n-propylcyclohexane, 2 - methyl- 3 -nonene and 3, 5, 5 -trimethyl- 4 -(4 '-butyl- 3 '-en- 2 '-onyl) cyclohexa- 1, 3 -diene.

Without hydrogen <b>peroxide,</b> the <b>maximum</b> extraction of copper and cobalt {{were found to be}} ~ 80 % and ~ 15 %, respectively when the acid concentration was varied between 0. 36 - 1. 1 M. When hydrogen peroxide was added (0. 008 - 0. 042 M), Cu recovery was enhanced to ~ 90 %. Recoveries of ~ 90 % of Co could be achieved at 20 ºC, using leachants consisting of 0. 36 M sulphuric acid and 0. 025 M hydrogen peroxide after 3 hours. The reaction time to reach 90 % Co extraction was reduced to less than 2 hours at 30 ºC. Stabcal modelling of the Eh-pH diagrams shows the importance of hydrogen peroxide as a reductant. The decrease of solution potential (300 - 350 mV) by adding hydrogen peroxide was confirmed by Eh measurements during the tests. The leaching follows the shrinking core model kinetics, where the rate constant is linearly dependent on hydrogen peroxide concentration in the range 0 - 0. 025 M and proportional to (1 /r 2) where r is the average radius of the mineral particles.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of type and amount of bleaching earth (BE) on the final quality of refined palm oils, especially on the oxidative state and color. Two types of bleaching earth were tested, one natural (NBE) and one acid-activated (ABE) (0. 5 – 3. 0 % w/w). Crude palm oils were bleached at 105  °C, during 30  min at 50  mmHg pressure.

From thermal stability of the removal activities in hemolysates, the removal activities {{were divided into two}} activities. The removal activity deactivated at lower temperature was catalase, and the 50 % inactivation was observed after 10 min incubation at 47. 2 ± 0. 5 °C for normal hemolysates and 34. 0 ± 0. 8 °C for acatalasemic ones. The removal activity deactivated at a higher temperature remained after the addition of sodium azide, and the 50 % inactivation was observed at 63. 5 ± 1. 4 °C. After separation of the removal activities by carboxymethyl-cellulose column chromatography, the removal activity deactivated at higher temperature was attributed to the activity by hemoglobin. From Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis of the removal rates by hemoglobin at 37 °C, the Michaelis constant for hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> and the <b>maximum</b> velocity were 201 ± 53 μM and 5. 37 ± 1. 39 μmol/s per g of Hb, respectively. Removal rates by hemoglobin in mouse hemolysates at 37 °C in 70 μM hydrogen peroxide were 1. 32 ± 0. 12 μmol/s per g of Hb. Catalase activity (k/g Hb: rate constant related to the hemoglobin content) in normal mouse hemolysates was 104 ± 12 at 25 °C and 117 ± 10 at 37 °C, and that in acatalasemic hemolysates was 10. 5 ± 1. 7 at 25 °C.

40|$|Background : Peroxide is {{the first}} {{compound}} that is produced after fats and oils are oxidated. Whenever peroxide concentration reaches to a certain amount, different changes occur and volatile essences are created which make unfavoured odour and flavour in oils and fats. The present article is a report of evaluation of peroxide concentration in Zoolbia and Bamieh which was planned and applied in kashan city in 2003 - 2004. Materials and methods : The research was accomplished by a descriptive study on 57 samples of Bamieh and 36 samples of Zoolbia during 2 years. In this study, firstly, certain amount of sample oil was extracted by Suxeleh method, and then the amount of available peroxide in the oil was measured by titration (Sodium thiosulfate 0. 02 Normal). To {{determine the amount of}} peroxide, the sodium thiosulfate consumption was measured and calculated by related formula. Statistical analyses were accomplished by use of test.

In sulphur-vulcanized natural rubber latex films, the crosslinked regions appeared as dark areas within the elliptical shaped rubber particles and as strands around the rubber particles section in between rubber particles linking the rubber particles. In peroxide-vulcanized natural rubber latex films, crosslinks region appeared denser at the outer surface of the rubber particles compared to the inner phase. Hydroxyacetone has been shown as an effective activator for tert-buthyl hydroperoxide in the prevulcanization of natural rubber latex using <b>peroxide</b> process. The <b>maximum</b> tensile strength value was observed to occur at film prepared at a prevulcanization temperature of 60 °C, heating for 3 hours.

Crosslink density is not the only factor that contributes to high strength property of natural rubber latex films. The addition of higher levels of crosslinking agent resulting in higher crosslink density and modulus of elasticity values, but, too high crosslinking may lead to subsequent decreased in the tensile strength value. Thus, a combination of the right degree of crosslinking range and the degree of particle cohesion are important factors governing the strength of natural rubber latex films. Leaching treatment and drying at elevated temperature, improved the coalescence of the rubber particles which in turn improved the tensile strength of the films. The addition of antioxidant hinders the thermal-oxidative effect during the drying process and thus, greater coherence of the films by heat treatment could be obtained...|$|R

One such process which employs UV light-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant has been explored for the destruction of nine aromatic pollutants (benzene, phenol, toluene, chlorobenzene, three chlorophenols, and two phthalate esters), as well as trichloroethylene (TCE). ^ Aromatic pollutants were treated in an annular batch-recycle photoreactor operated at 25 ∘C, pH 6. 8, and an applied UV power of 1. 6 watts/liter. Rates of reaction were determined for UV light alone and for the combination of UV light plus 1. 5 mM hydrogen peroxide. The UV/peroxide combination yielded higher reaction rates than UV light alone. All the aromatics were oxidized at similar rates. A study of the formation and destruction of reaction intermediates for two pollutants showed that all detectable intermediates could be eliminated, given sufficient treatment time. ^ The kinetics of TCE oxidation were studied in plate type batch photoreactors of two different depths. The reaction rate of TCE was first order in UV light intensity and pseudo first order in TCE concentration. The rate was first order in hydrogen peroxide concentration at low peroxide levels, but independent of peroxide concentration at high <b>peroxide</b> levels. The <b>maximum</b> rate attainable depended on the reactor depth, with the shallower reactor yielding the larger maximum rate. The effect of temperature on the rate was minimal. The rate was a factor of two slower at acidic and basic pH than at neutral pH. ^ A mechanism for TCE oxidation was proposed which yielded a rate expression consistent with the experimental observations. The rate expression was semi-empirical in that it employed the concept of 2 ̆ 2 effective 2 ̆ 2 path lengths to account for the attenuation of UV light intensity with increasing reactor depth. ^ Formic acid was identified as an intermediate of TCE oxidation.

40|$|High-purity oleate esters can {{decrease}} the melting points {{and improve the}} oxidative stability of lubricants. High-oleic soybean oil (HOSO) was esterified to butyl or isopropyl esters. Fractional distillation and low-temperature crystallization were applied to improve the purity of oleate of HOSO esters. Although the purity of butyl esters of HOSO attained 91. 8 % by fractional distillation, the rate of distillation must be slow which made this approach not very feasible. After subjecting the esters to a two-step crystallization at reduced temperatures, the percentage of oleate in the HOSO esters was increased from 83. 2 to 92. 5 %. The percentage of saturated fatty acids decreased to less than 2. 2 %, but polyunsaturates percentage remained almost unchanged. Methyl linoleate monolayer has a highest lipid oxidation rate. It can be employed to produce useful oxidation products including expoxides and hydroxides. Methyl linoleate (20 % by weight) was coated to silica gel H to form monolayers and heated at 35, 40, 50 and 60 yC. Methyl palmitate (5 % by weight of methyl linoleate) was added as internal standard. The identification of oxidation products was by comparison to standards. The oxidation rate increased with temperature. The temperature for optimal yields of epoxides (20. 26 %) and total non-scission products (NSPs, 38. 79 %) was 50 yC. Citric acid and EDTA (0. 01 % and 0. 02 % by weight of oil) were added as chelating agents to minimize the effects of iron on oxidation. Citric acid at 0. 01 % achieved higher PV and also reduced the loss of NSPs to scission products (SPs) after reaching the <b>maximum</b> <b>peroxide</b> value. The addition of 20 ppm vanadium (by weight of silica gel) increased the yield of epoxides (23. 85 %); however, it also led to lower peroxide values and longer induction period.

The type and composition of biodiesel have major effect on the formation of deposits. The major compounds of thermal stable residues of biodiesel from muffle furnace heated at 200 yC for 15 min were analysed by GC-MS. Those compounds were mostly fragments of fatty esters, in which the terminal ends are acids, aldehydes.
