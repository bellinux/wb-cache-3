40|$|The {{shipping}} market {{had taken off}} in 2003 and {{had come to a}} hard landing after the Financial Crisis in 2008. The optimism in this period spurred an aggressive order book expansion as the demand for these ships exceeded the supply. From 2008 till now, the market tries to find its equilibrium but supply and demand are still far from level. This research gives insight in the current market situation for Panamax ships and hereby focusing on ocean going grain shipments. The study aims to script the changing supply and demand elements that determine the future growth prospects for the Panamax fleet. This research will be of high value to decision makers in shipping companies, cargo owners, shipbuilders, bankers, governments and many more. The {{reason for this is that}} all of these decisions makers want have a good view of where the market is heading and if smart decisions and investments can be made. The research is performed with the data filtered from the Clarkson Shipping Intelligence Network. Clarkson Shipping Intelligence Network is a well-known Internet database that provides raw data, market reports, time series and graphs counting around 100, 000 pages regarding any aspect of shipping. From here, all <b>Panamax</b> <b>ship</b> market information was filtered (number of ships, age profile, flag, conversions and many more). Next to this, important drivers of grain demand and grain supply were filtered from web-sources and matched with the drivers of Panamax ships to seek correlations. Surprisingly, no correlations were found between these drivers. On the other hand, the <b>Panamax</b> <b>ship</b> information was structured in such a way that graphs and tables could be made that led to the following conclusions. Future growth prospects are almost none existing and a recovery of the market in the short term (within one to two years) is highly unlikely. The consequence is a sharp decrease of new building orders of Panamax ships and shipyards are struggling for work. Meanwhile, scrap prices are skyrocketing thus indicating an enormous increase in activity on scrap yards. But these days, scrap yards are struggling more and more with environmental and health and safety issues than their fight for new work. In the end, the research that lies in front of you is on of the most up-to-date market report on Panamax ships with the focus on ocean going grain shipments with those ships. Once over, the importance of this research to managers cannot be understated. Business Schoo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{practical}} method for estimating the weight of ro-ro deck structures. Preliminarily, the procedures for assessing the scantlings of platings, ordinary stiffeners and primary supporting members subjected to wheeled loads, are presented, in order {{to point out the}} parameters that influence the deck weight, such as ordinary stiffener spacing, transverse spacing, number of girders, web height of primary supporting members. The strength check of platings is rule based, while ordinary stiffeners are schematized as continuous beams; concerning the primary supporting members, instead, the direct scantling procedure, proposed in a previous paper, is adopted, schematizing the deck as an orthotropic plate with clamped boundary conditions in correspondence of the aft and fore bulkheads and the ship sides, in order {{to take into account the}} interaction of the two orthogonal beam sets. Some design charts are presented in order to determine the influence of the previously defined parameters on the deck weight or, similarly, on its equivalent thickness, spreading the stiffener and primary supporting member weight on the deck area. Finally, two numerical applications, relative to a Ro-ro <b>PANAMAX</b> <b>ship,</b> are presented, in order to evaluate the capability of the proposed technique...|$|E

40|$|One {{predicted}} {{consequence of}} global warming is the thinning of Arctic sea ice. This raises the question whether the fabled Northwest Passage {{can be used for}} year round ship traffic, and whether the distance saved by using the polar route justifies the incremental investment in ice-breaking ships. A conceptual study using computer simulation was conducted to evaluate the Northwest Passage versus the Panama Canal routes between eastern North America and Japan. Recent historical ice conditions were modelled stochastically to calculate ship transit time. The economic performance was then evaluated by estimating the port-to-port shipping cost component of the overall required freight rate, again using stochastic modelling for a variety of cost factors. The most critical economic variable is the incremental capital cost between an ice capable and a standard <b>Panamax</b> <b>ship.</b> Shipping from St John's Newfoundland to Yokohama is economic through the Northwest Passage even with an incremental capital cost of 80 %. Extending the route to New York would make the Northwest Passage non-competitive. We report the sensitivity of the port-to-port shipping cost for a number of economic factors, with capital and fuel cost being the most significant.

40|$|When the new locks of the Panama Canal are {{finished}} in 2015 Post Panamax vessels {{are able to}} sail through the Panama Canal. This will increase the container traffic intensity through the Caribbean. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) wants to anticipate on this expansion of the Panama Canal by investing in a US$ 1. 5 billion transshipment port in the Caribbean. Jamaica is an interesting location to realize this port, because of its ideal central position in the Caribbean and its location lies {{in the doorway of}} the Panama Canal. CHEC aims for the Goat Islands in Jamaica as their location for the new port. Normally the Jamaican government welcomes foreign investments of CHEC with open arms, but the Goat Islands are an environmentally protected area. Recently, this led to many complains by environmentalists. The new port can only be successful if it has a good competitive position with respect to other ports. The new port in Jamaica is a location with high potency to accommodate the container vessels which have ports at the East Coast of North America as destination. To attract shipping companies to the new transshipment port in Jamaica the price and efficiency of the new port must be competitive with other ports. As the new port of Jamaica doesn’t have a large hinterland and focusses mainly on transshipment, shipping companies are not bounded to Jamaica and can switch easily to other ports. The most competitive ports are Mariel (Cuba) and Freeport (the Bahamas). This report proposes designs and alternative locations for the new port. To find the ideal location for a new port in Jamaica different potential areas are selected and studied. The first steps resulted in sixteen possible locations for the port. Two Multi Criteria Analyses (MCA’s) resulted in a selection of four locations. Those possible locations for the new port are: the Goat Islands, Jackson Bay, Maccary Bay, and Little Bay. The best location is not found, because all the four locations are well-matched for their designed level of detail. Therefore the recommendation is made that all the four locations should be designed in a higher level of detail, so the decision makers can make well informed choices for the people of Jamaica. Because the media attention, the Jamaican government, and CHEC are more focusing on the Goat Islands than on the other locations, the location Goat Islands is designed further into detail. For designing the port the total surface of the port of 12 km 2 is divided into port area for transshipment (4 km 2) and area for the use of industry (8 km 2). The transshipment area has a quay length of 3 kilometer, which provides enough berthing space to handle seven Post Panamax ships and one <b>Panamax</b> <b>ship</b> simultaneously. The maximum expected throughput of 7 million TEU per year is found. The transshipment area is also designed into further detail. Super Post Panamax ship-to-shore cranes, multi trailer systems and rail mounted gantry cranes are most suitable for the port. The hinterland connection is also designed. A road connection is needed and a railway connection is designed as an option. The industrial surface can be used for many different facilities. These facilities are the assembling of gantry cranes for the Americas and creating cement and steel for export purposes. These activities need quay length which is included in the design of the total layout. Also space is reserved for a manufacturing facility, a logistics center, a LNG power plant, and a major IT facility. The extreme wave conditions for the new port are investigated to come up with the design loads. Extreme waves with a return period of 1 / 200 years give a surge level of 2. 0 meter and wave heights of 4. 0 meters at the port entrance. Behind the port is found a higher surge level of 2. 5 meters. Next to the extreme conditions the downtime of the port due to waves is established. Tropical storms are not strong enough to cause downtime, because of the sheltered area of Portland Bight. Only during hurricanes the port is not operational. The economical, social, and environmental impacts of the new port are described. For the new port the most favorable port model and a finance scheme are found. A private service port model with full concession in combination with a Build, Operate, and Transfer contract (BOT) is advised. The land will still be owned by the Jamaican government, but CHEC will fulfill both the functions of port authority and port operator. An environmental impact assessment has to be performed, because there are more issues besides the destruction of Little Goat Island, harming the fish sanctuary, and the impact on the total Portland Bight. Also these three issues should be investigated in detail. A SWOT analysis is carried out to find the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The main opportunity and threat is the change in expected throughput. To deal with this uncertainty an adaptive port planning is designed.
