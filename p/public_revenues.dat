After personally winning the support of Senator Dixon Lewis, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Polk was able to push the Independent Treasury Act through Congress, signing it into law on August 6, 1846. The act provided that the <b>public</b> <b>revenues</b> were to be retained in the Treasury building and in sub-treasuries in various cities, separate from private or state banks, to receive all government funds. The system would remain in place until the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.|$|E

Chichele was tenacious of the privileges of his see, and this involved him in a constant struggle with Henry Beaufort, bishop of Winchester. In 1418, while Henry V was alive, he successfully protested against Beaufort's being made a cardinal and legate a latere to supersede the legatine jurisdiction of Canterbury. But during the regency, after Henry VI's accession, Beaufort was successful, and in 1426 became cardinal and legate.|$|E

2500|$|Appian {{wrote that}} the law {{provided}} for distribution of public land that was leased to generate <b>public</b> <b>revenues</b> in Campania, especially around Capua, to citizens who had at least three children, and that this included 20,000 men. When many senators opposed the bill, Caesar pretended to be indignant and rushed out of the senate. Appian noted that Caesar did not convene it again {{for the rest of}} the year. Instead, he harangued the people and proposed his bills to the plebeian council. Suetonius also mentioned the 20,000 citizens with three children. He also {{wrote that the}} allocations concerned land in the plain of Stella (a relatively remote area on eastern Campanian border) that had been made public in by-gone days, and other areas of Campania that had been turned into public land but had not been allotted and was leased. Plutarch, who had a pro-aristocratic slant, thought that this law was not becoming of a consul, but for a most radical plebeian tribune. Land distribution, which was anathema to conservative aristocrats, was usually proposed by the plebeian tribunes who were often described by Roman writers (who were usually aristocrats) as base and vile. [...] It was opposed by ‘men of the better sort’ (aristocrats) and this gave Caesar an excuse to rush to the plebeian council, claiming that he was driven to it by the obduracy of the senate. It was only the most arrogant plebeian tribunes who courted the favour of the multitude (the people) and now Caesar did this to support his consular power 'in a disgraceful and humiliating manner'.|$|E

In other words, the Internet induces a higher extent {{of change in the}} structure of total public revenue—from lower reliance on resource revenue in favour of higher reliance on non-resource revenue—in less advanced countries than in more advanced economies that draw <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> from natural resources.

30|$|Turning {{specifically}} to results in Table  2, we obtain from column (1) of this table that the coefficient {{associated with the}} variable INTERNET is not statistically significant at the 10 % level, whereas in column (2) which includes the variable “DUMRES”, we obtain a negative and significant effect (at the 1 % level) of the Internet usage intensity on the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b> This clearly suggests that the Internet facilitates the shift from reliance on resource revenue to an increasing dependence on non-resource revenue in the overall <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b> In particular, we note that a 1 -percentage point increase in the Internet usage intensity {{is associated with a}} 0.056 -percentage point decline in the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> for countries contained in the sub-sample of “ResCountries”. In the light of these findings, our baseline model would henceforth be the one that contains the dummy variable “DUMRES” along with its interaction with the “INTERNET” variable. Moving on to results related to control variables in column (2) of Table  2, we observe that trade policy liberalization and the population size exert no significant effect on the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b> Higher oil prices, lower inflation rate and lower institutional and governance quality induce a rise in the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b> As expected, countries with higher real per capita income (higher development level) tend to mobilize higher share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> compared to less developed countries: this is exemplified by the positive and statistically significant coefficient of the variable capturing the real per capita income. The coefficient associated with the “Trend” variable is negative and statistically significant, therefore suggesting a decline in the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> over time.|$|R

30|$|To examine empirically whether (and if so) how the Internet {{influences}} {{the extent of}} the change in the structure of <b>public</b> <b>revenue,</b> we draw from the conventional literature on the determinants of <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> (e.g., Ghura 1998; Khattry and Rao 2002; Ebrill et al. 1999; Agbeyegbe et al. 2006; Brun et al. 2007, 2015; Baunsgaard and Keen 2010; Thomas and Treviño 2013; Crivelli and Gupta 2014; von Haldenwang and Ivanyna 2017) and particularly Gnangnon and Brun (2018), and Gnangnon (2018). We use a number of structural factors that have been identified as key determinants of countries’ <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> performance. These include the level of development, usually measured by countries’ real per capita income; the degree of trade policy liberalization, the sectoral composition of domestic output, and the demographic characteristic measured for example by the population size. The inflation rate has also been considered as a key policy variable that influences <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b>|$|R
3000|$|... “OILPR” {{represents}} the oil prices (deflated by the US consumer price index). It {{stands for a}} proxy for natural resource prices. We expect a rise in natural resource prices to induce higher resource revenue, to discourage the mobilization of non-resource revenue, and therefore to induce {{a rise in the}} share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b> In this context, higher oil prices could lead governments, including those in developing countries to be inclined to rely on resource revenue as their major source of <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b> However, as resource revenue is not a sustainable source of <b>public</b> <b>revenue,</b> governments that aim to reduce their dependence on natural resource revenue could engage in tax reforms, by moving away from resource revenue to non-resource revenue. In such a scenario, higher oil prices could lead in the medium to long term to a lower ratio of resource revenue to non-resource revenue, and hence to a decline in the ratio of resource <b>revenue</b> to total <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b>|$|R
30|$|Summing up, {{on the one}} hand, {{while the}} Internet could exert a {{positive}} impact on resource revenue, it is likely that its negative impact on resource revenue—due to the enhancement of resource companies tax avoidance strategies—would outweigh the positive impact so that the net impact on resource revenue would be negative. At the same time, the Internet would likely influence positively non-resource revenue. We therefore expect that the Internet would lead to a higher impact on non-resource revenue relative to resource revenue, and hence a negative effect on the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b> In the light of the potential losses of resource revenue that governments could incur, and given the fact that natural resource revenue is not a sustainable source of <b>public</b> <b>revenue,</b> we expect governments to engage in tax reforms, including by using the Internet, to reduce the dependence of its overall <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> on resource revenue. Overall, we expect that the higher access to the Internet would lead to a higher extent of change in the structure of <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> (i.e., a lower resource revenue share of total <b>public</b> <b>revenue),</b> notably through a progressive decline in resource revenue in favour of a rise in non-resource revenue.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the Internet on resource revenue in a sample of 99 countries, including both developed and developing countries, over the period 1995 – 2015 (non-overlapping periods of 3 -years have been used). Based on the two-step system GMM approach, the empirical analysis suggests that over the full sample, the Internet exerts a negative and significant effect on the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b> In other words, the Internet induces a positive extent of the change {{in the structure of the}} overall <b>public</b> <b>revenue,</b> from resource revenue towards non-resource revenue, which is ultimately the most sustainable source of <b>public</b> <b>revenue.</b> These results are confirmed by a negative effect of the Internet on countries’ performance in terms of resource revenue, measured by the resource revenue share of GDP, and a positive effect of the Internet on countries’ performance in terms of non-resource revenue, measured by the non-resource revenue share of GDP. These results are also valid, although with different magnitudes, when we consider {{the impact of}} the Internet on the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> across various sub-samples. More generally, the analysis shows that {{the impact of the}} Internet on the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> depends on countries’ levels of development, proxied by their real per capita income. Specifically, the higher the countries’ development level, the lower is the magnitude of the extent of change in the structure of the total <b>public</b> <b>revenue,</b> from resource revenue to non-resource revenue. This suggests that countries that are less developed experience a higher extent of change in the structure of their overall <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> (resource revenue vs non-resource revenue) than advanced economies. Even though more advanced countries have advantage of changing greatly their <b>public</b> <b>revenue</b> structure toward a higher dependence on non-resource revenue, they still have a higher capacity than less developed countries (and even more so poor countries) to negotiate better contracts with resource-seeking firms. They could additionally use the advantages provided by their high level of access to the Internet (and to the new technologies for information and communication), to collect higher resource revenue despite the fact that MNEs could also use their access to the Internet to escape the payment of resource revenue. Overall, the Internet could be a powerful tool for governments, notably developing countries, and particularly poor countries, to promote the change in the structure of their <b>public</b> <b>revenue,</b> notably from lower reliance on resource revenue at the benefit of a higher dependence on non-resource revenue.|$|R
