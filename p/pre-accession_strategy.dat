40|$|The Cyprus dispute {{accurately}} {{portrays the}} evolution of the conflict from ‘warfare to lawfare’ enriched in politics; this research has proven that the Cyprus problem has been {{and will continue to be}} one of the most judicialised disputes across the globe. Notwithstanding the ‘normalisation’ of affairs between the two ethno-religious groups on the island since the division in 1974, the Republic of Cyprus’ (RoC) European Union (EU) membership in 2004 failed to catalyse reunification and terminate the legal, political and economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community. So the question is; why is it that the powerful legal order of the EU continuously fails to tame the tiny troublesome island of Cyprus? This is a thesis on the interrelationship of the EU legal order and the Cyprus problem. A literal and depoliticised interpretation of EU law has been maintained throughout the EU’s dealings with Cyprus, hence, pre-accession and post-accession. The research has brought to light that this literal interpretation of EU law vis-à-vis Cyprus has in actual fact deepened the division on the island. Pessimists outnumber optimists so far as resolving this problem is concerned, and rightly so if you look back over the last forty years of failed attempts to do just that, a diplomatic combat zone scattered with the bones of numerous mediators. This thesis will discuss how the decisions of the EU institutions, its Member States and specifically of the European Court of Justice, despite conforming to the EU legal order, have managed to disregard the principle of equality on the divided island and thus prevent the promised upgrade of the status of the Turkish Cypriot community since 2004. Indeed, whether a positive or negative reading of the Union’s position towards the Cyprus problem is adopted, the case remains valid for an organisation based on the rule of law to maintain legitimacy, democracy, clarity and equality to the decisions of its institutions. Overall, the aim of this research is to establish a link between the lack of success of the Union to build a bridge over troubled waters and the right of self-determination of the Turkish Cypriot community. The only way left for the EU to help resolve the Cyprus problem is to aim to broker a deal between the two Cypriot communities which will permit the recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) or at least the ‘Taiwanisation’ of Northern Cyprus. Albeit, there are many studies that address the impact of the EU on the conflict or the RoC, which represents the government that has monopolised EU accession, the argument advanced in this thesis is that despite the alleged Europeanisation of the Turkish Cypriot community, they are habitually disregarded because of the EU’s current legal framework and the Union’s lack of conflict transformation strategy vis-à-vis the island. Since the self-declared TRNC is not recognised and EU law is suspended in northern Cyprus in accordance with Protocol No 10 on Cyprus of the Act of Accession 2003, the Turkish-Cypriots represent an idiomatic partner of Brussels but the relations between the two resemble the experience of EU enlargement: the EU’s relevance to the community has been based on the prospects for EU accession (via reunification) and assistance towards preparation for potential EU integration through financial and technical aid. Undeniably, the <b>pre-accession</b> and postaccession <b>strategy</b> of Brussels in Cyprus has worsened the Cyprus problem and hindered the peace process. The time has come for the international community to formally acknowledge the existence of the TRNC...|$|R

50|$|Even before {{accession}} negotiations began in June 1993, {{during a meeting}} of the European Council in Copenhagen, the EU Member States officially confirmed that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, currently affiliated with the EC, will join the EU after fulfilling economic and political criteria. On 8 April 1994, the Government of the Republic of Poland made a formal request, in Athens, for membership in the European Union. During the European Council summit held in Essen on 9-10 December 1994, Member States adopted a <b>pre-accession</b> <b>strategy,</b> defining the areas and forms of cooperation recognized by the EU as essential to speed up integration. This process also confirmed that the EU was willing to go through with enlargement to associated countries. Formal confirmation of the strategy outlined in the White Paper (on the alignment of countries with the requirements of the internal free-market) which was adopted at the European Council Summit in Cannes in June 1995. The White Paper, and the annual preparatory programs adopted by the Polish government, determined the framework and the relations of Poland with the EU. On 3 October 1996, under the resolution passed by the Council of Ministers on 26 January 1991, the Office for European Integration came into force with its purpose to coordinate and assist all ministries and institutions directly involved in the process of Polish integration with the European Union. The primary role of the Office for European Integration was to ensure the implementation of the tasks related to coordinating policies on matters related to the integration of Poland into the European Union. Additionally, it was responsible for coordination of measures for the adaptation of Poland to meet European standards, as well as managing the foreign aid that Poland received from the European Union.|$|E

The paper argues that although the mechanisms of Europeanisation identified for the Central and Eastern European countries are useful for understanding the EU’s external influence, they are not sufficient for fully deconstructing the avenues of external leverage. The key to understanding the Europeanisation of the Western Balkans is to take policy-related conditionality into account in addition to membership conditionality.

40|$|The {{study is}} {{analysing}} the Europeanisation of employment policy in Central and Eastern Europe {{in the process}} of preparing for accession to the European Union, focussing in particular on the example of the Czech Republic. It thereby uses an extended policy analysis based on the theoretical background provided by the Europeanisation approach. After explaining the structure and characteristics of the European employment policy area, the thesis is specifying the employment policy problems of transformation countries and is then concentrating on the Czech situation. The mechanisms and effects of Europeanisation of the Czech employment policy between 1998 and 2004 are studied in detail, comparing three Europeanisation processes concerning the transposition of labour directives, the preparation for participation in the European Employment Strategy (EES) and the preparation for participation in the European Social Fund (ESF). The main theoretical contribution of the thesis concerns the development and test of a conceptual framework for comparing different types of Europeanisation processes connected to different types of EU policy instruments (namely directives, the Open Method of Coordination, and ESF regulations). It is assumed, that the different instruments comprise different modes of implementing these policies in the Member (and accession) states. Certain types of Europeanisation mechanisms identified in the literature, namely institutional, structural and cognitive Europeanisation, are more likely to dominate the adaptation processes in one case or another, and therefore also the the relevance of influencing factors like institutional misfit, national actor constellations and individual actors’ positions is varying according to the type of policy to be implemented. Specifically, institutional misfit should be most relevant in cases where national decision making processes do not {{play a major role in}} the implementation process (i. e. in the case of directly binding EU law such as regulations). In all other cases, the structure of the national policy arena is more relevant for the Europeanisation processes and outputs, such as in particular with the transposition of EU directives. Cognitive Europeanisation processes and therefore the (change of) positions of (dominant) political actors are expected to play a particular strong role in the case of implementing non-binding EU soft law. For the accession countries modifications of these adaptation mechanisms due to the specific <b>pre-accession</b> <b>strategy</b> (“conditionality regime”) of the EU have to be considered, too. Empirically, the study is based on a literature review, analyses of documents and 19 expert interviews. The empirical part starts with an analysis of the situation of the Czech employment policy before the beginning of the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>strategy</b> of the EU in 1998. It then explains the adaptation processes in the framework of the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>strategy</b> and traces them in detail for the three areas to be compared. The results show, that in the case of the transposition of EU labour directives, which were in the core of the EU’s conditionality regime, institutional Europeanisation mechanisms played a major role. Also in the case of adaptation to the ESF institutional mechanisms were dominating, whereas in the case of preparation for the EES, cognitive Europeanisation was of greatest importance. Nevertheless, some structural effects can be observed, too, in particular the empowerment of certain national actors such as the social partners and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pre-accession</b> <b>strategy,</b> by {{challenging}} national sovereignty, erodes {{motivations for}} EU {{membership in the}} candidate countries, hence arising nationalistic reactions. Euroscepticism manifests itself in various forms depending {{on the way the}} country undergoes the transition, the domestic meaning of the accession and the country-specific patterns of euroscepticism. The Central and Eastern European countries mostly display great motivations for accession. The gap between expectations and the EU's functioning feed public euroscepticism. Mainstream party consensus however, often filters euroscepticism. Turkey distinguishes by an overall mistrust at both public and party level. The EU's reform demands and the European reluctance for Turkish accession have generated mistrust, focusing the 'EU debate' on the cost of accession. At public level, mistrust has fed the idea of an 'EU threat' around which the different spheres of the society have come together to oppose EU membership. At party level, mistrust caused parties from fully embracing the EU prospective, which the 2002 elections exemplify.

40|$|The time is {{not only}} ripe but {{pressing}} for the EU and {{the states of the}} Western Balkans to recalibrate and reinforce the current <b>pre-accession</b> <b>strategy.</b> Trade policy should be moved beyond existing free trade commitments for all the Western Balkans to enter the customs union of the EU and Turkey. Eurozone doctrine should be adapted to realities. Rather than regarding the use of the euro by Montenegro and Kosovo as an unfortunate turn of events, {{the costs and benefits of}} unilateral adoption of the euro by not-yet member states of the region should be more openly appraised, and the option to ‘euroise’ recognised as a possibility. It is good that the EU has moved at the declaratory level towards visa ‘liberalisation’, which means scrapping visas rather than just ‘facilitation’ measures. However the Commission has not yet published guidelines or timelines for this. The region should be put on track for access to the Structural Funds on terms and scales progressively approaching those from which new member states such as Bulgaria and Romania already benefit. The ratio of these aid receipts between the new member states and the Western Balkans is currently 4 : 1; the former are receiving more than they can handle efficiently, whereas the Western Balkans have huge unsatisfied needs.

40|$|Ten Central and East European {{countries}} {{applied for}} EU membership between 1994 and 1996. All ten signed association ‘Europe’ {{agreements with the}} EU and all were participants in the EU’s <b>pre-accession</b> <b>strategy</b> to help them prepare for eventual membership. Enlargement was conditional on the applicant state meeting certain political and economic conditions set out at the 1992 Copenhagen European Council. These included three political criteria: stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities; adherence to the objective of political union; and maintaining the momentum of integration. The economic criteria are similarly divided into three: {{the existence of a}} functioning market economy; capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the EU; and adherence to the aim of economic and monetary union. There was much debate on the appropriate speed of the enlargement process. It was evident that not all applicant countries would meet the conditions at the same time. It was therefore assumed that enlargement would take place in ‘waves’, with some countries proceeding faster than others. The book aims at addressing the question of how, when, and with whom enlargement should proceed. This involves identifying criteria to be used, which could help in deciding whether countries are ready to join. The book assesses the consequences of enlargement in stages for the EU budget, trade, agricultural trade, firms in countries left out of the enlargement process, foreign direct investment, growth, the location of industry, labour markets and foreign relations.

40|$|The {{external}} {{policies of}} the European Union {{may be viewed as}} the outcome of the interaction between the Member States, the European Community (acting {{in the context of the}} ‘first pillar’) and the European Union (acting on the basis of the second and third pillars). This tripartite interaction, which involves a large number of actors operating within different institutional logics, makes it challenging for the Union to conduct coherent policies, or to fulfil its objective of affirming its identity on the world stage (Article 2 TEU). The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is a particularly developed expression of a policy designed to meet the challenge of ensuring coherence between the three EU pillars. As an alternative mechanism designed to offer coherent policy-making in the cross-pillar context of relations with the EU’s strategically important neighbours, the ENP does not rely on new instruments but rather offers a way of integrating existing instruments via ‘soft’ frameworks, such as European Council and Council Conclusions and Commission policy papers. This paper aims to analyse the ENP as a contribution to the EU’s efforts to evolve a more coherent external action. Ukraine will serve as an example, as the advanced implementation of the ENP towards this country offers the best illustration of the policy, in both its potential and its shortcomings. It will demonstrate that the ENP is a cross-pillar security policy, which draws heavily on the specific methodology developed within the framework of the EU <b>pre-accession</b> <b>strategy.</b> It will be argued that while this new formula of external action carries the potential of fostering the coherence of EU external action, its effectiveness, in policy terms, may be hampered by several inherent paradoxes and tension...|$|E
