Targeted for a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) role, the 24th Division was reorganized as a mechanized division in 1979.

5|$|The {{station was}} not {{originally}} proposed as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> for Action in 1968, but a later revision to that plan entailed building a Second Avenue Subway {{with one of}} its stops located at 72nd Street. Construction on that project started in 1972, but stalled in 1975 {{due to lack of}} funding. In 2007, a separate measure authorized a first phase of the Second Avenue Line to be built between 65th and 105th Streets, with stations at 72nd, 86th, and 96th Streets. The station opened on January 1, 2017, with provisions to extend the line south to Houston Street in Phase 3. Since opening, the presence of the Second Avenue Subway's three Phase 1 stations has improved real estate prices along the corridor.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to JFK Airport {{had been}} proposed since 1968 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> for Action, {{but was not}} actually implemented for almost three decades. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, various plans surfaced to try to build such a link. Meanwhile, the JFK Express subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. There were 21 failed proposals for rail links to New York City airports during this time. Serious planning for a dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990. An environmental impact statement for a JFK light-rail system was released in 1997, and the current people-mover system started construction a year later. AirTrain JFK opened on December 17, 2003, despite being the subject of several lawsuits during construction and a death {{during one of the}} system's test runs.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, a government-endorsed {{disaster}} relief program was initiated {{to mitigate the}} developing humanitarian crisis in the three hardest-hit communes. The program was to distribute emergency food rations to 40,000 affected individuals, with special supplies intended to reach 1,500 malnourished children. A malnutrition rehabilitation center was established in Mahavelona as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> which cost approximately $1.2 million (1996 USD) in total, and funded partially by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA). At the end of February, the Government of Madagascar requested international aid; by March 6, France and Germany had donated a combined $100,000 in assistance funds, as well as emergency supplies worth nearly $80,000. Overall, the DHA handled roughly $450,000 in foreign donations, mostly from Europe. United States Ambassador to Madagascar, Vicki J. Huddleston, authorized the allocation of $25,000 to distribute tarps, while the United States Agency for International Development sent $17,000 for medical treatment.|$|E

5|$|The {{encryption}} {{resembles the}} RSA algorithm. This algorithm encodes data in 3-byte blocks. First, the each byte is permuted through an 8-position permutation, then the bits are {{split into two}} 12-bit integers (by taking the low 4 bits of the second byte and the 8 bits of the first byte as the first 12-bit integer, and the 8 bits of the third byte and the 4 high bits of the second integer as the second 12-bit integer). Each is individually encrypted by taking them to the 3491st power, mod 4097; the bits are then reassembled into 3 bytes. The encrypted text is then stored in a string variable as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> To shroud the would be visible and noticeable text it is compressed with the simple Lzw before final storage. As the Macintosh Common Lisp compiler compresses the main program code into the executable, this was not that necessary.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Program slicing is a {{technique}} for simplifying programs by focusing on selected aspects <b>of</b> semantics. <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> slicing deletes those <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> which can be determined to have no effect upon <b>the</b> semantics <b>of</b> interest. Slicing has applications in testing and debugging, re-engineering, program comprehension and software measurement. For example, in debugging, there is little point in the (human) debugger analysing sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source code which cannot have caused the bug. Slicing avoids this by removing these <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> focusing attention on those <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> which may contain a fault. This article reviews three semantic paradigms for slicing: static, dynamic and conditioned and two syntactic paradigms: syntax-preserving and amorphous. Slicing {{has been applied to}} many software development problems including testing, reuse, maintenance and evolution. This paper describes <b>the</b> main forms <b>of</b> <b>program</b> slice and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applicat...|$|R
40|$|When a {{previously}} tested program is modified, {{it is necessary}} to test <b>the</b> modified <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> and also retest other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> that have been affected by the change. The challenge is in identifying <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> affected by <b>the</b> changes in an efficient manner. We adress <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> identifying <b>the</b> affected def-use associations in <b>the</b> modified <b>program.</b> We use <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> path vectors previously proposed by Bharadwaj et al. for scheduling, and adapt it for <b>the</b> detection <b>of</b> defuse associations that are affected by the change. <b>The</b> advantage <b>of</b> our approach over other techniques is that it involves computing the required partial data flow information only once given <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> changes in an appropriate form. The computation is driven by <b>the</b> <b>program</b> changes. A second advantage is that our approach does not require the data flow history of previous versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> to detect <b>the</b> affected def-use associations...|$|R
