50|$|<b>Pressure-controlled</b> {{intermittent}} coronary sinus occlusion (also {{known as}} PICSO), is a procedure utilized to enhance restoration of {{blood flow to}} the microcirculation in heart tissue following a myocardial infarction. PICSO has a dual therapeutic potential first for myocardial salvage and second for tissue regeneration. In a meta-analysis of preclinical studies a significant reduction of infarct size of about 30% as compared to controls was observed.

50|$|The process {{consists}} of first placing the metal {{in an airtight}} vessel, called a retort. The metal is then encircled by a blend of aluminum powders. The retort is then closed {{and placed in a}} <b>pressure-controlled</b> kiln. At the elevated temperatures (typically greater than 300⁰C, usually between 700 and 1100⁰C) of the kiln, the aluminum is in its liquid phase and diffuses into the surface of the metal and forms an alloy with the substrate. This alloy usually contains a minimum of 20 percent aluminum. Conventional case depth for carbon and alloy steel is 0.0127-0.0508 centimeters, and for stainless and nickel base alloys is 0.00508-0.0254 centimeters.|$|E
50|$|A {{spray booth}} is a <b>pressure-controlled</b> closed environment, {{originally}} used to paint vehicles {{in a body}} shop. To ensure the ideal working conditions (temperature, air flow, and humidity), these environments are equipped with ventilation, consisting of mechanical fans driven by electric motors, and optionally burners to heat the air to speed paint drying. Toxic solvents and paint particles are exhausted outside, possibly after filtering and treatment to reduce air pollution. Prevention of fires and dust explosions is also a high priority. In order {{to assist in the}} removal of the over sprayed paint from the air and to provide efficient operation of the down-draft, water-washed paint spray booths utilize paint detackifying chemical agents.|$|E
50|$|Reed {{instruments}} such as {{the clarinet}} or oboe have a flexible reed or reeds at the mouthpiece, forming a <b>pressure-controlled</b> valve. An increase in pressure inside the chamber will decrease the pressure differential across the reed; the reed will open more, increasing the flow of air.The increased flow of air will increase the internal pressure further, so a pulse of high pressure arriving at the mouthpiece will reflect as a higher-pressure pulse back down the tube. Standing waves inside the tube will be odd multiples of a quarter-wavelength, with a pressure anti-node at the mouthpiece, and a pressure node at the open end. The reed vibrates at a rate determined by the resonator.|$|E
50|$|Mohl invented <b>Pressure-controlled</b> {{intermittent}} coronary sinus occlusion (also {{known as}} PICSO), a procedure utilized to enhance restoration of {{blood flow to}} the microcirculation in heart tissue following a myocardial infarction. PICSO has a dual therapeutic potential first for myocardial salvage and second for tissue regeneration. He {{is the author of the}} embryonic recalll hypothesis which offers an explanation on the mode of action on the molecular effects of PICSO. In a meta-analysis of preclinical studies a significant reduction of infarct size of about 30% as compared to controls was observed.

This was confirmed by an event free survival of patients indicating a significant risk reduction for reinfarction.|$|E
50|$|The {{first few}} breaths are {{delivered}} to the patient according to the ventilator manufacturer's particular algorithm for determining the patient's resistance and compliance. These are 'test breaths' that the ventilator can then use to calculate the optimal pressures for the next, regulated breaths. The pressure is constant during the set inspiratory time as with <b>pressure-controlled</b> CMV. The ventilator will use the exhaled tidal volume measured {{at the end of}} that breath's expiratory phase to calculate the pressure of the next breath. If the exhaled tidal volume is lower than the software threshold, the next breath will be delivered at a higher pressure, and if the exhaled tidal volume is higher than the software threshold, the next breath will be delivered at a lower pressure.|$|E
50|$|PCI {{is used in}} {{coronary}} heart disease to effectively restore perfusion. In (acute coronary syndromes) (primary percutaneous coronary intervention) restores blood flow in occluded or obstructed coronary arteries according to Braunwald's theorem: time is muscle. Flow in major epicardial coronary arteries however does not mean to increase myocardial blood flow leaving obstructed microcirculation without nutritive flow. Nowadays obstructed microcirculation can effectively cleared by <b>pressure-controlled</b> intermittent coronary sinus occlusion (PICSO) redistributing flow into deprived zones of the myocardium and increasing washout clearing no reflow zones in the myocardium. This treatment, a transcoronary sinus intervention which temporarily occludes the major outflow vein (cardiac vein) by automatically intermittent balloon pressure increase by observing the pressure in the occluded vein redistributes blood flow into affected heart tissue thereby improving microcirculation. PICSO also shows the potential for myocardial salvage and for tissue regeneration.|$|E
50|$|Hydrostatic gauges (such as {{the mercury}} column manometer) {{consist of a}} {{vertical}} column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube. The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube, one side of which {{is connected to the}} region of interest. Any fluid can be used, but mercury is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr (100 Pa) to above atmospheric. An important variation is the McLeod gauge which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10−6 torr (0.1 mPa), which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other <b>pressure-controlled</b> properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{finishing}} processes are pressure or force controlled, as against the surface or cylindrical grinding processes which are displacement controlled. In all cases, the process leaves its signature on the surface. Classical examples of <b>pressure-controlled</b> finishing processes are honing, lapping and super-finishing. In {{the last few}} decades, attention of researchers has turned towards non-traditional methods of finishing the surfaces. One such process is magneto-rheological abrasive finishing in which abrasive mixed with magneto-rheological (MR) fluid is used. Kordonski and Jacobs (1996) developed a setup in which magnetically stiffened magneto-rheological fluid mixed with abrasives is made to flow over a moving flat rigid wall and the polishing happens at a converging gap formed by the surface to be finished and a moving wall. Now it finds an interesting industrial application in polishing of optical lenses. The major advantage is that the abrasive medium exhibits higher yield strength when subjected to increased magnetic field. Apart from the ways of introducing the abrasive mixed MR fluid, the relative motions between the work piece and abrasive medium are imparted in different ways; using reciprocation, rotation or combination of both. Reciprocation motion has been employed in magneto-rheological abrasive finishing by Jha and Jain (2004). Seok, et al. (2007) employed MR fluid alone for the fabrication and finishing of curved silicon-based micro-structures. While Sadiq and Shunmugam (2009a,b) used both reciprocation and rotation, Dass et al. (2010) later investigated the process with rotary motion imparted to the abrasive medium by rotating magnetic field. In general, researchers working with MR fluid based finishing processes have studied the improvement in surface finish with process variables such as abrasive size, abrasive concentration, magnetic strength, reciprocation speed, rotational speed and processing time, taking work pieces with different initial roughness. Many results have been published mainly on surface finish improvements in terms of Ra and subsequently the study has been extended to include Rmax, Rz , etc. It {{is interesting to note}} that these parameters, characterizing the profile in the height direction, are derived from the same profile and hence are correlated. These roughness parameters do not reveal the nature of the profile and the changes happening to it with time for a given set of process parameters. Studies on material removal during the magneto-rheological abrasive finishing have also been reported. The metal removal is measured by weighing the work piece before and after processing.|$|E

30|$|Under the {{assumption}} that the maximum airway pressure (Pmax) during <b>pressure-controlled</b> assist modes of invasive mechanical ventilatory support is similar to Pplat during volume-controlled assist modes [21, 22], Pmax was defined as Pmax in <b>pressure-controlled</b> assist modes and plateau pressure in volume-controlled assist modes, when available. Also, ΔP was calculated by subtracting PEEP from Pmax during <b>pressure-controlled</b> and volume-controlled ventilation, respectively. This, however, was only done when set and measured respiratory rates were equal, indicating the absence of spontaneous breathing.|$|E
40|$|M. Cur. Nursing {{practitioners}} {{working in}} the critical care unit are responsible for quality nursing care of the patient on <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation. <b>Pressure-controlled</b> ventilation is a high-risk interaction, with potential life-threatening complications, for example barotrauma. There are, however, in the South-African context no standards for <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation with which quality nursing of the patient on <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation can be evaluated. The following question is then asked in this study: Which standards should be formulated for the adult patient on <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation incritical care units? The goal {{of this study is}} then to formulate standards for the adult patient on <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation in critical care units. An explorative, descriptive and modified standard-generating research design is followed in this study. The research methodology as suggested by Muller (1998 a: 606 - 609; 1998 b: 636 - 637) for standard development during the quality improvement process is used in this study. Standard formulation consists out of three phases, namely a development phase, a quantifying-/ validation phase and a testing phase. During the development phase of this study, a literature study is conducted after which concept standards for the adult patient on <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation in critical care units are formulated. During the validation phase of this study, the concept standards are validated by means of a consensus debate session with clinical domain experts. Seventeen standards in total were formulated. Standard one to fifteen are structure standards. These standards address the ethico-legal, philosophical and management framework according to which the nurse practitioner functions during the nursing of the adult patient on pressure controlled ventilation in critical care units. It also includes the fascilitating context, as well as facilities, equipment, stock and medication, procedures and protocols and aspect of personnel development necessary to nurse the patient on <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation. Lastly in this group of standards the knowledge and skills which the critical care nurse requires for nursing the patient on pressurecontrolled ventilation are described. Standard sixteen is the process standard for nursing the patient on <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation. This standard is described as one comprehensive standard to facilitate easy use in practice and to address the nursing process holistically. Standard seventeen can be described as the outcome standard for the nursing of the adult patient on <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation and describes the expected aspects of quality improvement...|$|E

Treatment of choice, especially the best form of ventilation, {{is not well}} known. Objectives: This study compared the effects of <b>pressure-controlled</b> (spontaneous timed [ST]) non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and NIV with intelligent volume-assured pressure support (IVAPS) in chronic hypercapnic COPD patients regarding the effects on alveolar ventilation, adverse patient/ventilator interactions and sleep quality. Methods: This prospective, single-center, crossover study randomized patients to one night of NIV using ST then one night with the IVAPS function activated, or vice versa. Patients were monitored using polysomnography (PSG) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure (PtcCO 2) measurement. Patients rated their subjective experience (total score, 0 – 45; lower scores indicate better acceptability). Results: Fourteen patients were included (4 females, age 59. 4 ± 8. 9 years). The total number of respiratory events was low, and similar under <b>pressure-controlled</b> (5. 4 ± 6. 7) and IVAPS (8. 3 ± 10. 2) conditions (P= 0. 064). There were also no clinically relevant differences in PtcCO 2 between <b>pressure-controlled</b> and IVAPS NIV (52. 9 ± 6. 2 versus 49. 1 ± 6. 4 mmHg). Respiratory rate was lower under IVAPS overall; between-group differences reached statistical significance during wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement sleep. Ventilation pressures were 2. 6 cmH 2 O higher under IVAPS versus <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation, resulting in a 20. 1 mL increase in breathing volume. Sleep efficiency was slightly higher under <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation versus IVAPS. Respiratory arousals were uncommon (24. 4 /h [pressure-controlled] versus 25. 4 /h [IVAPS]). Overall patient assessment scores were similar, {{although there was a}} trend toward less discomfort during IVAPS. Conclusion: Our results show that IVAPS NIV allows application of higher nocturnal ventilation pressures versus ST without affecting sleep quality or inducing ventilation-associated events.

40|$|Discogenic pain is {{a leading}} cause of chronic low back pain. The authors {{investigated}} the efficacy of <b>pressure-controlled</b> discography to determine its role in clinical decision-making for the management of patients with discogenic pain. <b>Pressure-controlled</b> discography was performed in 21 patients (51 discs) with pain-provocation, followed by post-discography computerized tomography scans. Pain response was classified as positive response and negative response, and measured with visual analog scale scores. Discographic findings were graded by the modified Dallas discogram scale. Elastance, pain provocation on intradiscal pressure, pressure and volume of initial pain response, and pain response intensity were statistically analyzed. Elastance showed significant differences between Grade 0 and Grade 4 & 5. Decreased elastance with positive pain response group was a good indicator to imply that disc degeneration presumably is a pain generator. Results of pain response were well correlated with intradiscal pressure but not with the amount of injected volume. Among 31 discs of Grade 4 and 5, 74 % showed negative pain response and 26 % showed positive response. It was concluded that <b>pressure-controlled</b> discography was useful to diagnose discogenic pain and excellent guide in decision-making for spinal operations...|$|E
40|$|To explore whether 1) {{conventional}} pressure support ventilation improves {{lung function}} and attenuates the pulmonary inflammatory response compared to <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation and 2) random variation of pressure support levels (noisy pressure support ventilation) adds further beneficial effects to pressure support ventilation. DESIGN: Three-arm, randomized, experimental study. SETTING: University hospital research facility. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four juvenile pigs. INTERVENTIONS: Acute lung injury was induced by surfactant depletion. Animals {{were randomly assigned}} to 6 hrs of mechanical ventilation (n = 8 per group) with either 1) <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation, 2) pressure support ventilation, or 3) noisy pressure support ventilation. During noisy pressure support ventilation, the pressure support varied randomly, with values following a normal distribution. In all groups, the driving pressures were set to achieve a mean tidal volume of 6 mL/kg. At the end of experiments, animals were killed and lungs extracted for histologic and biochemical analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Respiratory, gas-exchange, and hemodynamics variables were assessed hourly. The diffuse alveolar damage and the inflammatory response of lungs were quantified. Pressure support ventilation and noisy pressure support ventilation improved gas exchange and were associated with reduced histologic damage and interleukin- 6 concentrations in lung tissue compared to <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation. Noisy pressure support ventilation further improved gas exchange and decreased the inspiratory effort while reducing alveolar edema and inflammatory infiltration compared to pressure support ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In this model of acute lung injury, pressure support ventilation and noisy pressure support ventilation attenuated pulmonary inflammatory response and improved gas exchange as compared to <b>pressure-controlled</b> ventilation. Noisy pressure support ventilation further improved gas exchange, reduced the inspiratory effort, and attenuated alveolar edema and inflammatory infiltration as compared to conventional pressure support ventilation...|$|E
