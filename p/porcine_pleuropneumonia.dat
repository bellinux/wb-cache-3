50|$|Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (previously Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae), is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, {{respiratory}} pathogen {{found in}} pigs. It was first reported in 1957, and was formally declared {{to be the}} causative agent of <b>porcine</b> <b>pleuropneumonia</b> in 1964. It was reclassified in 1983 after DNA studies showed it was {{more closely related to}} A. lignieresii.|$|E
50|$|A. pleuropneumoniae {{was found}} to be the causative agent for up to 20% of all {{bacterial}} pneumonia cases in swine. The main disease associated with this bacterium is <b>porcine</b> <b>pleuropneumonia,</b> a highly contagious respiratory disease, affecting primarily young pigs (usually less than 6 months). All of the symptoms and signs of <b>porcine</b> <b>pleuropneumonia</b> can be attributed to its virulence factors. The symptoms include respiratory distress, bloodstained discharge (usually frothy) from the mouth, fever, anorexia, mild diarrhea, cyanosis, lethargy, and spontaneous abortion in sows. The most common sign for a pig farmer is the sudden death of several pigs over a short period of time. Peak mortality is usually reached when pigs are 10-16 weeks old. It is not uncommon for mortality rates to reach 20-80% in fattening pigs, with similarly high morbidity. Pigs that do survive the disease remain as carriers and spread the bacterium to other swine. Several bacterial combinations are seen in vivo, the most common simultaneous infection being Pasteurella multocida. Treatment must be immediate and continuous. Antibiotics used include ceftiofur, tetracycline, synthetic penicillins, tylosin, and sulfonamides.|$|E
40|$|<b>Porcine</b> {{contagious}} <b>pleuropneumonia,</b> caused byActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, has a {{major impact}} on economics, ecology, and animal welfare in the pig-rearing industry. Propionibacterium acnes, a facultative anaerobic Gram-positive corynebacte-rium, exists widely in normal healthy adult animals. We have shown previously that P. acnes can prevent A. pleuropneumoniae infections in mice and pigs. To elucidate the mechanism of this effect and to identify novel A. pleuropneumoniae vaccines, the role of anti-P. acnes antibodies in preventing infection was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence and opsonophagocytosis assays in vitro. The role of the specific humoral immune response induced by P. acnes was confirmed in a B cell depletion mouse model. The survival rates of mice challenged with A. pleuropneumoniae exhibited a highly significant positive rank correlation with the levels of anti-P. acnes antibodies. The specific antibodies induced by P. acnes had the ability to combine with A. pleuro-pneumoniae and increase opsonization of A. pleuropneumoniae for phagocytosis. Furthermore, analysis in the murine B cell depletion model confirmed that the humoral immune response induced by P. acnes {{played an important role in}} resistance to A. pleuropneumoniae infection. In this study, we further elucidated the reasons that P. acnes can prevent A. pleuropneumoniae infection, which provides useful evidence for the development of heterologous vaccines for the control of <b>porcine</b> contagious <b>pleuropneumonia.</b> <b>Porcine</b> contagious <b>pleuropneumonia</b> is a highly contagiousand fatal respiratory infectious disease, and the mortality of the most acute cases often reaches 80 to 100 % (1).

40|$|Contagious <b>porcine</b> <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> {{is caused}} by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The agent is able {{to adhere to the}} {{epithelium}} of the lower respiratory tract and lung alveoli.

Transferrin binding proteins mediate the uptake of iron by this bacterium, which is necessary for its multiplication. The typical hemorrhagic to necrotizing lesions in the lungs are primarily caused by the production of Apx toxins. By forming biofilms and producing proteases, Apx toxins and ammonia, A. pleuropneumoniae is able to circumvent the immune system of the host. Antibodies directed against the lipoprotein PalA may aggravate the course of infection, and counteract the protective effect of antibodies targeting the Apx toxins. In-depth knowledge on host-pathogen interactions may lead to the development of efficient vaccines. The protection observed after vaccination with bacterins, such as autologous vaccines, is serotype-specific and variable. This may be attributed to variable levels of PalA in these vaccines. Until now, the best results have been obtained using an experimental vaccine containing type IV fimbriae, transferrin binding proteins and Apx toxins...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} <b>porcine</b> <b>pleuropneumonia.</b> The virulence of the fifteen serotypes of App is mainly {{determined by the}} three major RTX toxins ApxI, ApxII and ApxIII, which are secreted by the different serotypes in various combinations. A fourth RTX toxin, ApxIV, is produced by all 15 serotypes specifically during infection of pigs, but not under in vitro conditions. Pigs infected with App show specific antibodies directed against ApxIV. The analysis of sera of experimentally infected pigs revealed that ApxIV-immunoblots detected App infections in the second to third week post infection. We developed an indirect ELISA based on purified recombinant N’-terminal moiety of ApxIV that showed a specificity of 100 % and a sensitivity of 93. 8 %.

Swine that have been inoculated subcutaneously are rendered solidly immune to infection with H. pleuropneumoniae intranasally. The marked pathogenicity of H. pleuropneumoniae for swine has been contrasted with the lack of pathogenicity of another swine Hemophilus, H. influenzae suis.

40|$|Blood gas and {{hematological}} {{responses to}} acute, mild Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection of growing pigs was studied. Six pigs (average weight 10. 1 kg) were experimentally infected intranasally with A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5. Four pigs served as controls. Rectal temperatures and arterial blood for gas analysis and hematology were taken at 0, 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h postinfection. All infected pigs became febrile showing clinical signs typical of {{mild to moderate}} porcine pleuropneumonia; controls remained asymptomatic. Neutrophilia with bands and lymphopenia were observed only in infected pigs. Arterial partial pressures of O 2 and CO 2, and pH did not change in infected pigs.

TolC, {{a key component of}} multidrug efflux pumps, are responsible for multidrug resistance in many Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we identified two TolC-like proteins, TolC 1 and TolC 2, in A. pleuropneumoniae. Deletion of tolC 1, but not tolC 2, caused a significant reduction in biofilm formation, as well as increased drug sensitivity of both planktonic and biofilm cells. The genetic-complementation of the tolC 1 mutation restored the competent biofilm and drug resistance. Besides, biofilm formation was inhibited and drug sensitivity was increased by the addition of phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide (PAβN), a well-known efflux pump inhibitor (EPI), suggesting a role for EPI in antibacterial strategies towards drug tolerance of A. pleuropneumoniae.

Immunization of pigs with recombinant ApfA alone induced high levels of specific serum antibodies and provided partial protection against challenge with the heterologous A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 9 strain. This protection was higher than that engendered by vaccination with rApxIVA or rTbpB alone and similar to that observed after immunization with the tri-antigen combination of rApxIA, rApxIIA and rApxIIIA. In addition, rApfA improved the vaccination potential of the penta-antigen mixture of rApxIA, rApxIIA, rApxIIIA, rApxIVA and rTbpB proteins, where the hexa-antigen vaccine containing rApfA conferred a high level of protection on pigs against the disease. Moreover, when rApfA was used for vaccination alone or in combination with other antigens, such immunization reduced the number of pigs colonized with the challenge strain.

The virulent isolate of H. pleuropneumoniae had a distinct, adherent capsule. The avirulent isolate had a fragile, easily removed capsule. Capsular material (CM) and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were isolated from each bacterial isolate and were compared biochemically and biologically. CM from both isolates contained carbohydrates, no detectable protein, and no detectable to trace amounts of lipid A. Each LPS contained heptose, hexose, galactose, glucosamine, 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate, and lipid A. Biological responses to CM and LPS from both isolates were demonstrated in the proclotting enzyme of Limulus polyphemus amebocyte lysate activation and in serological cross-reactions by immunofluorescence and immunodiffusion precipitation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative {{bacterial}} {{agent of}} <b>porcine</b> <b>pleuropneumonia,</b> produces Apx toxins which belong to RTX toxin family and {{are recognized as}} the major virulence factors. So far, their target receptor(s) has not been identified and the disease cytopathogenesis remains poorly understood. Production of an active Apx toxin and characterization of its toxic activity constitute the premises necessary to the description of its interaction with a potential receptor. From this point of view, we produced an active recombinant ApxIIIA toxin in order to characterize its toxicity on peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) isolated from several species. FINDINGS: Toxin preparation exercises a strong cytotoxic action on porcine PBMCs which {{is directly related to}} recombinant ApxIIIA since preincubation with polymyxin B does not modify the cytotoxicity rate while preincubation with a monospecific polyclonal antiserum directed against ApxIIIA does. The cell death process triggered by ApxIIIA is extremely fast, the maximum rate of toxicity being already reached after 20 minutes of incubation. Moreover, ApxIIIA cytotoxicity is species-specific because llama, human, dog, rat and mouse PBMCs are resistant. Interestingly, bovine and caprine PBMCs are slightly sensitive to ApxIIIA toxin too. Finally, ApxIIIA cytotoxicity is cell type-specific as porcine epithelial cells are resistant. CONCLUSION: We have produced an active recombinant ApxIIIA toxin and characterized its specific cytotoxicity on porcine PBMCs which will allow us to get new insights on <b>porcine</b> <b>pleuropneumonia</b> pathogenesis in the future.

TolC, the key component of multidrug efflux pumps and type I secretion systems, has been well-studied as an exit duct for numerous substances in many Gram-negative bacteria. By contrast, little is known on the role of TolC in biofilm formation. In this study, a ΔtolC mutant was used to examine the importance of TolC in biofilm formation of A. pleuropneumoniae. Surface attachment assays demonstrated the essential role of TolC in initial attachment of biofilm cells. The loss of TolC function altered surface hydrophobicity, and resulted in greatly reduced autoaggregation in ΔtolC. Using both enzymatic treatments and confocal microscopy, biofilm composition and architecture were characterized. When compared against the wild-type strain, the poly-β- 1, 6 -N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PGA), an important biofilm matrix component of A. pleuropneumoniae, was significantly reduced at the initial attachment stage in ΔtolC. These results were confirmed by mRNA level using quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally, defective secretion systems in ΔtolC may also contribute to the deficiency in biofilm formation. Taken together, the current study demonstrated the importance of TolC in the initial biofilm formation stage in A. pleuropneumoniae. These findings could have important clinical implications in developing new treatments against biofilm-related infections by A. pleuropneumoniae...|$|R
40|$|The Gram-negative {{bacterium}} Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the {{etiologic agent}} of <b>porcine</b> contagious <b>pleuropneumoniae,</b> a lethal respiratory infectious disease causing great economic {{losses in the}} swine industry worldwide. In order to better interpret the genetic background of serotypic diversity, nine genomes of A. pleuropneumoniae reference strains of serovars 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 were sequenced by using rapid high-throughput approach. Based on 12 genomes of corresponding serovar reference strains including three publicly available complete genomes (serovars 3, 5 b, and 7) of this bacterium, we performed a comprehensive analysis of comparative genomics and first reported a global genomic characterization for this pathogen. Clustering of 26, 012 predicted protein-coding genes showed that the pan genome of A. pleuropneumoniae consists of 3, 303 gene clusters, which contain 1, 709 core genome genes, 822 distributed genes, and 772 strain-specific genes. The genome components involved in the biogenesis of capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide O antigen relative to serovar diversity were compared, and their genetic diversity was depicted. Our findings shed more light on genomic features associated with serovar diversity of A. pleuropneumoniae and provide broader insight into both pathogenesis research and clinical/epidemiological application against the severe disease caused by this swine pathogen...|$|R

We sequenced the complete genome of A. pleuropneumoniae, JL 03, an isolate of serotype 3 prevalent in China. Its genome is a single chromosome of 2, 242, 062 base pairs containing 2, 097 predicted protein-coding sequences, six ribosomal rRNA operons, and 63 tRNA genes. Preliminary analysis of the genomic sequence and {{the functions of the}} encoded proteins not only confirmed the present physiological and pathological knowledge but also offered new insights into the metabolic and virulence characteristics of this important pathogen. We identified a full spectrum of genes related to its characteristic chemoheterotrophic catabolism of fermentation and respiration with an incomplete TCA system for anabolism. In addition to confirming the lack of ApxI toxin, identification of a nonsense mutation in apxIVA and a 5 ′-proximal truncation of the flp operon deleting both its promoter and the flp 1 flp 2 tadV genes have provided convincing scenarios for the low virulence property of JL 03. Comparative genomic analysis using the available sequences of other serotypes, probable strain (serotype) -specific genomic islands related to capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharide O-antigen biosyntheses were identified in JL 03, which provides a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of serotypic diversity of A. pleuropneumoniae...|$|R
