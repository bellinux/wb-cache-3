50|$|Metabolic inhibitors {{reduce the}} stomatal opening and {{increase}} the leaf resistance to water vapour diffusion without affecting carbon dioxide uptake. Examples include <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate,</b> abscisic acid (ABA), and aspirin.|$|E
50|$|Commercially available, this {{compound}} can {{be prepared}} by several routes. It results from treating <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate</b> with sodium stannite, by the reaction of mercuric halides with phenylmagnesium bromide, and the reaction of bromobenzene with sodium amalgam.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{toxicity}} and low nucleophilicity, organomercury compounds find limited use. The oxymercuration reaction of alkenes to alcohols using mercuric acetate proceeds via organomercury intermediates. A related reaction forming phenols is the Wolfenstein-Boters reaction. The toxicity {{is useful in}} antiseptics such as thiomersal and merbromin, and fungicides such as ethylmercury chloride and <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, a range of expired pesticides, industrial chemicals and various other materials were deposited in the warehouse of the rail station. Between 1991 and 1992, German company Schmidt-Cretan temporarily imported and stowed 480 tonnes of dangerous chemicals in Bajzë. Of these chemicals, the most dangerous were toxaphene and <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate,</b> both banned in the European Union since 1983. Importing was halted when the Albanian government noticed that the pesticides were outdated. Following complaints, the German authorities agreed to return the chemicals to Germany. In the meantime, however, local Albanians had emptied many containers in order to use them for household purposes. Much of the contents were emptied directly into the ground, eventually dispersing into Lake Shkodër. It was later reported that many cattle and sheep from the vicinity had died after the incident. Moreover, in subsequent years, fishermen from Lake Shkodër have reported a mass death of fish in the lake.|$|E

In Escherichia coli, in {{the presence}} of a second plasmid carrying functional transport genes, resistance to HgCl 2 and to <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate</b> (PMA) was expressed. Shortening the cloned fragment to 3. 8 kb abolished resistance to PMA but not to HgCl 2. In Bacillus subtilis, the 3. 8 -kb fragment produced mercuric reductase constitutively but did not produce resistance to HgCl 2 or to PMA...|$|E
40|$|The {{endocarp}} of {{the fresh}} pea pod incubated with solution or suspension of agricultural fungicides, phytotoxic metabolites of plant pathogenic fungi formed the pea phytoalexin, pisatin. Among the compounds tested, cycloheximide, triazine, dichlone, phenyimercury acetate, UV degradation product of <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate,</b> triphenyltin fungicides, and 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole induced pisatin. Ophiobolin, a toxin from Cochliobolus mtyabeanus, and ascochitine, a toxic metabolite from Ascochyta fabae, also induced pisatin. The possibilities {{of the development of}} harmless plant disease control agents was discussed in relation- to the induced synthesis of phytoalexins...|$|E
40|$|Biophysical {{and genetic}} {{properties}} of six independently isolated plasmids encoding {{the degradation of}} the herbicides 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxyacetic acid are described. Four of the plasmids, pJP 3, pJP 4, pJP 5, and pJP 7, had molecular masses of 51 megadaltons, belonged to the IncP 1 incompatibility group, and transferred freely to strains of Escherichia coli, Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, Rhizobium sp., Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. In addition, these four plasmids conferred resistance to merbromin, <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate,</b> and mercuric ions, had almost identical restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns, and encoded degradation of m-chlorobenzoate. The two other plasmids, pJP 2 and pJP 9, {{did not belong to}} the IncP 1 incompatibility group, had molecular masses of 37 megadaltons, encoded the degradation of phenoxyacetic acid, and possessed identical restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the sodium salt of 2, 3 -dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS) and meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) to mobilize mercury from tissues has been assessed in rats pretreated with different doses of HgCl 2, <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate</b> or exposed to different concentrations of mercury vapors. These pretreatments increase the mercury concentration in the kidney and to a lower extent in the liver. Only exposure to metallic mercury vapor leads to mercury accumulation in the brain. Both chelators mobilize mercury stored in the kidney {{and the amount of}} metal excreted in urine following a single administration of DMSA is a good indicator of the renal burden of mercury. The rate of removal is greater after DMPS administration than after DMSA but repeated administration of either agents eventually leads to the same total amount of mercury mobilized from the kidney. The loss of mercury from the liver can be slightly accelerated by repeated administration of the chelators. However, the chelators are inefficient in removing mercury from the brain...|$|E
40|$|Sulfaquinoxaline {{without the}} {{addition}} of an antibiotic in the feed did not protect the birds from mortality too well at the 0. 0125 % level, and appeared to inhibit growth {{to a certain extent}} when fed at a level of 0. 0250 %. Under the conditions of this experi-ment, sulfaquinoxaline proved to be a much more satisfactory medication when used in conjuction with aureomycin than when used either alone or in conjunction with terramycin. Sulfaquinoxaline at 0. 0250 % with terramycin at 83 grams per ton gave better results than did sulfa-quinoxaline without antibiotic, but did AS FAR as is known, no reports com-•*- ^- paring retention of mercury in dif-ferent strains or strain crosses of animals is available. In an investigation of the metabolism of <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate</b> (PMA) in animals, differences in mercury retention were noted by Miller et al.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to examine compounds that might improve the selectivity of the primary isolation medium for Haemophilus ducreyi. The susceptibility of 40 H. ducreyi strains to 34 antimicrobial agents, including 10 antibiotics, 3 quaternary ammonium compounds, 3 phenolic derivatives, 3 acridines, and 15 heavy metal compounds, was investigated by using an agar plate dilution technique. Results were compared with the susceptibilities of other gram-negative rods which may be contaminants on isolation media. The minimal inhibitory concentration range for colistin (16 to 128 micrograms/ml) indicated that this antibiotic might be of use as a selective agent. H. ducreyi was susceptible to spectinomycin (minimal inhibitory concentration range, 16 to 64 micrograms/ml), thiamphenicol (0. 12 to 1 microgram/ml), chloramphenicol (0. 12 to 0. 5 micrograms/ml), and streptomycin (4 to 32 micrograms/ml) and moderately susceptible to kanamycin (2 to 8 micrograms/ml). For the heavy metal compounds, a high susceptibility was seen with copper(II) chloride (2 to 8 micrograms/ml, corresponding to a concentration of 0. 75 to 3 micrograms of Cu 2 + ions per ml), sodium selenite (1 to 4 micrograms/ml, or 0. 45 to 1. 83 micrograms of Se- ions per ml), and <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate</b> (0. 12 to 0. 5 micrograms/ml). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of quaternary ammonium compounds, acridines, and phenolic derivatives were between 1 and 32 micrograms/ml, 8 and 32 micrograms/ml, and 8 and 250 micrograms/ml, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Morinda citrifolia {{from the}} Rubiaceae family, {{collected}} in parish of St. Andrew, Jamaica, West Indies, was investigated {{for the presence}} of the Bromelain-like protein enzyme. In the process Bromelain from Morinda citrifolia was partially purified and characterized. Fresh plant material was extracted in buffer (sodium acetate-acetic acid (10 mM), L-cysteine (1 mM), and sodium chloride (0. 1 M), freeze dried and analyzed using column chromatography and assayed using spectrophotometry in a five step procedure. The major purification steps involved were ammonium sulphate precipitation, gel-filtration (Sephadex G 200), ion exchange chromatography (CM sephadex C 25) and (DEAE sephadex A 25). The protein content was determined using the Bradford method. The enzyme displayed an optimum activity at pH 7. 1 and a temperature optimum at 35 ºC. A purification fold of 70. 9 and percentage recovery of 3. 3 was obtained. Inhibition studies using several different inhibitors of the enzyme revealed that the enzyme was susceptible to copper sulphate (0. 1 mM), mercury chloride (0. 1 mM), cobalt sulphate (0. 1 mM), zinc sulphate (0. 1 mM) and <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate</b> (0. 1 mM). Both casein and p-Nitrophenylbenzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysinate (CLN) were used as substrates for the enzyme, with the enzyme displaying greater activity when using casein as substrate. Bromelain-like protein enzyme showed high affinity for the substrate casein with a Km of 48. 5 µM...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} approach {{based on}} the assembly of genes of a catabolic pathway was used to detect transconjugants in aquatic communities. Resistance to <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate</b> was established in transconjugants when wide-host-range conjugal plasmids containing merB, the gene encoding organomercurial lyase, were transferred to strains from aquatic communities that had been acclimated to inorganic mercury and thus enriched for populations containing merA, the gene encoding mercuric reductase (T. Barkay, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 53 : 2725 - 2732, 1987). Conjugation was confirmed by using the plasmids' encoded antibiotic resistance patterns and by hybridization with a eukaryotic gene. Three merB-conjugal plasmids, belonging to incompatibility groups W (pGTE 16), P 1 (pGTE 26), and N (pGTE 25), were prepared. Transfers by filter matings of pGTE 16 and pGTE 26 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA 01 to indigenous strains were at efficiencies of 4. 5 × 10 - 2 and 4. 8 × 10 - 3 transconjugant per potential recipient, respectively. These efficiencies were from 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below those observed for intraspecies matings with genetically marked recipients. The third plasmid, pGTE 25, was not stably maintained in P. aeruginosa donors, and its transfer from Escherichia coli donors was {{below the level of}} detection. Characterized transconjugant strains were shown to be Pseudomonas spp. Potential applications of the described experimental approach in the creation of bacterial populations with new catabolic capabilities in hazardous waste sites and in the detection of transfer of recombinant DNA from engineered microorganisms to indigenous bacteria are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Penicillinase {{plasmids}} of Staphylococcus aureus often contain genes conferring {{resistance to}} inorganic mercury (Hg 2 +) and the organomercurial <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>acetate.</b> The mechanism of resistance {{was found to}} be the enzymatic hydrolysis of the organomercurial phenylmercury to benzene plus inorganic ionic mercury, which was then enzymatically reduced to metallic mercury (Hg 0). The Hg 0 was rapidly volatilized from the medium into the atmosphere. After the mercurial was degraded and the mercury was volatilized, the resistant cells were able to grow. These plasmids also conferred the ability to volatilize mercury from thimerosal, although the plasmid-bearing strains were equally as thimerosal sensitive as the S. aureus without plasmids. None of the plasmids conferred the ability to volatilize mercury from several other organomercurials, however: methylmercury, ethylmercury, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, merbromin, and fluorescein mercuric acetate. (Organomercurial resistance-conferring plasmids of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that we have been studying confer the ability to degrade two or three of these organomercurials.) Although mercury was not volatilized from p-hydroxymercuribenzoate or fluorescein mercuric acetate, the plasmid-bearing strains were resistant to these organomercurials. The ability to volatilize mercury from Hg 2 + and phenylmercury was inducible. The range of inducers included Hg 2 +, phenylmercury, and several organomercurials that were not substrates for the degradation system. Mercury-sensitive mutants have been isolated from the parental plasmids pI 258 and pII 147. Thirty-one such mercury-sensitive strains fall into three classes: (i) mercury-sensitive strains totally devoid of the phenylmercury hydrolase and Hg 2 + reductase activities; (ii) mutants with normal hydrolase levels and no detectable reductase; and (iii) mutants with essentially normal hydrolase levels and low and variable (5 to 25 %) levels of reductase activities. The mercury-sensitive strains were also sensitive to phenylmercury, including those with the potential for hydrolase activity...|$|E
