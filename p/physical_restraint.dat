Although there have been nationwide initiatives to reduce or eliminate the use of <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> on children, to date, researchers have not yet identified the organizational factors that predict the likelihood of using <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> on children. Based on the two-factor theory, in which two different types of predictors of motivation and behavior in the workplace were identified, the purpose of this quantitative non-experimental study was to examine whether satisfaction with pay, a hygiene factor, and satisfaction with supervision and perceived organizational support, motivating factors, predict the frequency of the use of <b>physical</b> <b>restraints.</b> Satisfaction with pay and supervision were measured using the Job Satisfaction Survey and perceived organizational support was measured using the Perceived Organizational Support Survey. Data were collected from 245 direct care staff members employed at residential treatment centers for children. Pearson product moment correlations and multiple regression analysis were conducted. The results indicated that satisfaction with supervision was negatively and statistically significantly related to the use of <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> on children {{in residential}} care and satisfaction with pay approached significance. Organizational changes that address training, development, pay, and best practices for supervision may aid in the reduction of <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> used on children.

25|$|The {{late eighteenth}} and early nineteenth centuries are {{typically}} seen as decisive in {{the emergence of}} new attitudes towards the management and treatment of the insane.

25|$|The term bondage {{describes}} {{the practice of}} <b>physical</b> <b>restraint.</b> Bondage is usually, but not always, a sexual practice. While bondage is a very popular variation within the larger field of BDSM, it is nevertheless sometimes differentiated {{from the rest of}} this field. Studies among BDSM practitioners in the US have shown that about half of all men find the idea of bondage to be erotic; and many women do as well. Strictly speaking, bondage means binding the partner by tying their appendages together; for example, by the use of handcuffs or ropes, or by lashing their arms to an object. Bondage can also be achieved by spreading the appendages and fastening them with chains or ropes to a St. Andrew's cross or spreader bars.|$|E

Liberty was accorded the same broad reading in the subsequent case Meyer v.

500|$|Treatments of this pseudoscientific {{disorder}} {{are called}} [...] "Attachment therapy". In general, these therapies {{are aimed at}} adopted or fostered children {{with a view to}} creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize obedience and parental control. There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream. There is little or no evidence base and techniques vary from non-coercive therapeutic work to more extreme forms of physical, confrontational and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. These forms of the therapy may well involve <b>physical</b> <b>restraint,</b> the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation, and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma. Critics maintain that these therapies are not within the attachment paradigm, are potentially abusive, and are [...] to attachment theory. The APSAC Taskforce Report of 2006 notes that many of these therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. Children may be described as [...] "RADs", [...] "Radkids" [...] or [...] "Radishes" [...] and dire predictions may be made as to their supposedly violent futures if they are not treated with attachment therapy. The Mayo Clinic, a well known U.S. non-profit medical practice and medical research group, cautions against consulting with mental health providers who promote these types of methods and offer evidence to support their techniques; to date, this evidence base is not published within reputable medical or mental health journals.|$|E

Therefore, reduction {{in the use of}} <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> in psycho-geriatric nursing home residents is very important. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the short-term effects of an educational intervention on the use of <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> in psycho-geriatric nursing home residents. Methods A cluster randomized trial was applied to 5 psycho-geriatric nursing home wards (n = 167 residents with dementia). The wards were assigned at random to either educational intervention (3 wards) or control status (2 wards). The restraint status was observed and residents' characteristics, such as cognitive status, were determined by using the Minimum Data Set (MDS) at baseline and 1 month after intervention. Results Restraint use did not change significantly over time in the experimental group (55 %– 56 %), compared to a significant increased use (P Conclusion An educational programme for nurses combined with consultation with a nurse specialist did not decrease the use of <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> in psycho-geriatric nursing home residents in the short term. However, the residents in the control group experienced more restraint use during the study period compared to the residents in the experimental group.
