2500|$|When {{biodiesel}} is cooled below {{a certain}} point, {{some of the}} molecules aggregate and form crystals. The fuel starts to appear cloudy once the crystals become larger than {{one quarter of the}} wavelengths of visible light – this is the cloud point (CP). As the fuel is cooled further these crystals become larger. The lowest temperature at which fuel can pass through a 45micrometre filter is the cold filter plugging point (CFPP). As biodiesel is cooled further it will gel and then solidify. Within Europe, there are differences in the CFPP requirements between countries. This is reflected in the different national standards of those countries. The temperature at which pure (B100) biodiesel starts to gel varies significantly and depends upon the mix of esters and therefore the feedstock oil used to produce the biodiesel. For example, biodiesel produced from low erucic acid varieties of canola seed (RME) starts to gel at approximately [...] Biodiesel produced from beef tallow and palm oil tends to gel at around [...] and [...] respectively.

The suitability of the castor oil was also assessed in terms of its favourable colour, odour, specific gravity, acid value, iodine value, saponification value, viscosity, <b>pour</b> <b>points</b> and flash points in comparison to those of conventional JBO. Different recipes for the production of emulsions were standardized in the industrial scale and their suitability were assessed according to their stability, specific gravity, temperature, viscosity and <b>pour</b> <b>points.</b> The recipes were used to spin jute fibre in the jute mill machines. The yarn products were studied to evaluate their work performances based on their physico-chemical properties: moisture regain, t. p. i., W. I., count, strength, tenacity, extension, textile modulus, toughness, QR, oil content and unsaponifiable matters. The yarn products were particularly evaluated in terms of their unsaponifiable matters based on the IJSG criterion. The yarns of processes show quality ratio 93. 93 to 104. 20 and unsaponifiable matters ranging from 126. 05 to 414. 92 mg/kg yarn and easily pass the IJSG criterion. The processes therefore appear to be of commercial importance...|$|R

40|$|This {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} use of {{oil-based}} industrial starch byproduct called corn germ as biodiesel feedstock. Corn germ oil (CGO) was extracted using n-hexane and the fatty acid profile of the oil analyzed using gas chromatography. The synthesis of CGO to biodiesel was conducted via two-stage method (esterification, followed by transesterification) due to the oil having a relatively high acid value of 3. 05 mg KOH/g. The physical and chemical properties of the oil, and fuel properties of corn germ oil methyl esters (CGOME) were measured in accordance with standard test methods. Specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, cloud and <b>pour</b> <b>points</b> of blends (B 2, B 5, B 10, B 15 and B 20) of CGOME in petrodiesel were also determined. A moderately high yield (85. 5 ± 0. 7 wt. %) of CGOME was obtained under classic reaction conditions. The fuel properties of CGOME measured were found to fulfill both ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards except oxidative stability and iodine value. In addition, the results for kinematic viscosity, specific gravity, cloud and <b>pour</b> <b>points</b> of CGOME-petrodiesel blends satisfied both ASTM D 975 and ASTM D 7467 and were in agreement with previous studies.
