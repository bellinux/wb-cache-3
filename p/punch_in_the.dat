5|$|GoldenEye was edited to be {{guaranteed}} a PG-13 rating from the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC. The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head {{when he is}} shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her a rabbit <b>punch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car. In 2006, the film was re-mastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15. However, the original MPAA edits still remain.|$|E
5|$|Batman {{returns to}} the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the {{preparations}} for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced <b>punch.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Jokerwho is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.|$|E

25|$|During the fight, a dogged Braddock {{took a few}} heavy {{hits from}} the {{powerful}} younger champion (30 years vs 26 years for Baer), but Braddock kept coming, wearing down Baer, who seemed perplexed by Braddock's ability to take a <b>punch.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, the judges gave Braddock the title with a unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|In July 1996, Frenzal Rhomb {{released}} {{their second}} album, Not So Tough Now, which {{was produced by}} Tony Cohen (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, TISM, Dave Graney), Kalju Tonuma (Nick Barker, The Mavis's) and Frenzal Rhomb. Just after its appearance, Costello was replaced by Lindsay McDougall on lead guitar and backing vocals – Costello left to attend university and become an animal rights activist. In November, the group issued a CD EP, <b>Punch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Face and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day Out. Late that year they toured the US supporting Blink-182.|$|E

25|$|The Hawks {{made the}} Cup Finals twice {{more in the}} 1960s, losing to the Leafs in 1962 and the Canadiens in 1965. They {{remained}} {{a force to be}} reckoned with throughout the decade, with Hull enjoying four 50-goal seasons, Mikita winning back-to-back scoring titles and MVP accolades, Pilote winning three consecutive Norris Trophies, and Hall being named the First or Second All-Star goaltender eight out of nine seasons. Hull and Mikita especially were widely regarded as the most feared one-two <b>punch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league. However, despite a strong supporting cast which included Bill Hay, Ken Wharram, Phil Esposito, Moose Vasko, Doug Mohns and Pat Stapleton, the Hawks never quite put it all together.|$|E
25|$|Machida was {{in talks}} to face Phil Davis, but the fight wouldn't end up {{happening}} due to Davis needing {{more time to}} recover from knee surgery. Instead, Machida replaced an injured Rashad Evans and faced UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones on December 10, 2011, in the main event of UFC 140. After a first round that saw Machida rock Jones with a <b>punch,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second round Jones took Machida down and cut him with an elbow strike. After standing up, Machida was knocked down with a straight left counter and then caught in a standing guillotine and choked unconscious at 4:26 of the second round, losing the title bout by technical submission. Both men won Fight of the Night honors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the failed revolution, women mourn the deaths of the {{students}} ("Turning") and Marius, wounded but alive, despairs at the sacrifice of so many lives and at the death of his friends while he survives ("Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"). As he wonders who saved his own life, Cosette comforts him, and they reaffirm their blossoming romance. Valjean realises that Cosette will not need him as a caretaker once she's married and gives them his blessing ("Every Day"). Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an escaped convict and must go away because his presence endangers Cosette ("Valjean's Confession"), making Marius promise never to tell Cosette. A few months later, Marius and Cosette marry ("Wedding Chorale"). The Thénardiers crash the reception disguised as nobility and attempt to blackmail Marius, telling him that Valjean is a murderer and that Thénardier saw him carrying a corpse in the sewers after the barricades fell. When Thénardier shows him the ring as proof, Marius realizes that it was Valjean who saved his life. The newlyweds leave to find Valjean (in some productions, Marius pauses to give Thénardier a <b>punch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face). The Thénardiers are not discouraged, instead gloating that their craven practicality has saved their lives time and time again ("Beggars at the Feast").|$|E

500|$|It was, as he recalled, [...] "a {{tremendous}} <b>punch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{stomach to}} all of us". The aftermath of the fire, in which three astronauts were killed, left Lunney {{and his colleagues at}} NASA feeling that they had perhaps failed to recognize the risks they were running in their efforts to meet Kennedy's timetable of landing a man on the Moon {{by the end of the}} decade.

500|$|Jason Scott of Blogcritics {{called it}} a [...] "gem" [...] and wrote that [...] "Lovato's pain runs so deep that this soul-baring song feels like a <b>punch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gut". Both Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu and Rick Florino of Artistdirect {{considered}} it a stand-out track of Unbroken, while [...] Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic ranked it at number 28 on his list of the best songs of 2011, writing, [...] "It's a moody waltz-time ballad whose cello-driven sense of atmosphere places it closer to something Coldplay might have done, although the phrasing makes it sound like she's been getting into '60s soul, her vocal cracking just enough to say, 'I'm feeling this'." [...] Masley also considered it the second best song by Lovato, just behind [...] "Skyscraper".|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{affirmed that}} the scene {{reestablished}} The Walking Dead to full form, {{as well as}} redeemed the season's [...] "general gutlessness thus far." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts, and observed that it was effective {{enough to keep the}} viewers chattering until the succeeding episode. Handlen summated: [...] "The Sophia reveal is a <b>punch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gut, because narrative fiction teaches us the longer someone stays missing, the better the chance they'll turn up alive; otherwise, where would the drama be? By using the little girl in this way, the show transforms what should've been anti-climax into a reinvention of an entire storyline. It's not enough to make the bad parts of the earlier episodes great, but it does show that the writers had more on their mind than stalling." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger felt that albeit predictable, the segment was [...] "well executed". Josh Wigler of MTV said that the storyline ended in [...] "a much darker way than anyone could have imagined." ...|$|E

500|$|When Mark {{returns from}} vacation, he visits Carly at her office. He is then locked in that clear glass conference room by Carly's {{assistant}} and friend, Lydia, and is stunned {{to see all}} of the three women sitting in there together. They proceed to confront him with his infidelities and embezzlement. With Carly as her attorney, Kate presents divorce papers and a list of their assets. She reveals how she, as a CEO, has returned all of Mark's embezzled money back to those companies, which saves him from prison time but then leaves him bankrupt, much to his shock and hysterical outrage. Mark's business partner, Nick, then arrives and acknowledges his wife's work back after firing him. In his furious anger and rush to leave, he smashes into the glass office, cutting him and ripping his clothes. He excuses himself, fuming, from the three women, who all then applaud each other. He then afterwards finds his car being towed away before also receiving a <b>punch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face from Carly's father, Frank.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club critic Andy Battaglia {{felt the}} ballad was {{successful}} in terms of execution and described it as [...] "a breeze of finger-snap funk." [...] Adrien Begrand from PopMatters singled it out as a highlight from {{the second half of}} Body Language, commenting that it [...] "keeps {{the last half of the}} album from being a complete waste of time." [...] Favouring Minogue's vocal performance, Eric Seguy from Stylus Magazine wrote: [...] "Kylie proves herself to be a consummate entertainer, breezing through the chill muzak of [...] "Promises" [...] and [...] "Chocolate"'s wild disco jam with equal ease." [...] Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani likened Minogue's vocals to that of British electronic music duo Mono and felt the tone of the song resembled the [...] "gauzy melancholy" [...] of Madonna's 1994 album Bedtime Stories. A mixed review came from The Guardian critic Helen Pidd, who acknowledged the song's commercial appeal but felt it [...] "sounds too dated to pack any <b>punch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> age of Beyoncé and Missy Elliott." [...] Spin magazine criticised the vocals for being over-processed and the lyrics for lacking substance. The magazine also felt that the theme of the song had already been covered by [...] "minor artists" [...] like American singer–songwriter Mandy Moore.|$|E
500|$|... 1988 was the bicentenary of {{non-indigenous}} {{settlement in}} Australia and, as such, there was {{renewed interest in}} the 'lost' second Sydney punchbowl. The bowl eventually turned up in a catalogue for a Chinese export porcelain exhibition at Newark Museum, New Jersey, United States, titled Chinese Export Porcelain: A Loan Exhibition from New Jersey Collections. The bowl had been lent by Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., a former United States Congressman (in office 1953–1975). The discovery was made by Terry Ingram, a Sydney journalist specialising in antiques and art, who wrote about it in his Saleroom column, titled Newark Museum packs Aussie <b>punch,</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Australian Financial Review on 25August 1988. It transpired {{that in the early}} 1930s, the bowl was acquired by Frelinghuysen's parents in a private negotiation with the owner at the time the National Art Collections Fund was attempting to raise interest from Sydney's cultural institutions. This discovery drew the attention of Paul Hundley, senior curator of the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM)'s USA Gallery, the Gallery itself a bicentennial gift of the American people to Australia. In May 2006, the ANMM announced it had acquired the bowl as a part gift from Frelinghuysen through the American Friends of the ANMM, a charitable organisation recognised by the US Internal Revenue Service which enabled Frelinghuysen to receive appropriate taxation benefits. The Australian Financial Review reported the acquisition in its Saleroom column, titled Museum bowled over, on 18May 2006. The punchbowl has been on display in the Museum's USA Gallery ever since. It also features as one of the 100 Stories from the ANMM, has digitised images in the ANMM catalogue and can be viewed on YouTube. At the time the ANMM acquired the punchbowl in 2006, the bowl was valued at $A330,000.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Ramirez again posted strong {{offensive}} numbers, {{finishing with}} a [...]325 average, 37 home runs, and 104 RBI. The second half surge of newly acquired fellow Dominican slugger David Ortiz gave the Red Sox a formidable one-two <b>punch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the}} lineup with Ramirez. However, in the summer, Ramirez missed several games with pharyngitis, but got into hot water as he was spotted in a bar in the hotel where he lived with a close friend, Yankees infielder Enrique Wilson, despite being supposedly too ill {{to play in the}} series against the rival Yankees. Ramirez and Wilson both maintained that Manny was just talking to his friend in that setting, and not actually drinking or partying as the media speculated. Boston manager Grady Little benched Ramirez for one game as a result. Despite this distraction, the Red Sox finished the season 95-67, qualifying for the MLB postseason {{for the first time with}} Ramirez. In the decisive fifth game of their Division Series matchup against the Oakland Athletics, Ramirez broke a 6th inning 1-1 tie by launching a go-ahead three-run homer off Barry Zito that set up an ALCS showdown with the rival Yankees. In ALCS Game 3, Ramirez was at the center of a bench-clearing brawl. Early in the game, Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martínez had hit Yankees outfielder Karim Garcia up high with a pitch, sparking heated dialogue, and a hard slide by Garcia into Red Sox second baseman Todd Walker had exacerbated the tensions. The very next inning, Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens threw a pitch high and inside to Ramirez, and Manny charged the mound, sparking the melee. The Red Sox lost the game 4-3. Despite Ramirez's strong play in the ALCS against the Yankees (.310 with 2 home runs), the Red Sox fell to the Yankees in the decisive seventh game on Aaron Boone's infamous extra-inning, walk-off home run.|$|E
