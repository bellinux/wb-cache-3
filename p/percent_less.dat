40|$|The {{time and}} space {{variability}} of global radiation have been studied using data collected from a mesoscale network of integrating pyranometers established in Wisconsin, for the period December 1966 through June 1967. The data have been normalized {{so that they are}} expressed as a percent of the clear day global radiation. The atmospheric transmission coefficient over the State changes from about 0. 75 in winter to 0. 60 in summer. For a typical month, the standard deviations of the State daily mean varied from a few percent up to 50 percent of the State mean. Mean day-to-day changes of approximately f 18 percent-radiation were recorded. From use of records for any one site in the State, the global radiation elsewhere in the State can be estimated with an approximate standard error of f 25 <b>percent</b> or <b>less</b> of the clear day radiation on a daily basis, f 15 <b>percent</b> or <b>less</b> on a 5 -day basis, and f 10 <b>percent</b> or <b>less</b> on a monthly basis. Alternatively, if the network data from the sites surrounding the unknown point can be used for interpolation, the global radiation anywhere in the State can be estimated with an approximate standard error of f 20 <b>percent</b> or <b>less</b> of the clear day radiation on a daily basis, f 10 <b>percent</b> or <b>less</b> on a 5 -day basis, and f 6 <b>percent</b> or <b>less</b> on a monthly basis. 1...|$|R

5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} weighs 6.0grams (93grains)—roughly {{half as much}} as {{a typical}} 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge—making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, a relatively high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it has roughly 30 <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability.

5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling {{to take a chance}} on the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower to help pay for condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> than the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction.|$|E
