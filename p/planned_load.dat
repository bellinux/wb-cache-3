50|$|Even though {{years of}} {{experience}} accounts for a good gauge for the appropriate lifting anchor to be used, {{it should not be}} left to the reinforcement fabricators and precast factory personnel to select the lifting anchor. The design engineer should specifically account for the applied loads expected during the lifting, transport and placement (or re-usability requirements) of the element. Flexure, casting bed suction, load direction (axial ‘tensile’, angular ‘sling’, transverse ‘shear’) are also load considerations to be accounted for in the lifting design of the element.The anchor selection, together with additional reinforcement, and rigging arrangements is influenced by:- The dead weight of the element- The number of anchors in the element and the configuration of the anchor- Capacity of the anchor at the specific concrete compressive strengths at time of lift- The dynamic loads applied during lifting (suction to the casting bed, or crane dynamics)- The rigging configurationAll of the above factors must be taken into consideration during the lifting design phase of the element.The weight of the element can be determined by the calculated volume, and using the specific gravity (normal weight reinforced concrete is approximately 24 kN/m3).Establishing the lifting anchor positions will influence the rigging arrangements used and therefore the static analysis of the rigging should be determined. Particular rigging configurations may be more suitable for particular job sites or lifting in place considerations, and the lifting design should denote the assumptions accordingly. For example, the statically determined systems, shown in Figure 3, where the determination of the loads is not always possible.Dynamic loads considered in lifting design are accounted for in two stages; suction to the casting bed on the initial lift and then the dynamic loads induced from crane vibration. These crane impact loads must be accounted for during transportation in the yard and on-site, and the coefficient increases from an overhead gantry crane through to a crane moving over rough terrain. Consideration for the entire transportation loads {{must be taken into account}} during the lifting design.Anchor capacity, or load resistance, should be considered for tensile loads (axial), sling angle (angular) and shear loads (transverse). Consideration of different load combinations may result in wide variations required from the lifting insert. The load directions during production, transport and placement should be considered carefully. Depending on the <b>planned</b> <b>load</b> direction, either a different anchor may be included in the lifting design, alternatively, reinforcement may be included to reduce the possibility of element flexure crack damage. The configuration (size, position and quantity) of this reinforcement should be supplemented to the element reinforcement design to ensure for adequate capacity of the lifting design.Lifting design is influenced by the steel / concrete interaction of the specific anchor selected. Different load cases are considered by the lifting design engineer, such as anchor susceptibility to edge distance, placement sensitivity, and anchor capacity at the specific concrete strength at time of lift. For example, a footed pin head style anchor maybe more susceptible to edge distance than a hairpin style anchor. Or a splayed anchor does not have the same tensile/axial capacity with the equivalent anchor length (effective embedment is greater on a footed anchor than a splayed anchor of equivalent overall length, see figure 4).|$|E

CDMA system with TDD is a good solution to this traffic asymmetry. However, the level of traffic asymmetry may be significantly different from a cell to another cell. To tackle this problem and to support the traffic hot spot, crossed slots are examined. The use of crossed slots is restricted within a certain range of a cell by investigating the inter-cell interference and the maximum <b>planned</b> <b>load</b> factor. We examine the radius of inner zone and discuss the capacity of downlink crossed slots for various neighbor cell environments. Computational results show that the capacity increase in the target cell is outstanding by reducing the service range of neighbor cells. When all six neighbors reduce their service range by 20 %, the capacity at target cell crossed slot is increased by 35 %. Monte Carlo simulation is performed with large scale fading to verify the numerical analysis...|$|E

Generally, for a mechanical component, the fatigue strength reduction factor (i) is difficult to evaluate especially when it is in service. In this paper, the procedures for crack paths individuation and consequently damage evaluation (adopted in laboratory for stressed specimens with <b>planned</b> <b>load</b> histories) are applied to mechanical components, already failed during service. The energy parameters, proposed by the authors {{for the evaluation of}} the fatigue behavior of the materials [1 - 5], are defined on specimens derived from a flange bolts. The flange connecting pipes at high temperature and pressure. Due to the loss of the seal, the bolts have been subjected to a hot flow steam addition to the normal stress. The numerical analysis coupled experimental analysis (measurement of surface temperature during static and dynamic tests of specimens taken from damaged tie rods), has helped to determine the causes of failure of the tie rods. The determination of an energy parameter for the evaluation of the damage showed that factors related to the heat release of the material (loaded) may also help to understand the causes of failure of mechanical components...|$|E

Determining {{the design of the}} <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> is critical to effective operations of such carriers. This dissertation makes contributions in modeling and algorithm design for three problems in LTL <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design: (1) Refined execution cost estimation. Existing <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design models use approximations that ignore important facts such as the nonlinearity of transportation costs with respect to the number of trailers, and empty travel beyond what is required for trailer balance that results from driver rules. We develop models that more accurately capture key operations of LTL carriers and produce accurate operational execution costs estimates; (2) Dynamic <b>load</b> <b>planning.</b> <b>Load</b> <b>plans</b> are traditionally revised infrequently by LTL carriers due to the difficulty of solving the associated optimization problem. Technological advances have now enabled carriers to consider daily <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> updates. We develop technologies that efficiently and effectively adjust a nominal <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> for a given day based on the actual freight to be served by the carrier. We present an integer programming based local search procedure, and a greedy randomized adaptive search heuristic; and (3) Stochastic <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> design. <b>Load</b> <b>plan</b> design models commonly represent origin-destination freight volumes using average demands, which do not describe freight volume fluctuations.

40|$|Building new or {{retrofitting}} existing industrial buildings {{presents a}} huge and potentially risky investment for any company. The investors wish to minimize the construction or upgrade costs and begin using the new facilities as soon as possible. A later correction of the flaws in the initial design is related to additional costs that the investors would like to evade. For this thesis we developed a computer model of a suggested upgrade of an automated warehouse. With the use of discrete-event simulation we observed the behaviour of the modeled system under different input parameters. The process of creating a warehouse model and the simulation was carried out with the SIMPROCESS software. The basics of queueing and serving theory were used and we assumed that the arrival times are distributed according to a Poisson distribution. For serving times, we assumed a normal distribution. The simulation itself {{was limited to the}} processes of receiving and shipping goods. The model’s parameters were set based on historical data that represent an annual number of receive or ship transactions and the average amount of processed material per transaction. Results indicate that the upgraded warehouse will be able to withstand the <b>planned</b> <b>load.</b> These results were obtained when the input parameters showed an adequately balanced system. We came across some bad warehouse performance when the load distribution difference between different parts of the warehouse was too high. ...|$|E

However, these stations also face challenges due to power fluctuations, high peak loads, and low load factors, affecting the reliable and economic operation of charging stations and distribution networks. This paper introduces a battery {{energy storage system}} (BESS) for charging load control, which is a more user-friendly approach and is more robust to perturbations. With the goals of peak-shaving, total electricity cost reduction, and minimization of variation in the state-of-charge (SOC) range, a BESS-based bi-level optimization strategy for the charging load regulation of fast charging stations is proposed in this paper. At the first level, a day-ahead optimization strategy generates the optimal <b>planned</b> <b>load</b> curve and the deviation band {{to be used as}} a reference for ensuring multiple control objectives through linear programming, and even for avoiding control failure caused by insufficient BESS energy. Based on this day-ahead optimal plan, at a second level, real-time rolling optimization converts the control process to a multistage decision-making problem. The predictive control-based real-time rolling optimization strategy in the proposed model was used to achieve the above control objectives and maintain battery life. Finally, through a horizontal comparison of two control approaches in each case study, and a longitudinal comparison of the control robustness against different degrees of load disturbances in three cases, the results indicated that the proposed control strategy was able to significantly improve the charging load characteristics, even with large disturbances. Meanwhile, the proposed approach ensures the least amount of variation in the range of battery SOC and reduces the total electricity cost, which will be of a considerable benefit to station operators...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{carrier phase}} {{kinematic}} GPS (global positioning system) {{has evolved into}} a reliable technique to measure both the three-dimensional magnitudes and frequencies of movements of structures. Techniques have been developed that tackle errors caused by multipath, tropospheric delay and issues relating to satellite geometry. GPS-derived movements compare well with data from both design predictions and structural models. Results from field trials carried out on the Forth Road Bridge are presented. This paper brings together key results that outline the procedure as well as a series of new data that indicate other potential applications. GPS data were collected continuously over a period of 46 h at a minimum rate of 10 Hz. During the trials wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity and temperature were also recorded. Frequently there was very heavy traffic flow, and at one point a special load (a 100 -t lorry) passed over simultaneously to the heavy daytime flow of traffic. Data from a <b>planned</b> <b>load</b> trial during a brief bridge closure are reported and compared with the limited results available from a finite element model. Measured vibration frequencies are also computed from GPS data and compared with those given in the literature. In addition, results indicating the change in structural characteristics are also presented – in particular changes of mass associated with changes in traffic loading are observed. The results show the performance of GPS as it has developed in recent years, and that it can now reliably be used as a significant part of structural health monitoring schemes, giving both the magnitude of quasi-static deflections in known time periods and hence the frequency of dynamic movements of structures...|$|E

Three genre types representing different structures, styles and degrees of topic familiarity were chosen for an RD analysis: procedural description, story-telling and recount of personal event. The results revealed that genre types and <b>planning</b> <b>load</b> influenced the rate of RD occurrence.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Mathematical {{analyses}} {{indicated that}} significant possibilities exist for load shifting projects on a Large Potable Water Utility (LPWU) in South Africa. A primary concern remained, i. e. whether the load variation {{would have an}} effect on the water quality. Extensive simulation and testing were initiated in order to prove that the load shift will not affect the water quality. In South Africa, the highest standard for drinking water is the Blue Drop award. The LPWU has received this award multiple times and strives to maintain it. An investigation was launched to determine if this load shifting project would {{have an effect on}} the quality standards to which the utility holds (SANS 241 (2011)). The LPWU has over 3000 km of pipelines to supply potable water to the industrial heartland of the country as well as millions of domestic users. The LPWU network is the longest pumping network in the world and is still expanding. The investigation included a simulation of a pumping simulation package to determine how the system would react to the changes. In this simulation, the load reduction in terms of Mega litre per day (Ml/day) was established. Results were compared to the normal operating parameters of the Water Treatment Works (WTW). The mathematical analysis in this investigation concluded that an evening peak load shift of 24. 5 MW is achievable. This dissertation will emphasise the necessity of a detailed investigation. The investigations and simulation will determine that the volume of water is well within the operating parameters of the WTW. Studies were done on each area of the plant. In-depth conversations with WTW personnel revealed that the reduction of the volume of water in question will not {{have an effect on the}} water quality. Further, it was established that it would be possible to use the sumps of the water treatment works to achieve the desired load shift. By using the sumps of the WTW, a load shift can be done without stopping any process in the WTW with the exception of disinfection at the Booster Pump Stations (BPS), where the balancing reservoirs were used as buffer capacity. The investigation shifted to establish whether stagnant water and a change in dosage would have an effect on the water quality in regard to the reduction and recovery load. As expected, the water never became stagnant at any moment due to the fact that only a small portion of the load was reduced. The water quality and dosage report of the water utility was used and compared to normal operations. The <b>planned</b> <b>load</b> shift had no effect on any aspects of the water quality.

40|$|The present thesis {{introduces}} the radio network planning process and optimisation for WCDMA (FDD mode), {{as defined by}} 3 GPP. This thesis consists of three parts: modelling and tools for radio network planning, process for pre-operational network control and optimisation for the operational network. General challenges to face in 3 G network control {{are based on the}} fact that many issues are interconnected and should be simultaneously considered, such as Planning means not only to meet current status and demands, but the solution should also comply with the future requirements by providing an acceptable development path. Traffic modelling is not only the question about the total amount of traffic growth, but also the question about the future service distribution and performance demands. All CDMA systems have a relation between capacity and coverage. Consequently, the network planning itself is not only based on propagation estimation but also on the interference situation in the network. Ideally, site selection consideration will be done based on the network analysis with <b>planned</b> <b>load</b> and traffic/service portfolio, taking possible co-siting constraints into account. Provision of multiple services and seamless management of at least two multiple access systems require rapid evolution of the management tools and processes. The network performance in terms of capacity, quality, and implementation and operational costs forms a multidimensional space. Operators' task will be to convert the business strategy to an operating point in the performance space in a cost efficient manner. The contribution of this thesis in terms of modelling and tools is as follows: Improvement of the accuracy of radio link budget by introducing power control headroom (also called fast fading margin). Improvement of loading equation by introducing a transmit power increase term. Development of theory and modelling for a planning tool capable of multi-service and multi-carrier interference, capacity and coverage analysis. Development and implementation an interface taking into account the true traffic distribution (not uniform) and terminal speed. In the area of pre-operational planning process the contribution of this thesis is as follows: Development of dimensioning methodology for multi-service network site density estimation, utilising the modelling of power control headroom, transmit power increase, soft handover and Eb/N 0. Development of radio network planning process for multi-service environment including capacity and coverage evaluation for a given traffic mixture, quality and area requirements. Analysis of means to improve radio network performance with Mast Head Amplifier (MHA), diversity reception, sectorisation and proper antenna selection. In the area of optimisation of the operational network the contribution of this thesis is as follows: Definition for optimisation target in the case of 3 G. The optimisation will be capacity-quality trade-off management instead of plain quality improvement process. Introduction of Self Organizing Map (SOM) in the analysis of cellular networks. Analysis of the applicability of SOM in WCDMA cellular network optimisation. Introduction of SOM based applications to support network capacity-quality trade-off management.

40|$|Power system simulations, {{power market}} {{analysis}} {{as well as}} power system security and reliability analysis now serves as fundamental analysis tasks in power system planning and operation. Thus, it is very useful to discuss techniques, data needs and methodologies related power system reliability. Work is very important {{both in terms of}} operational and economical aspects of a modern power system. The task of determining the reliability of a given power system can be a complex and difficult process. Several methodologies exist and the terminology describing these calculations may differ from case to case. The work performed in this thesis demonstrates a known reliability methodology related to a real-life power system. In the latter, PSS®SINCAL and its reliability module ZUBER has been emphasized. The development of a working test model has been an important part of this thesis. In the latter, statistical information describing the power system has been the main challenge, both in terms of availability and quality. The various reliability data have been calculated from annual failure statistics collected by Statnett and experience data from Siemens. The scope of the reliability analysis was to determine the affect of future load expansions. It is a known fact that load development can affect the reliability of the power system and potentially increase the frequency of supply interruptions causing higher CENS costs. However, {{this was not the case}} as the changes in frequency of supply interruptions were insignificant. The results showed a suspected CENS cost increase of 1. 6 NOK. Thus, it is evident that this is due to the fact that the uninterrupted power is now substantially larger. The reliability analysis show that the given power system will sustain its high level of reliability even with the <b>planned</b> <b>load</b> expansion. A comparative analysis of the ongoing development of a methodology (SAMREL) incorporating power market analysis via power flow and contingency analysis and PSS®SINCAL have also been presented. Comparing tools describing probabilistic reliability are important and can act as an incentive for future development of reliability tools. The major strength of PSS®SINCAL compared to SAMREL is simply the fact that PSS®SINCAL is a developed and commercialized tool. Unfortunately it was not possible conduct a reliability analysis using SAMREL, which was a major draw-back as a comparative analysis of both the tools relates to the same test model would have been very beneficial. SAMREL is comprised of several existing tools and therefore rely on the interaction between these tools, which after my opinion further complicate both the user friendliness and process of commercialization. From an educational point-of-view, the work related to SAMREL has several benefits contributing to increased general knowledge about power system reliability. It is evident that the accuracy of any reliability analysis depends on the quality of the statistical data. The studies show that local statistical data e. g. data based on local knowledge or local statistics often pose as a better solution. However, such data are unfortunately often very difficult to obtain, leaving no alternative as to use the available more general data. However, it is evident that some uncertainties always will exist but need to be taken into consideration when conducting such analysis. However, close cooperation with the utilities in combination with the utilization of high quality reliability data will after my opinion have a positive affect on the accuracy of the reliability analysis. Another important subject related to reliability is the process of identifying the critical system components. As shown, the main tool presented in this thesis is the consequence matrix, which categories the results obtained from the reliability analysis. The categories indicate both the consequence and the corresponding probability. Such matrixes need to be the result of a joint effort from both the customer and the professionals performing the criticality analysis, including all relevant information needed to classify criticality. The strength of this method lies in the fact that the defined probabilities can be used to identify large elements, such as substations and then be further utilized on a component level for the critical substation. The methodologies describing power system reliability have been emphasized throughout this thesis. The given test system and the performed reliability calculation demonstrates PSS®SINCAL as a tool for determining the reliability of a power system. The methodology utilized in this report is from the author 9 ̆ 2 s point of view a good representation of a state of the art reliability analysis...|$|E

Developing a detailed operational schedule allows one to more accurately estimate the likely cost of a given <b>load</b> <b>plan,</b> along with other important performance metrics. Given a <b>load</b> <b>plan,</b> the scheduling approach we develop creates loaded truck dispatches between terminals with specified time windows, and then creates cyclic driver schedules to cover all dispatches. A computational study using data from a large U. S. LTL carrier demonstrates that our technology produces schedules that accurately model operational costs, typically within 2 % of actual reported costs...|$|R

Obviously for the building has been completed to designed {{and has not been}} implemented in the field to do the analysis of behaviors the building due to earthquake load changes. This analysis aims to know how big the difference in behavior due to continuous span bridge earthquake <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> according to SNI- 1726 - 2002 with {{the earthquake}} <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> according earthquake map 2010. Effect of quake included by way of of dynamic analysis using SAP 2000 program assistance in the model response spectra. Earthquake loads applied to the model of continuous span bridge with span number 5 (five) pieces. From the results obtained by the analysis of the difference displacement and ductility due to earthquake <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> according to SNI- 1726 - 2002 with the earthquake <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> according earthquake map 2010. Dispalcement caused by the earthquake <b>load</b> <b>plan</b> according earthquake map 2010 more than 30 % compared to the amount of displacement due to earthquake <b>loads</b> SNI <b>plan</b> 1726 - 2002. This is understandable given the magnitude of the response spectra according map 2010 earthquake larger than the response spectra according SNI- 1726 - 2002...|$|R

Overall, the airport handled some 220 passengers in September, equal to six travelers on each flight.Czech Airlines decided to discontinue its flights from and to Radom with effect of late October, {{that had an}} average load of three passengers. The suspension was officially caused {{by the lack of}} de-icing equipment.airBaltic followed and announced on short notice to cancel its services and end its co-operation with the airport from November 18 onwards. According to Wyborcza, flights to Riga even got surpassed by flights on the Prague route in terms of success.airBaltic hereby left the airport without any scheduled flights less than just three months after they had begun.|$|R
