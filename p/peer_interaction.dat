40|$|The {{current study}} was a {{correlational}} study that examined children’s temperament (inhibitory control and shyness) and prosocial behavior as predictors of preschool-aged children’s <b>peer</b> <b>interactions.</b> The current study also examined the moderating effects of inhibitory control and shyness on relation between children’s prosocial behavior and <b>peer</b> <b>interactions.</b> Participants were 40 children (19 boys) aged from three to five enrolled in eight different preschools in a Midwestern city. It was hypothesized that children’s prosocial behavior and temperament (inhibitory control and shyness) would be correlated with preschool children’s <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> operationalized as sociability, communication, assertiveness, conflict, and a composite <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> domain. Results revealed {{that there was not}} a significant association between prosocial behavior and <b>peer</b> <b>interactions.</b> However, {{there was a significant difference}} between boys and girls on prosocial behavior, with girls scoring higher than boys on average. Prosocial behavior did not significantly differ by age. Inhibitory control was inversely correlated with conflict. Children’s shyness was significantly and negatively correlated with conflict.

25|$|Another {{study done}} by Jeffrey Trawick-Smith took 60 {{different}} children ages {{three to four}} and observed them playing with nine different toys deemed best for development.

The researchers then quantified play quality of the children with each toy based on factors such as learning, problem solving, curiosity, creativity, imagination, and <b>peer</b> <b>interaction.</b> The results revealed that boys generally received higher scores for overall play quality than girls, and the toys with the best play quality were those identified as the most gender neutral, such as building blocks and bricks along with pieces modeling people. Trawick-Smith then concluded that the study encourages a focus on toys which are beneficial to both genders {{in order to create a}} better balance.|$|E

40|$|A body of {{empirical}} research {{has revealed that}} there are associations among language skills, <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and behavioral problems in childhood. At the same time, however, there has been comparatively less research devoted to exploring the mutual unfolding of these factors over {{the first few years}} of life. The current study is designed to partially address this gap in the literature by examining how language skills, negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and behavioral problems are interrelated in a sample of twins drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). Employing a quantitative genetic framework, the results of the current study revealed that variance in language skills, negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and externalizing behavioral problems were all due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Bivariate Cholesky models indicated that most of the covariance among language skills, negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and externalizing behavioral problems was due to common genetic factors.

Looked after children and young people have highlighted the impact of negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and especially <b>peer</b> violence and intimidation, on their care experiences. However, to date, no specific fostering research has addressed this important issue. In response to this gap, we undertook focus groups with 32 foster carers in the South West of England.

The analysis revealed five main associated themes: the impact on the carers' birth children; a lack of placement planning; inadequate referral information; a negative view of social work support; and insufficient external interventions. ‘We undertook focus groups with 32 foster carers in the South West of England’ Key Practitioner Messages •Negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> particularly violence, were a major concern for foster carers, especially if they negatively impacted on the welfare of carers' birth children. •An absence of pre-placement referral information on negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> was commonly reported and placed all children in the fostering household at risk. •Associated social work support and external interventions were often perceived as lacking and inadequate. •Fostering procedures, review and decisions need to recognise the impact of peer violence on all members of the fostering household...|$|R

Although both child and classroom characteristics have been implicated as contributors to children’s success, there has been scant research linking child temperament, teacher–child relationship quality, and <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> in the same study. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine children’s early temperament, rated at preschool age, as a predictor of <b>interactions</b> with <b>peers</b> (i. e., aggression, relational aggression, victimization, and prosociality) in third grade while considering teacher–child relationship quality in kindergarten through second grades as a moderator and mediator of this association.

40|$|Mutual {{help and}} support are {{essential}} issues in everyday life. However, by no means, uncomplicated and effective help {{is a matter}} of course. Since helping behavior presupposes social skills and competences, it must be learned. The topic of my dissertation is the contribution of <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> to the development of prosocial behavior. As developmental theorists emphasize, <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> unlike adult-child interactions, involve equal roles and rights, resulting in greater cooperation. The purpose of this investigation is to gain insights in children´s natural occuring helping behavior. In which situations children typically help each other? Which difficulties and problems children have to overcome, when they seek or give help? The empirical material used in this study consists of observational data. <b>Peer</b> <b>interactions</b> in one classroom of grade 6 (21 girls and boys, mean age: 12. 5 years) were videotaped. For analyses 134 helping situations were identified and transcribed. The results show, that children help in many different situations. In the majority of the situations help was given or accepted in a friendly, harmonious way. However, in about one third of the cases, children either refused to help or combined the helping act with unfriendly behavior. Relations between friendship and unproblematic helping were found in part. Girls helped more often than boys. But overall, there were only few sex-differences. In summary the findings suggest, that <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> play an important role for the development of prosocial behavior. </P...|$|R
40|$|This {{collective}} {{case study}} investigated how <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> occurred in two racially and ethnically diverse, first year residential communities at a mid sized public research university.

40|$|This essay {{summarizes}} the author's 10 {{years of experience}} at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation mentoring secondary school science teachers during 8 -wk Summer Research Institutes. The summary {{is presented as a}} learning model, which we call the research dynamic. This model consists of three interlocked components: specified ignorance, <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and gateway experiments. Specified ignorance is {{based on the work of}} the sociologist Robert K. Merton. It is essentially the art of highlighting what is not known about a phenomenon but must become known for further progress. In practice, specified ignorance is framed as a hypothesis, a prediction, or a question. It is commonly the outcome of <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> which are the second essential component of the research dynamic. <b>Peer</b> <b>interactions</b> are the inevitable outcome of having teachers work together in the same laboratory on related research topics. These topics are introduced as gateway experiments, the third component. The most important attribute of gateway experiments is their authenticity. These experiments, when first carried out, opened new scientific vistas. They are also technically, conceptually, and logically simple. We illustrate the research dynamic with a line of seminal experiments in biochemical genetics. We provide evidence that the research dynamic produced significantly positive effects on teachers' confidence in their professional preparedness...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} three decades, the topic of children's peer {{relationships}} has taken a prominent position {{in the fields of}} developmental and clinical psychology. This reflects, in part, a growing conviction that children who enjoy strong and positive relationships with peers fare well in their social and academic lives and that those who suffer from peer rejection and friendlessness may be "at risk " for later socioemotional and academic difficulties (Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, in press). Why the latter group is at risk has not been well addressed {{from the perspective of a}} “grand theory ” of <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> and relationships.

Theories relevant to the study of <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> and relationships: A brief overview Piaget (1932), in his earliest writings, portrayed children's relationships with peers, unlike their relationships with adults, as being relatively balanced, egalitarian, and as falling along a more-or-less horizontal plane of power assertion and dominance. It was within this egalitarian context that Piaget believed children could experience opportunities to examine conflicting ideas and explanations, to negotiate and discuss multiple perspectives, and to decide to compromise with or to reject the notions held by <b>peers.</b> From such <b>interactions,</b> Piaget argued that children came to develop the capacity for sensitive perspective-taking; in turn, the ability t...|$|R
