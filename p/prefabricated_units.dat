50|$|The New Otani {{opened on}} 1 September 1964 to {{coincide}} with the Tokyo Olympics the following month. Its construction was requested by the Japanese government in order to fill a perceived shortage of hotel space for foreign visitors to the Olympics. Yonetaro Otani, a former sumo wrestler who founded and ran a small steel company, agreed to build the hotel on a site he owned. It had formerly been the site of the Fushimi-no-miya family residence in the Kioicho district of Tokyo (and before that, the residence of samurai lord Katō Kiyomasa). The 1,085-room hotel was built in seventeen months using a number of techniques that were revolutionary in Japan at the time, such as curtain walls and <b>prefabricated</b> <b>unit</b> bathrooms. The 400-year-old garden on the site was retained as part of the hotel.|$|R

It is notorious for being angular, with sudden changes of slope rather than a smooth arch. The flyover was closed for several months in 2008 for remedial work carried out to the road deck, with several sections replaced. It was found upon final inspection that the bridge parapets had suffered severe corrosion. The bridge was fitted with emergency barriers which meant that traffic was restricted to one lane in the London-bound (westbound) direction only. It has since re-opened for two-way traffic.|$|E

5000|$|Ground {{was broken}} {{on the first}} {{residential}} building at Pacific Park — B2 — on December 18, 2012. The building will have 363 units, 50% of those units will be affordable. In March 2011, The New York Times revealed that Forest City Ratner was considering building a 34-story apartment building out of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>units.</b> If constructed, {{it will be the}} largest prefabricated structure in the world. Given that, it is likely to face new engineering challenges, and it is not yet certain whether it can be constructed economically. However, if construction turns out to be feasible, the move is likely to save considerable building costs, because construction in a factory is cheaper than at a field site. While satisfying affordable housing advocates, it is likely to anger construction unions, who have been major supporters of the project. At 32 storeys tall, B2 will be the tallest building in the world constructed using modular technology. The housing component of the project has been criticized for its urban density. The construction of a 34-story prefabricated building, while not the first prefab high-rise in the city, would be the largest. However, B2 will be completed in late 2015 — more than ten years after Atlantic Yard's commencement — instead of 2014, the original expected completion date. It was only 13% complete [...]|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Modular {{structural}} {{systems are}} constructed using a method that they are assembled with <b>prefabricated</b> <b>unit</b> modular frames on-site. This provides a benefit that can significantly reduce building construction time. The structural design is usually carried out {{under the assumption that}} their load-carrying mechanism {{is similar to that of}} traditional steel moment-resisting systems. However, both systems are different in terms of beam-column connection details which may strongly influence the lateral structural behavior. Specially, the presence of access holes in a beam-column joint of a unit modular frame could cause undesirable failure during strong earthquakes. Therefore, this study carried out finite element analyses (FEMs) of unit modular frames to investigate the cyclic behavior of beam-column joints with the access holes. Analysis results show that the unit modular frames present stable cyclic response with large deformation capacities and their joints are classified into semi-rigid connections even if there are access holes. Keywords—Unit modular frame, steel moment connection, nonlinear analytical model, moment-rotation relation, access holes. I...|$|R
