5|$|There {{used to be}} {{two large}} geysers fields in Nevada—Beowawe and Steamboat Springs—but they were {{destroyed}} by the installation of nearby geothermal power <b>plants.</b> <b>At</b> the plants, geothermal drilling reduced the available heat and lowered the local water table {{to the point that}} geyser activity could no longer be sustained.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{original}} {{sections of}} I-94's predecessor highways in the Detroit area were given early names. The westernmost {{of these is}} the Willow Run Expressway, named for the Willow Run complex. The <b>plants</b> <b>at</b> Willow Run produced B-24 Liberator bombers for Ford Motor Company during World War II. The second, the Detroit Industrial Expressway, continued the route of the Willow Run Expressway eastward into Detroit. Both highways were built to move workers from Detroit to the industrial <b>plants</b> <b>at</b> Willow Run during the war and were later incorporated into I-94 in the 1950s as part of a Detroit–Chicago highway.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{wholesale}} destruction of <b>plants</b> <b>at</b> the K–Pg boundary, {{there was a}} proliferation of saprotrophic organisms, such as fungi, {{that do not require}} photosynthesis and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, such as ferns and other plants, returned.|$|E

5|$|Marine {{halfbeaks}} are omnivores {{feeding on}} algae; marine {{plants such as}} seagrasses; plankton; invertebrates such as pteropods and crustaceans; and smaller fishes.

They are in turn eaten by many ecologically and commercially important fish, such as billfish, mackerel, and sharks, and so are a key link between trophic levels.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{planting}} depth on emergence, growth, development and yield of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) in dark red soil (Shimajiri Mahji) were evaluated in Okinawa, Japan. Turmeric <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> {{the depths of}} 8, 12 and 16 cm emerged earlier and more evenly than that <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a shallower depth in both glasshouse and field experiments. Weed growth was unaffected by the planting depth of turmeric until 50 - 60 days after planting (DAP), but affected thereafter due to mutual shading with the canopy. Weed biomass at 90 - 140 DAP was significantly smaller in the fields where turmeric was <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> the depths of 8, 12 and 16 cm than in the field where it was <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a shallower depth. The turmeric rhizome (yield) developed earlier when <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> 8, 12 and 16 cm depths than at 4 cm. In a glasshouse study, shoot biomass and yield of turmeric were significantly greater when <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> the depths of 4, 8 and 12 cm than that of 2 cm. In field experiments, they were also significantly greater when planting depth was 8 or 12 cm than 4 cm. Even in turmeric <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a 16 cm depth shoot dry weight and yield were greater than that <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a 4 cm depth, but it was comparatively difficult to harvest rhizomes in this field. About 30 % of turmeric in the field <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a 4 cm depth was uprooted by a typhoon, {{but not at the}} depths of 8, 12 and 16 cm. The over all results suggested that rhizomes of turmeric should be <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a depth of 8 to 12 cm in dark red soil for a higher yield and lower weed competition...|$|R

5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes {{to be used in}} the manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their <b>plants</b> <b>at</b> Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line). DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the first}} expressways in Michigan predates the Interstate Highway System. During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) built the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways (now part of I-94) to carry workers from Detroit to the defense <b>plants</b> <b>at</b> Willow Run Airport. The state created the Michigan Turnpike Authority (MTA) in 1951, which {{proposed}} {{the construction of a}} toll freeway to run north–south in the state. The original termini for the Michigan Turnpike were Bridgeport and Rockwood. Interagency politics stalled progress on any proposed turnpikes while MSHD had three freeways under planning or construction.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{protests from}} TVA {{that it was}} unnecessary, the Manhattan District built a {{coal-fired}} power plant at K-25 with eight 25,000 KW generators. Steam generated from the K-25 power plant was subsequently used by S-50. Additional power lines were laid from the TVA hydroelectric <b>plants</b> <b>at</b> Norris Dam and Watts Bar Dam, and the Clinton Engineer Works was given its own electrical substations at K-25 and K-27. By 1945, power sources were capable of supplying Oak Ridge with up to 310,000 KW, of which 200,000 KW was earmarked for Y-12, 80,000 KW for K-25, 23,000 KW for the township, 6,000 KW for S-50 and 1,000 KW for X-10. Peak demand occurred in August 1945, when all the facilities were running. The peak load was 298,800 KW on 1 September.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even though}} on a per-individual basis, many other species are {{actually}} more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or {{as effectively as}} honey bees—in many instances they will not visit the <b>plants</b> <b>at</b> all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the beekeeping industry. In China, hand pollination of apple orchards is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the US Congress {{directed}} the Department of Energy {{to report on}} ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent, bringing their consumption below that of conventional power plants. A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent. A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 17 used wet-cooling systems. The four existing CSP plants with dry-cooled systems were the three power <b>plants</b> <b>at</b> the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow, California, and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County, California. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 planned to use wet systems (including one wet system using reclaimed wastewater), 7 planned for dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified.|$|E
