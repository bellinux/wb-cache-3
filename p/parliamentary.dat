5|$|Although {{political}} parties fund their campaigns using donations {{or their own}} assets, the government reimburses them for each <b>parliamentary</b> seat won. For instance, each seat won in the 2011 <b>parliamentary</b> election brought a party 180,000kuna (euros). Smaller sums were paid to parties or candidates failing to win any <b>parliamentary</b> seats, provided that they received more than {{five percent of the}} votes cast in a constituency.|$|E

5|$|Bath {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} extant <b>parliamentary</b> {{constituencies}} in the United Kingdom, being in continuous existence since the Model Parliament of 1295. Before the Reform Act 1832, Bath elected two members to the unreformed House of Commons, as an ancient <b>parliamentary</b> borough. From 1832 until 1918 it elected two MPs and then was reduced to one.|$|E

5|$|Created as a <b>parliamentary</b> borough in 1832, Oldham's first <b>parliamentary</b> representatives {{were the}} {{radicals}} William Cobbett and John Fielden. Winston Churchill began {{his political career}} in Oldham. Although unsuccessful at his first attempt in 1899, Churchill was elected as the member of Parliament for the Oldham <b>parliamentary</b> borough constituency in the 1900 general election. He held the constituency for the Conservative Party until the 1906 general election, {{when he won the}} election for Manchester North West as a Liberal MP. After he became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1940, Churchill was made a Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Oldham, on 2 April 1941.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{signature}} of the so-called Zurich Protocols the ARF left the coalition and became an opposition party once again in 2009, but relations with other factions in the Armenian opposition have remained frosty.

5|$|Following {{a review}} of <b>parliamentary</b> {{representation}} in Greater Manchester, Atherton {{is part of the}} Bolton West <b>Parliamentary</b> constituency. It is the only ward in the borough to be represented outside a Wigan borough seat (the remainder of the borough is represented by Leigh, Makerfield or Wigan).

5|$|In July {{the same}} year, Hareide {{received}} further criticism {{as the number}} of licenses to kill large carnivores allegedly was not only at a record high (12 brown bears, 10 grey wolves, 22 wolverines and 13 lynx), but also contradictory to the <b>parliamentary</b> policy on the matter. According to Hareide, the actions were in line with the <b>parliamentary</b> stance on the issue.|$|E

5|$|Local {{government}} for the town of Reading is principally provided by Reading Borough Council, a single level unitary authority without civil parishes. However some of the town's outer suburbs are in West Berkshire and Wokingham unitary authorities. These outer suburbs belong to civil parishes, in some cases with their own town status. Reading has elected at least one Member of Parliament to every Parliament since 1295. Historically, Reading was represented by the members for the <b>Parliamentary</b> Borough of Reading, and the <b>parliamentary</b> constituencies of Reading, Reading North, and Reading South. Since the 2010 general election, Reading and its surrounding area has been divided between the <b>parliamentary</b> constituencies of Reading East and Reading West. The whole of the town is within the multi-member South East England European constituency.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{typically}} sits Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays {{from early}} January to late June and from early September to mid December, with two-week recesses in April and October. Plenary {{meetings in the}} debating chamber usually take place on Wednesday afternoons from 2pm to 6pm and on Thursdays from 9:15am to 6pm. Chamber debates and committee meetings {{are open to the}} public. Entry is free, but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space. Parliament TV is a webcast and archive of <b>Parliamentary</b> business back to 2012. and on the BBC's <b>parliamentary</b> channel BBC Parliament. Proceedings are also recorded in text form, in print and online, in the Official Report, which is the substantially verbatim transcript of <b>parliamentary</b> debates.|$|E
5|$|<b>Parliamentary</b> {{elections}} {{are to be}} held no later than 60 days after the expiration of the 4-year <b>parliamentary</b> term, counting from the day that parliament is constituted {{with the election of}} a Speaker.

5|$|<b>Parliamentary</b> {{privilege}} protects contentious {{views expressed}} by MPs {{in the course}} of <b>parliamentary</b> proceedings in the interest of their constituents or the general public, and thus effectively buoys the right of free speech and expression. Members can speak freely and express themselves frankly in Parliament without fearing legal consequences because they are immune from any civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment or damages for what they have said.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution of Croatia {{mandates}} that the parliament consists {{of at least}} 100 members {{and no more than}} 160 members, elected by a direct secret ballot for four-year terms. <b>Parliamentary</b> elections are held within 60 days following the term's expiration or <b>parliamentary</b> dissolution (the latter takes place with a <b>parliamentary</b> no-confidence vote or if the parliament fails to approve a state budget within 120days after the government submits one for approval), and a new parliament must convene within 20 days after the elections.|$|E
5|$|The Device Forts {{along the}} Solent also fell into <b>Parliamentary</b> hands {{early in the}} conflict. Calshot was garrisoned throughout, as was Brownsea, which was {{strengthened}} and equipped with additional guns. West Cowes was rapidly taken after firing on a nearby <b>Parliamentary</b> ship, and the Royalist commander at Yarmouth quickly negotiated a surrender of his tiny garrison. The heavily outnumbered garrison at Southsea Castle was stormed by <b>Parliamentary</b> forces in a night attack. Like Camber, St Andrew's and Netley were rapidly occupied and then decommissioned by Parliament. In the north-east, Hull also sided with Parliament, and its castle and blockhouses were used {{as part of the}} town's defences during multiple sieges.|$|E
5|$|The European <b>Parliamentary</b> Research Service (EPRS) is the European Parliament's {{in-house}} research department and think tank. It provides Members of the European Parliament - and where appropriate, <b>parliamentary</b> committees - with independent, objective and authoritative analysis of, and research on, policy {{issues relating to}} the European Union, in order {{to assist them in}} their <b>parliamentary</b> work. It is also designed to increase Members' and EP committees' capacity to scrutinise and oversee the European Commission and other EU executive bodies.|$|E
5|$|The First English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642. During its early campaigns, Kenilworth formed a useful {{counterbalance}} to the <b>Parliamentary</b> stronghold of Warwick. Kenilworth was used by Charles on his advance to Edgehill in October 1642 {{as a base for}} raids on <b>Parliamentary</b> strongholds in the Midlands. After the battle, however, the royalist garrison was withdrawn on the approach of Lord Brooke, and the castle was then garrisoned by <b>parliamentary</b> forces. In April 1643 the new governor of the castle, Hastings Ingram, was arrested as a suspected Royalist double agent. By January 1645 the <b>Parliamentary</b> forces in Coventry had strengthened their hold on the castle, and attempts by Royalist forces to dislodge them from Warwickshire failed. Security concerns continued {{after the end of the}} First Civil War in 1646, and in 1649 Parliament ordered the slighting of Kenilworth. One wall of the great tower, various parts of the outer bailey and the battlements were destroyed, but not before the building was surveyed by the antiquarian William Dugdale, who published his results in 1656.|$|E
5|$|The Garden Lobby is at {{the centre}} of the <b>parliamentary</b> complex and connects the debating chamber, {{committee}} rooms and administrative offices of the Tower Buildings, with Queensberry House and the MSP building. The Garden Lobby is the place where official events as well as television interviews normally take place and it is used as an open social space for MSPs and <b>parliamentary</b> staff.|$|E
5|$|The Government is {{responsible}} to the parliament; some other institutions, such as the Croatian National Bank and the State Audit Office, also report directly to the parliament. The parliament appoints an ombudsman to promote and protect human rights and liberties established by the constitution, <b>parliamentary</b> legislation and treaties adopted by Croatia. The ombudsman is appointed for an eight-year term; the ombudsman's work is independent. The ombudsman, {{as well as all}} other persons authorised to act on behalf of the parliament, is granted <b>parliamentary</b> immunity equal to that enjoyed by <b>parliamentary</b> members.|$|E
5|$|The June 2000 <b>parliamentary</b> {{elections}} were Zimbabwe's most important since 1980. Sixteen parties took part, although the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)—led by trade unionist Morgan Tsvangirai—was particularly successful. During the election campaign, MDC activists were regularly harassed {{and in some}} cases killed. The Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum documented 27 murders, 27 rapes, 2466 assaults, and 617 abductions, with 10,000 people displaced by violence; the majority, although not all, of these actions were carried out by ZANU-PF supporters. Observers from the European Union (EU) ruled that the election was neither free nor fair. The vote produced 48% and 62 <b>parliamentary</b> seats for ZANU-PF and 47% and 57 <b>parliamentary</b> seats for the MDC. For the first time, ZANU-PF were denied the two-thirds <b>parliamentary</b> majority required to push through constitutional change. ZANU-PF had relied heavily on their support base in rural Shona-speaking areas, and retained only one urban constituency.|$|E
5|$|The <b>parliamentary</b> {{borough of}} Peterborough was {{abolished}} under the Representation of the People Act 1918, {{and the name}} was transferred to {{a division of the}} new <b>parliamentary</b> county of Northampton with the Soke of Peterborough.

5|$|The {{privilege}} of peerage {{is the body}} of special privileges belonging {{to members of the}} British peerage.

5|$|The war {{turned against}} the Royalist factions, and on 23 April 1644 <b>Parliamentary</b> forces {{commenced}} the siege of York. A Scottish army under Alexander Leslie came from the south, while a <b>Parliamentary</b> force under Ferdinando Fairfax came from the east. Six weeks later, Edward Montagu brought a third contingent to York, bringing the number of forces besieging the city to over 30,000 men. William Cavendish commanded the city during the siege, while Colonel Sir Francis Cobb was appointed {{the governor of the}} castle. Despite bombardment, attempts to undermine the walls and attacks on the gates, the city held out through May and June. Prince Rupert, sent to relieve York, approached with reinforcements, and through clever manoeuvring was able to force the besiegers to withdraw, lifting the siege on 1 July. The next day, <b>Parliamentary</b> forces defeated Rupert at the Battle of Marston Moor, six miles west of York, making the surrender of York and the castle inevitable. On 14 July the city and castle surrendered to the <b>Parliamentary</b> forces, who permitted the Royalists to march out with full honours.|$|E

5|$|There {{was little}} {{significant}} <b>parliamentary</b> representation for the burgher class, and none for the peasants.

5|$|Thus 65 new county {{seats and}} 65 new borough seats {{were created in}} England and Wales. The total number of English members fell by 17 and the number in Wales {{increased}} by four.

5|$|Under the Reform Act of 1832, a <b>Parliamentary</b> Borough was established. The Bolton {{constituency}} {{was represented}} by two Members of Parliament. The <b>Parliamentary</b> Borough continued until 1950 when it was abolished and replaced with two <b>parliamentary</b> constituencies, Bolton East and Bolton West, each with one Member of Parliament. In 1983 Bolton East was abolished and two new constituencies were created, Bolton North East, and Bolton South East covering most of the former Farnworth constituency. At the same time major boundary changes also took place to Bolton West, which took {{over most of the}} former Westhoughton constituency. Under the town twinning scheme the local council have twinned Bolton with Le Mans in France, since 1967, and Paderborn in Germany, since 1975.|$|E

5|$|When the English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642, Portland was {{initially}} controlled by <b>Parliamentary</b> forces. The castle was captured in 1643 {{by a group of}} Royalists who gained access by pretending to be <b>Parliamentary</b> soldiers. As the war turned against the King in the south-west, <b>Parliamentary</b> forces besieged the castle for four months in 1644, and once again the following year. The castle finally surrendered to Vice-Admiral William Batten in April 1646. It is uncertain why the castle, which was not easily defensible on the landward side, proved so difficult to take; the historian Peter Harrington has suggested that its low-lying position may have made it difficult for Parliament to bombard it from the sea.|$|E
