50|$|Vendor {{certification}} {{strategies can}} be misleading to laypersons. A common strategy exploits the layperson's overemphasis of EAL level with over-certification, such as certifying an EAL 3 <b>protection</b> <b>profile</b> (like CAPP) to elevated levels, like EAL 4 or EAL 5. Another is adding and certifying MLS support features (such as role-based access control <b>protection</b> <b>profile</b> (RBACPP) and labeled security <b>protection</b> <b>profile</b> (LSPP)) to a kernel that is not evaluated to an MLS-capable <b>protection</b> <b>profile.</b> Those types of features are services run on the kernel and depend on the kernel {{to protect them from}} corruption and subversion. If the kernel is not evaluated to an MLS-capable <b>protection</b> <b>profile,</b> MLS features cannot be trusted regardless of how impressive the demonstration looks. It is particularly noteworthy that CAPP is specifically not an MLS-capable profile as it specifically excludes self-protection capabilities critical for MLS.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} {{independent}} IT security evaluation according to published criteria has not realized {{its potential for}} the assessment of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs). Main reason for this was, that PETs were not covered appropriately in the evaluation criteria. This situation has changed somewhat, and therefore this paper reports on a case study, in which we developed <b>Protection</b> <b>Profiles</b> for remailer mixes. One reason for the development of these <b>Protection</b> <b>Profiles</b> was to test the privacy related components in the new Evaluation Criteria for IT Security [...] Common Criteria (International Standard 15408, ECITS/CC) and to develop improvements. Another reason was to contribute to an independent evaluation of privacy enhancing technologies. The experiment shows, that the ECITS/CC enable PPs for remailer mixes, but that there are still improvements necessary.

5000|$|The Common Criteria {{is based}} on this science and it {{intended}} to preserve the Assurance Level as EAL levels and the functionality specifications as Protection Profiles. Of these two essential components of objective robustness benchmarks, only EAL levels were faithfully preserved. In one case, TCSEC level C2 (not a MAC capable category) was fairly faithfully preserved in the Common Criteria, as the Controlled Access <b>Protection</b> <b>Profile</b> (CAPP). [...] Multilevel security (MLS) Protection Profiles (such as MLSOSPP similar to B2) is more general than B2. They are pursuant to MLS, but lack the detailed implementation requirements of their Orange Book predecessors, focusing more on objectives. This gives certifiers more subjective flexibility in deciding whether the evaluated product’s technical features adequately achieve the objective, potentially eroding consistency of evaluated products and {{making it easier to}} attain certification for less trustworthy products.
