5000|$|There are {{individual}} differences in some aspects of mind-wandering between older and younger adults. [...] Although older adults reported less mind-wandering, these older participants showed {{the same amount of}} mind-wandering as younger adults. There were also differences in how <b>participants</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> an error. After an error, older adults took longer to return focus back to the task when compared with younger adults. It is possible that older adults reflect more about an error due to conscientiousness. [...] Research has shown that older adults tend to be more conscientious than young adults. Personality can also affect mind-wandering. [...] People that are more conscientious are less prone to mind-wandering. Being more conscientious allows people to stay focused on the task better which causes fewer instances of mind-wandering. Differences in mind-wandering between young and older adults may be limited because of this personality difference.|$|E

The second survey, also done by Knowledge Networks, included 1,003 graduates of non-government schools and 505 graduates of government schools.

5000|$|A {{study by}} {{scientists}} at New York University and the University of California, Los Angeles, found {{differences in how}} self-described liberal and conservative research <b>participants</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> changes in patterns. Participants were asked to tap a keyboard when the letter [...] "M" [...] appeared on a computer monitor and to refrain from tapping when they saw a [...] "W". The letter [...] "M" [...] appeared four times more frequently than [...] "W", conditioning participants to press the keyboard on almost every trial. Liberal participants made fewer mistakes than conservatives {{when they saw the}} rare [...] "W", indicating to the researchers that these participants were better able to accept changes or conflicts in established patterns. The participants were also wired to an electroencephalograph that recorded activity in their anterior cingulate cortex, {{the part of the brain}} that detects conflicts between a habitual tendency and a more appropriate response. Liberals were significantly more likely than conservatives to show activity in the brain circuits that deal with conflicts during the experiment, and this correlated with their greater accuracy in the test. The lead author of the study, David Amodio, warned against concluding that a particular political orientation is superior. [...] "The tendency of conservatives to block distracting information could be a good thing depending on the situation," [...] he said.|$|E
50|$|Social Media Use during Disasters is a {{research}} project that was conducted from July 2012 to October 2013, {{and it is one}} of the major contributions by the START research center to the risk communication field. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter are used to collect and distribute information quickly and easily. Because of this function of social media, it is being used as a tool to communicate about disasters. “Given the growing importance of social media as a disaster communication tool, it is vital to understand how individuals use, behave, and interpret information on social media sites to better inform policy, guidance, and operations and to ensure that emergency managers, first responders, and policy makers can best optimize how they use these tools.”. A random sample of 2,015 U.S. residents participated in this study. The participants were asked to imagine that a disaster involving multiple terrorist attacks was unfolding. The participants were then presented with information from both local and national sources about the disaster through Facebook posts and tweets. Participants were then asked to complete a questionnaire assessing their responses to the information. The study found that the source of the information impacted its perceived credibility. However, the source alone did not influence participants’ likelihood of taking recommended action. The study also showed that after participants were exposed to the information they were more likely to communicate that information through interpersonal channels rather than through organizational media channels. Finally, the study also showed that demographics such as gender and age affected how <b>participants</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> the information.|$|E

Here we describe a system, based on psycholinguistic theory, designed {{to create a sense}} of rapport between a human speaker and virtual human listener.

5000|$|In Psychology, the {{numerical}} Stroop effect (related {{to the standard}} Stroop effect) demonstrates the relationship between numerical values and physical sizes. When digits are presented visually, they can be physically large or small, irrespective of their actual values. Congruent pairs occur when size and value correspond (e.g., large 5 [...] small 3) while incongruent pairs occur when size and value are incompatible (e.g., large 3 small 5). It was found that when people are asked to compare digits, their reaction time tends to be slower {{in the case of}} incongruent pairs. This reaction time difference between congruent and incongruent pairs is termed {{the numerical}} Stroop effect (or the size incongruity effect; SICE) In a numerical Stroop experiment, participants carry out a physical or a numerical size judgement task in separate blocks. In the numerical task, <b>participants</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the values and ignore the physical sizes and in the physical task, <b>participants</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the sizes and ignore the values. It is also possible to add neutral pairs to the basic task. In neutral pairs the two digits vary in one dimension only (e.g., the pair 5 3 for the numerical task and large 3 small 3 for the physical task). Neutral pairs enable measuring facilitation (i.e., the difference in reaction time between neutral and congruent pairs) and interference (i.e., the difference in reaction time between incongruent and neutral pairs).|$|R
5000|$|A study {{examining}} {{memory and}} embodied cognition illustrates that people remember {{more of the}} gist of a story when they physically act it out. [...] Researchers divided female participants randomly into 5 groups, which were [...] "Read Only," [...] "Writing," [...] "Collaborative Discussion," [...] "Independent Discussion," [...] and [...] "Improvisation." [...] All participants received a monologue about teen addiction and were told {{to pay attention to}} details about the character and action in the monologue. Participants were given 5 minutes to read the monologue twice, unaware of a future recall test. In the [...] "Read Only" [...] condition participants filled out unrelated questionnaires after reading the monologue. In the [...] "Writing" [...] condition <b>participants</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> 5 questions about the story {{from the perspective of the}} character in the monologue. They had 6 minutes to answer each question. In the [...] "Collaborative Discussion" [...] condition participants responded from the character's perspective to the same questions as the [...] "Writing" [...] group, but in groups of 4 or 5 women.

The [...] "Independent Discussion" [...] condition was the same as the [...] "Collaborative Discussion," [...] except 1 person answered each question. In the [...] "Improvisation" [...] condition participants acted out 5 scenes from the monologue in groups of 5 women. The researchers suggest that this condition involves embodied cognition and will produce better memory for the monologue. Every participant played the main character and a supporting character once. Participants were given short prompts from lines in the monologue, which were excluded from the memory test. Participants had 2 minutes to choose characters and 4 minutes for improvisations. The recall test was the monologue with 96 words or phrases missing. Participants had to fill in the blanks as accurately as possible.|$|E
