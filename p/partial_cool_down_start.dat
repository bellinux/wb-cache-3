40|$|Thesis (DTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. The water {{desalination}} process needs {{large quantities of}} energy, either directly from fossil fuel or electricity from the national grid. However, these sources of energy significantly contribute to problems such as global warming in addition to creating a drain on the economy, due to their high cost. This dissertation is {{a description of the}} research undertaken with the aim of producing a {{water desalination}} prototype; a novel approach that was designed using state-of-the-art solar water heating equipment, incorporating the technologies of evacuated tubes and heat pipes. During the execution of the project, various modifications to the original commercially-available solar water heating system were attempted, each aimed at increasing the production of pure water. Finally, the system proved capable of producing a reasonable amount of pure water after twelve lengthy indoor experiments conducted in a laboratory in the department of Mechanical Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Bellville Campus, Cape Town, South Africa. Each experiment lasted five days on the basis of seven hours of exposure to an average amount of simulated solar radiation, followed by seventeen hours daily of inactivity and <b>partial</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> of the system...|$|R

5000|$|Ensign Records owner Nigel Grainge commented {{in retrospect}} that [...] "A Fierce Pancake was an ambitious record, I {{think it was}} a well {{recorded}} version of the album they would have made as an indie anyway, they just wouldn't have recorded it so expensively. I don’t {{think it would have been}} greatly different. When you listen to 'Buffalo', that's the kind of record that the band who recorded ‘Buffalo’, was going to make. 'Buffalo' was put out as the third single when all else had failed and we actually got a little bit close, we did get some airplay, but I think by that time things weren’t really gelling. We just didn’t get the momentum, it was almost like the album's dead let's give the third single a shot." [...] In 2016, the band's drummer Rob McKahey said that [...] "the album credits are like a who's who, and this was all for us, we could have done it all ourselves. It was ridiculous, bad management, bad decisions; I mean it cost a fortune as well. I couldn’t listen to it for years, I just thought it was a mess, I can listen to it now actually, I can see beauty in it occasionally but I’ve distanced myself from it." [...] He told The Quietus that [...] "A Fierce Pancake isn't bad, it's a bit dense. People were listening to it going 'what the fuck were these guys taking?'

The optimization of the processing route in terms of chemistry and rolling schedule is carried out by means of hot compression and torsion tests. The control of austenite recrystallization during the multipass deformation and the subsequent phase transformation provides fine grained ferrite-martensite microstructure. The combined use of a new thermomechanical rolling schedule with an appropriate continuous <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> to martensite <b>start</b> temperature allows to produce a high strength level (750 MPa) based on a C-Mn-Nb steel chemistry which exhibits a very attractive resistance-ductility balance, a high toughness as well as interesting fatigue properties in the as hot-rolled condition. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Magnet System of the Steady State Superconducting Tokamak (SST- 1) {{has been}} {{completely}} refurbished under the SST- 1 Mission. Since Jan 2009, {{a wide spectrum of}} refurbishment has been undertaken which, includes developing reliable designs and processes leading to the fabrication of leak tight low DC resistances in SST- 1 magnet winding packs, equipping each of the sixteen SST- 1 Toroidal Field (TF) magnets with a supercritical helium cooled bubble type thermal shields and testing each of the prepared TF magnets under representative conditions in cold with nominal currents along with manifolds and isolators in near representative conditions. Each of the sixteen SST- 1 TF magnets has been tested fully and successfully in a dedicated test stand in nineteen campaigns during June 10, 2010 and was concluded on Jan 24, 2011. These campaigns ensured that all the sixteen TF magnets could be charged to their nominal currents of 10000 A in either two-phase or supercritical cooling conditions with leak-tight inter-double pancake resistances being in the range of 150 pico ohms to 1200 pico ohms. The supercritical helium cooled thermal shields welded in the inner bore of the TF magnets have also performed as per the design specifications. Subsequently, the assemblies of the SST- 1 TF magnets and the Poloidal Field (PF) magnets in SST- 1 machine shell have begun. The SST- 1 TF magnets are being assembled in pairs (known as octants) together with a SST- 1 vacuum vessel module, sector of 80 K bubble type thermal shields and a pair of outer-inter-coil-structures. The octant assemblies have been completed. The nine superconducting Poloidal Field (PF) magnets will shortly be assembled being supported from the TF cases. The resistive central solenoid magnets, compensating coils and the newly designed in-vessel radial control coils will be subsequently assembled. The assembled magnets inside the cryostat are expected to be <b>cooled</b> <b>down</b> <b>starting</b> from Jan 2012 when a detailed engineering validation of the magnet system would be undertaken.

50|$|Polyamide {{material}} is heated until liquid (typically at 410F/210C). The hot liquid Polyamide {{material is}} then injected {{at very low}} pressure, typically 50 to 200 psi (3.5 to 14 bar) into a relative cold mold-set (65F/18C). The low viscosity polyamide material flows gently into the mold-set cavity and around the electronics to be encapsulated. It also <b>starts</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> {{as soon as it}} touches the mold-set cavity and the electronics. A mold-set cavity is typically filled in a few seconds but a typical full molding cycle is 20 to 45 seconds. As the Polyamide material <b>starts</b> to <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> it also <b>starts</b> to shrink. Continuous injection pressure is therefore applied to the cavity, even after its initial fill. This is done in order to compensate for the shrinkage that naturally occurs when the Polyamide material goes from liquid to solid (i.e. hot to cold). The Polyamide temperature is not too hot for the electronics and does not re-melt or re-flow the solder. This is simply because the relative cold mold-set will absorb the brunt of the heat, thereby reducing the temperature that a circuit board may see. Millions of circuit boards are successfully over-molded without causing any harm in the process. A low injection pressure does not stress a fragile solder joint.|$|R
40|$|Until the mid- 1990 s Belgium and the Netherlands {{remained}} largely aligned {{in terms of}} output growth. However, since then they have shown a more divergent growth pattern as the Netherlands experienced a much more pronounced cycle than Belgium. There are three main explanations. (1) The Netherlands saw significant equity withdrawals from rising housing prices that only lessened as the real-estate market <b>cooled</b> <b>down</b> at the <b>start</b> of the new millennium, while the dynamic in the Belgian housing market has been much more modest and home equity withdrawal insignificant. (2) The inflation pressures and labour market tensions that built up during the late 1990 s in the Netherlands resulted in high nominal labour cost growth, a substantial loss in international competitiveness {{and the need for}} severe wage moderations in the ensuing years, which in turn reinforced the downward part of the cycle. In Belgium, the wage-setting institutions were more geared towards aligning wage developments to those of its neighbours, which prevented large swings in relative competitiveness.
