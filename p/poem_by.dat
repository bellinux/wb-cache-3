5|$|After Richard's death, King John of England {{failed to}} {{effectively}} defend Normandy against Philip's ongoing campaigns between 1202 and 1204. Château de Falaise fell to Philip's forces, {{as well as}} castles from Mortain to Pontorson while Philip simultaneously besieged Rouen, which capitulated to French forces on 24June 1204, effectively ending Norman independence. Philip laid siege to Château Gaillard, which was captured after a long siege from September 1203 to March 1204. As Philip continued the siege throughout the winter and King John {{made no attempt to}} relieve the castle, {{it was only a matter}} of time before the castellan was forced to capitulate. The main source for the siege is Philippidos, a <b>poem</b> <b>by</b> William the Breton, Philip's chaplain. As a result, modern scholars have paid little attention to the fate of the civilians of Les Andelys during the siege.|$|E

5|$|Eclogue 4, {{also known}} as the Fourth Eclogue is the name of a Latin <b>poem</b> <b>by</b> the Roman poet Virgil.

The work describes the birth of a boy, a supposed savior, who once of age will become divine and eventually rule over the world. During late antiquity and the Middle Ages, a desire emerged to view Virgil as a virtuous pagan, and as such, early Christians, such as Roman Emperor Constantine, early Christian theologian Lactantius, and St. Augustineto varying degreesreinterpreted the poem to be about the birth of Jesus Christ.|$|E
