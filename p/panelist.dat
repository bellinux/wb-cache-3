5|$|During his {{run as a}} variety-show host, Moore {{was tapped}} to host CBS' weekly prime-time TV panel show I've Got a Secret. It premiered on June 19, 1952. On this show, Moore began his friendships with comedian Henry Morgan and game show host and <b>panelist</b> Bill Cullen, {{with whom he had}} a long working relationship. Morgan later stated that Moore had helped him keep his job as a celebrity <b>panelist</b> on the show.|$|E

50|$|Hall {{then asked}} the <b>panelists</b> for an answer. If the player played it safe, {{then he asked}} each of the <b>panelists</b> for one answer. Should the player call for a longshot, {{if he or she}} said yes (that the <b>panelists</b> would get the answer), he only asked three <b>panelists</b> for an answer (or, if the {{contestant}} said no, that the <b>panelists</b> wouldn't get the answer, all five <b>panelists</b> were asked for an answer, and the first two were asked for a second answer, for a total of seven answers).|$|R

30|$|In {{the first}} {{brainstorming}} round, we provided the <b>panelists</b> with {{a description of}} the end-to-end structure of our Delphi study as well as with detailed definitions and instructions. In line with the results of the pilot study, the <b>panelists</b> had to name between six and ten reasons why processes show different behavior than intended (Schmidt et al. 2001; Okoli and Pawlowski 2004). To support the subsequent coding and consolidation, we also asked the <b>panelists</b> to provide a short description per reason. We also used the first questionnaire to gather further information about the <b>panelists</b> and to confirm that they meet the selection criteria. In this round, all <b>panelists</b> received identical questionnaires (Okoli and Pawlowski 2004). We received 192 responses from 29 <b>panelists.</b>|$|R
5|$|Parker {{was heard}} {{occasionally}} on radio, including Information Please (as a guest) and Author, Author (as a regular <b>panelist).</b> She {{wrote for the}} Columbia Workshop, and both Ilka Chase and Tallulah Bankhead used her material for radio monologues.|$|E
5|$|The Question Time British National Party {{controversy}} {{occurred in}} the autumn of 2009, due to an invitation by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to Nick Griffin, leader of the far-right British National Party (BNP), to be a <b>panelist</b> on Question Time, one of its flagship television programmes on current affairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour replaced The Garry Moore Show in the CBS time slot. Moore {{then made}} sporadic television guest appearances such as cameos on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, reunions with Carol Burnett on her program {{and serving as}} a <b>panelist</b> on various game shows, before Mark Goodson asked him to host another series.|$|E

30|$|The {{randomized}} questionnaire {{of round}} three was distributed to 39 <b>panelists.</b> Analogous {{to the second}} round, we invited all initially committed <b>panelists,</b> as <b>panelists</b> did not require specific knowledge from prior rounds to select the most important reasons. In this round, 33 <b>panelists</b> provided feedback. The satisfaction with the coding and the panelists’ overall satisfaction with the study increased to 5.73 (Table  1). Based on the panelists’ responses, we shortlisted all reasons voted for by at least ten <b>panelists,</b> i.e., 30 % of the panel (Paré et al. 2013). We shared this cut-off criterion and let it approve by the <b>panelists.</b> On this foundation, 34 reasons remained on the shortlist. One reason voted for by ten <b>panelists</b> (i.e., exactly the threshold) received qualitative comments about redundancies with another reason and was dropped after a discussion within the author team. Further, we dropped one category (‘IT changes’) as all related reasons received too few votes.|$|R
5|$|Affleck {{has written}} op-eds about issues facing eastern Congo for the Washington Post, Politico, the Huffington Post, and Time. He has {{appeared}} as a discussion <b>panelist</b> at many events, including at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Global Philanthropy Forum, and the Clinton Global Initiative. During visits to Washington D.C., Affleck has testified before the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights, the House Armed Services Committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Projects.|$|E
5|$|After Speers' {{retirement}} in 1957, John Middaugh was minister from 1958 to 1968. Middaugh {{was a regular}} <b>panelist</b> for ten years on the weekly television program To Promote Goodwill, an interfaith discussion of social and religious issues produced by WBAL-TV and broadcast worldwide on the Voice of America. He {{was also in the}} forefront {{of the civil rights movement}} in the early 1960s. Along with William Sloan Coffin and dozens of other clergymen and civil rights activists, Middaugh was arrested in a clash with police at Baltimore's Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in July 1963 over efforts to desegregate the popular attraction.|$|E
5|$|Avram Steuerman-Rodion, {{a socialist}} based in Iași, contributed a special series of {{articles}} documenting the growth of Germanophila in that city, and throughout Moldavia region. Titled Scrisori din Iași ("Letters from Iași"), it notably chronicled the conflicts between the enthusiastically Ententist University of Bucharest professors and their more skeptical University of Iași colleagues. Seara also enlisted contributions from physician Ottoi Călin, {{a member of the}} PSDR Executive Committee and author of its Zimmerwald pacifist manifesto. Despite this agenda, Ottoi was not employed as a political <b>panelist,</b> but, as a practicing physician, held Searas advice column.|$|E

50|$|The {{operations}} of a CIR are typically assisted by a moderator who is trained {{to ensure that}} all <b>panelists</b> engage in the deliberations. Over the course of a few days, the <b>panelists</b> not only deliberate among themselves but also question policy experts and advocates {{on both sides of the}} initiative. The <b>panelists</b> write a statement describing their deliberations in a form that can be publicized though means such as including it in the voter’s pamphlet. This statement summarizes what the <b>panelists</b> believed were the best arguments pro and con, and it lists the number of <b>panelists</b> who recommended voting both for and against the initiative.|$|R
50|$|In every episode, {{there would}} be a group of <b>panelists</b> that act as co-hosts, judges and {{commentators}} which could help the singer to choose his/her duo. Regular <b>panelists</b> include Park Myeong-su, Jang Yun-jeong, Seo Jang-hoon, Yoon Sang, and Han Hee-jun. Guest <b>panelists</b> include Hani (EXID), Noh Sa-yeon, Oh Ha-young (Apink), and many more.|$|R
5|$|Between 1947 and 1950, Moore {{began to}} make {{tentative}} steps into the new medium as a <b>panelist</b> and guest host on quiz and musical shows. On June 26, 1950, he was rewarded with his own 30-minute CBS early-evening talk-variety TV program, The Garry Moore Show, which was a shorter version of his radio show. Until September 1950, it was also simulcast on radio. During 1950 and 1951, he hosted prime-time variety hour summer replacements for Arthur Godfrey and his Friends. He appeared as a guest star on other programs including CBS's Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town.|$|E
5|$|The Sunday, July 5, 2015, {{installment}} of Amy Dickinson's advice column Ask Amy unwittingly featured a hoax letter that derived its situational premise from The Room and, even after being edited for publication, retained phrases from the film's dialogue; Dickinson addressed the hoax {{in the following}} Saturday's July 11 edition of the National Public Radio comedy and quiz show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, where she appears as a regular <b>panelist,</b> and her July 20, 2015 column.|$|E
5|$|The fourth QED was {{hosted by}} magician Paul Zenon, who co-wrote and {{appeared}} in the humorous opening film and was also a <b>panelist.</b> Notable speakers included Richard Wiseman, Elizabeth Pisani, Mark Crislip, Robert Llewellyn, Nathan Phelps, Susan Gerbic, Mark Edward and Deborah Hyde. The Ockham Awards for the year 2013 were hosted by Wiseman and included Skepticality (Best Podcast), Leaving Fundamentalism by Jonny Scaramanga (Best Blog), Nightingale Collaboration (Best Campaign), Superstition ain't the way: Kylie Sturgess at TEDxPerth (Best Video) and the QED organisers (Editor's Choice).|$|E
30|$|To {{validate}} these results, {{we performed}} a second brainstorming round (Schmidt et al. 2001; Keeney et al. 2006). This time, we asked the <b>panelists</b> to provide feedback on each reason and category. To provide the <b>panelists</b> with sufficient guidance, we presented them their input from the first round. To avoid bias, we implemented a randomized questionnaire, i.e., the order of categories and reasons per category were randomized (Paré et al. 2013). The <b>panelists</b> were also allowed to name new reasons {{based on their own}} or ideas and those of other <b>panelists.</b> We sent the questionnaire to 39 <b>panelists,</b> as 1 expert withdrew in the first round, and 27 <b>panelists</b> provided feedback. We distributed the questionnaire to all <b>panelists</b> who had initially agreed to participate in our study to leverage as much creativity and expertise as possible. As the average coding satisfaction was 5.63 on the seven-point Likert scale, the <b>panelists</b> were almost strongly satisfied with the consolidated reasons and categories (Table  1). Again, all co-authors evaluated the panelists’ anonymized feedback independently and then consolidated their individual evaluations. Not to get biased by individual <b>panelists,</b> reasons or categories were only changed or deleted if this was suggested by several <b>panelists.</b> Reasons were added, if they were not included in any existing reason. Importantly, our intention was not to keep the number of reasons for process deviance small in this round, as this was the objective of the narrowing down phase. Finally, we reached an agreement on 61 reasons on the medium list, structured into ten categories.|$|R

50|$|To {{establish}} the odor concentration, an olfactometer is used which employs {{a group of}} <b>panelists.</b> A diluted odorous mixture and an odor-free gas (as a reference) are presented from sniffing ports {{to a group of}} <b>panelists.</b> In comparing the odor emitted from each port, the <b>panelists</b> are asked to report if they can detect a difference between the ports. The gas-diluting ratio is then decreased by a factor of 1.4 or two (i.e., the concentration is increased accordingly). The <b>panelists</b> are asked to repeat their judgment. This continues until the <b>panelists</b> respond certain and correct twice in a row. These responses are used to calculate the concentration of the odor in terms of European odor units (OUE/m3).|$|R
5|$|The {{producers}} originally asked Anthony Hopkins and Clint Eastwood {{to provide}} {{the voice of the}} dentist, Dr. Wolfe, but they both turned the role down. Anthony Perkins was later asked to fulfill the role and he agreed, but died before the role could be recorded. In the end, the role went to Simpsons regular Hank Azaria. As well, the original <b>panelist</b> on Smartline was supposed to be O. J. Simpson, but he turned it down, much to the relief of the writers when Simpson was later tried for murder.|$|E
5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow <b>panelist,</b> punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E
25|$|Reilly {{was late}} for the taping of two episodes; Goodson filled in for {{him for the first}} few minutes of one, and {{announcer}} Johnny Olson did the same on the other. Celebrity panelists appeared in week-long blocks, due to the show's production schedule. A number of celebrities, including Betty White, Dick Martin, Marcia Wallace, Bill Daily, Fannie Flagg, and Patti Deutsch were semi-regular panelists, usually appearing several times a year. Celebrity panelists also included personalities from other Goodson-Todman produced game shows, such as The Price Is Rights Bob Barker and Janice Pennington. The panelists were all seated in a strict order; the male guest <b>panelist</b> of the week, Somers, and Reilly sat in the top row from the viewer's left to right, and the female guest <b>panelist</b> of the week, Dawson (later a semi-regular <b>panelist),</b> and a semi-regular female <b>panelist</b> occupied the bottom row.|$|E

50|$|Teams must {{guess the}} name of the artists in a themed segment which takes musical {{inspiration}} from one, or some, of the <b>panelists.</b> The game is played as a team; however, all of the <b>panelists</b> can score points for their team if they get the correct answer. <b>Panelists</b> have access to a cheat sheet for the last five seconds of each track.|$|R
30|$|Next, the <b>panelists</b> {{individually}} rated two longer {{video clips}} to determine consistency across dimensions. They were provided the entire rubric {{and were asked}} to decide which dimension the clip belonged to. Within the dimensions of Peer Interaction, Positive Communication, and Inquiry Rich/Multiple Paths, all of the <b>panelists</b> were able to identify and score each attribute within the dimensions for both video clips. Two of the attributes within Transdisciplinary Approach were also scored by all six <b>panelists,</b> and two other attributes, “discusses and approaches problem solving incorporating multiple disciplines” and “negotiates relevant method or materials to solving the problem posed”, were not apparent to four of the six and six of the six <b>panelists,</b> respectively. That is, all <b>panelists</b> made the same scoring choices for every dimension except for two attributes within Transdisciplinary Approach. Data from follow-up discussions and interviews showed that <b>panelists</b> believed the videos lacked an in-depth view of students “having discussions” or “negotiations” related to those two attributes, so they did not score them.|$|R
30|$|In recent years, {{guidelines}} and rigor criteria for Delphi {{studies have been}} proposed (Okoli and Pawlowski 2004; Keeney et al. 2006; Paré et al. 2013; Skinner et al. 2015). We accounted for this knowledge and elaborate on this in the next sections. In line with Dalkey and Helmer (1963), Delphi studies include <b>panelists,</b> ensure end-to-end anonymity, reach consensus iteratively via several rounds, and incorporate the panelists’ feedback in a structured manner. <b>Panelists</b> are experts who provide their opinion and comment on the opinion of other experts (Okoli and Pawlowski 2004). Experts can be organized {{in one or more}} panels. Ensuring anonymity is essential to avoid bias as, for instance, <b>panelists</b> with a self-confident appearance may influence other <b>panelists</b> (Okoli and Pawlowski 2004; Skinner et al. 2015). In addition, Delphi studies take multiple rounds to capitalize on the creativity and expertise of all <b>panelists.</b> In each round, the <b>panelists</b> should be provided with structured feedback such that they can trace progress and assess whether their input has been reasonably integrated into the overall position of the panel. <b>Panelists</b> should also be allowed to change their opinion and to provide feedback on both (intermediate) results and the study at large. Thereby, it is vital that <b>panelists</b> are not forced to adjust their previous responses (Paré et al. 2013).|$|R
