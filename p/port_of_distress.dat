40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} six {{studies that have}} {{examined}} a new conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance, the measurement issues {{in this area and}} the relation networks <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. In particular, the studies address three issues which are fundamental to understanding the nature <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. Furthermore, an examination of these issues is essential if a fully comprehensive account <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance, which is currently not well specified, is to be gained. The first issue to be addressed is insularity and the multifaceted conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. This issue was investigated in Study One, whereby a new conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance was employed. The second issue here pertains to measuring the construct <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. This issue was investigated in Studies One, Two and Three. Study One introduced the Distress Intolerance Five Factor – Short (DIFF-S), as a parsimonious measure of the general factor and the five facets <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. Study Two supported the concurrent and construct validity and the test–retest reliability of the DIFF-S. Study Three suggested that the DIFF-S demonstrates an association with the Mirror-Tracing Persistence Task and the Cold Pressor Task. The third issue here is the relation networks <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance as they relate to other relevant constructs. This was investigated in Studies Four, Five and Six. Study Four suggests that there is an emphasis on neuroticism in predicting general distress intolerance and the majority <b>of</b> the <b>distress</b> intolerance facets. Study Five suggests the involvement of attentional networks and directed attention {{in the structure of the}} five facets <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. Study Six reveal that, retrospectively, the mechanisms of the family of origin and parental bonding are involved in the five facets <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance. Overall, this thesis provides an advanced solution as to the conceptualisation and measurement issues <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> intolerance and also explores its relation networks...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{documents the}} {{positive relationship between}} financial distress and equity issuance and shows that dilution explains the low stock returns <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> firms. When the cross-section of firms is sorted by degree <b>of</b> <b>distress,</b> the value-weighted mean of the monthly net issuance rate increases significantly from 0. 05 % for the safest decile portfolio to 0. 95 % for the highest. Moreover, the low returns <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> firms are found only in past net issuers. The primary source <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> equity issuances is discounted private issuances. Unlike earlier empirical studies that focus on returns to existing shareholders, I find that firms that issue equity privately do not underperform when returns of existing and new shareholders are combined. I also show that many managers avoid shareholder approval when issuing discounted equity by keeping the fraction of new shares just below the required 20 % approval threshold. These findings suggest that dilution explains the low returns <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> firms. ...|$|R

These participants completed questionnaires measuring levels <b>of</b> <b>distress,</b> impact <b>of</b> the event, recent life changes and health profile at time 1 (5 days post rape), time 2 (15 days post rape) and time 3 (35 days post rape). the immunological measures included CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, lymphocytes, white cell count, platelets and mv(time 1 only). The results revealed significant relationships between levels <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> and immune parameters; health profile and immune parameters; ways of coping and immune parameters and levels <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> and immune parameters. Significant differences were obtained for CD 4 5 (p= 0. 039) between time 1 and time 2, as well as between time 2 and time 3.

40|$|Clinical psychologists do {{not appear}} to be willing to talk about their own {{experiences}} <b>of</b> <b>distress.</b> This may be due to the scientist practitioner model that has dominated the profession for some time. Recently, there appears to be a shift towards a reflective practitioner model with a growing interest in personal and professional development which may provide a cultural shift. It is clear from the literature that psychologists’ own experiences <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> prior to training, influence their decision to pursue therapeutic careers. In addition to this, there is evidence that suggests that the life experiences of psychologists influences the theoretical orientations that they use in practice. The present study aims to address the gaps in the literature by exploring the influence <b>of</b> <b>distressing</b> experiences that occur before training and how these experiences influence the decision to train as a clinical psychologist. Furthermore, the present study aims to explore how experiences <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> influence the development of a clinical psychologist’s preferred theoretical orientation. Eight participants‘ accounts were analysed by using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The following four themes were identified; how experiences <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> influence the career pathway to clinical psychology, being a professional who has experiential knowledge <b>of</b> <b>distress,</b> how personal experiences <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> influence how clinical psychologists relate to clients and how distress influences the way change processes are understood. Participants acknowledged the influence <b>of</b> experiential <b>distress</b> on career choice and on theoretical orientation, however this was one of many influences that were considered to be important.

40|$|We {{argue that}} risk premia affect the {{valuation}} <b>of</b> financial <b>distress</b> costs, because these costs {{are more likely}} to be incurred in bad times. We compute the NPV <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> costs using risk-adjusted default probabilities that are derived from corporate bond spreads. Because credit spreads are large, the magnitude of the risk-adjustment is substantial. For a firm whose bonds are rated BBB, our benchmark calculations show that the risk-adjusted NPV <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> is 4. 5 % of pre-distress firm value. In contrast, a valuation <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> costs that ignores risk premia produces an NPV <b>of</b> <b>distress</b> <b>of</b> 1. 4 %. The risk adjustment also increases the marginal effect <b>of</b> leverage on <b>distress</b> costs. We show that risk-adjusted, marginal distress costs can be of similar magnitude as the marginal tax benefits of debt derived by Graham (2000). Thus, distress risk premia can help explain why firms appear rather conservative in their use of debt...|$|R

We present a model of corporate failure in which accounting and market-based measures forecast the likelihood <b>of</b> future financial <b>distress.</b> Our best model is more accurate than leading alternative measures of corporate failure risk. We use our measure <b>of</b> financial <b>distress</b> to examine the performance <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> stocks from 1981 to 2008. We find that distressed stocks have high stock return volatility and high market betas and {{that they tend to}} underperform safe stocks by more at times of high market volatility and risk aversion. However, investors in distressed stocks have not been rewarded for bearing these risks. Instead, distressed stocks have had very low returns, both relative to the market and after adjusting for their high risk. The underperformance <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> stocks is present in all size and value quintiles. It is lower for stocks with low analyst coverage and institutional holdings, which suggests that information or arbitrage-related frictions may be partly responsible for the underperformance <b>of</b> <b>distressed</b> stocks...|$|R
