The partnership {{to create a new}} pharmaceutical manufacturing process was led by PATH’s Drug Development program (through an affiliation with OneWorld Health), with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and based on a modified biosynthetic process for artemisinic acid, initially designed by Jay Keasling at the University of California, Berkeley and optimized by Amyris. The reaction is followed by a photochemical process creating singlet oxygen to obtain the end product. Sanofi expects to produce 25 tons of artemisinin in 2013, ramping up the production to 55-60 tons in 2014.

40|$|High-tech tomato {{greenhouse}} systems, {{which are}} the standard in Northern Europe (especially in Belgium and the Netherlands), mainly aim for high yields, up to 60 kg m- 2. However, quality should be considered equally important, as consumers {{are willing to pay}} higher <b>prices</b> <b>per</b> <b>kg</b> for a high quality product. Influencing the plant water status is acknowledged to strongly influence fruit quality, as water deficit or increased salinity may result in higher dry matter content, a main determinant of tomato quality. Unfortunately, this increase in quality is often associated with a decrease in fresh yield, making a thorough insight on the controlling factors of both aspects critical if one aspires to optimise the final product value. The objective of the current research was therefore to combine plant water status monitoring with the assessment of an array of fruit quality parameters and yield, for both drought and salinity treatments in order to further clarify this interrelationship. To this end, we set up an experiment in a controlled greenhouse environment, where tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum 'Dirk') were exposed to four different treatments: control, drought stress, and two levels of salt stress (EC levels of 4 and 6 dS cm- 1). Plant water status was monitored by measuring stem water potential. Furthermore, fruit yield, as well as a set of fruit quality parameters (hexose sugars content, organic acids content, and firmness) was evaluated. Results showed that fruit quality does benefit from both drought and increased salinity, and that the highest salinity level scored the best on all measured quality aspects. Moreover, we observed that even small water deficits, induced either by mild drought or salt stress, improved fruit quality, without jeopardising yield. The acquired insights, combined with mechanistic modelling, may ultimately lead to a more efficient greenhouse management with higher quality tomatoes...|$|R

A simultaneous introduction of taxes on all three meat products can decrease emission of GHG, nitrogen, phosphorus and ammonia by at least 27 %. If only one meat product can be taxed, a tax on pork meat gives the largest reductions in emission of all pollutants, which to a large extent is explained by the high complementarity in consumption...|$|E

A total of 326 retail outlets were surveyed, and 33 (10%) were found to have tiger parts for sale, including skins, canines, bones, and whiskers.
