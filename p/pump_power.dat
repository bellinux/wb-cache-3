5|$|At the New York–Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which <b>pump</b> <b>power</b> into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E
25|$|The OPO {{consists}} essentially of {{an optical}} resonator and a nonlinear optical crystal. The optical resonator serves to resonate {{at least one}} of signal and idler waves. In the nonlinear optical crystal, the pump, signal and idler waves overlap. The interaction between these three waves leads to amplitude gain for signal and idler waves (parametric amplification) and a corresponding deamplification of the pump wave. The gain allows the resonating wave(s) (signal or idler or both) to oscillate in the resonator, compensating the loss that the resonating wave(s) experience(s) at each round-trip. This loss includes the loss due to outcoupling by one of the resonator mirrors, which provides the desired output wave. Since the (relative) loss is independent of the <b>pump</b> <b>power,</b> but the gain is dependent on <b>pump</b> <b>power,</b> at low <b>pump</b> <b>power</b> there is insufficient gain to support oscillation. Only when the <b>pump</b> <b>power</b> reaches a particular threshold level, oscillation occurs. Above threshold, the gain depends also on the amplitude of the resonated wave. Thus, in steady-state operation, the amplitude of the resonated wave is determined by the condition that this gain equals the (constant) loss. The circulating amplitude increases with increasing <b>pump</b> <b>power,</b> and so does the output power.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>pump</b> <b>power</b> is {{significantly}} above threshold, the two output waves are, {{to a very}} good approximation, coherent states (laser-like waves). The linewidth of the resonated wave is very narrow (as low as several kHz). The nonresonated generated wave also exhibits narrow linewidth if a pump wave of narrow linewidth is employed. Narrow-linewidth OPOs are widely used in spectroscopy.|$|E
40|$|Liquid cooling {{electronics}} using microchannels {{integrated in}} the chips {{is an attractive}} alternative to bulky aluminum heat sinks. Cooling can be further enhanced using nanofluids. The goals {{of this study are}} to evaluate heat transfer in a nanofluid heat sink with developing laminar flow forced convection, taking into account the <b>pumping</b> <b>power</b> penalty. The proposed model uses semi-empirical correlations to calculate effective nanofluid thermophysical properties, which are then incorporated into heat transfer and friction factor correlations in literature for single-phase flows. The model predicts the thermal resistance and <b>pumping</b> <b>power</b> as a function of four design variables that include the channel diameter, velocity, number of channels, and nanoparticle fraction. The parameters are optimized with minimum thermal resistance as the objective function and fixed specified value of <b>pumping</b> <b>power</b> as the constraint. For a given value of <b>pumping</b> <b>power,</b> the benefit of nanoparticle addition is evaluated by independently optimizing the heat sink, first with nanofluid and then with water. Comparing the minimized thermal resistances revealed only a small benefit since nanoparticle addition increases the <b>pumping</b> <b>power</b> that can alternately be diverted towards an increased velocity in a pure water heat sink. The benefit further diminishes with increase in available <b>pumping</b> <b>power...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Gain is {{achieved}} in a DFA due to population inversion of the dopant ions.

The RX 450h {{was scheduled to}} go on sale in the U.S. in mid to late 2009, with sales introductions for the RX 450h in Asia (including Japan) and Europe in the same year. The RX 450h features an upgraded 3.5L 2GR-FXE V6 engine (shared with the RX 350) which produces [...] at 6000 rpm, along with a new inverter which boosts total horsepower to [...] (with the electric motors providing an added [...] ). The new inverter is 8kg lighter, and more efficient. Up to three electric motors {{are used in the}} hybrid system, including two dual motors for the forward wheels (123kW output), and a third for the rear wheels on the AWD model (50kW; engages when slippage is detected or the throttle pressed firmly). The RX 450h's V6 engine now runs on the Atkinson cycle for added efficiency. Compared to the prior Otto cycle system, the Atkinson cycle has a lower compression ratio, along with higher expansion ratio inside engine cylinders. This system uses less energy to form fuel-air mixtures, and releases more energy. A lighter, more free-flowing oil (0W-20) is also used, reducing friction energy loss and oil <b>pump</b> <b>power</b> requirements. Two additional systems are added to the RX 450h's Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain, an exhaust heat recovery system to reduce engine warm-up periods (optimizing engine start-stop times, particularly in cold conditions), and a cooled exhaust gas-recirculation system to reduce fuel pumping loss. The electric motors use the first automotive application of liquid cooling {{on both sides of the}} high-current transistors, allowing greater contribution from the electric motors versus the gasoline engine.|$|E
