50|$|During {{the recent}} years due a {{combination}} of factors the Academy had been facing severe financial problems. Its precarious finances are barely adequate to maintain a skeletal staff on extremely meagre remuneration. Absolutely no funds are available for any kind of development plans. Even maintenance of basic services is not possible. Buildings have not seen repair and white wash {{for a long time and}} <b>publication</b> <b>programme</b> is badly affected. Modernisation of its famed library, preservation of rare manuscripts, publication of Hindi and English translations of its books and a number of other projects could not be undertaken due to the paucity of funds. Urgent help is needed to enable the Academy maintain its glorious tradition and continue to serve the community for which it was founded.|$|E
50|$|This {{firm has}} a very active <b>publication</b> <b>programme</b> that aims to {{preserve}} knowledge, {{in the form of}} old books, from being lost. An extensive list of about 200 travelogues gives a vivid picture of India specifically, and Asia generally. Many of the big names in Asian exploration and in the field of history have been reprinted. W. W. Hunter, H. H. Wilson, Max Muller, Rhys Davids, H. H. Risley, Edgar Thurston, G. Forrest, G. B. Malleson, Nicholas Greenwood, William Muir, Vincent A. Smith, Emerson Tennent, Wilhelm Geiger, Monier-Willams, Sven Hedin, Richard F. Burton, Francis Younghusband, William Moorcroft, M. Auriel Stein, Marco Polo, Heuin Tsang, Al-Beruni, William of Rubruck, and many more share this shelf space. Travelogues of people who, in the Middle Ages, frequented India such as F. Bernier, J. B. Tavernier, John Fryer, N. Mannuchi, Abbe Carre, J. Ovington, Alexander Hamilton, J. Neuihoff, P. Baldeaus, Father Montserrat, Ippolito Desideri, etc., have been given a new lease on life.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the death}} in 1907 of Romilly Allen, the Rev Rupert Morris, {{originally}} from Holywell in Flintshire {{took over the}} editorship. Morris had joined the Cambrians in 1875 and in 1892 he had become Chaplain and Librarian to the Duke of Westminster at Eaton Hall near Chester. Morris immersed himself {{in the history of}} Chester, his most notable publication being [...] Chester during the Plantagenet and Tudor Reigns , published in 1894, and he also edited the Chester Archaeological Journal. He then moved to St Gabriel's, Pimlico, a large London parish in the Duke's patronage. It was from here that he edited Archaeologia Cambrensis until his death in 1917. With the onset of the First World War the association was able initially to keep up its <b>publication</b> <b>programme,</b> but then reduced the issues of Archaeologia Cambrensis to two each year. The summer meetings were abandoned, with a general meeting being called each year at Shrewsbury. Much of the organisation of the association was undertaken by the noted geologist and Palaeolithic archaeologist William Boyd Dawkins, who had been born at Buttington, near Welshpool. Boyd Dawkins, who was knighted in 1917, stood in as president of the association between 1914 and 1919.|$|E
50|$|In 1909 Markham was succeeded as President by Sir Albert Gray, an ex-member of the Ceylon Civil Service. From {{this time}} onwards the Society began {{to extend its}} {{activity}} beyond that of publication. It supported {{the establishment of a}} memorial to Richard Hakluyt in Bristol Cathedral in 1911, and in 1914 Gray represented the Society on the British Academy Committee involved in organising the Shakespeare Tercentenary. The period also saw the emergence of women as editors and translators, notably Sigfus Blondal, Bertha Philpotts, Lavinia Anstey and Zelia Nuttall. Membership increased, largely on account of institutional subscriptions which by 1911 accounted for half of the 440 members. Sir William Foster, the former Secretary, served as President 1928-1945, and then as Vice-president until his death in 1951. Foster's skill in annotating rubbed off on his editors and resulted in a period distinguished by considerable improvements in the quality of the Society’s publications, together with a steady growth in membership to more than 2000. Foster was succeeded in 1945 by Edward Lynam, Superintendent of the Map Room at the British Museum (now the British Library) and the first of a line of post-war presidents whose terms of office were restricted to a period of five years. In the post-war period the Society's <b>publication</b> <b>programme</b> benefited from the labours of those of its voluntary officers who also took on editorial responsibilities, including R. A. Skelton, Eila Campbell, Terence Armstrong, Sarah Tyacke, Michael Brennan, Robin Law and Will Ryan.|$|E
50|$|The same year, {{together}} {{with a group of}} Palestinian intellectuals and academics Abdul Hadi founded the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs (PASSIA) in March 1987 to provide a forum for the free debate and analysis of a plurality of local and foreign perspectives. PASSIA is involved in four main areas. As part of its Research and <b>Publication</b> <b>Programme,</b> PASSIA has published over 120 different studies on a large diversity of subjects relevant to the Palestine question and the Palestinians, in addition to its highly popular annual diary. Another major component is the Dialogue Programme providing a venue for the presentation and discussion {{of a wide range of}} issues and viewpoints on matters of concern to Palestinians, with a focus on topical political events, interfaith issues and, most importantly, the question of Jerusalem which is a primary focus of Abdul Hadi’s interests and a core topic in PASSIA’s work. Speakers and participants at these meetings include local and foreign scholars, professionals, activists as well as representatives of political factions and the diplomatic corps. It can be said that PASSIA has proved most successful in serving as a catalyst for civic dialogue and in fostering a better understanding of Palestinian affairs - be they in the domestic or international context. A third pillar of the work undertaken by PASSIA is its Training and Education Programme, which provides a much-needed platform for Palestinian practitioners and professionals to deepen their knowledge and expertise in specific areas of international affairs and institutional/personal capacity building (with courses on strategic planning, leadership, management, and communication skills, to name a few).|$|E
