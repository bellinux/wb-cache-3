Immediately following {{the passing of the}} FQPA, the EPA moved to create the Food Safety Advisory Committee.

Within 10 years, the EPA had successfully reassessed 99% of the nation's pesticide tolerances (recommending the revocation of 3,200, recommending the modification of 1,200 and approving 5,237).

Many cities also have street newspapers, which are publications designed to provide employment opportunity to homeless people. While some homeless have jobs, some must seek other methods to make a living. Begging or panhandling is one option, but is becoming increasingly illegal in many cities.

500|$|In 352BC, Athenian troops {{successfully}} opposed Philip at Thermopylae,* E. M. Burke, [...] "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 184 (note 92). but the Macedonian {{victory over}} the Phocians at the Battle of Crocus Field shook Demosthenes. In 351BC, Demosthenes felt strong enough to express his view concerning the most important foreign <b>policy</b> <b>issue</b> facing Athens at that time: the stance his city should take towards Philip. According to Jacqueline de Romilly, a French philologist {{and member of the}} Académie française, the threat of Philip would give Demosthenes' stances a focus and a raison d'être (reason for existence). Demosthenes saw the king of Macedon as a menace to the autonomy of all Greek cities and yet he presented him as a monster of Athens's own creation; in the First Philippic he reprimanded his fellow citizens as follows: [...] "Even if something happens to him, you will soon raise up a second Philip [...] ".* G.

[...] Interspersed with spells of work, Lansbury attended schools in Bethnal Green and Whitechapel. He then held a succession of manual jobs, including work as a coaling contractor in partnership with his elder brother, James, loading and unloading coal wagons. This was heavy and dangerous work, and led {{to at least one}} near-fatal accident. During his adolescence and early adulthood, Lansbury was a regular attender at the public gallery at the House of Commons, where he heard and remembered many of Gladstone's speeches on the main foreign <b>policy</b> <b>issue</b> of the day, the [...] "Eastern Question". He was present at the riots which erupted outside Gladstone's house on 24 February 1878 after a peace meeting in Hyde Park. Shepherd writes that Gladstone's Liberalism, proclaiming liberty, freedom and community interests was [...] "a heady mix that left an indelible mark" [...] on the youthful Lansbury.|$|E

500|$|The {{result was}} a state of [...] "no war, no peace" [...] as Lithuania avoided {{recognizing}} any Polish claims {{to the city and}} the region, as well as refusing to undertake any actions that would recognize Poland's control of Vilnius even de facto. Lithuania broke off all diplomatic relations with Poland and continuously emphasized that Vilnius remained its permanent capital (Kaunas was designated as the temporary capital). Poland refused to formally recognize the existence of any dispute regarding the region, since that would have lent legitimacy to the Lithuanian claims. Railroad traffic and telegraph lines could not cross the border, and mail service was complicated. For example, a letter from Poland to Lithuania needed to be sent to a neutral country, repackaged in a new envelope to remove any Polish signs, and only then delivered to Lithuania. The conflict over Vilnius remained the most important foreign <b>policy</b> <b>issue</b> in Lithuania, but it became increasingly marginalized in the international arena. There were unsuccessful informal attempts to normalize the situation, most notably by the Lithuanian Prime Minister Augustinas Voldemaras between 1927 and 1928 and by Foreign Minister Stasys Lozoraitis between 1934 and 1936, who asked President Smetona to re-establish the diplomatic relations with Poland. Both sides engaged in emotional and nationalistic rhetoric.|$|E
500|$|Charles's English {{parliament}} enacted laws {{known as}} the Clarendon Code, designed {{to shore up the}} position of the re-established Church of England. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign <b>policy</b> <b>issue</b> of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his first cousin King Louis XIV of France. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, Titus Oates's revelations of a supposed [...] "Popish Plot" [...] sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir (James, Duke of York) was a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death on 6 February 1685. He was received into the Roman Catholic Church on his deathbed.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court, by a {{majority}} of five to two, decided that expert witnesses were not immune in the law of England and Wales from claims in tort or contract for matters connected with their participation in legal proceedings. This reversed a line of authority dating back 400 years. The case considered the narrow issue, namely whether preparation of a joint statement by experts was immune from suit, and the wider public <b>policy</b> <b>issue</b> of whether litigants should be able to sue experts that they had instructed for breach of duty. There was discussion about whether removing the immunity would have a [...] "chilling effect" [...] on the willingness of experts to participate in court proceedings, although judges {{on both sides of the}} decision agreed that there was no empirical evidence on the point. [...] Lord Phillips, a member of the majority, compared the situation of expert witnesses with that of advocates, on the basis that both owed duties to clients and to the court. [...] Advocates' immunity from claims in negligence had been removed in 2001 in Hall v Simons. [...] The change, he said, had not led to an increase in vexatious claims or a reduction in the performance of duties owed by advocates to the court. [...] Lord Hope, in the minority, said that experts and advocates had different functions and so disagreed with the comparison. He also pointed out that English law would now be different from Scots law on this issue.|$|E
