Highly ionised <b>plasma</b> <b>jets</b> and a neutral target could be very efficient (sigma CE > 10 (exp - 15) cm 2) to realisation of this atomic scheme. Theoretical estimates and preliminary experiments show that for plasma focus with a stored energy of several kJ one can reach a substantial population inversion for ions of light elements with charge number Z< 10.

50|$|Making {{a keyhole}} welds: An {{outstanding}} characteristics of plasma arc welding, owing to exceptional penetrating power of <b>plasma</b> <b>jet,</b> {{is its ability}} to produce keyhole welds in work piece having thickness from 2.5 mm to 25 mm. A keyhole effect is achieved through right selection of current, nozzle orifice diameter and travel speed, which create a forceful <b>plasma</b> <b>jet</b> to penetrate completely through the work piece. <b>Plasma</b> <b>jet</b> in no case should expel the molten metal from the joint. The major advantages of keyhole technique are the ability to penetrate rapidly through relatively thick root sections and to produce a uniform under bead without mechanical backing. Also, the ratio of the depth of penetration to the width of the weld is much higher, resulting narrower weld and heat-affected zone.As the weld progresses, base metal ahead the keyhole melts, flow around the same solidifies and forms the weld bead. Key holing aids deep penetration at faster speeds and produces high quality bead. While welding thicker pieces, in laying others than root run, and using filler metal, the force of <b>plasma</b> <b>jet</b> is reduced by suitably controlling the amount of orifice gas.|$|E

40|$|Repetitively pulsed <b>plasma</b> <b>jets</b> {{generated}} by a capillary arc discharge at high stagnation pressure (> 15, 000 psi) and high temperature (> 10, 000 K) are utilized to produce 0. 1 - 10. mu. m sized metal powders and decrease cost of production. The <b>plasma</b> <b>jets</b> impact and atomize melt materials to form the fine powders. The melt can originate from a conventional melt stream or from a pulsed arc between two electrodes. Gas streams used in conventional gas atomization are replaced with much higher momentum flux <b>plasma</b> <b>jets.</b> Delivering strong incident shocks aids in primary disintegration of the molten material. A series of short duration, high pressure plasma pulses fragment the molten material. The pulses introduce sharp velocity gradients in the molten material which disintegrates into fine particles. The plasma pulses have peak pressures of approximately one kilobar. The high pressures improve the efficiency of disintegration. High gas flow velocities and pressures are achieved without reduction in gas density. Repetitively pulsed <b>plasma</b> <b>jets</b> will produce powders with lower mean size and narrower size distribution than conventional atomization techniques...|$|R

In this paper, we examine {{what would be a}} worthwhile experiment {{to do in order to}} explore the dynamics of merging <b>plasma</b> <b>jets</b> to form a plasma liner as a first step in establishing an experimental database for plasma-jets driven magnetized target fusion (PJETS-MTF).

The experiment (PLX) described in this paper serves as Phase 1 of this four-phase program. The logic underlying the selection of the experimental parameters is presented.

By adjusting {{the structure and}} setting {{the location of a}} copper wire in the quartz tube, an intensive jet composed of two jets about 2. 4 cm is produced with microwave power of 50 W. The microwave frequency is 2. 45 GHz. Four twisty <b>plasma</b> <b>jets</b> about 2. 0 cm for argon discharge are generated in four tubes at incident power of 120 W. A plasma ball of air discharge about 0. 5 cm in radii is generated in the tube at the power of 100 W.

Significantly larger surfaces can be treated than with an individual jet. Further, {{the distance between the}} device and the skin is to a certain degree variable, as the skin is not needed as a plasma electrode, significantly simplifying use on the patient.Low temperature <b>plasma</b> <b>jets</b> have been used in various biomedical applications ranging from the inactivation of bacteria to the killing of cancer cells.|$|R
40|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>jets</b> {{with high}} {{momentum}} flux density {{are required for}} a variety of applications in propulsion research. Methods of producing these <b>plasma</b> <b>jets</b> are being investigated at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.

The jets must be sufficiently focused to allow them to be transported over several meters. A plasma accelerator concept is presented that might be able to meet these requirements. It is a self-switching, shaped coaxial pulsed plasma thruster, with focusing of the plasma flow by shaping muzzle current distribution as in plasma focus devices, and by mechanical tapering of the gun walls.

High-speed optical imaging reveals that dim diffuse plasmas emerge just behind the bright head of the plasma bullet at the starting point of the feather-like plume.

Commonly, the deposits remain adherent to the substrate as coatings; free-standing parts can also be produced by removing the substrate. There are a large number of technological parameters that influence the interaction of the particles with the <b>plasma</b> <b>jet</b> and the substrate and therefore the deposit properties.
