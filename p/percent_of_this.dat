5|$|SR-103 {{serves the}} {{function}} of connecting the town of Clearfield, and residents along I-15 to Hill Air Force Base. The base, , was the sixth largest employer {{in the state of}} Utah and is the third largest employer which is neither the state government nor a state-funded higher education institution. SR-103 is one of four Utah state highways that connect to Hill Air Force Base, the others being SR-97, SR-168 and SR-232, Only SR-168 has a lower average daily traffic count, with roughly 1,000vehicles-per-day traveling along the highway compared to SR-103's approximately 16,000vehicles-per-day. This is a decline from previous years (in 2007 the average on SR-103 was 22,525; in 2006, the average was 22,215; in 2005, 21,275). Four <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> traffic was composed of trucks. The measurement point for the traffic counts is at the eastern terminus of SR-103, the entrance to the Falcon Hill National Aerospace Research Park. The highway is codified as Utah Code §72-4-116, and is designated as a minor arterial, which the Federal Highway Administration defines as linking major arterials at a lower volume than a primary arterial.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} teleost {{is largely}} {{impermeable}} to water, and the main interface between the fish's body and its surroundings is the gills. In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their gills by osmosis, while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across the gills in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea in one hour, it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content, with 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> entering through the gills and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just {{two percent of the}} body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across the gills for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.|$|E

5|$|Fighting in Eastern Europe {{began with}} the first Austro-Hungarian {{invasion}} of Serbia in early August 1914. The number of Austro-Hungarian troops was far smaller than the 308,000-strong force intended when war was declared. This was because {{a large portion of}} the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had moved to the Russian Front, reducing the number of troops involved in the initial stages of the invasion to approximately 200,000. Forty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> force was composed of South Slavs living within Austro-Hungarian borders. On the other hand, the Serbs could muster some 450,000 men to oppose the Austro-Hungarians upon full mobilization. The main elements to face the Austro-Hungarians were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Užice Armies, with a combined strength of approximately 180,000 men. The Balkan Wars had only just concluded and Serbia was still recovering. Over 36,000 Serbian soldiers had been killed and 55,000 seriously wounded. Few recruits had been gained from the newly acquired territories, and the Serbian army had been stretched by the need to garrison them against Albanian insurgents and the threat of Bulgarian attack. To compound matters, the Serbian army was dangerously short of artillery, and had only just begun to replenish its ammunition stocks. Its supply problems also extended to more basic items. Many Serbian recruits reported for duty barefoot, and many units lacked any uniform other than a standard issue greatcoat and a traditional Serbian cap known as a šajkača. Rifles were also in critically short supply. It was estimated that full mobilization would see some 50,000 Serbian soldiers with no equipment at all. The Austro-Hungarians, on the other hand, possessed an abundance of modern rifles and had twice as many machine guns and field guns as the Serbs. They also had better stocks of munitions, as well as much better transport and industrial infrastructure behind them. The Serbs had a slight advantage over the Austro-Hungarians: many of their soldiers were experienced veterans of the Balkan Wars and better trained than their Austro-Hungarian counterparts. Serb soldiers were also highly motivated, which compensated in part for their lack of weaponry.|$|E
