40|$|The {{operation}} of nuclear facilities has, fortunately, not led to many accidents with off-site consequences. However, it is well-recognised that should a large release of radioactivity occur, the {{effects in the}} surrounding area and population will be significant.

This review paper details the various stages of a nuclear accident and the corresponding aspects of an emergency preparedness plan that are relevant to these stages, both from a UK and international perspective. The paper also details how certain aspects of emergency preparedness have been affected by the accident at Fukushima Dai-ichi and as a point of comparison how emergency management plans were implemented following the accidents at Three Mile Island 2 and Chernobyl.

40|$|A general {{computational}} simulation {{methodology for}} an integrated <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment</b> of composite structures is discussed and demonstrated using aircraft fuselage (stiffened composite cylindrical shell) structures with rectangular cutouts. The computational simulation was performed for the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment</b> {{of the structural}} behavior including buckling loads, vibration frequencies, global displacements, and local stresses. The scatter in the structural response is simulated based on the inherent uncertainties in the primitive (independent random) variables at the fiber matrix constituent, ply, laminate, and structural scales that describe the composite structures. The effect of uncertainties due to fabrication process variables such as fiber volume ratio, void volume ratio, ply orientation, and ply thickness is also included. The methodology has been embedded in the computer <b>code</b> IPACS (Integrated <b>Probabilistic</b> <b>Assessment</b> of Composite Structures). In addition to the simulated scatter, the IPACS code also calculates {{the sensitivity of the}} composite structural behavior to all the primitive variables that influence the structural behavior.

The results from the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment</b> for the composite structure with rectangular cutouts indicate that the uncertainty in the longitudinal ply stress is mainly caused by the uncertainty in the laminate thickness, and the large overlap of the scatter in the first four buckling loads implies that the buckling mode shape for a specific buckling load can be either of the four modes...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} a <b>probabilistic</b> safety <b>assessment</b> of radioactive doses as consequences from accident scenarios {{to complement the}} deterministic assessment presented in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Safety Analysis Report (SAR). The International Council of Radiation Protection (ICRP) recommends both assessments be conducted to ensure that ''an adequate level of safety has been achieved and that no major contributors to risk are overlooked'' (ICRP 1993). To that end, the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment</b> for the WIPP accident scenarios addresses {{the wide range of}} assumptions, e. g. the range of values representing the radioactive source of an accident, that could possibly have been overlooked by the SAR. Routine releases of radionuclides from the WIPP repository to the environment during the waste emplacement operations are expected to be essentially zero. In contrast, potential accidental releases from postulated accident scenarios during waste handling and emplacement could be substantial, which necessitates the need for radiological air monitoring and confinement barriers (DOE 1999). The WIPP Safety Analysis Report (SAR) calculated doses from accidental releases to the on-site (at 100 m from the source) and off-site (at the Exclusive Use Boundary and Site Boundary) public by a deterministic approach. This approach, as demonstrated in the SAR, uses single-point values of key parameters to assess the 50 -year, whole-body committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE). The basic assumptions used in the SAR to formulate the CEDE are retained for this report's <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment.</b> However, for the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment,</b> single-point parameter values were replaced with probability density functions (PDF) and were sampled over an expected range. Monte Carlo simulations were run, in which 10, 000 iterations were performed by randomly selecting one value for each parameter and calculating the dose. Statistical information was then derived from the 10, 000 iteration batch, which included 5 %, 50 %, and 95 % dose likelihood, and the sensitivity of each assumption to the calculated doses. As one would intuitively expect, the doses from the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment</b> for most scenarios were found to be much less than the deterministic assessment. The lower dose of the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment</b> can be attributed to a ''smearing'' of values from the high and low end of the PDF spectrum of the various input parameters. The analysis also found a potential weakness in the deterministic analysis used in the SAR, a detail on drum loading was not taken into consideration. Waste emplacement operations thus far have handled drums from each shipment as a single unit, i. e. drums from each shipment are kept together. Shipments typically come from a single waste stream, and therefore the curie loading of each drum can be considered nearly identical to that of its neighbor. Calculations show that if there are large numbers of drums used in the accident scenario assessment, e. g. 28 drums in the waste hoist failure scenario (CH 5), then the <b>probabilistic</b> dose <b>assessment</b> calculations will diverge from the deterministically determined doses. As it is currently calculated, the deterministic dose assessment assumes one drum loaded to the maximum allowable (80 PE-Ci), and the remaining are 10 % of the maximum. The effective average of drum curie content is therefore less in the deterministic <b>assessment</b> than the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment</b> for a large number of drums.

40|$|International audienceIn {{nuclear power}} plants, <b>probabilistic</b> risk <b>assessment</b> {{insights}} contribute {{to achieve a}} safe design and operation. In this context, the decision-making process must be robust and uncertainties {{must be taken into}} account and controlled. In general, the uncertainties in a nuclear <b>probabilistic</b> risk <b>assessment</b> context can be categorized as either aleatory or epistemic. The epistemic uncertainty, which can be subdivided into parameter and model uncertainties, is recognized to have an important impact on actual results of <b>probabilistic</b> risk <b>assessment.</b> Traditionally, the approach of an epistemic uncertainty analysis in nuclear <b>probabilistic</b> risk <b>assessment</b> often relies on the probabilistic approach in which parameter uncertainty is treated by using an assigned probability distribution, e. g. the log-normal one, and model uncertainty can be taken into account through sensitivity studies. Such an approach has been recognized in several recent researchs to present limitations regarding the impacts of assigning probability distribution in case of rare operating feedback data. In order to overcome such a limitation, in this article we propose a comprehensive approach for uncertainty analysis from the parameter and model uncertainties modeling to the final step of the decision-making process using the Dempster-Shafer theory, which is recognized to be more general than the probabilistic approach.

40|$|The {{high degree}} of {{complexity}} and uncertainty associated with aerospace engineering applications has driven designers and engineers towards the use of probabilistic and statistical analysis tools {{in order to understand}} and design for that uncertainty. As a result, probabilistic methods have permeated the aerospace field to the extent that single point deterministic designs are no longer credible, particularly in systems analysis, performance assessment, technology impact quantification, etc. However, as statistics theory is not the primary focus of most aerospace practitioners, incorrect assumptions and flawed methods are often unknowingly used in design. A common assumption of <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessments</b> in the field of aerospace is the independence of random variables. These random variables represent design variables, noise variables, technology impacts, etc., which can be difficult to correlate but do have underlying relationships. The justification for the assumed independence is usually not discussed in the literature even though this can have a substantial effect on <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment</b> and uncertainty quantification results. In other cases the dependence between random variables is acknowledged but intentionally ignored on the basis of difficulty in characterizing underlying random variable relationships, a strong bias towards methodological simplicity and low computational expense, and the expectation of modest strength in random variable dependence. <b>Probabilistic</b> <b>assessments</b> also yield large amounts of data which is not effectively used due to the sheer volume of data and poor traceability to the drivers of uncertainty. The literature shows optimization techniques are resorted to in order to select from competing alternatives in multiobjective spaces, however, these techniques generally do not handle uncertainty well. The motivating question is, how can improvements be made to the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment</b> process for aircraft technology assessments that capture technology impact tradeoffs and dependencies, and ultimately enable decision makers to make an axiomatic and rational selection under uncertainty? This question leads to the research objective of this work which is to develop a methodology "to quantify and characterize aviation's environmental impact, uncertainties, and the trade-offs and interdependencies among various impacts" Council 2010, in order to assess and select future aircraft technologies. Copula theory is suggested {{to address the problem of}} assumed independence on the input side of <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessments</b> in aerospace applications. Copulas are functions that can be used to define probabilistic relationships between random variables. They are well documented in the literature and have been used in many fields such as the statistics, finance, and insurance industries. They can be used to quantify complex relationships, even if that is only qualitatively or notionally understood. In this way a designer's knowledge regarding uncertainty can be better represented and propagated to system level metrics through the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessment.</b> Utility theory is proposed as a solution to the challenge of effectively using output data from <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessments.</b> Utility theory is a powerful tool used in economics, marketing, psychiatry, etc., to express preferences among competing alternatives. Utility theory can provide combined valuation to each alternative in a multiobjective design space while incorporating the uncertainty associated with each alternative. This can enable designers to rationally and axiomatically make selections consistent with their preferences, between complex solutions with varying degrees of uncertainty. This work provides an introduction to copula and utility theories for the aerospace audience. It also demonstrates how these theories can be applied in canonical problems to bridge gaps currently found in the literature with regards to <b>probabilistic</b> <b>assessments</b> of aircraft technologies. The key contributions of this research are (1) an Archimedean copula selection tree enabling practitioners to rapidly translate their qualitative understanding of dependence into copula families that can represent it quantitatively (2) estimation of the quantified effect of using copulas to capture probabilistic dependence in three representative aerospace applications (3) an expected utility formulation for axiomatically ranking and selecting aircraft technology packages under uncertainty and (4) a strategic elicitation procedure for multiattribute utility functions that does not need assumptions of independence conditions on preferences between the attributes. The proposed FAAST methodology is shown as an encompassing framework for the aircraft technology assessment and selection problem that fills capability gaps from the literature and supports the decision maker in a rational and axiomatic manner.
