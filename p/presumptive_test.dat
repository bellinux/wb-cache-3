5000|$|Sodium nitroprusside is {{also able}} to detect amines. This {{compound}} is thus used as a stain to indicate amines in thin layer chromatography. Sodium nitroprusside is similarly used as a <b>presumptive</b> <b>test</b> {{for the presence of}} alkaloids (amine-containing natural products) common in illicit substances. [...] The test, called Simon's test, is performed by adding 1 volume of a solution of sodium nitroprusside and acetaldehyde in deionized water to a suspected drug, followed by the addition of 2 volumes of an aqueous sodium carbonate solution. The test turns blue for some secondary amines. The most common secondary amines encountered in forensic chemistry include 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, the main component in Ecstasy) and phenethylamines such as methamphetamine. Sodium nitroprusside is also useful in the identification the mercaptans (thiol groups) in the nitroprusside reaction.|$|E

To ensure a <b>presumptive</b> <b>test</b> is reliable, accurate and replicable, {{it has to be}} validated. In this paper we present a method validation for the cost-effective, presumptive blood test, Hemastix® with sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) specifically for archaeology and buried residues. Hemastix®, a haemoglobin specific chemical reagent test strip (Hb-CRTS), was used {{with the addition of a}} chelating agent (EDTA) which increases the specificity of this test. It was conducted using a collection of 146 substances (plant, animal, metal compounds, chemical solutions including blood), 6 experimentally degraded samples, 177 experimental artefacts, 238 reference samples (on microscope slides) and 39 mixtures of substances. We also compared the Hemastix® and Hemastix® with EDTA test to two other Hb-CRTSs (URS- 10 and Chemstrip® 10 MD) and two additional presumptive tests, the tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) test and the phenolphthalein test. The results demonstrate that Hemastix® is the most specific, sensitive and cost-effective <b>presumptive</b> <b>test</b> evaluated which can be substituted with any other Hb-CRTS.

40|$|Bloodstains are a {{widespread}} kind of biological {{evidence at the}} crime scene {{and one of the most}} used reagents for the presumptive identification of blood for forensic purposes is tetramethyl-benzidine. We have introduced and validated the tetramethylbenzidine-based Combur 3 Test E (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Basel, Switzerland), a colorimetric catalytic test based upon the detection of the peroxidase-like activity of the hemoglobin, due to its high sensitivity, easiness of use and capability to maintain the complete structural and morphological integrity of the bloodstain. Analytical performances related to a forensic use of the test and the suitable applicability to the presumptive detection of bloodstains when extremely diluted, aged, mixed with several substances and deposited over a plethora of substrates was reliably proved. In addition, possible positive interferences of the test chemicals on the subsequent Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) DNA typing analyses, especially in Low-Template DNA (LT DNA) conditions, was evaluated. While the Combur 3 Test E showed the same chemical interference drawbacks as other <b>presumptive</b> <b>tests</b> for blood as for the low specificity, we demonstrated that its format and our suggested protocol of use make it appropriate for the forensic presumptive detection of blood, better performing and much easier to use than other analogous <b>presumptive</b> <b>tests</b> and usually compatible with the following STRs DNA typing analyses...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} the sample in a {{forensic}} case {{is one of the}} most important factors, since it determines the posterior analysis, helping to define or discard its identity (like blood versus semen). A <b>presumptive</b> <b>test</b> is a qualitative analysis that allows to identify, or confirm, the presence of a substance in a sample. These determinations usually occur, after a chemical reaction, and a specific colour is produced. A false positive is another substance reacting the same way, producing the expected result. The aim of this work was to evaluate the most effective <b>presumptive</b> <b>test</b> (with fewer false-positives) when analysing products that could look and behave like blood during a forensic screening assay. Eight different products were tested, like Betadine®, and four reagents were considered: Tetramethylbenzidine, O-toluidine, Leuchomalachite green and BlueStar® Forensic (BlueStar).

40|$|Numerous reports {{purporting}} {{the existence}} of form-specific antigens of Candida albicans have been published, but it is generally unclear whether antigenic variability is an acceptable alternative interpretation. In this study, we used indirect immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy to determine the distribution and form specificities of two antigens during yeast and hyphal growth in several defined and complex media. The results confirmed that antigen expression varies with length of incubation, nutrition, and serotype and indicate that the form specificities of antigens may be misinterpreted when conclusions are based exclusively on indirect immunofluorescence and extraction procedures. We therefore suggest that investigations be designed to include serotype A and B isolates grown in both complex and chemically defined media and that agglutination, immunofluorescence, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on whole cells or cell extracts be used as <b>presumptive</b> <b>tests.</b> Confirmation of form-specific antigens should be done by appropriate immunoelectron microscopic evaluation...|$|R

Material and methodsThe aerosols generated by dentistry and endodontic procedures were analyzed in 26 dental units of the dental clinic. Blood agar plates (n= 244) were incubated at 37 °C/ 48 h and the colony forming units (CFU) were calculated. All statistical analysis methods were conducted using the SPSS® vs. 17. 0 software (SPSS Inc., IL, Chicago, USA), using α= 0. 05 for the comparison tests used (non parametric tests of Mann–Whitney and Wilcoxon). ResultsThe IMA median value in the dental clinic was of 10. 4 CFU/dm 2 /h. Aerosols’ CFU counts were significantly higher at 0. 5 m and during endodontic treatments.

A novel application of visible wavelength reflectance hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has been used for the detection and positive identification of blood stained fingerprints in a non-contact and non-destructive manner on white ceramic tiles. The identification of blood was based on the unique visible absorption spectrum of haemoglobin between 400 and 500 nm.
