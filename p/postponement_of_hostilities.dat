50|$|From {{the middle}} 1930s the {{political}} {{line of the}} world communist movement changed. The so-called Popular Front against the threat of fascism rendered cooperation with socialists and others through unified workers' athletic festivals not only a possibility but the tactical order of the day. Plans were laid for a so-called 3rd Workers' Olympiad {{to be held in}} Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain in June 1936, under joint auspices of the RSI and the SWSI. The time and place proved inauspicious, however, coinciding with outbreak <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> in the Spanish Civil War. This forced <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> the event, which was rescheduled for the next summer in Antwerp, Belgium.|$|R

40|$|Context: <b>Postponement</b> <b>of</b> first {{pregnancy}} {{is known to}} be associated with a variety of interdependent factors such as age, education, income, occupation, religion, caste, and cash incentives. This paper examines the relationship and effects of some of these factors on <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> first pregnancy among newly married couples in Satara district. Objective: To study the interdependency of age, years of schooling, income, and cash incentive on <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> first pregnancy among newly married couples. Materials and Methods: This study employed quasi-experimental study design. Duly trained multipurpose workers interviewed husbands and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) interviewed the wives; preferably in separate rooms using pretested semi-open proforma. Statistical analysis was done using STATA® version 12 statistical software. Results: Out of 1, 355 participants; 704 couples successfully postponed first pregnancy by 2 years, but 651 couples could not do so. Participants were significantly successful in postponing pregnancy by 569. 13 vs. 353. 89 days for controls. Age and education of female participants were significantly associated with <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> first pregnancy; while age, education, and income of male participants were not associated with postponement. Conclusions: Higher age, more education, and higher income appear to be associated with acceptance <b>of</b> <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy and appear to be acting synergistically in both male and female participants as compared to nonparticipants...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Decreasing {{fertility}} {{has been}} accompanied with the rising age of mothers almost in all the Western countries. Because {{of the lack of}} individual level surveys, the reasons for the postponement are often studied indirectly with the macro level data. Our aim is to explore the individual reasons <b>of</b> the <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> births with a direct measurement instrument. The <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> birth is defined as a situation when a person {{would like to have a}} child but it will be delayed at least for two years. Three prevailing types of reasons – resources, life stage, partner-related – are analysed in Estonia and Finland. The data from the surveys in 1999 and 2002 are used for analyses. It was found that the life stage and the resource reasons were equally prevailing in both countries among the reasons <b>of</b> <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> births. However, life stage reasons were statistically more important in Finland than in Estonia. For different age groups and by different socio-demographic variables the reasons <b>of</b> the <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> births vary considerably...|$|R
40|$|Hierarchical {{reactive}} planning (HRP) is {{a popular}} method for controlling virtual beings' behaviour. The advantage of HRP is that complex behaviours can be described relatively easily. However, in particular situations problems with biological plausibility arise. This is partially caused {{by the fact that}} so called transition behaviours and <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> behaviour are hard to express in HRP. Transition behaviours are short actions that the simulated beings should engage in between two main behaviours in order to ensure a smooth transition between them. <b>Postponement</b> <b>of</b> behaviour is desirable in case the running behaviour is approaching the end and therefore should not be interrupted. In the present work we incorporate transition behaviours and <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> behaviour into the model of HRP and describe the implemented prototype...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor's {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the issue <b>of</b> <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> school attendance.

A questionnaire survey is evaluated and the survey results are interpreted in the practical part. The survey aims {{to find out what the}} most common reasons for the <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> school attendance are, what diagnostic methods are used by kindergarten teachers and how teachers focus on the issue of readiness of children for starting primary school...|$|R
