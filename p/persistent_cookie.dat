5000|$|First Visit / First Session - (also called 'Absolute Unique Visitor' in some tools) A {{visit from}} a uniquely {{identified}} client that has theoretically {{not made any}} previous visits. Since {{the only way of}} knowing whether the uniquely identified client has been to the site before is the presence of a <b>persistent</b> <b>cookie</b> or via digital fingerprinting that had been received on a previous visit, the First Visit label is not reliable if the site's cookies have been deleted since their previous visit.|$|E
50|$|Instead of expiring {{when the}} web browser is closed as session cookies do, a <b>persistent</b> <b>cookie</b> expires at a {{specific}} date or after a specific length of time. This means that, for the cookie's entire lifespan (which can be as long or as short as its creators want), its information will be transmitted to the server every time the user visits the website that it belongs to, or every time the user views a resource belonging to that website from another website (such as an advertisement).|$|E

50|$|The United States {{government}} has set strict rules on setting cookies in 2000 {{after it was}} disclosed that the White House drug policy office used cookies to track computer users viewing its online anti-drug advertising. In 2002, privacy activist Daniel Brandt found that the CIA had been leaving <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> on computers which had visited its website. When notified it was violating policy, CIA stated that these cookies were not intentionally set and stopped setting them. On December 25, 2005, Brandt discovered that the National Security Agency (NSA) had been leaving two <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> on visitors' computers due to a software upgrade. After being informed, the NSA immediately disabled the cookies.|$|R
30|$|Cookies may be {{subdivided}} into session cookies, erased when the browser is closed, and <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies,</b> preserved across multiple browser sessions. <b>Persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> are frequently {{used as an}} inexpensive way to store users’ preferences for a Web site. The advantage is that the Web site operator doesn’t need to maintain an account for the user; all pertinent information is stored in the browser, and {{made available to the}} site when the user visits it. Cookies may also be used for tracking purposes: a cookie lets a Web site uniquely identify the user (on a given computer) and link to her all Web pages she visited on that site. Tracking is possible within a single Web site or across a group of cooperating Web sites.|$|R
50|$|Another {{problem is}} cookie deletion. When web {{analytics}} depend on cookies to identify unique visitors, {{the statistics are}} dependent on a <b>persistent</b> <b>cookie</b> to hold a unique visitor ID. When users delete cookies, they usually delete both first- and third-party cookies. If this is done between interactions with the site, the user will appear as a first-time visitor at their next interaction point. Without a persistent and unique visitor id, conversions, click-stream analysis, and other metrics dependent on the activities of a unique visitor over time, cannot be accurate.|$|E
5000|$|The server's HTTP {{response}} {{contains the}} contents of the website's homepage. But it also instructs the browser to set two cookies. The first, [...] "theme", {{is considered to be a}} session cookie, since it does not have an [...] or [...] attribute. Session cookies are intended to be deleted by the browser when the browser closes. The second, [...] "sessionToken" [...] is considered to be a <b>persistent</b> <b>cookie,</b> since it contains an [...] attribute, which instructs the browser to delete the cookie at a specific date and time.|$|E
50|$|In the 2010 report, the FTC {{proposed}} a “uniform and comprehensive consumer choice mechanism” for OBA, {{referred to as}} “Do Not Track”. The FTC states, “the most practical method of providing uniform choice for online behavioral advertising would likely involve placing a setting similar to a <b>persistent</b> <b>cookie</b> on a consumer’s browser and conveying that setting to sites that the browser visits, to signal {{whether or not the}} consumer wants to be tracked or receive targeted advertisements”. The FTC believes that a Do Not Track mechanism is preferable to the existing browser-based cookie opt-outs as it is more “clear, easy to locate and effective” and it conveys the user’s choice to opt out of tracking directly to websites.|$|E
40|$|Many web-based {{services}} use <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> {{to store}} user authentication {{information on the}} disk. In these services, when a web browser connects to the server, it sends the <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> to automate the authentication process so that the user {{does not need to}} type in the username or password. However, current web authentication architecture does not have a proper expiration mechanism. As a consequence, a hacker can use an expired cookie to gain unauthorized access to the web services. To fix this problem, we propose two schemes for the web servers to efficiently store and verify cookie state information. We show that these schemes can effectively stop the replay-attack from expired cookies and can be easily implemented. Key words: Cookie revocation, Web authentication...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Federal agencies are using Internet "cookies" to enable electronic transactions and track visitors on their websites. Cookies are text files that have unique identifiers and are used to store and retrieve information that allow websites to recognize returning users, track on-line purchases, or maintain and serve customized web pages. This report discusses whether (1) federal websites complied with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) guidance {{on the use of}} cookies and (2) the guidance provided federal agencies with clear instructions on the use of cookies. GAO reviewed 65 websites randomly selected from the General Services Administration's government domain registry database between November 2000 and January 2001 to determine whether they used <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> and whether such use was disclosed in the website's privacy policy. As of January 2001, most of the websites reviewed were following OMB's guidance on the use of cookies. Of the 65 sites GAO reviewed, 57 did not use <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> on their websites, eight used <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies,</b> four did not disclose such use in their privacy policy, and the remaining four sites using <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> did provide disclosure but did not meet OMB's other conditions for using cookies. In addition, four other sites that did not use cookies did not post privacy policies on their home pages. Those sites were taking, or planning to take, corrective action to address their noncompliance with OMB guidance. GAO found that although OMB's guidance proved useful in ensuring that federal websites address privacy issues, the guidance remained fragmented, with multiple documents addressing various aspects of Web site privacy and cookie issues. In addition, the guidance did not provide clear direction on the disclosure of session cookies. ...|$|R
50|$|The news {{organization}} should not record any {{information regarding the}} uploader, i.e., their IP address or information about the computer used, and the browser does not enable <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> or allow third party embedding. Anonymity is not guaranteed, but the creators claim {{that the system is}} safer than electronic mail.|$|R
5000|$|Visitor / Unique Visitor / Unique User - The uniquely {{identified}} client that is generating {{page views}} or hits within a defined time period (e.g. day, week or month). A uniquely identified client {{is usually a}} combination of a machine (one's desktop computer at work for example) and a browser (Firefox on that machine). The identification is usually via a <b>persistent</b> <b>cookie</b> that has been placed on the computer by the site page code. An older method, used in log file analysis, is the unique combination of the computer's IP address and the User Agent (browser) information provided to the web server by the browser. It is important to understand that the [...] "Visitor" [...] {{is not the same as}} the human being sitting at the computer at the time of the visit, since an individual human can use different computers or, on the same computer, can use different browsers, and will be seen as a different visitor in each circumstance. Increasingly, but still somewhat rarely, visitors are uniquely identified by Flash LSO's (Local Shared Object), which are less susceptible to privacy enforcement.|$|E
50|$|Because ETags are cached by {{the browser}} and {{returned}} with subsequent requests for the same resource, a tracking server can simply repeat any ETag received from the browser to ensure an assigned ETag persists indefinitely (in a similar way to <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies).</b> Additional caching headers can also enhance the preservation of ETag data.|$|R
5000|$|WorkLenz was a {{web based}} project {{portfolio}} management application with no active controls and no <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies.</b> It {{was built on}} the [...]NET framework and was available in two delivery methods: self-hosted or software as a service (SaaS). WorkLenz enabled the select, control and evaluate process for enterprise software projects and investments.|$|R

5000|$|For this reason, <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as tracking cookies because they can be used by advertisers to record information about a user's web browsing habits {{over an extended period of}} time. However, they are also used for [...] "legitimate" [...] reasons (such as keeping users logged into their accounts on websites, to avoid re-entering login credentials at every visit).|$|R
50|$|The HTML5 {{standard}} (which {{most modern}} web browsers support to some extent) includes a JavaScript API called Web storage that allows {{two types of}} storage: local storage and session storage. Local storage behaves similarly to <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> while session storage behaves similarly to session cookies, except that session storage is tied to an individual tab/window's lifetime (AKA a page session), not to a whole browser session like session cookies.|$|R
50|$|Web storage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} DOM storage (Document Object Model storage), provides web application software {{methods and protocols}} used for storing data in a web browser. Web storage supports persistent data storage, similar to cookies but with a greatly enhanced capacity and no information stored in the HTTP request header. There are two main web storage types: local storage and session storage, behaving similarly to <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> and session cookies respectively.|$|R
40|$|Now a days, {{internet}} {{marketing is}} on peak. Most {{of the companies}} use internet for marketing and advertisements of their business. For tracking visitors, cookies are stored in their browser by these company websites. But what, if visitor deleted the cookies stored? So it is really difficult to maintain a 100 % correct record of visitors. So {{a new type of}} cookie is created which is really difficult to delete. The main purpose of this is to identify a returning visitor even if he/she has tried to delete the cookies stored in the browser. Samy Kamkar created a java script API for creating <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies.</b> This API is called evercookie...|$|R
30|$|The {{two primary}} areas for {{evidence}} collection on the cloud consumer side are devices and networks {{used by the}} users to access cloud services. In other words, forensic data {{that can be found}} at the consumer premises may either be data stored in a device or data flowing through local network of the consuming organization. Usually, the kind of forensic data that can be extracted from a device residing on the premises of the CSCs may include history logs, temp data, the registry, access logs, chat logs, session data and <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> that can be found on the web browsers through which the CSCs are accessing their adopted cloud services [15]. Similarly, network forensic data may also include filesystems, processes and network traffic. Therefore, once potential sources of digital evidence in the CSCs is identified, live digital evidence is immediately collected in a forensically sound manner.|$|R
5000|$|Samy Kamkar {{released}} v0.4 beta of the Evercookie on September 13, 2010, as open source. [...] According to the project's website: Evercookie {{is designed}} to make persistent data just that, persistent. By storing the same data in several locations that a client can access, {{if any of the}} data is ever lost (for example, by clearing cookies), the data can be recovered and then reset and reused. Simply think of it as cookies that just won't go away. Evercookie is a javascript API available that produces extremely <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies</b> in a browser. Its goal is to identify a client even after they've removed standard cookies, Flash cookies (Local Shared Objects or LSOs), and others. Evercookie accomplishes this by storing the cookie data in several types of storage mechanisms that are available on the local browser. Additionally, if Evercookie has found the user has removed any of the types of cookies in question, it recreates them using each mechanism available.|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Although the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) has taken actions to improve many of its information technology (IT) management processes, it continues to face substantive challenges that, if left incomplete, could disrupt existing progress and threaten the viability of its existing and future IT spending. VA has yet to fill its full-time department chief information officer vacancy since the position's creation three years ago. In addition, sustained leadership and commitment are necessary to improve VA's departmentwide computer security program, especially as VA begins to move some of its information and services to veterans onto the Internet. And although VA {{has done a good}} job of posting privacy and security notices on its websites, it should focus more attention on complying with Office of Management and Budget policies prohibiting the use of <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies.</b> Furthermore, until VA defines and begins to implement a departmentwide, enterprise architecture, it will continue to encounter costly difficulties in achieving its "One VA" vision. Finally, VA faces important decisions on making greater use of the Decision Support System and on the continued development and wide-scale implementation of the compensation and pension replacement project. Continued attention and full implementation of past recommendations by GAO and others are essential for achieving better IT management outcomes. ...|$|R
40|$|Authentication cookies {{allow for}} {{convenient}} online user authentication, but potential security prob-lems may be encountered if a malicious adversary {{were able to}} obtain a given user’s authentication cookie. The Firefox add-on, Firesheep, and cross-site scripting methods have demonstrated that attackers are capable of achieving this goal. In this study, we hope to survey user logins across the Web in order to evaluate the vulnerability of user accounts on major websites and to gain insight on potential defenses. Our approach consists of running two browser profile instances per site: a primary crawler and a shadow crawler. For every website, the primary profile performs a legitimate login and saves the <b>persistent</b> <b>cookies.</b> The secondary profile loads the cookies and visits the same website. If the resulting webpage recognizes a user as having logged in, then the attack is considered successful. For different tests, the shadow crawler is instantiated on either the same computer as the primary crawler, or remotely, on a computer with a different browser fingerprint and IP address. The {{findings of this study}} show that on a large scale, many sites do not yet implement additional authentication factors once an authentication cookie is obtained. We see industry beginning to develop more secure systems, and hope to encourage further progress with our results. In addition, specialized Web security companies have emerged, using more sophisticated methods to protect user accounts that will require investigation. 1...|$|R
25|$|When some users {{choose to}} disable HTTP cookie to reduce privacy risks as noted, {{new types of}} cookies were invented: since cookies are advertisers' main way of {{targeting}} potential customers, and some customers were deleting cookies, some advertisers started to use <b>persistent</b> Flash <b>cookies</b> and zombie cookies. In a 2009 study, Flash cookies {{were found to be}} a popular mechanism for storing data on the top 100 most visited sites. Another 2011 study of social media found that, “Of the top 100 web sites, 31 had at least one overlap between HTTP and Flash cookies.” However, modern browsers and anti-malware software can now block or detect and remove such cookies.|$|R
30|$|Even {{traditional}} cookies remain {{somewhat of}} a mystery to many end users, {{but at least they}} contain the Domain attribute that hints at the cookies’ scope and applicability. Names of XDC cookies, on the other hand, are digests of public keys, and do not contain any information that may be recognized by the users. To mitigate this we suggest that browsers maintain a running log of recent use of all <b>persistent</b> XDC <b>cookies</b> capturing the channel name, the host name of the Web server reading or writing the cookie, the date and time of its last access, the type of access, and, possibly, the value set. This log can be used by administrators and advanced users to analyze XDC access patterns and modify their browsers’ cookie acceptance rules if needed.|$|R
25|$|In the past, {{web sites}} have not {{generally}} made the user explicitly {{aware of the}} storing of cookies, however tracking cookies and especially third-party tracking cookies are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories — a privacy concern that prompted European and US lawmakers to take action in 2011. Cookies can also have implications for computer forensics. In past years, most computer users were not completely aware of cookies, but recently, users have become conscious of possible detrimental effects of Internet cookies: a recent study done has shown that 58% of users have at least once, deleted cookies from their computer, and that 39% of users delete cookies from their computer every month. Since cookies are advertisers' main way of targeting potential customers, and some customers are deleting cookies, some advertisers started to use <b>persistent</b> Flash <b>cookies</b> and zombie cookies, but modern browsers and anti-malware software can now block or detect and remove such cookies.|$|R
