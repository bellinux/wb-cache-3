5000|$|Backpage.com, LLC v. Cooper — In 2012, {{the state}} of Tennessee passed similar {{legislation}} mirroring most of the language in the Washington law. The law specifically targeted Backpage. Backpage filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Tennessee seeking a restraining order and temporary injunction to prevent enforcement of this law. In January 2013, United States District Judge John T. Nixon granted the motion. A permanent injunction and Final judgment was granted on March 27, 2013 holding that it was likely unconstitutional and [...] "directly at odds" [...] with Section 230. The court rejected the State's argument that its statute [...] "does not implicate First Amendment scrutiny because it criminalizes only offers to engage in illegal transactions." [...] Rather, {{the court held that}} under the First Amendment, the State must prove a defendant's scienter that specific speech is unlawful [...] "to avoid the hazard of self-censorship," [...] and therefore the State's <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> would impose [...] "an impossible burden" [...] on [...] "websites such as Backpage.com [...] [...] [...] to review all of their millions of postings or, more likely, shut down their adult services section entirely." [...] Invalidating the Tennessee law, the court held that state efforts to censor or chill an entire category of speech on a website fail because, [...] "when freedom of speech hangs in the balance—the state may not use a butcher knife on a problem that requires a scalpel to fix." ...|$|E
50|$|After a {{landslide}} election victory, Johnson used his State of the Union address in January 1965 to, among other things, promise a voting rights act. It was Cox {{who developed the}} first draft. The mechanism devised by Cox was to provide for a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> of a list of practices including literacy tests and similar devices if the state {{had a history of}} low minority voter turn-out as shown by voter statistics. In such cases the burden was shifted to the state to prove nondiscriminatory intent. This mechanism remained the heart of the legislation throughout the legislative process. Both Ramsey Clark and Nicholas Katzenbach admired the mechanism for its legal craftsmanship and statecraft (because it avoided the need to prove intent to discriminate). Before the bill was submitted to Congress Cox answered a question in Court which was used by nationally syndicated columnist Drew Pearson to embarrass Cox before the new president. On January 28, Cox urged the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court decision which held that the federal government had no power to sue a state alleging violation of the Fifteenth Amendment by discriminatory devices aimed at African-Americans. Cox argued the narrow ground that the government had such power. When the Court expressly asked Cox whether he was asking the Court to strike down the statutes, Cox answered that he was not, only that the case be remanded to the three-court panel. The Court's opinion, delivered on March 8, highlighted this exchange {{in such a way that}} some inferred that Cox passed up a golden opportunity. Pearson's column stated that Cox had cost the civil rights movement two years in litigation, and for that he point blank suggested that Johnson replace Cox as solicitor general.|$|E
40|$|Resale price {{maintenance}} {{is a particularly}} dangerous vertical intrabrand restraint. Because of its direct impact on price competition, {{it is likely to}} harm consumers in a substantial number of cases. At the same time, RPM is likely to benefit consumers in a significant number of other cases. Given these mixed effects, the ideal legal standard would distinguish between those instances in which RPM is anticompetitive and those in which it is procompetitive. While Leegin thought that the full rule of reason could play this role, it did not acknowledge what every scholar who has looked at the issue has found-that the full rule of reason has operated in practice as a standard of virtual per se legality, absolving almost every restraint examined. This article proposes an alternative approach-a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> combined with safe harbors-and explains why it is likely to produce better results at lower cost...|$|E

40|$|International {{trade has}} changed {{some of the}} {{challenges}} faced by antitrust authorities: it has added an international dimension. Under {{the current system of}} international antitrust, the backbone of enforcement is unilateral: each country applies its own tools to deal with international antitrust issues within the constraints imposed upon it by public international law. This enforcement pattern is sometimes coupled with cooperation agreements which are based on the realization that while cooperation among firms might be anti-competitive, this is generally not true for cooperation among countries. Yet such cooperation is often limited. This paper, which is part of a book on Cooperation, Comity And Competition Policy (Oxford University Press, 2009), analyzes the effects that a unilateral enforcement system has on a small economy, by focusing on a specific case study: Israel. The case of Israel is interesting not only as a stand-alone case study, but mostly because it provides useful insights into the reality of enforcing antitrust in a globalized world by a small economy. As the paper indicates, even when it possesses the legal tools to tackle international antitrust issues, Israel often suffer from serious practical deficiencies. Most importantly, it frequently cannot create a credible threat to large, multinational firms that engage in anti-competitive conduct which harms its economy. It also has limited resources and incentives to deal with international anti-competitive conduct, especially when such conduct is addressed by other jurisdictions. As a result, despite the sometimes severe effects of anti-competitive conduct on its markets, Israel, like other small economies, is a marginal player in the globalized antitrust regime and is generally a passive bearer of the effects of international anti-competitive conduct and of the enforcement actions of larger jurisdictions rather than proactive confronters of such issues and actions. This observation has important implications for a globalized antitrust regime. The paper also analyzes some intriguing issues which arise from public international law doctrines of extraterritoriality. For example, it analyzes the issue of whether the effects doctrine acts as a pre-condition for a finding of an anti-competitive conduct if some of the parties are foreign or does it apply only if there is a finding of an anti-competitive conduct that has direct legal implications for a foreign firm. It also analyzes the issue <b>of</b> whether <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> can apply in cases which involve foreign firms and in which jurisdiction is based on proof of 2 ̆ 2 a significant and direct 2 ̆ 2 anti-competitive effect...|$|R

40|$|Part I of this Essay {{sets out}} why the legal {{framework}} in the EU amplifies what are, in reality, relatively small differences in thinking about resale price maintenance (2 ̆ 2 RPM 2 ̆ 2). This amplification is primarily {{due to the fact}} that the legal system asks economists, in the name of legal certainty, to draw a false dichotomy between those agreement and practices that are harmful and those that are beneficial. For practices like naked price-fixing, it is relatively easy for economists to agree on an answer. It is harder, however, for practices like RPM, which can give rise to serious anticompetitive harm, but can also prove to be indispensable for important and valuable benefits to consumers. Part II therefore provides a summary of the economic literature on RPM and emphasizes the need for further empirical research in this area. Within the current legal framework, there is not yet sufficient evidence to justify moving RPM out of the EU’s “presumed illegality” or “object” box and into a case-by-case assessment of “effect” box. It is clear, however, that this approach will sometimes presume that some RPM arrangements are illegal when in fact they either do not restrict competition or, if they do, they are nevertheless justified by generating consumer benefits. Accordingly, we would have significant reservations about a legal framework that goes beyond “presumed illegality,” for example making RPM de facto illegal or even per se illegal, as in the United States before Leegin. On the basis of these beliefs, Part III suggests several small steps that can be taken towards assessing RPM within a “presumed illegality” framework without sacrificing too much of the legal certainty that is realized under the current approach. First, we argue that it is important to ensure that any <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> is truly rebuttable, and provide some thoughts as to how this might work. This includes the requirement that the authority should set out at least one plausible “theory of harm” that is consistent with known facts. Second, we suggest that a series of screens might usefully be adopted for considering whether there is likely to be a credible theory of harm in any particular case of RPM, and for prioritizing cases on this basis. Third we recognize that a prioritization approach may not be as effective in a system such as the United States, where competition law is primarily enforced via cases brought by private litigants. There may, nevertheless, be some potential to use screens of this sort to help define a legal standard. Under this approach, failure of the screens would demonstrate that there is no credible theory of harm associated with a particular case of RPM and the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> could be rebutted. This approach would be similar to the screens that are commonly applied in the EU in article 102 TFEU (2 ̆ 2 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union”) (article 82 EC (“Treaty Establishing the European Community”)) abuse-of-dominance cases...|$|E
40|$|Reverse payment {{settlements}} have {{ignited a}} firestorm debate among all affected parties: consumer groups, brand-name pharmaceutical companies, generic manufacturers, pharmaceutical wholesalers and retailers, lawmakers, executive agencies, {{and the federal}} courts. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has waged a decade-long battle against such private settlements of pharmaceutical patent litigation as illegal market-sharing agreements, with skirmishes among the circuits trending {{in favor of the}} settling parties until recently. The Third Circuit’s recent decision in In re K-Dur Antitrust Litigation unsettled this trend, and the Supreme Court granted the FTC’s petition for a writ of certiorari in a separate case on the issue on December 7, 2012. A reverse payment settlement is an agreement ending a pharmaceutical patent infringement suit under which a putative patent holder agrees to compensate an alleged infringer, typically a generic firm, to settle a patent infringement case. In exchange, the alleged infringer agrees not to challenge the patent holder’s patent or sell a generic version of the drug for a stated term. Because the payment flows from the plaintiff to the defendant, it has been called a “reverse” payment. This Note argues that any standard of antitrust review for reverse payment settlements must involve an evaluation of the patent’s strength at the time the patent holder and generic firm enter into a settlement. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is the court of competent jurisdiction to review a district court’s evaluation of a patent’s strength. Part I reviews reverse payment settlements generally and the statutory schemes that promote their emergence. Part II presents three approaches the circuit courts have adopted to review reverse payment settlements: per se illegality, a rebuttable <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality,</b> and the scope of the patent test. Part III argues that any standard of antitrust scrutiny must consider the patent’s strength {{at the time of the}} settlement — an approach no circuit has yet adopted — and that the Federal Circuit is the proper appellate court to review patent strength...|$|E
40|$|Provisions of the Press Law of 1984 {{encourage}} to {{the fresh}} insight into non proprietary d a t a s deriving from impendence or infringement of personal interests. The argumentation implies knowledge of problems of personal interests protection. The question of proprietary means of protection {{is beyond the}} scope of the article. The elaboration consists of two parts. In the first one the author discusses crucial questions related to interpretation of the Civil Code in the light of new judicial decisions. Provision of art. 24 of the C. C. institutes two separate, basically independent non proprietary claims: for desistance and for performing acts to remove results of effected infringement. A person whose interest is impended over by another person's act is entitled to the claim for desistance. The statute is introducing the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> of perpetrator's act. The author studies several newest decisions concerning that claim. It can be also applied in the neighbourhood relations resulting in the interdiction of acts exceeding the average level of disturbances, impending over such personal interests as health and peacefullness. A problem of defining circumstances excluding illegality of acts is of a crutial importance. Other questions are to be discussed with reference to the claim for removing results of effected infringement. For a, long time that matter had its weight in labor law in the respect of amending employee's record. Coming into force of Labor Gode brought about an essential change, and judicial decisions precised application, of the Civil Code provisions to questions of records. The art. 24 of the C. C. retains its full impact beyond the labor relations. The second part of the elaboration dwells on a study of two institutions of the press law i. e. amendment and opinion. Papers editor is obliged to insert a factual correction of untrue or inaccurate information at the request of the interested party. The same applies to publishing a reply to statements impending over personal interests. In most of the cases it is a breach of good name (libel, indignity).

40|$|Contingent fee {{lobbying}} {{has long}} been a disfavored practice. Although some commentators argue that use of a contingent fee lobbying contract could open up federal legislative and regulatory processes to greater participation by Americans of limited means, many others, including the Supreme Court, have declared that lobbying a legislature or agency under a contingent fee contract is generally both illegal and unethical. However, the conclusion that the practice is illegal is often based on a declaration that the practice is unethical... without a thorough examination of the sources of law that led to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> in the first instance. Is it legal to lobby Congress or federal agencies on a contingent fee contract? If legal, would such a contract be ethical? These are the two core issues addressed in this article. On the way to our answers to these questions, we examine the history of lobbying and the legal treatment of lobbying. We review the early Supreme Court precedent that is often cited in support of a contingent fee lobbying ban, finding that the cases more reliably stand for a general ban on lobbying, not for a specific ban on contingent fee lobbying. We look at the evolution of lobbying – from reviled practice to respected profession – through the lenses of Senate hearings and executive branch procurement practices. We turn to the example of state law to review the competing philosophies underlying state regulation of contingent fee lobbying and to emphasize how the early Supreme Court pronouncements on lobbying may be easily employed to support either philosophy. Because the First Amendment may be implicated in any restriction on speech, we highlight how the Supreme Court’s more recent jurisprudence addressing restrictions on political speech is likely to affect any future evaluation of contingent free lobbying. Finally, regardless whether the practice of contingent fee lobbying is legal, we examine whether certain ethical boundaries should be drawn to curb any particular tendency to corruption that may result from use of a contingent fee lobbying contract. We conclude that contingent fee lobbying should not summarily be condemned or prohibited, but propose imposing a more rigorous disclosure regime specifically aimed at this type of lobbying compensation agreement...|$|E
40|$|The {{public policy}} towards minimum resale price {{maintenance}} (‘RPM’), or vertical price fixing, namely the practice whereby a manufacturer stipulates a retail price floor below which its products {{are not to be}} resold, has traditionally {{been one of the most}} contentious antitrust issues on both sides of the Atlantic. Economic theory suggests that RPM is capable of producing ambivalent welfare consequences, thus obscuring the intellectual debate as to the optimal antitrust response to the practice. This normative uncertainty is best reflected in the divergent approach taken to RPM under the relevant laws of the United States and the European Union, arguably the world’s two most mature antitrust jurisdictions. In 2007, in its seminal Leegin judgment, the United States Supreme Court abolished the century-old per se ban on vertical price fixing. At the same time, under the European Commission’s recent Guidelines on Vertical Restraints price floors remain subject to a quasi-conclusive <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to examine whether a more consistent approach through the relaxation of the European Commission’s blanket prohibition on price floors would be feasible and, in effect, desirable. Based on insights from new institutional economics, it will be argued that RPM may on certain occasions be a substitute – however imperfect – for vertical integration, where a merger would be prohibitively costly for the parties, in which case the hierarchical form of organisation will have to be replaced by a hybrid governance structure. Under certain circumstances, a fixed retail profit margin may enhance the self-enforcing range of long-term partnerships governed by relational norms, as well as the manufacturer’s control over distribution by reducing substantially the transaction costs associated with monitoring dealer performance. At the same time, however, the analysis will take into account the various objections to the practice, most notably the horizontal collusion theory, in order to argue that the approach to RPM should in principle be cautious. The discussion will culminate in the proposal for a new, workable analytical framework for the substantive assessment of vertical price fixing under EU competition law, which will be based on a – genuinely – rebuttable presumption of anti-competitive object under Article 101 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of 2 ̆ 2 exclusionary eminent domain 2 ̆ 2 – the exercise of eminent domain that {{has the effect of}} excluding low-income households from an otherwise predominantly or entirely middle-class or wealthy neighborhood or locality, whether or not exclusion itself was the purpose of the condemnation. All condemnations exclude the condemned owner (and his or her tenants, if any) from the condemned property. Exercises of what I am calling 2 ̆ 2 exclusionary eminent domain 2 ̆ 2 are doubly exclusive because the displaced residents are unable to afford new housing in the same neighborhood or locality as their now-condemned, former homes. In exclusionary eminent domain, low-incomes households are excluded not only from their homes but also from their home neighborhood or locality. Exclusionary eminent domain, as I am using the term, seems to occur in two distinct contexts. In the suburban context, a structure or structures occupied by low-income households are condemned by a predominantly non-low-income locality in the interest of attracting new development that will house or otherwise be geared to middle-class or wealthy people. The threatened condemnations of mobile home parks in suburban New Jersey towns such as Lodi are examples of this type of exclusionary eminent domain. In the urban gentrification mode of exclusionary eminent domain, a large city with a mix of wealthy and poor areas condemns low-income housing in a gentrifying or largely gentrified area, with the result that the displaced low-income residents must move to poorer areas of the city or out of the city. The use of threats of eminent domain to facilitate the massive Atlantic Yards development in north central Brooklyn – a development that will feature seventeen luxury towers to be constructed by Frank Geahry – illustrates this model of exclusionary eminent domain. This Article assesses the case for a new state constitutional law doctrine limiting exclusionary eminent domain, and argues that, on balance, the advantages of such a doctrine may exceed the disadvantages. The particular form of exclusionary eminent domain doctrine I am positing would incorporate two of the features of the most analogous existing doctrine, the state constitutional law doctrine regarding exclusionary zoning. Those features are, first, judicial evaluation of a locality 2 ̆ 7 s actions in terms of the metropolitan regional needs for low-income housing and each locality 2 ̆ 7 s fair share obligation with respect to those needs, and, second, the creation of a rebuttable <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>illegality</b> when the locality takes an action that will bring its stock of affordable housing below or further below its fair share obligation. An exclusionary eminent domain doctrine would not absolutely bar condemnation of low-income housing in a locality or neighborhood that otherwise has less than its fair share of such housing, but rather would result in the application of heightened review to such condemnations. The condemning authority would have to provide a more compelling, more-tailored justification for condemnation than rational basis review would require. An exclusionary eminent domain doctrine would raise the cost to local officials of condemning low-income housing located in middle-class or wealthy neighborhoods or localities, and thereby would make it more likely that those officials would configure new development so as to leave such housing in place. The doctrine also would provide a strong incentive for a locality that wanted to proceed with the condemnation of low-income housing to create substitute low-income housing in the same neighborhood as the development site, as by doing so they would negate the claim that condemnations would drop the locality or neighborhood below its pre-condemnation fair share of low-income housing. In addition, the doctrine would have the effect of increasing the bargaining power of owners of low-income housing owners who want to sell, so that they would receive larger payments than they would have if there were no exclusionary eminent domain doctrine...|$|E
