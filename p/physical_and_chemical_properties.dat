40|$|The {{sampling}} scheme {{is essential in}} the investigation of the spatial variability of soil properties in Soil Science studies. The high costs of {{sampling scheme}}s optimized with additional sampling points for each <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> soil <b>property,</b> prevent their use in precision agriculture. The {{purpose of this study was}} to obtain an optimal sampling scheme for <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> sets <b>and</b> investigate its effect on the quality of soil sampling. Soil was sampled on a 42 -ha area, with 206 georeferenced points arranged in a regular grid spaced 50 m from each other, in a depth range of 0. 00 - 0. 20 m. In order to obtain an optimal sampling scheme for every <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>property,</b> a sample grid, a medium-scale variogram and the extended Spatial Simulated Annealing (SSA) method were used to minimize kriging variance. The optimization procedure was validated by constructing maps of relative improvement comparing the sample configuration before and after the process. A greater concentration of recommended points in specific areas (NW-SE direction) was observed, which also reflects a greater estimate variance at these locations. The addition of optimal samples, for specific regions, increased the accuracy up to 2 % for <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> 1 % for physical properties. The use of a sample grid and mediumscale variogram, as previous information for the conception of additional sampling schemes, was very promising to determine the locations of these additional points for all <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> soil <b>properties,</b> enhancing the accuracy of kriging estimates of the physical-chemical properties...|$|R

5|$|All of the {{discovered}} {{alkali metals}} occur in nature as their compounds: {{in order of}} abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity; francium occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), {{which is likely to}} be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure.

Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and europium (826°C), but lower than for curium (1340°C).|$|E
