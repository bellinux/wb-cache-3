2500|$|Regular {{electronic}} tuners contain {{either an}} input jack for electric instruments (usually a 1/4" [...] patch cord input), a microphone, or a clip-on sensor (e.g., a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup)</b> {{or some combination}} of these inputs. [...] Pitch detection circuitry drives some type of display (an analog needle, an LCD simulated image of a needle, LED lights, or a spinning translucent disk illuminated by a strobing backlight). Some tuners have an output, or through-put, so the tuner can connect 'in-line' from an electric instrument to an instrument amplifier or mixing console. Small tuners are usually battery powered. Many battery powered tuners also have a jack for an optional AC power supply.|$|E
2500|$|Guitar {{amplifiers}} {{can also}} modify the instrument's tone by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain frequencies, using equalizer controls, which function {{the same way}} as the bass and treble knobs on a home hi-fi stereo, and by adding electronic effects; [...] distortion (also called [...] "overdrive") and reverb are commonly available as built-in features. The input of modern guitar amplifiers is a 1/4" [...] jack, which is fed a signal from an electro-magnetic pickup (from an electric guitar) or a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> (usually from an acoustic guitar) using a patch cord, or a wireless transmitter. For electric guitar players, their choice of guitar amp and the settings they use on the amplifier are a key part of their signature tone or sound. Some guitar players are longtime users of a specific amp brand or model. Many electric guitar players use external effects pedals to alter the sound of their tone before the signal reaches the guitar amp, such as the wah wah pedal and the chorus pedal.|$|E
2500|$|Electric violins have a {{magnetic}} or <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> that converts string vibration to an electric signal. A patch cable or wireless transmitter sends {{the signal to}} an amplifier of a PA system. Electric violins are usually constructed as such, but a pickup {{can be added to}} a conventional acoustic violin. An electric violin with a resonating body that produces listening-level sound independently of the electric elements can be called an electro-acoustic violin. To be effective as an acoustic violin, electro-acoustic violins retain much of the resonating body of the violin, and often resemble an acoustic violin or fiddle. [...] The body may be finished in bright colors and made from alternative materials to wood. These violins may need to be hooked up to an instrument amplifier or PA system. [...] Some types come with a silent option that allows the player to use headphones that are hooked up to the violin. The first specially built electric violins date back to 1928 and were made by Victor Pfeil, Oskar Vierling, George Eisenberg, Benjamin Miessner, George Beauchamp, Hugo Benioff and Fredray Kislingbury. These violins can be plugged into effect units, just like an electric guitar, including distortion, wah-wah pedal and reverb. Since electric violins do not rely on string tension and resonance to amplify their sound they can have more strings. For example, five-stringed electric violins are available from several manufacturers, and a seven string electric violin (with three lower strings encompassing the cello's range) is also available. The majority of the first electric violinists were musicians playing jazz fusion (e.g., Jean-Luc Ponty) and popular music.|$|E
50|$|Some {{electric}} guitar models feature <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups,</b> which function as transducers {{to provide a}} sound closer to that of an acoustic guitar with the flip of a switch or knob, rather than switching guitars. Those that combine <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> and magnetic pickups are sometimes known as hybrid guitars.|$|R
50|$|Some {{electric}} archtops {{also have}} <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups,</b> making them hybrid guitars.|$|R
50|$|Some pickup {{products}} are installed and used similarly to <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups,</b> but use different underlying technology, for instance electret or condenser microphone technology.|$|R

50|$|Most {{versions}} of the Parker Fly feature a set of two magnetic Humbucker style pickups and a Fishman developed <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> designed to emulate acoustic guitar sounds. The <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> is aided by an onboard active pre-amplifier requiring {{the use of a}} 9 volt battery. The magnetic pickups are passive, but sit within the active circuit path. Fly guitars feature a stereo output jack, allowing the piezo and magnetic pickups to be sent to different amplifiers, or blended into a mono signal. Some Fly models have only magnetic pickups, for traditional electric guitar sounds, while some models have only piezo pickups, for use as solid-body acoustic-electric guitars.|$|E
50|$|In rockabilly and psychobilly, percussively {{slapping}} the strings against the fingerboard {{is an important}} part of the bass playing style. Since <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> are not good at reproducing the sounds of strings being slapped against the fingerboard, bassists in these genres often use both <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> (for the low bass tone) and a miniature condenser mic (to pick up the percussive slapping sounds). These two signals are blended together using a simple mixer before the signal is sent to the bass amp.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{acoustic}} guitars {{should not}} be confused with semi-acoustic guitars, which have pickups of the type found on solid-body electric guitars, or solid-body hybrid guitars with <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> have a {{very high}} output {{impedance}} and appear as a capacitance in series with a voltage source. They therefore often have an instrument-mounted buffer amplifier fitted to maximize frequency response.|$|R
5000|$|He used a Parker Fly Deluxe for the Chili Peppers {{days during}} the live {{versions}} of [...] "My Friends". He {{used it for}} its clean tones and its <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> that sounds similar to an acoustic guitar.|$|E
5000|$|Contact pickups {{register}} the vibrations {{of the instrument}} itself. They {{have the advantage of}} producing little feedback and no crosstalk at all. In spite of their lesser sound quality and thanks to their low price, contact pickups (and especially the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup)</b> have become the most popular transducer.|$|E
50|$|Almost all bass {{amplifiers}} {{are designed}} for use with an electric bass, which has magnetic pickups. When a double bass player is plugging their instrument into a typical bass amp, the signal usually comes from a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> mounted on the bridge or beneath {{the feet of the}} bridge. The direct signal from a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> does not usually sound good when it is plugged into a standard electric bass amp. Many upright bass players who use piezoelectric pickups use a preamplifier or preamp-equipped DI box before the signal is sent to the bass amp. The preamplifier helps to ensure that the impedance of the pickup signal matches the impedance of the amplifier, which improves the tone. Some preamplifiers also have equalizers which can be used to modify the tone.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> use a [...] "sandwich" [...] of {{quartz crystal}} or other {{piezoelectric}} material, typically placed beneath the string saddles or nut. These devices respond to pressure changes from all vibration at these specific points.|$|R
5000|$|Such pickups are {{uncommon}} (compared {{to normal}} ones), {{and only a}} few notable models exist, like the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> on the Moog Guitar. Hexaphonic pickups can be either magnetic or piezoelectric or based on the condensor principle like electronicpickups ...|$|R
25|$|Detection of {{pressure}} {{variations in the}} form of sound is the most common sensor application, e.g. piezoelectric microphones (sound waves bend the piezoelectric material, creating a changing voltage) and <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> for acoustic-electric guitars. A piezo sensor attached to the body of an instrument is known as a contact microphone.|$|R
50|$|More {{recently}} solid-body {{electric and}} hollow-body acoustic-electric charangos have become available. The solid-body instruments are built {{very much as}} miniature electric guitars, whereas the acoustic-electrics are usually a standard acoustic charango {{with the addition of}} a contact microphone or <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> to run the output of the instrument through an amplifier.|$|E
50|$|A silent guitar {{is a type}} of guitar with a solid or {{chambered}} {{body that}} converts the vibration of the strings into electric current using a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup.</b> The body of the guitar does not amplify the vibration of the strings into audible sound. Thanks to this, musicians can practice with headphones without disturbing people around them, or obtain an acoustic tone under heavy amplification without feedback.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic pickups. Magnetic pickups, {{as applied}} in {{electric}} guitars, register the vibrations of nickel or steel strings in a magnetic field. They {{have the advantage}} {{that they can be}} connected directly to an (electric guitar) amplifier, but in combination with a steel-string acoustic guitar the sound tends to be electric. This is why acoustic guitarists typically choose a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup,</b> built in microphone, or both.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> (also called [...] "piezo" [...] pickups) are {{non-magnetic}} pickups {{that use}} a transducer to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted {{under the bridge}} saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often {{similar to that of}} an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.|$|R
50|$|The Bongo is {{available}} with four, five, and since 2008, six strings, fretted and fretless lined or unlined, with neodymium H (single humbucker), HS (bridge humbucker/neck single-coil) and HH (dual humbuckers) pickup configurations. A bridge with <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> {{is available}} on all models except left-handed and six-string versions. On all multiple-pickup models there is a blend control rather than the selection switch found on other Music Man basses (piezo models have an additional blend control for the piezo bridge).|$|R
50|$|Though the {{original}} {{aim of the}} resonator was increased volume, some modern instruments incorporate electric pickups and related technology. Many modern makers produce instruments with one {{of a variety of}} pickup types—and some players retrofit pickups to non-electric instruments. Most commonly, resonator guitars use <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> (contact type transducers) placed under the bridge or elsewhere on the instrument, or use specialized microphones placed inside the instrument or {{directly in front of the}} cone to preserve the resonator's distinctive tone.|$|R
50|$|A hybrid guitar {{is also an}} {{electric}} guitar {{with the ability to}} produce a signal with the tonal quality of an acoustic guitar in addition to a typical electric signal from a magnetic pickup, allowing a wide tonal pallette for performers with a varied repertoire. Hybrid guitars typicallyuse a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> to generate the acoustic-like signal, this is the same type of pickup used in most electro-acoustic guitars.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge of}} a Variax {{electric}} guitar has an individual <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> for each string. The instrument's electronics converts {{each of these}} six signals to a digital signal, and digitally processes each to emulate the selected sound. Since the system process the strings separately, it can model the effects that one string of a target emulation might cause on another. It can also shift individual string pitches to digitally create alternate tunings instead of pitch-shifting all strings at once.|$|E
50|$|An {{amplification}} {{system with}} two transducers combines {{the qualities of}} both. A combination of a microphone and a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> typically produces better sound quality and less sensitivity to feedback, as compared to single transducers. However, {{this is not always}} the case. A less frequently used combination is a piezoelectric and a magnetic pickup. This combination can work well for a solid sound with dynamics and expression. Examples of a double system amplifier are the Highlander iP-2, the Verweij VAMP or the LR Baggs dual source and the D-TAR Multisource.|$|E
40|$|Compressed {{thin-walled}} beams {{with open}} section {{are prone to}} torsional, or flexural-torsional, buckling. Here we present the results of several studies where, by <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> and a universal testing machine, we experimentally detected the natural frequencies and buckling loads of centrally compressed aluminum thin-walled beams with open cruciform section, exhibiting remarkable warping stiffness. We detected the free vibration frequencies for different values of the compressive force and for both free and (at least partially) restrained warping of the end sections. We compared the behavior of integer elements to that of analogous beams, where we introduced a localized damage, i. e., a sharp variation of a cross-section. For the integer elements, we compared the experimental results with those provided by an in-house numerical code, which investigates the elastic stability of possible non-trivial paths of thin-walled beams in a dynamic setting. The results show that, on the one hand, <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> can be efficiently used to extract modal parameters of structural elements; on the other hand, the numerical code proves to be robust and accurate in {{the determination of the}} buckling loads of the integer elements, in all the analyzed configurations...|$|R
50|$|The Parker Fly {{is a type}} of {{electric}} guitar built by Parker Guitars. It was designed by Ken Parker and Larry Fishman, and first produced in 1993. The Fly is unique among electric guitars in the way it uses composite materials. It is notable for its light weight (4.5 lb; 2.0 kg) and resonance. It {{was also one of the}} first electric guitars to combine traditional magnetic <b>pickups</b> with <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups,</b> allowing the guitarist to access both acoustic and electric tones.|$|R
50|$|Lyon and Healy, Camac Harps, Salvi Harps, {{and other}} {{manufacturers}} also make electroacoustic pedal harps. The electroacoustic pedal harp is a modified concert harp, with <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> {{at the base}} of each string and an amplifier. Electroacoustic harps are a blend of electric and acoustic, with the option of using an amplifier or playing the harp just like a normal pedal harp. The electric harp is different from the electroacoustic harp, as it is entirely electric, lacking a soundbox and being nearly mute without an amplifier.|$|R
5000|$|Ralph Farris (born Ralph Howard Farris, Jr., 1970) is an American violist, violinist, composer, arranger, {{producer}} and conductor, {{best known as}} a founding member and artistic director of the ensemble ETHEL. Farris is an electric string player with a lengthy career that spans the gamut of musical genres from rock and jazz to Broadway. His instruments are outfitted with a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup</b> which allows him to play amplified. Amplification was initially adopted early in Farris's career in order to facilitate the playing of various [...] "contemporary classical" [...] pieces that involve electronic components. It continues to be integral to his signature sound.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2010s, {{there is}} some {{convergence}} between the functionality of keyboard combo amplifiers and small PA systems. Some keyboard amplifiers have an XLR input for a microphone and a microphone preamplifier. To use a microphone, a preamp is generally needed to boost {{the power of the}} sigal, because mic's only output a tiny, weak signal. This input's inclusion of a preamp means that it could also be used to plug in an acoustic guitar's <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickup.</b> This type of keyboard amplifier {{could be used as a}} PA system by a singer-songwriter who is accompanying herself or himself on guitar and keyboards in a very small venue, such as a coffeehouse.|$|E

50|$|Yamaha, Baldwin, Helpinstill and Kawai's {{electric}} pianos are actual grand or {{upright pianos}} with strings and hammers. The Helpinstill models have a traditional soundboard; {{the others have}} none, and are more akin to a solid-body electric guitar. On Yamaha, Baldwin and Kawai's pianos, the vibration of the strings is converted to an electrical signal by <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> under the bridge. Helpinstill's instruments use a set of electromagnetic pickups attached to the instrument's frame. All these instruments have a tonal character {{similar to that of}} an acoustic piano.|$|R
5000|$|Optical pickups {{are another}} type of {{non-magnetic}} pickup. They use an infrared LED to optically track {{the movement of the}} string, similar to the mechanism of modern computer mice, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the [...] "hum" [...] or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> to fill in the missing frequencies. LightWave Systems builds basses with optical pickups.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} use of {{piezoelectric}} disk buzzers, usual in stringed musical instruments to acquire sound as a voltage signal, for experimental modal analysis. These transducers helped in extracting natural frequencies and mode shapes of an aluminium beam and a steel arch in the laboratory. The results are compared with theoretical predictions and experimental values obtained by accelerometers and a laser displacement transducer. High accuracy, small dimensions, low weight, easy usage, and low cost, make <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pickups</b> an attractive tool for the experimental modal analysis of engineering structure...|$|R
