40|$|Throughout the {{financial}} services industry, the call center is being recognized as a critical delivery channel, helping firms to keep existing customers, expand their business, and control costs. For banks, call centers provide a cost effective means of servicing in customer requests, and are essential in retaining customers. The traditional role of the call center as a question and answer base for the customer is still a strong motivator for their existence, There is, however, a growing tendency to blend sales related activities with traditional transaction based activities at a financial service firm's <b>phone</b> <b>center.</b> Institutions view the opportunity to sell additional products {{as the key to}} a successful <b>phone</b> <b>center</b> operation. While service-oriented businesses in other sectors of the economy are experiencing a similar proliferation in call centers, the dichotomy of a service center and a sales center is much more apparent in banking. Other sectors do not fully blend service and sales in the call center operation as fully as is the desire of financial services firms. The move to sales elsewhere in {{the financial}} services industry has been ongoing for some time. The last decade has seen a growing number of banks implementing cross-sell programs across their branch networks in an effort to become higher profit, sales-driven organizations that leverage the delivery system expense structure. Today, these sales efforts in the branches are being extended to alternative delivery channels, a major one of which is the <b>phone</b> <b>center.</b> Lack of management focus, poor hiring practices, lack of training, ineffective organization for marketing, poor service, and not knowing customers or products are only a selection of some of the barriers between resources and sales in banking that have been documented. This paper identifies some of these roadblocks in the context of retail banking phone centers. The authors show that the nature of <b>phone</b> <b>center</b> operations makes them extremely susceptible to the increasing and changing resource needs of a sales organization. The authors provide a snapshot of retail banking phone centers, a review of related literature, and then present an analytical approach to characterize the tradeoffs between service and sales in phone centers. The situation at a specific <b>phone</b> <b>center</b> is described and analyzed. The authors demonstrate that cross-selling costs. In addition to its visible costs, such as training and technology, cross-selling is shown to have detrimental effects on customer service because of the additional burdens and operational load it creates on the system. With a move to more selling, capacity needs sharply increase in terms of customer service representatives and information processing resources. These capacity implications can be easily overlooked, since they are less visible than what one would expects to encounter. The authors show how restaffing can overcome some of the congestion related problems induced by additional sales activity. The authors use a performance model described in the paper in conjunction with an optimization model to determine economically optimal staffing levels for call centers. However, they note that staffing is not the only factor to be considered. Design of customer request processes and human resource practices that support the design are equally important in determining the success of a cross-sell program. The authors intend a second phase of this study a detailed filed study of call center operations across the entire financial services industry. ...|$|E

Using data collected in a large retail bank and a <b>phone</b> <b>center,</b> Fernandez and his associates (Fernandez et al. 2000; Fernandez and Weinberg 1997; Marsden and Gorman 2001) scrutinize multiple phases of the hiring process and demonstrate that using pre-existing social ties facilitates job-person matching success at each stage of the hiring process. Their studies show that external referrals are able to prepare more suitable resumes and time their applications better than non-referrals at early stages and that they {{are also more likely to}} receive interviews and job offers at late stages of a hiring process. These findings suggest that social ties should be viewed as “a formal means by which the firm seeks to harness the power of social relations for its own ends” (Fernandez and Weinberg 1997, 900). Since job search channels that lead to positive search results are those that well match the employer’s hiring methods, it is necessary to consider the variation in individual job search behaviors based on the variation in employers’ hiring methods, which are essentially determined by hiring requirements for job positions.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies capacity {{management in}} service delivery channels {{that are highly}} susceptible to uncertainties in their operations, thus labeled as congestion prone. Identifying an inbound call center as a natural example of such delivery channels, the study focuses on capacity management in these centers. Using data from a field study of the U. S. retail banking industry, this dissertation identifies important issues surrounding the management of capacity in the call centers of these firms. Three major issues emerge from this exploration: defining the relationship between various performance metrics in call centers; identifying the capacity implications of a transition to sales; resizing call centers to satisfy the growing capacity needs. ^ To address the first issue, a performance model {{for the study of}} operations at an inbound call centers is presented. The call center is modeled as a multi-case processor sharing loss system, where the interacting effects of human, telecommunication and information technology resources are explicitly incorporated. Product-form solutions for this type of system are provided along with a combinatorial method to compute performance measures like blocking and reneging. For computations involving large sized problems, a method that uses the idea of Monte-Carlo summation is implemented. Structural properties of throughput in these systems are determined. ^ The performance model is used to explore the tradeoffs between service and sales for call centers. In the contest of a retail bank 2 ̆ 7 s call center, it is shown that in addition to its visible costs, like training and technology to support systems for sales activities, cross-selling will have less visible congestion related costs, experienced as deteriorating customer service. It is furthermore demonstrated that designing the right process and adopting appropriate human resource practices are critical in determining the success of a sales program. ^ The dissertation concludes with the study of optimal staffing of a <b>phone</b> <b>center.</b> For this non-linear integer programming problem, it is shown that a greedy allocation procedure yields the optimal server allocation. Heuristics are developed for the more general case, and numerical examples are presented to illustrate their performance. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} in retail banking reviews {{the work of a}} Wharton School {{research}} team which has been tracking the process of change at one of the larger American commercial banks. The bank is referred to by the pseudonym "National Bank. " The team's research focuses on how a bank chooses what changes to make and how to implement changes as new technologies, increasing competition, and more demanding customers force it to rethink product offerings and distribution channel design. In the case of "National," these forces resulted in a massive re-engineering effort designed to restructure the branch delivery system. The goal of the redesign was to streamline branch processes and relocate many administrative tasks and routine servicing of accounts to centralized locations. The physical layout of branches was changed so customers would be encouraged to use ATMs and call centers rather than consult with branch employees. Branch employees' efforts were to be directed toward sales rather than service and information systems and call centers were expanded. As pilot experiments developed and the project matured, the bank's initial focus on changes in physical layout of branches, information systems, and design of key business processes gave way to focus on changes in key jobs in the branch systems, human resource practices that supported these jobs, and on employees' reactions to the changes. As these changes were implemented, several problems arose and were addressed. First, rural branches in the early pilots felt that the new changes were inappropriate for their market, leading to a decision to abandon the original model of standardization across the entire system. Second, implementation of new technology proved a slower process than had been expected. Third, branch employees often found it difficult to successfully refocus on sales rather than service. Fourth, some customers were unhappy with changes that routed all their calls to a centralized location rather than to the their local branch. Finally, it was difficult to implement the human resource practices necessary to support the new organization. New position levels changed employee expectations of moving up in the hierarchy and caused some internal dissatisfaction and confusion. Employees feared layoffs. In dealing with these problems, a second pilot redesign was tested in urban and suburban markets, incorporating a number of process modifications to address these issues. New challenges have arisen, including introducing the changes to branches that have been acquired recently through mergers and acquisitions and introducing standardized innovations within a decentralized management system. These and a range of human resource issues continue to be addressed by the team. Despite the many challenges to implementing an effective new delivery paradigm at National, a number of the early pilots have demonstrated success in moving routine transactions to more official channels, while achieving the goals of increased sales and customer satisfaction. As a result of their ongoing analysis of National's redesign process, the authors have identified six key factors for success: Have a good <b>phone</b> <b>center</b> in place early and believe in it as a critical component of retail service delivery; Acknowledge the importance of human resource issues; Not only acknowledge but address the human resource issues early and clearly; Clarify employees' roles and develop new skills when needed; Not all employees need the same kinds of commitment; Be ready and willing to adapt your model, but be confident to resist attempts {{to maintain the status quo}} for the wrong reasons. ...|$|E
