40|$|The {{topic of}} the paper refers to the most crucial {{issues related to the}} {{coordination}} of social security in EU and the regulations of the European Union law related to the national insurance contributions. The EU law determines fundamental principles for the coordination of social security in EU, which include a warranty for the protection of rights related to persons moving between the European Union Member States. The <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the coordination of social security have normative nature, i. e. they are included in the European Union system of legal provisions. The most important principles are: the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> equal treatment, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the application of single legislation, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> counteracting a <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> benefits (proportionality), the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> priority in the case of converging rights to benefits. The European Union legal regulations related to the national insurance contributions do not replace the national legislation but only supplement it {{at the level of the}} Community so as to ensure a closer cooperation between the institutions, which handle social security...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we use the}} concept <b>of</b> {{resource}} <b>cumulation</b> to model various forms of computation. The space <b>of</b> <b>cumulations</b> (called a cumulator) is simply represented as a five tuple consisting of a well-founded partial order, a monoid and a volume function. The volume function is introduced to simplify reasoning about limit points and other topological properties. A specification command is a set <b>of</b> <b>cumulations.</b> Typical phenomena <b>of</b> concurrency such as reactiveness, safety and liveness, fairness, real time and branching time naturally arise from the model. In order to support a programming theory, we introduce a specification language that incorporates sequentiality, nondeterminism, simple parallelism, negation and general recursions. A new fixpoint technique is used to model general recursions. The language {{is applied to the}} case study on CSP, which becomes a special model of cumulative computing with a combination of four resource cumulators of alphabet, termination, trace and refusal. All laws of cumulative computing are also valid for CSP and the generalization from CSP to Timed CSP can be achieved by simply combining the four cumulators with real time. Loops whose bodies may take zero time can then be modeled more satisfactorily...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} based on the study {{conducted}} in years 1979 - 85 on the group of 207 young adult offenders tried in Poznań District Court. The purpose of the study Was to perform a synthesizing evaluation of efficiency of particular penal measures [...] The basis of the evaluation is an attempt to grasp the connections and dependencies between typical crime generating factors (exo- and endogenic) — grouped in 11 structures and forming sets characterized by different degrees <b>of</b> <b>cumulation</b> — and the offenders' subsequent lines of conduct, determined by the levels of their recidivism, and to determine the influence of measures applied by the courts on the above dependencies. No connnection was found between the degree <b>of</b> <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> crime generating factors and severity of the measure. The penalty of deprivation of liberty was in cases <b>of</b> greater <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> crime generating factors even less frequent than in variants with weak <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> these factors. It indicates that Art. 51 of Criminal Code is not always applied. (i. e. the exposition of educational aims of proceedings concerning the young adult offenders). The highest percentage of recidivism occurs after the penalty of deprivation of liberty (39, 3 %), somewhat lower after the conditional suspension of the execution of such penalty (32, 6 %), small after the penalty of restricted liberty (6, 4 %); there is no recidivism after autonomous fine and after educational and corrective measures. The relation between the recidivism and the lack of stabilization (i. e. the situation when the offender does not relapse into crime but nevertheless does not stabilize his situation through e. g. taking a job) is statistically significant (p< 0, 001) with correlation coefficient v = 0, 411. The above result indicates the lack of efficiency of applied penal measures and suggests the need of changes in the policy of punishing.

40|$|Within any {{preferential}} trade agreement (PTA) origin rules exist {{in order to prevent}} third countries from taking advantage of the PTA concessions. The rules thus are there to preserve the existing external protection of countries within the PTA. However, depending on their formulation, they can also increase that level of external protection, resulting in trade suppression and trade diversion. This paper provides the first serious empirical examination of the possible impact of rules of origin on patterns of trade in the European context.
