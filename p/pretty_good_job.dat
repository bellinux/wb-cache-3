500|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings, {{just as it}} had during the second season. The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4.75 million household viewers, a slight increase over season two's 4.68 million average, but lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households. Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership to a decline in ratings for NBC in general, as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels. He added: [...] "I would love it if our ratings went up and up, and we've done a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of making our show inviting and friendly, welcoming to new viewers.

500|$|Exiles {{graphics}} and sound received nearly universal praise, and were credited with completing the game's immersion.

Macworlds Peter Cohen praised Presto for giving out bits of story throughout the game, rather than providing exposition only during opening and closing sequences. The pacing and rewards system was also appreciated by reviewers. IGN concluded their review of the game by stating that Presto had done [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> with a notable addition to the series". The Daily Telegraph offered even stronger praise, saying that Presto had crafted the best Myst game in the series thus far, a sentiment that was echoed in other publications. The editors of Computer Games Magazine named Exile the best adventure game of 2001, and called it [...] "a breath of fresh air amidst the otherwise barren crop of adventure titles." [...] They also presented the game with their [...] "Best Art Direction" [...] and [...] "Best Acting" [...] awards, the latter for Dourif's performance.|$|E
500|$|The song {{garnered}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reception from music critics, {{most of whom}} noted that the song may be taken offensively because of its stereotypical lyrics. The song {{has been described as}} a [...] "plaintive ballad" [...] by Joseph Woodard of Entertainment Weekly. San Francisco-based non-profit organization, Common Sense Media gave the song a mixed review, stating that it should remain an album track rather than a single. They stated, [...] "With Beyoncé doing a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of phonetically singing in Spanish (the occasional verb phrase doesn't blend), this is more about novelty than about being a great single." [...] Agustin Gurza of the Los Angeles Times gave the song a positive review, naming it a stand-out track off of Alejandro's Viento a favor. Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic complimented the writing as well as the production on the song and called it [...] "over-bearing in a positive way."

2500|$|In 2004, Hanson gave {{a mostly}} {{favorable}} review {{to the book}} Colossus by the British historian Niall Ferguson, where Ferguson argued that the United States should be an imperial power {{in the sense of}} preserving the post war order of global free trade, communications, and commerce, and the principal problem with Americans was that they were unwilling to embrace global leadership {{in the same way that}} people in 19th century Britain did. Hanson found much to approve of in Ferguson's book, writing: [...] "In reality, we should be natural imperialists, given our wealth and expertise. Americans are also endowed with an exceptional moral sense. We are a generous people, whose checkered imperial interventions in the past rarely proved profitable or exploitive." [...] Hanson agreed with Ferguson that the principle problem with Americans was an unease at playing the role of an imperialistic power, argued that post-1945 histories of Germany and Japan proved the beneficial results of American occupation and predicted that Iraq under American occupation would become just as much a prosperous and democratic society as Germany and Japan are. Hanson praised Ferguson for his defense of the British Empire as a benevolent force and his thesis that the United States should play the same role in the world as the British Empire, writing: [...] "Does Ferguson propose a new American liberal empire? In fact, he does almost, but not before noting that the British Victorians themselves got a bad rap as exploitive colonialists. In fact, the record of the 18th and 19th centuries prove exactly the opposite: Former and once-prosperous colonies, following autonomy, quickly turned into self-induced miseries, while Britain itself thrived as never before once free of these costly obligations. Empire turns out not to be a means of making money, but instead an idealist pursuit to keep sea lanes open, bullies at bay and nations trading rather than fighting. The world has been lucky to have the Americans fill this vacuum, inasmuch as the British once did a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of it as well." [...] Hanson, well before the immigration and financial crises of the EU, also praised Ferguson for his very negative picture of the European Union as being both [...] "busy triangulating with our enemies" [...] and [...] "running huge trade deficits with us as we supply their own security needs." [...] He cites appears to agree with Ferguson that Europe is undemocratic, and statist, but that with a population in decline and even worse entitlement overspending than the US, a more broken melting pot, and socialist response to these issues ensuring Europe will be unable generate the unity or idealism required to supplant the US.|$|E
