5000|$|Skin (<b>percutaneous,</b> dermal) <b>absorption</b> is the {{transport}} of chemicals from the outer surface of the skin both into the skin and into circulation. Skin absorption relates {{to the degree of}} exposure to and possible effect of a substance which may enter the body through the skin. Human skin comes into contact with many agents intentionally and unintentionally. Skin absorption can occur from occupational, environmental, or consumer skin exposure to chemicals, cosmetics, or pharmaceutical products. Some chemicals can be absorbed in enough quantity to cause detrimental systemic effects. Skin disease (dermatitis) {{is considered one of the}} most common occupational diseases. [...] In order to assess if a chemical can be a risk of either causing dermatitis or other more systemic effects and how that risk may be reduced one must know the extent to which it is absorbed, thus dermal exposure is a key aspect of human health risk assessment.|$|R

Baofukang suppository is a type of traditional Chinese medicine that consists primarily of two Chinese Medicinal Herbs: (1) zedoary turmeric oil; and (2) borneol. Zedoary turmeric oil is a volatile oil steam-distilled from Curcuma phaeocaulis which contains a variety of effective components, including beta-elemene, curcumin, curzerenone, and Zimmer ketones currently in clinical use. These components may provide potent pharmacological activities, such as antitumor or antiviral effects, enhancing the immune response, particularly by promoting the regeneration and repair of damaged or inflamed mucosa (Kamazeri et al. 2012). Due to its potent pharmacological action, this plant extract has begun to attract some significant attention. Borneol is extracted from the essential oil of various subtropical and evergreen broad-leaved such as Cinnamomum and Lauraceae, and a bicyclic monoterpenoid alcohol commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine as the adjuvant for more than 1500  years (Jiang et al. 2008). It demonstrates anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antibacterial properties, while also accelerating <b>percutaneous</b> drug <b>absorption</b> and increasing the bioavailability of drugs in the brain tissue (Almeida et al. 2013; Slamenova et al. 2009). Therefore, the aims of this work was to evaluate the in vitro antifungal properties and mechanisms of the Baofukang suppository, which would be further applied widely in clinic as a potential antifungal drug for the prevention of VVC.|$|R

In this study two tripeptides, namely sarcosyl-L-leucyl-phenylalanine (Sar-Leu-Phe) and glycyl-L-leucyl-phenylalanine (Gly-Leu-Phe) were studied as potential chelators, which would increase the bioavailability of copper(II) through dermal absorption. Glass electrode potentiometry {{was used to measure}} the solution thermodynamics of copper(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II) with Gly-Leu-Phe and Sar-Leu-Phe, at 25 0. 01 °C and an ionic strength of 0. 15 M (NaCl). The terminal amine of both tripeptides was found to have the same basicity, but the methyl group on the terminal amine decreased the stability constants of the copper(II) ligand species by 0. 38 to 1. 67 log units. It increased the stability constants of the zinc(II) ligand species by 0. 13 to 1. 07 log units and it also increased the stability constant of the NiL 2 H- 1 species by 1. 3 to 1. 4 log units, while not affecting the NiL species. The solution structures of the complexes were determined spectroscopically using Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, Infrared spectroscopy and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The copper(II) complexes tend more towards a square planar geometry, rather than the expected tetragonally distorted octahedral geometry. All the nickel(II) species, were square planar, except for the ML species, which was octahedral. The ligand coordinated to the metal ion via an amine-N, two amide-Ns, two carbonyl-Os and a carboxyl-O. The postulated coordination modes were validated using quantum mechanical calculations.

The present study focuses on the design of new drugs {{that could be used to}} change the bioavailability of copper and hence alleviate inflammation.

Equilibrium constants of H+, Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) with the peptides were measured in aqueous solution at 25 ± 0. 01 oC and an ionic strength of 0. 15 M (NaCl) using glass electrode potentiometry. The tripeptides species showed significantly different coordination behaviour. The results that Cu(II) coordinates to one amino group, two deprotonated peptides and one imidazole nitrogen atoms to give a neutral complex. The structures of the complex species were investigated using ultraviolet-visible (Uv-Vis), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectroscopy as well as molecular mechanics (MM) calculations. The visible spectra obtained for the different species in solution were typical of Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes. 1 H NMR identified the active binding sites to be the imidazole nitrogen, the amide nitrogen and the terminal amino group. The imidazole nitrogen was involved in coordination first, followed by the amide and then the terminal amine groups. The ԑ-amino group of lysine did not coordinate to the Cu(II). Molecular mechanics was used to support the Cu(II) structures postulated from potentiometric and spectroscopic data. The prefered method of increasing the available pool of low molecular weight Cu(II) species in vivo is via dermal absorption. For this reason the drugs were designed so that they could be administered dermally and be selective for Cu(II) so that they do not affect the speciation of other metal ions in blood plasma. Speciation calculations of Cu(II) using a computer model of blood plasma indicated that Sar-Lys-His was the best at mobilising copper in vivo. This study also considered <b>percutaneous</b> skin <b>absorption.</b> Octanol/water partition coefficients and Franz cell permeation studies showed that the Cu(II) complexes are hydrophilic but that Sar-Gly-His caused a 2 fold increase in membrane permeability of Cu(II) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} in Australia of a serum ELISA {{test for}} allergen specific IgE in canine atopy {{was met with}} initial enthusiasm by many small animal veterinarians.

Atopy is a frustrating disease to diagnose and treat, but the new ELISA does not provide the easy solution to this problem. It would be more accurately characterised as as a serum ELISA for discriminating allergens in canine atopy. The dog should first be characterised as atopic, and then it is suitable to screen the dog 2 ̆ 7 s blood for individual allergen identification to guide treatment. ELISA and intra-dermal testing correlate poorly, so which test should be believed? This is controversial and raises the possibility that both tests are right, each corresponding to different sub-types of atopy. Perhaps allergens are percutaneously absorbed leading to atopic dermatitis. There may also be another similar disease process whereby the primary mode of access is via inhalation to produce a syndrome akin to hayfever or asthma in humans. The two syndromes may commonly occur together. Preliminary research with skin patch testing supports the notion of a <b>percutaneous</b> route of <b>absorption</b> of allergens causing atopic dermatitis.

[Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]The effect of occlusion on the in vitro <b>percutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> of linoleic acid was investigated. A greater skin concentration of linoleic acid from an ethanolic vehicle was observed in non-occluded experiments compared with occluded experiments (P< 0. 05). Such changes were not observed as consistently when ethanol was replaced with a less volatile organic solvent (cyclomethicone). These observations were attributed to the increase in the concentration gradient due to the unimpeded evaporation of volatile solvents, which provided a greater driving force and enhanced non-occluded delivery in these systems, compared with occluded systems. Conversely, the <b>percutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> of a polar material (glycerol) from an aqueous solution did not yield any such differences. While more conclusive comparisons between volatile and non-volatile solvents and penetrants would be required to substantiate fully these comparisons, it is apparent that non-occlusion of volatile solvents may enhance <b>percutaneous</b> <b>absorption.</b> The physicochemical properties of the penetrant, for example its natural state at skin temperature (i. e. solid or liquid) may further determine the degree of enhanced <b>percutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> compared with occluded environment...|$|E

40|$|There is {{potential}} for haemorrhaging injuries that become contaminated with toxic chemicals e. g. sulphur mustard (SM). There are no specific medical countermeasures for such injuries at present. It is proposed that haemostats could simultaneously stop bleeding and decontaminate wounds. Products {{must be able}} to clot SM-contaminated blood and reduce SM <b>percutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> to be considered suitable. Sulphur mustard did not significantly affect coagulation in vitro or in vivo. Overall SM did not affect the pro-coagulatory function of haemostats. However, clot strength in WoundStat™ treated blood was adversely affected by SM in vitro. Superficial damage to the skin significantly increased the <b>percutaneous</b> <b>absorption</b> of SM with good agreement between in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, the altered toxicodynamics imply that the latent period associated with SM pathology is due, in part, to rate of absorption and not solely caused by biochemical pathways. Application of WoundStat™ significantly reduced the amount and rate of SM penetration through the skin in vitro.
