40|$|At {{the moment}} Automobile Shredder Residue (ASR) is usually {{landfilled}} worldwide, but European draft Directive 2000 / 53 /CE forces {{the development of}} alternative solutions, stating the 95 %-wt recovery of an End of Life Vehicle (ELV) weight to be fulfilled by 2015. This work describes two industrial tests, each involving 250 - 300 t of ELVs, in which different <b>pre-shredding</b> operations were performed. The produced ASR materials underwent an extended characterization and some post-shredding processes, consisting of dimensional, magnetic, electrostatic and densimetric separation phases, were tested on laboratory scale, having as main purpose the enhancement of ASR recovery/recycling and the minimization of the landfilled fraction. The gathered results show that accurate depollution and dismantling operations are mandatory to obtain a high quality ASR material which may be recycled/recovered and partially landfilled according to the actual European Union regulations, with particular concern for Lower Heating Value (LHV), heavy metals content and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) as critical parameters. Moreover post-shredding technical solutions foreseeing minimum economic and engineering efforts, therefore realizable in common European ELVs shredding plants, may lead to multi-purposed (material recovery and thermal valorization) opportunities for ASR reuse/recovery...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable waste {{management}} of post-recycling municipal solid wastes (MSW) {{is an important}} component in the ‘green ’ movement toward a cleaner, environmentally-conscious society. Waste-to-Energy (WTE) power plants have potential to significantly reduce the amount of landfilled refuse while producing a carbon neutral form of heat and power, However,; the average capital investment for a new WTE facility ranges from $ 7, 500 to $ 9, 000 per installed kW of capacity, nearly three times that of coal fire power plants. There exists a need to considerably reduce the cost of such facilities in order to bring them into the mainstream of solid {{waste management}}. This report examines how size-reduction and homogenization of the raw MSW stream can potentially improve WTE operating characteristics while decreasing capital investments. Chemical rate and heat transfer theories indicate that the productivity of a moving grate WTE boiler should be enhanced by means of <b>pre-shredding</b> the MSW, thus reducing the average particle size, homogenizing the feed, and increasing its bulk density by an estimated 30 %. Smaller particle sizes enhance reaction kinetics and flame propagation speed, due to the higher surface to volume ratio, and thus lower the amoun...|$|E

Heath, and {{subsequently}} Hershey, {{have supported the}} incorporation of the candy bar in other confections by marketing a <b>pre-shredded</b> variety, many vendors hand crumble the candy bars, finding the pre-crumbled variety [...] "too small and too dusty." ...|$|R
50|$|Through time, it {{was common}} {{to be able to}} find blocks of suet at grocers' shops, however, it was not until 1893 that the first <b>pre-shredded</b> suet became available. It was the brainchild of Gabriel Hugon, a French man living in Manchester. He {{observed}} his wife struggling to cut blocks of suet in the kitchen and set about to create ready shredded suet.|$|R
