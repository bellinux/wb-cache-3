40|$|Twenty soil {{profiles}} in the Bolivian {{part of the}} Brazilian shield were studied and classified according to WRB. Parent material is Precambrian metamorphic bedrock, vegetation a mosaic of (semi) deciduous forest and savanna (cerrado type). The climate is tropical with 4 to 5 dry months in the winter. With direct calculation of CEC per kg clay (both: pH 7 and effective), attributing the CEC completely to the clay fraction, the following soil groups were keyed out: 8 Ferralsols, 6 <b>Phaeozems,</b> 1 Acrisol, 2 Lixisols, 2 Umbrisols, and 1 Regosol. It is astonishing to have <b>Phaeozems.</b> In our handbooks they are described as steppe soils making excellent farmland. On the contrary, in the study area, the forest <b>Phaeozems</b> are medium-fertile and used for shifting cultivation, and the savanna <b>Phaeozems</b> are not suitable for agriculture at all. Using regression analysis to split up the contributions of organic matter and clay to the CEC leads to a modified classification: 2 savanna <b>Phaeozems</b> and the 2 Lixisols shift to the Ferralsols. With that method many more horizons have low-activity clays. To avoid some major difficulties, which may occur with regression analysis, we used the direct calculation to detect the CEC per kg clay. Anyway, the WRB key has to state clearly the required calculation method. For the <b>Phaeozems</b> we suggest introducing a ferralic qualifier. Ferralic <b>Phaeozems</b> would intergrade to the already existing Mollic Ferralsols. We also suggest modifying the handbooks to emphasis the fact that <b>Phaeozems</b> are not always steppe soils, but may also occur in tropical forest and savanna, where they usually have low-activity clays and may be rather infertile...|$|R
40|$|A well-based {{knowledge}} about the former distribution of Chernozems and <b>Phaeozems</b> is necessary to (i) better understand the factors influencing formation and degradation of these highly fertile soils, and (ii) better explain prehistoric settlement patterns that were also determined by natural factors such as soil fertility. During this archaeopedological study carried out in Central Germany we applied sedimentological and micromorphological methods to compare soils and pedosediments from the recent Chernozem/Phaeozem region with black-coloured pedosediments buried in early Neolithic structures of the recent Luvisol area directly to the east. Relocated clay coatings and significantly lower magnetic enhancement compared to Chernozem/Phaeozem-derived material were found in most black-coloured pedosediments in the Luvisol area. This demonstrates that despite their location next to an extensive Chernozem/Phaeozem area these sediments do not originate from Chernozems or <b>Phaeozems.</b> Instead, their dark colour must either originate from anthropogenic input similar to black-coloured Anthrosols (“Dark Earth”), or must stem from Ah-material of former Luvisols. Consequently, may be apart from a small relatively dry and carbonate-rich Luvisol region northwest of Leipzig there was obviously no significantly larger distribution of Neolithic Chernozems and <b>Phaeozems</b> in this region during the past. Consequently, the regional early Neolithic settlers of the Linear Pottery Culture settled intensively also in areas outside the distribution of Chernozems and <b>Phaeozems,</b> and the activities of these settlers {{did not lead to}} the formation of such soils. Thus, fertile soils were obviously only one factor among probably others to explain the regional Neolithic settlement pattern. Significantly lower carbonate contents were found for the parent material of the black-coloured pedosediments in the Luvisol region compared with the parent material of Chernzems and <b>Phaeozems.</b> This demonstrates that the decisive factor to explain the recent and former spatial distribution of Chernozems and <b>Phaeozems</b> in this relatively dry area is the carbonate dynamics. Anthropogenic activity since the early Neolithic period obviously helped to preserve the naturally formed Chernozems and <b>Phaeozems</b> by re-carbonatization processes, but humans were not the main soil forming factor in early settled regions...|$|R

The frequency of this fungus was positively correlated with the content of humus, nitrogen, CaCO3 and phosphorus in the soils, and the fungus demonstrated high tolerance for pH (e.g., from pH 4.5-9.5).

We discovered clusters of hundreds of regularly shaped pits that were always connected to the Bht horizons of adjacent Luvic Phaeozems. The occurrence of anthropogenic pits in connection with Phaeozems was never reported before, and we called them <b>Phaeozem</b> pits. We conducted archaeobotanical (charcoal analysis) and geochemical (black carbon, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations) investigations. We compared soil material from <b>Phaeozem</b> pits with clearly anthropogenic pits: (i) settlement pits, and (ii) slot pits, {{that can be found}} outside of prehistoric settlements and do not contain any visible artefacts, but are defined as anthropogenic by their shape. The main results of our study were: (1) <b>Phaeozem</b> Bht horizons and pits are man-made and archaeological off-site features. (2) Soil properties of the <b>Phaeozem</b> horizons could have been affected by inputs of soil amendments, perhaps to fertilize agricultural fields or gardens. (3) The high proportion of charred organic matter in the dark soil material of <b>Phaeozem</b> horizons and pit fillings results from vegetation fires ignited by man. (4) They were presumably formed in several periods between Mesolithic and the Middle Ages, mainly during Younger to End-Neolithic (4400 - 2200 BC).

40|$|To {{assess the}} soil quality of <b>Phaeozems</b> and Luvisols from Kujawy region (Kujawy-Pomerania Province, Poland), the soil quality {{indicators}} such as: content {{of organic matter}} and nutrients, as well as bulk density were used. The soils showed similar inherent properties (soil texture, depth to parent material, type of clay) and management practices (tillage, crop rotation, nutrient application). The following properties were determined: bulk density, grain size composition, exchangeable acidity, concentration of available forms of potassium, phosphorus and magnesium, {{and the content of}} total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (Nt). The amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved nitrogen (DN) were measured in the solution obtained after extraction with 0. 004 M CaCl 2. The stock of TOCs, Nts and DOCs, and DNs were calculated. The total organic carbon content in surface horizon of <b>Phaeozems</b> was significant higher (13. 9 - 20. 1 g·kg- 1) than in Ap horizon of Luvisols (8. 3 - 11. 0 g·kg- 1), which is a consequence of their origin. The stock of organic carbon in Ap horizon fell within 5. 89 to 8. 49 kg·m 2 in <b>Phaeozems</b> and 3. 80 to 4. 81 kg·m 2 in Luvisols. Although <b>Phaeozems</b> demonstrated a significant higher content of TOC, as compared with Luvisols, the amount of dissolved organic carbon was similar in both soil types, which points to a higher share of DOC in the total organic carbon content in Luvisols (up to 17. 5 % in Et horizon). The amounts of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved nitrogen and their stock do not depend on the type of soils if the management practices are similar...|$|R
40|$|Loss of {{ecological}} functions due to soil degradation impacts viability of crop production systems world-wide, particularly in vegetable cropping systems commonly {{located in the}} most productive areas and characterized by intensive soil cultivation. This paper reports soil degradation caused by intensive vegetable farming, and its reversibility after {{two to five years}} of drastic changes in soil management on 16 commercial vegetable farms in south Uruguay. Changes in soil management included addition of green manures and pastures in rotations of vegetable crops, use of animal manure, and erosion control support measures (terracing, reducing slope length, re-orientation of ridges). Soil degradation caused by vegetable farming was assessed by comparing soil properties in 69 vegetable fields with values at reference sites located close to the cropped fields. Effects of the changes in soil management in the 69 fields were assessed by comparing soil properties at the start and to those {{at the end of the}} project. Compared to the on-farm reference sites, the vegetable fields contained 36 % less SOC, 19 % less exchangeable potassium, water stable aggregates with an 18 % smaller geometric mean diameter, and 11 % lower plant-available soil water capacity. Phosphorus availability was 5 times higher under vegetable cropping compared to the on-farm reference. <b>Phaeozems</b> (Abruptic) revealed greater degradation (44 % less soil organic carbon (SOC)) than Vertisols (24 % less SOC) and <b>Phaeozems</b> (Pachic) (21 % less SOC). After two to five years of improved soil management, SOC concentration in the upper 20 cm increased by on average 1. 53 g kg- 1 (12 %) in the <b>Phaeozems</b> (Abruptic) and 1. 42 g kg- 1 (9 %) in the <b>Phaeozems</b> (Pachic). SOC in Vertisols increased only by 0. 87 g kg- 1, most likely due to their greater initial SOC concentration. Topsoil carbon sequestration was on average 3. 4 Mg ha- 1 in the <b>Phaeozems.</b> Multiple linear regression showed the quantity of incorporated amendments, the initial amount of SOC and the clay content to explain 77 % of the variability in yearly changes of SOC. Available water capacity increased significantly with SOC particularly due to more water retention at field capacity, resulting in an increase in available water capacity in the first 20 cm of soil of 8. 4 mm for every 10 g kg- 1 of SOC increase.

40|$|Tillage {{may affect}} the {{microstructural}} organization of soil, including the distribution of microaggregates with different mechanical strengths. We quantified the impact of tillage treatment on the amount and distribution of free organic matter, microaggregates (unstable and stable under low intensity sonification) and their components, in the upper horizons of zonal soils of the Center of the Russian Plain. Under plowing, the carbon content decreases, both in unstable and stable microaggregates. The loss of carbon in unstable microaggregates was ~ 24 %, whereas in stable microaggregates, it was ~ 37 %, relative to native soils. The carbon content of organic (LFoc) and organo-clay (Clayrd) fractions in unstable microaggregates (CLFoc/CClayrd) was almost identical in the upper horizons of native soils: the ratio of these components is for Albeluvisols (1. 1), <b>Phaeozem</b> (0. 8) and Chernozems (1. 0). Under plowing, these decrease to: Albeluvisols and Chernozems (0. 6) and <b>Phaeozem</b> (0. 5). The shares of carbon accumulated within the unstable and stable microaggregates (Cunstable/Cstable) are constant under equilibrium conditions and show a tendency to decrease {{from north to south}} on the order of: Albeluvisols and <b>Phaeozem</b> (2. 2) > Chernozems (1. 0).

However, {{there is a}} limited understanding of the dynamic processes of straw-derived and soil-derived carbon {{and the influence of}} the addition of straw carbon on soil-derived organic carbon in different soils associated with different fertility levels. In this study, we applied the in-situ carborundum tube method and 13 C-labeled maize straw (with and without maize straw) at two cropland (<b>Phaeozem</b> and Luvisol soils) experimental sites in northeast China to quantify the dynamics of maize-derived and soil-derived carbon in soils associated with high and low fertility, and to examine how the addition of maize carbon influences soil-derived organic carbon and the interactions of soil type and fertility level with maize-derived and soil-derived carbon. We found that, on average, the contributions of maize-derived carbon to total organic carbon in maize-soil systems during the experimental period were differentiated among low fertility Luvisol (from 62. 82 % to 42. 90), high fertility Luvisol (from 53. 15 % to 30. 00 %), low fertility <b>Phaeozem</b> (from 58. 69 % to 36. 29 %) and high fertility <b>Phaeozem</b> (from 41. 06 % to 16. 60 %). Furthermore, the addition of maize carbon significantly decreased the remaining soil-derived organic carbon in low and high fertility Luvisols and low fertility <b>Phaeozem</b> before two months. However, the increasing differences in soil-derived organic carbon between both soils with and without maize straw after two months suggested that maize-derived carbon was incorporated into soil-derived organic carbon, thereby potentially offsetting the loss of soil-derived organic carbon. These results suggested that <b>Phaeozem</b> and high fertility level soils would fix more maize carbon over time and thus were more beneficial for protecting soil-derived organic carbon from maize carbon decomposition...|$|E

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{performance}} of a formalized digital soil mapping (DSM) approach comprising fuzzy k-means (FKM) classification and regression-kriging to produce soil type maps from a fine-scale soil observation network in Risnovce, Slovakia. We examine whether the soil profile descriptions collected merely by field methods fit into the statistical DSM tools and if they provide pedologically meaningful results for an erosion-affected area. Soil texture, colour, carbonates, stoniness and genetic qualifiers were estimated for a total of 111 soil profiles using conventional field methods. The data were digitized along semi-quantitative scales in 10 -cm depth intervals to express the relative differences, and afterwards classified by the FKM method into four classes A-D: (i) Luvic <b>Phaeozems</b> (Anthric), (ii) Haplic <b>Phaeozems</b> (Anthric, Calcaric, Pachic), (iii) Calcic Cutanic Luvisols, and (iv) Haplic Regosols (Calcaric). To parameterize regression-kriging, membership values (MVs) to the above A-D class centroids were regressed against PCA-transformed terrain variables using the multiple linear regression method (MLR). MLR yielded significant relationships with R 2 ranging from 23 % to 47 % (P < 0. 001) for classes A, B and D, but only marginally significant for Luvisols of class C (R 2 = 14 %, P < 0. 05). Given the results, Luvisols were then mapped by ordinary kriging and the rest by regression-kriging. A 'leave-one-out' cross-validation was calculated for the output maps yielding R 2 of 33 %, 56 %, 22 % and 42 % for Luvic <b>Phaeozems,</b> Haplic <b>Phaeozems,</b> Luvisols and also Regosols, respectively (all P < 0. 001). Additionally, the pixel-mixture visualization technique was used to draw a synthetic digital soil map.

Therefore, monitoring the fate of DPAA in soils is recommended in areas contaminated by leakage from chemical weapons.

40|$|The edaphological {{evaluation}} and soil classification of experimental areas sites are important instruments for the correct interpretation of agronomical results and decisionmaking about targeting and ex-ante evaluation of agricultural technology transfer. The {{objective of this}} article is to present the results of the edaphological evaluation soil, analysis and classification of three sites located in the altiplano central of Mexico. We wanted to determine the limiting factors for agricultural production before recommending conservation practices, as developed by INIFAP in collaboration with CIMMYT. The soils were classified both under the FAO classification system and USDA Soil Taxonomy in Santa Lucía as a cumulic <b>Phaeozem,</b> or a Cumulic Haplustoll, in El Horno as a mollic Fluvisol or Mollic Ustifluvents and a haplic Fluvisol or Typic Ustifluvents, and in Calpulapan, a petroduric <b>Phaeozem,</b> or Entic Duristoll. The limiting factors for crop production are mainly related to moisture availability, varying structure and texture along the profile, low organic matter content and risk of erosion. Taking into account these limiting factors further development, extension and implementation of conservation agriculture practices is highly recommended...|$|E

The Humic Andosol is the dominant soil type which is mainly found at an altitude of 3,000 m. The other types of soil are shallow Andosols, Lithosols, and Haplic <b>Phaeozems</b> that are mainly common in the area between 2,500 and 3,500 m. The Semien Mountains are highly eroded as a result of human land use practices and {{as a result of the}} topography of the area.|$|R

Romania presents a diversity of soils, from the semi-arid zones in which specific zones encountered the wet and cold. Most soils in our country are distributed in a horizontal zonality plains and low hills are represented by cernisols (kastanozems, chernozems, <b>phaeozems)</b> and luvisols (preluvosols, luvosols) and a vertical zonality of high hills and mountain regions including cambisols zone (eutricambosols, districambosols), spodisols zone (prepodzols, podzols) and umbrisols zone (nigrosols, humosiosols) ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study on differentiation of the morphological structure of soil and selected physical and chemical properties of soils in toposequence of the Opalenica Plain. The study was conducted in a 1200 m long transect running through a typical soil toposequence for the Polish Lowland, and therefore the results presented in this study can be extrapolated to similar geomorphological conditions of the area. On the basis of pedological cross-section, the following soil units were distinguished: PWspgl – Albic Luvisols (Arenic) with glossic properties, PAt – Albic Glossic Retisols (Loamic), PAsp – Albic Glossic Retisols (Aric, Arenic), PAspgg – Albic Glossic Retisols (Aric, Arenic, Oxyaquic), PWsggl – Albic Luvisols (Aric, Arenic, Stagnic) with glossic properties, PWgggl – Albic Luvisols (Aric, Loamic, Stagnic) with glossic properties, CZgg – Mollic Reductigleyic Eutric Gleysols (Aric, Loamic), CFt – Fluvic <b>Phaeozems</b> (Aric, Arenic). Each of these units has its own specific position in toposequence but the occurrence of Fluvic <b>Phaeozems</b> (Aric, Arenic) are associated with geogenetic processes of Mogilnica river. In this work, using a multiple regression analysis a statistically significant relationships between the position of the soils in relief and the terrain slopes and the organic carbon content in Ap horizon, the cation exchangeable capacity, the sum of exchangeable bases and the pH were obtained. Systematic variability of most soil properties of Ap horizon have shown two distances of spatial variation. The first concerns the systematic changes in shorter distance (from 132 to 344 m) and can be associated with differences in soil properties between separate soil units. The second distance of spatial correlation ranges from 431 m to 792 m, which testify to the fact that quantitative changes in the properties of soils are realized gradually and distinctly, together with the differentiation of the slope, over several separate cartographic units...|$|R
