5000|$|<b>Procedure</b> <b>turn</b> (PT): ICAO {{defines a}} PT as a {{maneuver}} {{in which a}} turn is made away from a designated track followed by a turn {{in the opposite direction}} to permit the aircraft to intercept and proceed along the reciprocal of the designated track. A standardized way of reversing course to get lined up for final approach. The approach chart must indicate that a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> is authorized for the approach, via a [...] "procedure turn barb" [...] symbol or a similar notation. Note that when a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> exists for an approach, the maximum speed of the aircraft in the <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> is limited by regulations (typically, it should not exceed 200 knots IAS). The <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> is typically entered by tracking a navaid course outbound (usually following a reciprocal of the inbound course), and then turning 45° off of the course; after that, the pilot flies this leg for a certain time, then conducts a 180° turn to get on a 45° intercepting course, and then re-intercepts the inbound course.|$|R

5000|$|An {{instrument}} approach wherein final approach is begun without first having executed a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn,</b> not necessarily completed with a straight-in landing or made to straight-in landing minimums. A direct {{instrument approach}} requires no <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> {{or any other}} course reversal procedures for alignment (usually indicated by [...] "NoPT" [...] on approach plates), as the arrival direction and the final approach course are not too different from each other. The direct approach can be finished with a straight-in landing or circle-to-land procedure.|$|R
50|$|On 24 August 1984, a Balkan Bulgarian Airlines An-12B, {{registration}} LZ-BAD made a {{hard landing}} on runway 25 after a tight <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> while on approach to Bole Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, {{there were no}} casualties.|$|R
50|$|Some {{approach}} procedures do {{not permit}} straight-in approaches unless the pilots are being radar vectored. In these situations, pilots are required to complete a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> (PT) or other course reversal, generally within 10 NM of the PT fix, to establish the aircraft inbound on the intermediate or final approach segment. When conducting any type of approach, if the aircraft is not lined up for a straight-in approach, then a course reversal might be necessary. The idea of a course reversal is to allow sufficiently large changes in the course flown (in order to line the aircraft up with the final approach course), without taking too much space horizontally and while remaining {{within the confines of}} protected airspace. This is accomplished in one of three ways: a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn,</b> a holding pattern, or a teardrop course reversal.|$|R
40|$|Ketones are {{reported}} to be conveniently converted into their α-tolylsulfinylated derivatives. This new procedure {{is based on the}} reaction of their corresponding trimethylsilyl enol ethers with p-toluenesulfinyl p-tolylsulfone in the presence of tris(dimethylamino) sulfur trimethylsilyldifluoride (TAS-F). Considering that β-ketosulfoxides are key intermediates for the preparation of α,β-unsaturated ketones, this <b>procedure</b> <b>turns</b> out to be of rather broad synthetic relevance...|$|R

5000|$|Initial {{approach}} segment: This segment {{provides a}} method for aligning the aircraft with the intermediate or final approach segment and to permit descent during the alignment. It begins at an IAF and ends at the intermediate approach segment or intermediate fix (IF). A DME arc, a <b>procedure</b> <b>turn,</b> or holding pattern may be involved or the terminal route may simply intersect the final approach course.|$|R
50|$|During {{the second}} <b>procedure</b> <b>turn</b> {{before the first}} final approach, a navigational error was {{obviously}} made, as the aircraft headed straight for BN again instead of beacon MN. One cannot say whether {{this was due to}} the fact that the two beacons were not set on the ADFs in the normal sequence (ADF 1 to BN, ADF 2 to MN; the opposite settings were found in the wreckage).|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{anomalies}} {{which the}} standard scattering matrix pole-extraction procedures have produced in a mathematically well defined coupled-channel model, {{we have developed}} a new method {{based solely on the}} assumption of partial-wave analyticity. The new method is simple and applicable not only to theoretical predictions but to the empirical partial-wave data as well. Since the standard pole-extraction <b>procedures</b> <b>turn</b> out to be the lowest-order term of the proposed method the anomalies are understood and resolved. Comment: 5 page...|$|R

We characterize the difference by proving the corresponding weak convergence of Brownian motion in random scenery. When the potential depends on the spatial variable macroscopically, we prove a convergence to SPDE. Comment: 23 pages, to appear in SP...|$|R

50|$|Following {{the second}} <b>procedure</b> <b>turn,</b> a continual descent begins from {{a height of}} {{approximately}} 3,200 ft, as they had a definite glide path indication. This could not, however, {{have come from the}} ILS glide path transmitter, as the flight path led over the glide path station with its many weak and steep secondary glide path beams. The flight director system could offer an explanation for the regular rates of descent. At approximately 3,200 ft over N a spurious glide path was crossed during the second <b>procedure</b> <b>turn.</b> Now if {{on the basis of this}} indication, which might have also coincided with a localizer indication, the flight director was set to the approach mode in order to follow both pointers on this, the subsequent approach might be explained, but only if the two pilots neglected to keep the normal, continuous, mutual check on the basic navigational instruments and the marker control. The artificial horizon pitch bar which is not integrated with the ILS glide path signals required an average rate of descent of approximately 500 ft/min to maintain a 2.5° glide path without wind correction. In this instrumentation, the ILS glide path indication takes the form of a small triangle in the artificial horizon.|$|R

40|$|We reformulate, using super worldline formalism, the pinched gluon vertex {{operator}} {{proposed by}} Strassler.

Thus the pinch <b>procedures</b> <b>turn</b> out to be nothing but the insertions of δ-function. Applying our formulation to two-loop diagrams which are gluon scatterings via single spinor loop with one gluon insertion, we show various formulae on pinched N-point functions. 1 Fellow of the Danish Research Academy...|$|R

The very same <b>procedure</b> <b>turns</b> out to be automatically suited for the efficient implementation of Gauss-Legendre collocation methods, since these methods are a special instance of HBVMs. The linear convergence analysis of the splitting procedure exhibits excellent properties, which are confirmed by a few numerical tests. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
