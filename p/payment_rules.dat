50|$|Community {{health centers}} {{rely on a}} {{combination}} of Medicaid payments, grant revenues, and other private and public funding sources to fund their operations. The sources of funding for health centers have changed significantly over time. Public Health Service Act grants under Section 330 were once a prominent source of funding for CHCs. Although 330 grants remain important to the financial viability of health centers, federal reimbursement policy under Medicaid has become their largest source of revenue. In 2008, Public Health Service Act grants comprised 18.3% of all CHC revenues. The expansion of CHCs has instead been largely funded by the growth in Medicaid resulting from eligibility expansions, coverage reforms, and modified <b>payment</b> <b>rules.</b> In 1985, Medicaid patients made up 28% of all CHC patients but only 15% of CHC revenues. By 2007, the share of Medicaid patients matched their share of revenues. In the same time period, grants for the uninsured decreased from 51% to 21%. In 2008, Medicaid payments had grown to account for 37% of all CHC revenues.|$|E

50|$|Following the 1968 season, he {{was signed}} by the North Melbourne Football Club in a highly {{controversial}} transfer. A transfer fee of $2,000 was set for Bryant's clearance under a rule which the VFA had introduced in 1967, but VFL clubs were forbidden from paying any sort of transfer fee under the VFL's player <b>payment</b> <b>rules</b> - which had {{been the source of}} open dispute between the competitions over the previous two years. The VFA formally approved Bryant's clearance, and it initially appeared that it had done so without the transfer fee being paid; but VFA secretary Fred Hill then reported to the press that North Melbourne had indeed secretly paid the transfer fee in defiance of the VFL's rules. Box Hill president Reg Shineberg claimed likewise, and reported to have received the fee clandestinely - in cash, under cover of darkness, and from a man he did not know. North Melbourne was required to face the VFL arbitrators over the affair, but charges against the club were dropped when Hill did not provide any written corroborating evidence; so whether or not the illegal transfer fee was actually paid was never proven.|$|E

The Association approved the clearance of Bryant from Box Hill to the VFL's North Melbourne, and had set a transfer fee of $2,000 for Bryant's clearance. It was initially reported that the clearance had been approved without the transfer fee being paid, which could have occurred only if the Association had broken its own rules requiring the transfer fee. Association secretary Fred Hill responded to the press that this was not the case: that North Melbourne had indeed paid the transfer fee, and had done so secretly in defiance of the VFL's rules. Box Hill president Reg Shineberg described to the press the clandestine circumstances under which he had allegedly received the fee - in $10 and $20 notes, under cover of darkness outside VFA House, from a man he did not know.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. This paper explores how the Shapley value {{can be used as}} the basis of a <b>payment</b> <b>rule</b> for auctions and exchanges. The standard Shapley value is modified so that losing bidders do not make or receive any <b>payments.</b> The new <b>rule,</b> called the balanced winner contribution (BWC) rule, satisfies a variation of Myerson’s balanced contribution property. The <b>payment</b> <b>rule</b> is fair in the sense that, with respect to reported values, the members of every pair of traders make equal contributions to each other’s share of the gains from trade. BWC payments can be used in single-item auctions and more complex auctions and exchanges with multiple items and package bidding. A series of examples is presented to illustrate how the BWC rule works and how the payments compare to those based on competitive prices, the core, and the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanis...|$|R

40|$|Generalized Vickrey {{mechanisms}} {{have received}} wide {{attention in the}} combinatorial auction design literature because they are efficient and strategy-proof. However, {{it is well known}} that it is impossible for an exchange, with multiple buyers and sellers and voluntary participation, to be efficient and budget-balanced, even relaxing dominant strategy requirements. Except for special cases, a market-maker in an efficient exchange must make more payments than it collects. Taking a constructive approach, we clear exchanges to maximize reported surplus, and explore the efficiency effects of different budget-balanced <b>payment</b> <b>rules.</b> The <b>payment</b> <b>rules</b> are formulated to minimize the distance to Vickrey payments, under different metrics. Different rules lead to different levels of truth-revelation, and therefore efficiency.

40|$|Combinatorial auctions have a {{wide range}} of {{real-world}} applications; yet, designing com-binatorial auction mechanisms that simultaneously possess good economic properties and computational tractability remains a major challenge. An auction mechanism consists of an allocation rule and a payment rule. We propose a new framework that uses Structural SVMs to design a payment rule for any given allocation rule. Besides being tractable, the payment rule produced by an exact classifier is both strategyproof and individually ratio-nal. Unlike the VCG payment rule, our framework does not require an optimal allocation rule, an NP-hard problem, in order to obtain a strategyproof mechanism. Our experiments show that the <b>payment</b> <b>rules</b> generated from our framework enjoy a low level of ex post regret and approximate well-known strategyproof <b>payment</b> <b>rules,</b> such as VCG and second price, reasonably well.

40|$|This paper investigates reverse auctions {{that involve}} {{continuous}} values {{of different types}} of goods, general nonconvex constraints, and second stage costs. Our analysis seeks to design the <b>payment</b> <b>rules</b> and conditions under which coalitions of participants cannot influence the auction outcome in order to obtain higher collective utility. Under incentive-compatible bidding in the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, coalition-proof outcomes are achieved if the submitted bids are convex and the constraint sets are of polymatroid-type. Unfortunately, these conditions do not capture the complexity of the general class of reverse auctions under consideration. By relaxing the property of incentive-compatibility, we investigate further <b>payment</b> <b>rules</b> that are coalition-proof, but without any extra conditions. Among coalition-proof mechanisms, we select the mechanism that minimizes the participants' abilities to benefit from strategic manipulations, in order to incentivize truthful bidding from the participants. Since calculating the payments directly for these mechanisms is computationally difficult for auctions involving many participants, we present two computationally efficient methods. Our results are verified with several case studies based on electricity market data...|$|E
