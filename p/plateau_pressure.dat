40|$|ABSTRACT: There is {{no clear}} {{evidence}} as to how maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (PI,max) should be measured, although <b>plateau</b> <b>pressures</b> sustained for 1 s and measured at residual volume (RV) are usually recommended. Peak and plateau PI,max were measured at RV and at functional residual capacity (FRC) in 533 healthy subjects (aged 10 – 90 yrs) in order to comparably test all PI,max measurements for their predictors, reproducibility and normal values. <b>Plateau</b> <b>pressures</b> accounted for 82. 0 – 86. 3 % of peak <b>pressures.</b> Peak and <b>plateau</b> <b>pressures</b> measured at FRC accounted for 84. 3 – 90. 5 % of pressures at RV, and were highly correlated. Age was negatively predictive and weight and body mass index posi-tively predictive of PI,max, but regression parameters were low. All PI,max measurements were comparable when calculating regression parameters, between-subject variability and reproducibility. In conclusion, peak and plateau maximal inspiratory mouth pressure are comparably useful {{for the assessment of}} inspiratory muscle strength and can be reliably measured at functional residual capacity and at residual volume. Regression equations are of low impact in predicting normal values due to the weak influence of demographic and anthropometric factors and to the high unexplained between-subject-variability. Age-related 5 th percentiles can indicate the lower limit of the normal range...|$|R

Inspiratory hold maneuvers at 5, 15, 25 and 35  cmH 2 O incremental ventilatory <b>plateau</b> <b>pressures</b> (Pvent) were performed, and CO was measured in the last 3  s of the 12  s inspiratory hold.

50|$|In {{a patient}} with acute lung injury (ALI), the right level of PEEP is that which optimizes {{arterial}} oxygenation without causing O2 toxicity or ventilatior-induced lung injury. Balancing the benefit of keeping the lung open (during tidal ventilation) against the risk of lung overinflation may require monitoring of the pressure-volume curve, lung morphology, and gas exchange. When loss of aeration has a focal distribution (atelectatic lower lobes coexisting with aerated upper lobes), {{a high level of}} PEEP can cause overinflation of already aerated areas and only partial recruitment of atelectatic areas. Different strategies exist to find the level of PEEP in these patients: ARDSnet, guided by esophageal pressure, Stress Index, static airway pressure-volume curve. In such patients, some experts recommend limiting PEEP to low levels (~10cmH2O). In patients who have diffused loss of aeration PEEP can be used provided it does not cause the <b>plateau</b> <b>pressure</b> to rise above the upper inflection point.|$|E

30|$|The {{use of a}} lung {{protective}} ventilatory strategy {{resulted in}} {{a significant decrease in}} mortality in ARDS patients by the reduction of VILI during mechanical ventilation [4].

However, this ventilation strategy does not fully eliminate TR because of the persistence of atelectasis along the mechanical ventilation period. Contrarily, lung recruitment—i.e. a ventilatory strategy that reverts atelectasis by applying a few mechanical breaths at high airways pressure—can potentially avoid the occurrence of VILI by TR [8, 11, 12].

Methods: Forty-three patients were intubated with a double-lumen endobronchial tube. After positioning the patients in the lateral decubitus, one-lung ventilation was started with 100 % oxygen, tidal volume 10 ml/kg without PEEP; arte-rial oxygen tension, <b>plateau</b> airway <b>pressure,</b> and static compliance were checked as baseline values (T 0). Fifteen minutes later, same parameters were measured (T 15). The tidal volume had changed to 6 ml/kg with 6 cmH 2 O PEEP. Fifteen min-utes later, the same parameters were measured (T 30). Results: Oxygen tension had decreased at T 15 (282. 1 ± 83. 4 mmHg) compared to T 0 (477. 2 ± 82. 4 mmHg) (P < 0. 0001), but was maintained at T 30 (270. 4 ± 81. 9 mmHg).
