In order to increase their pin utilization rate and electrical characteristics for high-speed applications, an innovative leadframe package, named multiple exposed pads (M-pad) LQFP package, is proposed.

50|$|Of {{particular}} interest to the SOFC-based IGFC power system is catalytic coal gasification, because of the characteristically high methane content of its resultant syngas. This process experienced development in the 1980s for synthetic natural gas production purposes. Compared to conventional gasification summarized above, a catalytic gasifier would require less oxygen input, run at a lower process temperature, and produce a syngas stream with a higher methane concentration (vol), in addition to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. With its lower operating temperature, a relatively high cold gas efficiency of at least 90% is projected for catalytic gasification, and this characteristic, {{as well as the}} process need for less oxygen input, would directly support high-efficiency IGFC power system operation. Furthermore, internal reformation of the substantial methane content of its syngas within the SOFC module can be used by design to assist module cooling, and can thereby lead to reductions in the <b>parasitic</b> <b>power</b> demand associated with cooling air supply.The SOFC electric power generator module in an IGFC system could conceivably be fueled with syngas supplied by any of the available conventional coal gasifiers, and studies indicate that power system electric efficiencies in the 45-50% range are achievable, depending on whether the power system uses atmospheric-pressure or pressurized SOFC modules. However, from the efficiency viewpoint particularly, the preferred coal gasification approach for the application is catalytic. Using that technology, IGFC system efficiencies in 56-60% range are projected, again depending on SOFC module pressurization. Estimates and comparisons are tabulated below.† The efficiency estimates include the effects of <b>parasitic</b> <b>power</b> loads due to CO2 compression for carbon sequestration/storage.|$|E
5000|$|While {{energy is}} always lost during a brake event, a {{secondary}} factor that influences efficiency is [...] "off-brake drag", or drag {{that occurs when}} the brake is not intentionally actuated. After a braking event, hydraulic pressure drops in the system, allowing the brake caliper pistons to retract. However, this retraction must accommodate all compliance in the system (under pressure) as well as thermal distortion of components like the brake disc or the brake system will drag until the contact with the disc, for example, knocks the pads and pistons back from the rubbing surface. During this time, there can be significant brake drag. This brake drag can lead to significant <b>parasitic</b> <b>power</b> loss, thus impacting fuel economy and overall vehicle performance.|$|E

5000|$|Most Dell laptop {{computers}} {{have a special}} external power supply (PSU) which cannot {{be replaced by a}} third-party universal supply. The PSU has what's called UniqueWare™ Add-Only Memory, known under type DS2501. It is a <b>parasitic</b> <b>power</b> circuit memory chip connected to the center identification pin in the plug, via a 2m long unshielded wire alongside the PSU cable. This chip produces a special signal using a 1 wire communication protocol known as [...] "1-wire" [...] in identifying the PSU as an original Dell PSU. This chip handles all the data needed to authenticate a charge. If a power supply not made by Dell is used, or the cable near the connector becomes damaged as is not infrequent after some use, the PSU stops charging the battery and the CPU runs slower, although the computer can be used indefinitely so long as it remains plugged in. If this problem is present at startup, the message [...] "The AC power adapter type cannot be determined. Your system will operate slower and the battery will not charge" [...] is displayed. This will continue until the external PSU is replaced. A few third-party suppliers make power supplies with specific provision for Dell computers at lower prices than Dell's. It is possible to work round the slowdown, but not the battery charging, by installing a CPU clock utility. On some models (the 9100 for instance), the problem can be worked around by starting the computer without a battery installed and fitting the battery after the computer has booted.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A hh-hopping {{accelerator}} for on-chip {{power supply}} circuits is proposed {{and the effectiveness}} of the accelerator circuit is experimentally verified.

50|$|The manual {{transmission}} couples {{the engine to}} the transmission with a rigid clutch instead of the torque converter on an automatic transmission or the v-belt of a continuously variable transmission, which slip by nature. Manual transmissions also lack the <b>parasitic</b> <b>power</b> consumption of the automatic transmission's hydraulic pump. Because of this, {{manual transmission}}s generally offer better fuel economy than automatic or continuously variable transmissions; however the disparity has been somewhat offset {{with the introduction of}} locking torque converters on automatic transmissions. Increased fuel economy with a properly operated manual transmission vehicle versus an equivalent automatic transmission vehicle can range from 5% to about 15% depending on driving conditions and style of driving. The lack of control over downshifting under load in an automatic transmission, coupled with a typical vehicle engine's greater efficiency under higher load, can enable additional fuel gains from a manual transmission by allowing the operator to keep the engine performing under a more efficient load/RPM combination. This is especially true as between manual and automatic versions of older models, as more recent advances including variable valve timing reduce the efficiency disadvantages of automatic transmissions by allowing better performance over a broader RPM range. In recognition of this, many current models (2010 and on) come with manual modes, or overrides on automatic models, although the degree of control varies greatly by the manufacturer. Also, manual transmissions do not require active cooling and because they are, mechanically, much simpler than automatic transmissions, they generally weigh less than comparable automatics, which can improve economy in stop-and-go traffic. However this gap in economy is being rapidly closed, and many mid to higher end model automatic cars now get better economy than their standard spec counterparts. This is in part due to the increasing impact of computers co-ordinating multiple systems, particularly in hybrid models in which the engine and drive motors must be managed, as well as using different automatic technology such as CVT and Dual-Clutch Automatics.|$|E
