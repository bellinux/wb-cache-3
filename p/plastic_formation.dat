40|$|Connections between {{structural}} members are critical elements that typically govern {{the performance of}} structural systems; hence, techniques for monitoring the condition of connections are needed to provide early warning of structural damage. <b>Plastic</b> hinge <b>formation</b> in fasteners frequently occurs in timber connections when the yield capacity is exceeded. An innovative pulse echo testing technique was developed for detecting the <b>formation</b> of a <b>plastic</b> hinge in bolted timber connections and estimating the associated magnitude of connection displacement. A shift in overall signal centroid {{proved to be the}} best flTedictor of <b>plastic</b> hinge <b>formation,</b> with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 9. As the plastic hinge angle increased, the signal centroid shifted to the right since a higher proportion of pulse energy was forced to undergo multiple transverse wave reflections caused by the deformed geometry of the bolt. Because the determination of a shift in signal centroid requires the availability of prior test information for the initially undeformed fastener, an alternate linear relationship between echo amplitude ratios and <b>plastic</b> hinge <b>formation</b> was also proposed with an adjusted R 2 of 0. 87.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{monograph}} was to develop the methodology of formation, classification of properties {{and analysis of the}} structure of the surface layers, particularly the zone connecting the core and the coating and between the single layers created on the working surfaces of dies for the <b>plastic</b> <b>formation</b> on non-ferrous metals, with particular consideration to the specific nature of the extrusion process with reversibly rotating die (the KOBO method). Design/methodology/approach: Nanocrystalline structure layers production technology was developed, which included nanocomposite and low-friction layers with desired usable properties ensuring increased durability, abrasive and adhesion wear strength. The production process of dual-layer coatings, such as hard nitride layer - low friction DLC layer, was carried out in the continuous mode, on a device furnished with technologies of lateral, rotating cathodes and central rotating cathode, within one technological process. The developed coatings were tested under the working conditions for the elements coated with them (tools – dies), in order to establish the anticipated responses and properties during their use. Findings: The numerous interdisciplinary tests and analyses carried out in the scope of material science, production technology and computer techniques as well as the results obtained provided foundation for the formation of structure and tribological properties of the dies by controlled process conditions. The required final quality and durability of the tools for plastic metal formation in the extrusion process was obtained, which has been proven under operating conditions. Practical implications: Economically efficient process improvement, increased production efficiency and quality and products reliability through increased durability and unfailing operation time of tools for <b>plastic</b> <b>formation</b> of nonferrous metals and improved usable properties shall guarantee measurable economic effects to the manufacturers and users of the products. Moreover, it will enhance their competitiveness both on the domestic and overseas markets. Originality/value: The Author’s original approach was the development of a dual-layer coating within one process. Such coatings consists of the internal hard PVD layer providing the appropriate hardness, strength, low thermal conductivity and restricting the impact of external factors on the wear process of the dies used for non-ferrous metals extrusion and the external low-friction layer providing good tribological properties, which, in combination with the appropriate formation of the transition zone between the base material and coating, and between the single layers in the coating, providing adhesion sufficiently high, enabled increased operating durability of the dies, and this has been proved in this paper...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} method based on impulse response {{to determine the}} time and location of <b>plastic</b> hinge <b>formation</b> by using the recorded responses of the structure in time domain without using complicated transformations. At early stages of earthquake loading, structural systems remain in the elastic phase but when the loading increases, plastic hinges will be formed and will affect the structural response. Determining the location and time of this damage can be very important in decision making process. Most of the previously presented methods aimed at finding the time and location of hinge formation by changing the response space by employing Fourier, Short time Fourier or wavelet transform methods using changes in vibration properties of the system like vibration frequency or vibration modes of the structure.

Stem cells have unlimited potential for self-renewal and develop into various cell types. For the mesodermal tissue engineering such a source of cells is the bone marrow stroma. However, isolation of the bone marrow requires general or spinal anesthesia and yields low number of mesodermal stem cells (MSCs) upon processing (1 MSC per 105 adherent stromal cells). An alternative source of autologous stem cells seems to be, apart from bone marrow: periosteum, muscular tissue or synovial membrane and adipose tissue.

Stromal stem cells, isolated from this tissue, exhibit characteristics common to mesodermal tissues, including: adherence to <b>plastic,</b> <b>formation</b> of fibroblastic- like colonies, extensive proliferative capacity, ability to differentiate into several mesodermal lineages (including bone, cartilage, muscle and fat), and expression of several common cell surface antigens.

Three examples - aided by the writings of Catherine Malabou and Karen Barad - will provide instances of and for a diffractive mode of spectatorship, where space, sensorium and the social are cut through with new acts of <b>plastic</b> <b>formation</b> in the brain. The first example considers Socrates’ cataleptic condition in The Symposium. Read through what Malabou describes as ‘explosive plasticity’, these ‘fits of abstraction’ are conditions of possibility for synaptic spacing in the brain. Catalepsy and the wounded are bound by an ethics of ‘regenerative repair’ – the sculpting and re-sculpting of the brain in the aftermath of a rupture. The second example explores the intra-active mattering of the universe in Jean-Paul Sartre’s Nausea, in particular, Antoine Roquentin’s encounter with a pebble – a nonhuman iteration. This exposure to an existential futurity – the death-drive of the Anthropocene – where plastics and plasticity are caught in a battle between the brain and the environment. The third example explores walking and migration in the new hinterlands of the twenty-first century.

40|$|Liquefaction {{is one of}} {{the leading}} seismic actions to cause {{extensive}} damage to buildings and infrastructure during earthquakes. In many historic cases, <b>plastic</b> hinge <b>formations</b> in piles were observed at inexplicable locations. This project investigates the behaviour of piled foundations within soils susceptible to liquefaction using numerical analysis carried out in Abaqus in terms of plastic hinge development.

An extensive analysis and design study of 3 -, 6 - and 10 -storey frames, both undamped moment-resisting frames (MRFs) and retrofitted with hysteretic and frictional dissipators has been performed. Frames were modelled using the finite element program Sap 2000 and were analysed using both non-linear static pushover analysis and non-linear time history analysis. The principal aims were to assess the degree of improvement in performance achieved through use of the devices, and the suitability of various displacement-based analysis methods for estimating the seismic response of frames fitted with dissipative devices. It was found that both dissipative systems led to substantial improvements in frame performance, in terms of <b>plastic</b> hinge <b>formation</b> (reduced to virtually zero) and deformation (reduced by a factor of more than 2). Base shears remained similar to those for the undamped MRFs. Pushover analyses were found to be a useful design tool for the unretrofitted frames, giving good estimates of the overall displacement demands, base shears and <b>plastic</b> hinge <b>formation.</b> However, the various pushover approaches proved less successful at estimating the performance of the dissipative frames, where they appeared to underestimate the beneficial effects of energy dissipation. Of the various pushover methods assessed, the FEMA 356 approach appears to offer the most accurate and realistic estimate of seismic performance, {{with the exception of the}} inter-storey drift distribution. For the 6 - and 10 -storey frames (both ductile MRFs and dissipative frames), pushover methods using fixed, single load patterns gave rather poor estimates of the distribution of inter-storey drift with height.

Among the aluminium alloys, the AA 2024 -T 3 highlights due to its high flow stress and strain hardening. Moreover, the material temperature sensitivity has been found dependent on plastic strain.
