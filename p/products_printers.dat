40|$|Reliable {{image quality}} {{assessments}} {{are necessary for}} evaluating digital imaging methods (halftoning techniques) and <b>products</b> (<b>printers,</b> displays). Typically {{the quality of the}} imaging method or product is evaluated by comparing the fidelity of an image before and after processing by the imaging method or product. It is well established that simple approaches like mean squared error do not provide meaningful measures of image fidelity. A number of image fidelity metrics have been developed whose goal was to predict the amount of differences that would be visible to a human observer. In this paper we outline a new model of the human visual system (HVS) and show how this model can be used in image quality assessment. Our model departs from previous approaches in three ways: 1) We use a physiologically and psychophysically plausible Gabor pyramid to model a receptive field decomposition; 2) We use psychophysical experiments that directly assess the percept we wish to model; and 3) We model discrimination performance by using discrimination thresholds instead of detection thresholds. The first psychophysical experiment tested the visual system's sensitivity as a function of spatial frequency, orientation, and average luminance. The second experiment tested the relation between contrast detection and contrast discrimination...|$|E

50|$|These issues {{provided}} a great incentive for MIM to grind its ores finer. MIM metallurgists had undertaken fine grinding test work on samples from both deposits using conventional grinding technologies between 1975 and 1985. However, {{it was found}} that conventional grinding had a very high power consumption and that contamination of the mineral surface by iron from the steel grinding media adversely affected flotation performance.It was concluded in 1990 that there was no suitable existing technology for grinding to the fine sizes in the base metals industry. Consequently, Mount Isa’s head of mineral processing research, Dr Bill Johnson, began looking at grinding practices outside the mining industry. He found that fine grinding was well established for such high-value manufactured <b>products</b> as <b>printer</b> inks, pharmaceuticals, paint pigments and chocolate.|$|R
