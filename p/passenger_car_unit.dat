The paper proposes the modified Webster’s formula to estimate the delay of vehicles at pre-timed signalized intersections under mixed traffic conditions. Traffic volumes approaching signalized intersections are classified into four groups: Motorized two-wheeler, Car, Minibus, and Bus. The <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> <b>unit</b> is estimated by using the multiple regression analysis. Distributions of the saturation flow are developed and proved to follow the normal distributions at three studied intersections.

40|$|AbstractThe {{majority}} of the roads in India are of single-lane or two-lane width. Due to budget constrains sometimes these roads are constructed with {{one and a half}} lane width (5. 5 m) and is called intermediate-lane road with traffic moving on both directions. To simplify the analysis of mixed traffic on such roads, different types of vehicles are converted into equivalent number of passenger cars by using <b>Passenger</b> <b>Car</b> <b>Unit</b> (PCU). In the present study, an attempt is made to study the effect of the carriageway width on PCU of different vehicle categories. Data are collected at ten sections of intercity roads in different states in India. The results show that PCU value for a vehicle type varies with traffic volume and composition on the road and the carriageway width of the road being used. For example the average PCU for a big car varies from 1. 46 to 1. 59 on two-lane roads, 1. 23 to 1. 55 on intermediate roads and 1. 58 on single-lane roads. All these results are discussed in this paper...|$|E

The limitation of Highway Capacity Manual’s PCU values is ex-plained. Statistical analysis determined that there is a significant difference in volume of cars only between homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic conditions for various road widths. Hence the PCU values of heterogeneous traffic are recommended for the design of traffic systems over homogeneous traffic conditions. The {{results of the present study}} shows that for heavy vehicles, SUVs and motorcycles, the PCU values as a function of volume to capacity ratio vary from 0. 8 to 2. 8, 1. 0 to 2. 3 and 0. 2 to 0. 65 respectively.

40|$|Capacity is {{a central}} concept in design and {{operation}} of roadways. Studying roadway capacity and factors affecting this capacity {{is an important issue}} when transportation facilities are designed or upgraded. One of the main components for the estimation of roadway capacity is the <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> <b>unit</b> (PCU). The main objective {{of this paper is to}} study the influence of different geometric features of tangent and curved elements on PCU values on two-lane two-way rural roads. Geometry and traffic data were collected from six sites located on Benisuif-Assiut Agricultural Road, Egypt. Each site was composed of two elements; a straight element (tangent) and a succeeding horizontal curve. PCU values were estimated using the speed-area method. Using regression analysis, different models were developed to model the influences of different geometric features on PCU values. The results show that the PCU values for different vehicle categories increase linearly with increase of carriageway width and horizontal curve radius. This increase is clearly observed in case of heavy vehicles rather than light vehicles. The resulting models are useful in optimizing geometric design on two-lane two-way highways from the capacity point of view in the preliminary design stage...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{formulate}} rational traffic management measures for urban roads, {{it is essential}} to understand the effect of different types of vehicle on congestion. The effect of different types of vehicle on congestion has been captured on the basis of marginal congestion. Using congestion models, the marginal congestions have been estimated for different road widths, traffic compositions and on-street parking levels. The peak hour vehicular composition and volume level vary for different roads in an urban area. Therefore, for assessing the operating conditions for different roads based on a comparable quantitative measure, the marginal congestion caused per <b>Passenger</b> <b>Car</b> <b>Unit</b> (PCU) of mixed traffic stream has been estimated and denominated ‘Marginal Congestion Index (MCI) ’. The use of MCI for prioritization of management actions for different urban roads is discussed. It is shown that a congestion model explicitly accounts for the effects of traffic composition and volume level. Therefore, the effect of different types of vehicles on congestion at all traffic volumes could be estimated using congestion models. Altogether, modeling of congestion is established as a tool for formulating rational traffic management measures for urban roads in developing countries...|$|E

Considering this, a new microscopic simulation technique, where a co-ordinate approach to modelling vehicle location is adopted, {{has been used for}} modelling the traffic operations at signalised intersections of developing cities. The model has been calibrated and validated on the basis of data collected from Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. It has been found that the concept of <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> <b>unit</b> (PCU), which is widely used as a signal design parameter, is not applicable in case of mixed traffic comprising of both motorised and non-motorised vehicles. Therefore, using the developed simulation model the saturation flows at signalised intersections are investigated in an aggregate form of vehicles per hour. It has also been found that saturation flows in terms of aggregate vehicles are very much dependent on the approach width, turning proportion and composition of the traffic mix. Using the simulation results, an equation has also been regressed {{in order to be able}} to estimate the saturation flow from the influencing variables like road width, turning proportion, percentage of heavy and non-motorised vehicles. ...|$|E
