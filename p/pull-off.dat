5|$|Several {{changes have}} been made to the {{gameplay}} mechanics for Guitar Hero II: hammer-on and <b>pull-off</b> functionality has been improved, and three note chords have been introduced, scored as triple points if played correctly. There are additional statistics available for a song upon completion, and the scores achieved in either Quick Play or Career mode are saved to the same in-game high-score list. The handedness of the guitar can now be toggled from the Pause menu when playing a song (previously, this was only available from the game's main menu). For the Xbox 360 version, scores can also be compared with other players through Xbox Live via the Leaderboard feature, and there are 50 Achievements that can be earned in the game.|$|E

500|$|He {{was also}} {{recognized}} for his [...] "spanky-twang" [...] guitar style. To create his sound, {{he used a}} pronounced 'phaser' effect (see 'Modulation Effects': below) plus a mixture of thumb and fingers during the rhythmic parts, while using picks for the lead runs. He combined hammer-on and <b>pull-off</b> riffs, with eventual upper-fret double stops and modulation effects. Jennings played a 1953 Fender Telecaster, a used guitar that {{was a gift from}} The Waylors. Jennings's bandmates adorned his guitar with a distinctive leather cover that featured a black background with a white floral work. Jennings further customized it by filing down the frets to lower the strings on the neck to obtain the slapping sound. Among his other guitars, Jennings used a 1950 Fender Broadcaster from the mid-1970s, until he gave it to guitarist Reggie Young in 1993. The leather covers of his guitars were carved by leather artist Terry Lankford.|$|E
500|$|Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars {{received}} positive reviews, with {{an average}} score of 85% on review aggregate sites Metacritic and GameRankings. Critics praised its balance between accessibility and depth; Adam Sessler called it the perfect game for the Wii's demographic, and remarked that it allows [...] "grandmas, kiddies and junkies" [...] to perform intricate combos, while including deeper gameplay mechanics for the [...] "more refined palate". Contrasting the game with previous Vs. titles, GameSpot reviewer Randolph Ramsay stated that its use of fewer buttons [...] "may seem less complex , but this simplicity belies the depth of each character's move set." [...] Eurogamer's Matt Edwards believed that, compared to the separate buttons for punches and kicks in , Tatsunoko vs. Capcoms streamlined approach was moderately easy to learn. Edwards claimed that the game is a [...] "slightly slower and more user-friendly Marvel, without losing the ability to <b>pull-off</b> crazy 50+ hit combos." ...|$|E

5000|$|In guitar playing (apart from {{classical}} guitar) legato is used interchangeably as a {{label for}} both musical articulation and a particular application of techniqueâ€”playing musical phrases with predominantly hammer-ons or <b>pull-offs</b> instead of picking. Legato technique to provide legato articulation on electric guitar generally requires playing notes that are close {{and on the}} same string, following the first note with others that are played by hammer-ons and pull-offs.Some guitar virtuosos (notably Allan Holdsworth and Shawn Lane) developed their legato technique {{to the extent that}} they could perform extremely complex passages involving any permutation of notes on a string at extreme tempos, and particularly in the case of Holdsworth, tend to eschew <b>pull-offs</b> entirely for what some feel is a detrimental effect on guitar tone as the string is pulled slightly sideways.The term [...] "hammer-ons from nowhere" [...] is commonly employed when crossing strings and relying solely on fretting hand strength to produce a note but on a plucked string.Many guitar virtuosos are well-versed in the legato technique, as it allows for rapid and [...] "clean" [...] runs. Multiple hammer-ons and <b>pull-offs</b> together are sometimes also referred to colloquially as [...] "rolls," [...] a reference to the fluid sound of the technique. A rapid series of hammer-ons and <b>pull-offs</b> between a single pair of notes is called a trill.|$|R
500|$|A {{key feature}} of the song is the driving guitar rhythmic figure {{centered}} on one chord, with [...] "accents that fell fractionally ahead of the beat". [...] Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray describes it as a [...] "rocking dance piece... its structure is utterly free-form, its basic beat is the jumping, polyrhythmic groove which he [...] learned in the Delta". [...] In an interview with B.B. King, Hooker confirmed that he used an open G guitar tuning technique for his guitar, although he usually used a capo, raising the pitch to B (1948), A (1959), or A (1970). [...] He also employed hammer-on and <b>pull-off</b> techniques, which are described as [...] "a slurred ascending bass line played on the fifth string [...] " [...] by music writer Lenny Carlson. [...] Although it is titled a [...] "boogie", it does not resemble the earlier boogie-woogie style. [...] Boogie-woogie {{is based on a}} left-hand piano ostinato or walking-bass line and, as performed on guitar, forms the popular 1940s instrumental [...] "Guitar Boogie". [...] Rather than being derivative, Hooker's boogie becomes [...] "as overwhelmingly personal a piece as anything ever done in the blues".|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to other music and rhythm video games, in that the player must press buttons on a game controller in time with scrolling notes on the game screen to complete a song. The basic mechanics are based on Konami's Guitar Freaks. In the case of Guitar Hero, the player may use either the guitar peripheral (a 3/4-scale reproduction of the Gibson SG guitar as bundled with the game, or a third-party version) or a standard controller to play the scrolling notes. The guitar peripheral has five different-colored fret buttons near the nut of the guitar neck, and a strum bar and a whammy bar {{on the body of}} the guitar. The peripheral also has other buttons in order to navigate the game's menus. Music is displayed on screen through a series of notes, matching in color and position to the fret buttons, that scroll down the screen on a fret board. To hit or play a note, the player must hold down the fret button corresponding to the note shown and toggle the strum bar {{at the same time as}} that note passes a marked area on the screen. Faster series of notes may be played on the guitar controller using hammer-on and <b>pull-off</b> techniques where the player does not need to strum each note. [...] The game supports toggling the handedness of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller. A player using the standard controller simply presses the buttons that correspond with the displayed notes as outlined in the game's manual.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero Live follows similar {{gameplay}} {{to previous}} installments in the series, requiring players {{to use a}} guitar-shaped controller with buttons and a strum bar to match notes on a scrolling [...] "highway" [...] corresponding to notes played in a song. In contrast to the previous five-button design, the Guitar Hero Live controller features six buttons arranged into two rows of three. The frets are represented by a [...] "note highway", three scrolling lanes on-screen, containing either black or white notes representing the two rows. Lower difficulty levels use one row of buttons, while higher difficulties may include [...] "chords" [...] that {{use a combination of}} buttons from both rows. The game typically maps out power chords to use the top row of buttons, while modifications of those chords include others from the bottom row. Notes may be held and sustained, indicated by trailing lines after the note markers, during which the player can use the guitar's whammy bar to alter the held note's pitch for effect. Fast-moving sections of songs may employ the use of hammer-on and <b>pull-off</b> notes, marked with a special outline, which can be played without using the strum bar. The game also retains the concept of open strumming introduced in previous Guitar Hero titles, represented as a horizontal bar across the lanes and requiring the player to hit the strum bar without pressing any fret keys. The player is able to select one of four difficulty levels which affect the number and complexity of the note patterns they have to hit, and the speed at which the on-screen display scrolls. Guitar Hero Live can also be played by two players, both playing on separate guitar controllers with split-screen separate note highways, competing for the best score. Songs in GH Live mode (below) also includes vocals, allowing players to sing along in tone with the song's lyrics using a connected microphone.|$|E

2500|$|Instruments made {{specifically}} {{for the use of}} a steel are played horizontally, on the player's lap or otherwise supported. Proper terminology for the hand-held bar used is [...] "steel" [...] or [...] "tone bar" [...] rather than [...] "slide". Nevertheless, the term [...] "lap slide" [...] coexists with [...] "lap steel" [...] to describe the same instrument played in a different style. [...] "Slide" [...] usually connotes blues or rock music. The steel is held in the non-dominant hand and pressed against the strings and moved horizontally to change the pitch. The ring and little finger usually rest on the strings to block unwanted overtones. The instruments are designed with the strings relatively high off the fingerboard to allow for more pressure from a heavier steel without hitting the fingerboard. Actual frets may not exist on these instruments, only visual markers where the frets would normally be. The guitars have reinforced necks, often square, to withstand high tunings that would not be supported by the slimmer neck of a traditional guitar. The steel chosen may be in many different shapes and styles and is a matter of personal preference of the performer. The most common steel is a solid metal cylinder with one end rounded into a bullet shape, about [...] in diameter and [...] in length. Some lap slide guitar players choose a steel with a deep indentation or groove on each side so it can be held firmly (see photo), and may have squared-off ends. The better grip facilitates playing the rapid vibratos in blues music. This design, often used by resonator guitar players, facilitates hammer-on and <b>pull-off</b> notes. The lap instruments are typically plucked with the dominant hand, with or without finger picks. On occasion, an artist may use a flat pick. Both hands may be involved another important functionâ€”to dampen or mute unwanted strings and to stop notes in staccato passages to prevent notes from running together.|$|E

50|$|The melodic {{style in}} {{bluegrass}} is often fast and dynamic, with slides, hammer-ons, <b>pull-offs,</b> powerful strumming and rapid crosspicking. Bluegrass flatpickers usually prefer guitars {{with a flat}} top rather than an arch top, and steel strings rather than nylon.|$|R
5000|$|On most {{acoustic}} instruments, {{this means}} the second note has little sustain. As a result, in acoustic music, <b>pull-offs</b> are primarily used as an embellishment. Performers of plucked instruments tend to use [...] "pull-offs" [...] when playing grace notes, usually in conjunction with multiple hammer-ons and strumming or picking to produce a rapid, rippling effect. In rock and heavy metal music, electric guitars are often performed with overdriven amplifiers and/or guitar effects such as distortion pedals and compression pedals are used, which add substantial sustain to the sound. With this type of electronic gear and a powerful instrument amplifier nearing the threshold of feedback, <b>pull-offs</b> can even be used to play sustained notes.|$|R
50|$|The song {{is notable}} for its intro, an {{acoustic}} flamenco-style solo by Eddie Van Halen. This {{was accomplished by}} using his right hand to pick a single-note trill on the high E string.
