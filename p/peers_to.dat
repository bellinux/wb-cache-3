5|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 (c. 34) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that was}} given Royal Assent on 11 November 1999. The Act {{reformed}} the House of Lords, one of the chambers of Parliament. For centuries, the House of Lords had included several hundred members who inherited their seats; the Act removed such a right. However, {{as part of a}} compromise, the Act did permit ninety-two hereditary <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> remain in the House on an interim basis.

5|$|Under {{articles}} XXII and XXIII of the Act of Union of 1707, Scottish peers {{were entitled}} to elect sixteen representative <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> the House of Lords. Each served for one Parliament or a maximum of seven years, but could be re-elected during future Parliaments. Upon the summons of a new Parliament, the Sovereign would issue a proclamation summoning Scottish <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The elections were held in the Great Gallery, a large room decorated by eighty-nine of Jacob de Wet's portraits of Scottish monarchs, from Fergus Mór to Charles II. The Lord Clerk Register would read out the Peerage Roll as indicates his presence when called. The Roll was then re–read, with each peer responding by publicly announcing his votes and the return {{being sent to the}} clerk of the crown at London. The same procedure was used whenever a vacancy arose.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E

He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.|$|E
5|$|George {{inherited}} the throne at a politically turbulent time. Lloyd George's People's Budget had been rejected {{the previous year}} by the Conservative and Unionist-dominated House of Lords, contrary to the normal convention that the Lords did not veto money bills. Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith had asked the previous king to give an undertaking that he would create sufficient Liberal <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> force the budget through the House. Edward had reluctantly agreed, provided the Lords rejected the budget after two successive general elections. After a general election in January 1910, the Conservative peers allowed the budget, for which the government now had an electoral mandate, to pass without a vote.|$|E

One significant amendment made to the Bill was the so-called Weatherill Amendment, named for the Lord Weatherill, the former Speaker of the House of Commons. The Weatherill Amendment put into place the deal agreed to by the Prime Minister and Viscount Cranborne, and allowed 92 hereditary <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> remain members of the House of Lords.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compile and {{evaluate}} the evidence on the effects on health and social outcomes of computer based <b>peer</b> <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> communities and electronic self support groups, used by people to discuss health related issues remotely. DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: Analysis of studies identified from Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Electronics and Communications Abstracts, Computer and Information Systems Abstracts, ERIC, LISA, ProQuest Digital Dissertations, Web of Science. SELECTION OF STUDIES: We searched for before and after studies, interrupted time series, cohort studies, or studies with control groups; evaluating health or social outcomes of virtual <b>peer</b> <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> communities, either as stand alone interventions or {{in the context of}} more complex systems with <b>peer</b> <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> components. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Peer</b> <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> interventions and co-interventions studied, general characteristics of studies, outcome measures used, and study results. RESULTS: 45 publications describing 38 distinct studies met our inclusion criteria: 20 randomised trials, three meta-analyses of n of 1 trials, three non-randomised controlled trials, one cohort study, and 11 before and after studies. Only six of these evaluated "pure" <b>peer</b> <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> communities, and one had a factorial design with a "peer <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> only" arm, whereas 31 studies evaluated complex interventions, which often included psychoeducational programmes or one to one communication with healthcare professionals, making it impossible to attribute intervention effects <b>to</b> the <b>peer</b> <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> community component. The outcomes measured most often were depression and social support measures; most studies did not show an effect. We found no evidence to support concerns over virtual communities harming people. CONCLUSIONS: No robust evidence exists of consumer led <b>peer</b> <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> communities, partly because most <b>peer</b> <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> communities have been evaluated only in conjunction with more complex interventions or involvement with health professionals. Given the abundance of unmoderated <b>peer</b> <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> groups on the internet, research is required to evaluate under which conditions and for whom electronic support groups are effective and how effectiveness in delivering social support electronically can be maximised...|$|R

5|$|Representative peers were {{introduced}} in 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into the Kingdom of Great Britain. At the time, there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers. The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently {{the election of a}} small number of representative <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> represent Scotland was negotiated. A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1801.|$|E
5|$|Researchers in {{the field}} {{advocate}} a teaching style that incorporates group problem-solving activities and demands higher-level thought. According to this process, a teacher initially poses a single question {{in a number of}} ways. Next, students discuss the problem with the teacher and amongst themselves, asking questions. In forming these questions, students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their <b>peers,</b> <b>to</b> generate a solution. Other curriculum designs tailored to young children such as “” incorporate practices which aim to improve students’ capacity to shift and prolong attention as well as think “outside the box” (i.e. generate creative solutions).|$|E

5|$|The block {{voting system}} was used, with each peer casting as many votes {{as there were}} seats to be filled. The system, however, {{permitted}} the party with {{the greatest number of}} peers, normally the Conservatives, to procure a disproportionate number of seats, with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to admit the representative <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive writs of summons.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It {{is worth noting that}} JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, The 4th Earl of Kilmorey (a peer from an Ulster family), died in 1961. Disputes then arose as to whether representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, although the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such plans. In the next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all peers in the Peerage of Scotland the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow Irish <b>peers</b> <b>to</b> attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all Irish peers the right to stand for election to the House of Commons, and to vote at parliamentary elections.|$|E
