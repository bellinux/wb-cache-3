5|$|Certain <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> {{be solved}} using this result. For example, {{consider}} two measuring cups of volume a and b. By adding/subtracting u multiples {{of the first}} cup and v multiples of the second cup, any volume ua + vb can be measured out. These volumes are all multiples of g = gcd(a, b).|$|E
5|$|In each case, these {{simplified}} models display many of {{the issues}} that have to be handled in practice. Constraint satisfaction problems, which generalize graph homomorphism <b>problems,</b> <b>can</b> express various additional types of conditions (such as individual preferences, or bounds on the number of coinciding assignments). This allows the models to be made more realistic and practical.|$|E
5|$|In morphology, {{analogous}} traits {{arise when}} different species live in similar ways and/or a similar environment, and so {{face the same}} environmental factors. When occupying similar ecological niches (that is, a distinctive way of life) similar <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> lead to similar solutions. The British anatomist Richard Owen {{was the first to}} identify the fundamental difference between analogies and homologies.|$|E
5000|$|The Dirichlet <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> {{be solved}} for many PDEs, {{although}} originally it was posed for Laplace's equation. In that case the <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> be stated as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|A bilevel {{optimization}} <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> {{be generalized}} to a multi-objective bilevel optimization problem with multiple objectives at one or both levels. A general multi-objective bilevel optimization <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> be formulated as follows: ...|$|R
30|$|By {{using the}} {{collocation}} method, the variables are discretized, the <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> {{be transferred to}} linear equations. Combining MATLAB software with least square method to solve the unknown coefficient, numerical solution of the <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> be obtained.|$|R
5|$|Matrix {{calculations}} can be often {{performed with}} different techniques. Many <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> {{be solved by}} both direct algorithms or iterative approaches. For example, the eigenvectors of a square matrix {{can be obtained by}} finding a sequence of vectors xn converging to an eigenvector when n tends to infinity.|$|E
5|$|Although this species' {{population}} {{now appears}} to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E
5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be fatal to horses, as their bodies are designed to bear weight on all four legs and serious <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> result if this is not possible.|$|E
5000|$|This <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> {{easily be}} solved in linear {{time on a}} {{sequential}} machine, but a parallel algorithm can do better: given [...] processors, the <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> be solved in logarithmic time, , by the following pointer jumping algorithm: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{complexity}} theory and computability theory, an oracle machine is an abstract machine {{used to study}} decision <b>problems.</b> It <b>can</b> be visualized as a Turing machine with a black box, called an oracle, which is able to solve certain decision problems in a single operation. The <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> be of any complexity class. Even undecidable problems, such as the halting <b>problem,</b> <b>can</b> be used.|$|R
40|$|We design new {{deterministic}} and randomized algorithms for computational {{problems in}} free solvable groups. In particular, we {{prove that the}} word problem and the power <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> be solved in quasi-linear time and the conjugacy <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> be solved in quasi-quartic time by Monte Carlo type algorithms...|$|R
5|$|Late in life, Henry became obese, with a waist {{measurement}} of , {{and had to}} be moved about with the help of mechanical inventions. He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly suffered from gout. His obesity and other medical <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> be traced from the jousting accident in 1536, in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's mood swings, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament.|$|E
5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or {{by the promise of}} a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the prominence of money in the film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is a type}} of computation {{in which}} many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> {{be solved}} in {{polynomial}} time. One method of showing this uses the Havel-Hakimi algorithm constructing a special solution {{with the use}} of a recursive algorithm. Alternatively, following the characterization given by the Erdős-Gallai theorem, the <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> be solved by testing the validity of [...] inequalities.|$|R
30|$|Our {{optimization}} <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> be mathematically formulated as follows.|$|R
5|$|Some {{scheduling}} <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> {{be modeled}} {{as a question}} about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E
5|$|The life {{expectancy}} of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop {{as a result of}} lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.|$|E
5|$|Common defects of the forelegs include base-wide and base-narrow, {{where the}} legs are farther apart or closer {{together}} on the ground then they are when they originate in the chest; toeing-in and toeing-out, where the hooves point inwards or outwards; knee deviations to the front (buck knees), rear (calf knees), inside (knock knees) or outside (bowleg); short or long pasterns; and many problems with the feet. Common defects of the hind limbs include the same base-wide and base-narrow stances and problems with the feet as the fore limbs, as well as multiple issues with the angle formed by the hock joint being too angled (sickle-hocked), too straight (straight behind) or having an inward deviation (cow-hocked). Feral horses are seldom found with serious conformation problems in the leg, as foals with these defects are generally easy prey for predators. Foals raised by humans {{have a better chance}} for survival, as there are therapeutic treatments that can improve even major conformation problems. However, some of these conformation <b>problems</b> <b>can</b> be transmitted to offspring, and so these horses are a poor choice for breeding stock.|$|E

The convex hull <b>problem</b> <b>can</b> be solved through linear programming or through convex hull algorithms, but the process of finding the convex hull is an exponential problem.|$|R
