5|$|Wagner {{planned for}} a {{collected}} {{edition of his}} publications as early as 1865; he believed that such an edition would help the world understand his intellectual development and artistic aims. The first such edition was published between 1871 and 1883, but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were an embarrassment to him (e.g. those praising Meyerbeer), or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce Wagner's own account of his progress. Wagner's autobiography Mein Leben was originally published for close friends only {{in a very small}} edition (15–18 copies <b>per</b> <b>volume)</b> in four volumes between 1870 and 1880. The first public edition (with many passages suppressed by Cosima) appeared in 1911; the first attempt at a full edition (in German) appeared in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Between June and August 2004, Ohzora also {{released}} five separate {{volumes of}} manga based on Kanon drawn by five separate artists. Ohzora later collected {{some of the}} previously published manga anthologies into two volumes titled Kanon Anthology Comics Best Selection released in December 2006 and January 2007. Additionally, Ohzora released another 13 volumes of an anthology series titled Kanon under their Twin Heart Comics label. The now-bankrupt publisher Raporto also released 21 manga anthology volumes titled Kanon under their Raporto Comics label between November 2000 and October 2002. The last manga anthology, a collection of four-panel comic strips released in a single volume by Enterbrain titled Magi-Cu 4-koma Kanon, was released in January 2007 under their MC Comics label.

5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price <b>per</b> <b>volume</b> on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E
5|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{is to treat}} shock and preserve kidney function. Initially this is done through the administration of generous amounts of intravenous fluids, usually isotonic saline (0.9% weight <b>per</b> <b>volume</b> sodium chloride solution). In victims of crush syndrome, it is recommended to administer intravenous fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures. This will ensure sufficient circulating volume {{to deal with the}} muscle cell swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys. Amounts of 6 to 12liters over 24hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300ml/h in adults), unless there are other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a history of heart failure.|$|E
50|$|Some {{nanoparticles}} outperform hydrogen (<b>per</b> unit <b>volume)</b> and hydrocarbons (<b>per</b> {{unit mass}} and volume) {{in terms of}} energy storage. Two important metrics are the energy per unit mass and energy <b>per</b> unit <b>volume.</b> Vehicles are usually designed on a <b>per</b> unit <b>volume</b> basis (for drag considerations). On a <b>per</b> unit <b>volume</b> basis, Boron outperforms both hydrogen and hydrocarbons. On a per unit mass basis, Boron outperforms hydrocarbon fuels but {{is not as good}} as hydrogen. Therefore, the DASS engines will take advantage of the excellent properties of Boron along with hydrocarbon, and hydrogen fuels.|$|R

5|$|The {{photosphere}} is tens {{to hundreds}} of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than air on Earth. Because {{the upper part of}} the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as limb darkening. The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at about 6,000 K, interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~1023m−3 (about 0.37% of the particle number <b>per</b> <b>volume</b> of Earth's atmosphere at sea level). The photosphere is not fully ionized—the extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} five sets of manga anthologies {{produced}} by different companies and drawn by {{a multitude of}} different artists. The first volume of the earliest anthology series, released by Ichijinsha under the title Air Comic Anthology, was released on January 25, 2001 under their DNA Media Comics label. Volumes for this series continued to be released until December 25, 2001 with the seventh volume. The second anthology, Air Anthology Comic, was released in a single volume by Softgarage on December 20, 2002. On April 17, 2004, Ohzora released an anthology composed of works based on both Kanon and Air titled Haru Urara: Kanon & Air. Ohzora also released three other anthologies under the title Air, the last of which came out on March 24, 2005. The last manga anthology was released as a single volume on April 2, 2005 by Jive titled Comic Anthology Air: Kimi no Iru Basho.
