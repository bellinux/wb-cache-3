5|$|Before {{the release}} of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in 2005, Msgr. Fleetwood, then serving with the Council of European Episcopal Conferences, gave an {{interview}} with Vatican Radio. In the interview, Fleetwood reaffirmed his <b>positive</b> <b>opinion</b> of the books, and remarked that then-Cardinal Ratzinger's letters may {{have been written by}} a member of the congregation's staff and simply signed by the prefect. He also stated that his and Amorth's opinions are just that, conflicting personal opinions of priests.|$|E

This compares with 33 percent of Americans who identify themselves as Evangelical and 39 percent who take the Bible literally.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in her mouth and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a <b>positive</b> <b>opinion</b> of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E

25|$|After {{his death}} his son-in-law, P. van Limburg Brouwer, a {{physician}} and writer, wrote a dull biography, but with some crucial details. The statesman J.R. Thorbecke in his Historische Schetsen ("Historical Sketches"), published in 1860, criticised the biographer, his subject and his florid jargon. Some authors regard Wiselius as forceful, sharp-witted, animated or even overstrung. Simon Schama hardly ever has a <b>positive</b> <b>opinion</b> of Wiselius and the Patriot brotherhood, describing them as only quasi-intellectual, and Wiselius himself as a minor figure, a Jacobin, a renegade and an over-loud, pessimistic drawing-room liberal who shirked real issues, and ended up leaving politics an embittered man.|$|E
30|$|To {{verify the}} {{validity}} or {{not of the}} null hypothesis regarding utility of ObasCId-Tool, H 0 U, one should compare the amount of <b>positive</b> <b>opinions</b> about this construct {{to the amount of}} negative/neutral opinions. However, before doing this, it must be checked whether the sample data conforms to the normal probability distribution. Hence, the Shapiro-Wilk test [39] was applied to the set of <b>positive</b> and negative/neutral <b>opinions</b> presented in Table  10 and for both sets (negative/neutral and positive opinions); the data were not normally distributed, restricting the use of the t test. Hence, the Mann-Whitney test [39], a non-parametric test that does not require normally distributed data for its execution, was applied. Comparing the mean value of <b>positive</b> <b>opinions</b> about the ease of use of the ObasCId-Tool to the mean value of negative/neutral opinions, the null hypothesis H 0 U could be rejected with degree of significance p[*]=[*] 0.00094. That is, with approximately 99.9 % of confidence, it may be stated that the mean amount of <b>positive</b> <b>opinions</b> differs from the amount of negative/neutral opinions.|$|R
30|$|He et al. (2012) {{introduced}} the influence blocking maximization (IBM) problem to elaborate the competitive influence propagation in social networks under the competitive linear threshold (CLT) model. In IBM problem, one entity aims {{to block the}} influence propagation of its opposing counterpart {{as much as possible}} by strategically selecting a set of seed nodes to initialize its own influence. IBM problem is another type of competitive influence maximization under the constraint of opposing effect of each party’s influence. For instance, when a negative rumor spreads in the social network about an institution, the institution needs to respond quickly by choosing other seed nodes to inject <b>positive</b> <b>opinions</b> about the institution. The <b>positive</b> <b>opinions</b> spreading are expected to fight against the negative rumor. Thus, in IBM problem, the <b>positive</b> <b>opinions</b> also spread over the network with a certain infection probability. While in our graph protection problem, each protected set of nodes are selected pre-emptively and have no probability to transmit the protection attributes to their neighbors.|$|R

25|$|Mao Zedong's {{decision}} {{to take on the}} United States in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world, undertaken {{at a time when the}} Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War. Mao supported intervention not to save North Korea, but because he believed that a military conflict with the United States was inevitable after the United States entered the Korean War, and to appease the Soviet Union to secure military dispensation and achieve Mao's goal of making China a major world military power. Mao was equally ambitious in improving his own prestige inside the communist international community by demonstrating that his Marxist concerns were international. In his later years Mao believed that Stalin only gained a <b>positive</b> <b>opinion</b> of him after China's entrance into the Korean War. Inside Mainland China, the war improved the long-term prestige of Mao, Zhou, and Peng, allowing the Chinese Communist Party to increase its legitimacy while weakening anti-Communist dissent.|$|E

He wanted Hemingway to replace John Dos Passos as screenwriter, since Dos Passos had left the project when his friend José Robles was arrested and later executed.

When the game was localized for an English release, translators had to change alcohol-based names with soda-pop names due to problems with rating boards. This resulted in several jokes being lost in translation. The game's English title was changed from [...] "Brave Fencer Musashiden" [...] to [...] "Brave Fencer Musashi" [...] in order to avoid confusing non-Japanese players about the titular character's name, as [...] "Musashiden" [...] means Musashi's story.|$|E

Parkin again noted the carried-over mechanics of the main game, but said that the confined environments made the limited choices feel [...] "negative rather than liberating". Keza MacDonald of IGN again praised the gameplay mixture and improved mechanics for the boss fight and, like other reviewers, criticized the amount of backtracking through environments. Evans-Thirlwell enjoyed being able to rebuild Adam's augmentation set-up and multiple gameplay options. Francis echoed the praise for the boss gameplay, despite finding it more linear than the main game.|$|E

40|$|Background. It {{seems that}} {{patients}} may ask general practitioners about natural cosmetics applied {{on the skin}} regarding their safety and suitability. Objectives. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze natural cold pressed oils as potential cosmetic products. Material and methods. Cold pressed oils obtained from selected seeds and fruit stones were analyzed, including: chokeberry seed oil, blackcurrant seed oil, elderberry seed oil, raspberry seed oil, apricot seed oil, tomato seed oil, strawberry seed oil, broccoli seed oil, Nigella sativa seed oil, hemp oil, safflower seed oil, Silybum marianum seed oil and coconut oil. 80 adult volunteers assessed the cosmetic properties of the analyzed oils. Each of the volunteers tested 2 to 4 different oils, by applying them on the skin. In addition, patch tests with all analyzed oils were performed on 23 individuals. Results. The majority of tested oils were positively evaluated by the participants: in the opinion of the participants, oil extracted from safflower had the best appearance (100 % <b>positive</b> <b>opinions),</b> coconut oil had the best smell (70 % <b>positive</b> <b>opinions),</b> while black currant seed oil showed the best absorbency (85 % <b>positive</b> <b>opinions).</b> No irritation was observed within the analyzed product group, albeit one allergic reaction to apricot seed oil was observed with patch testing. Conclusions. Based on the achieved results, it could be suggested that natural cold pressed oils can be applied to the skin as cosmetics. Our observations may be helpful for general practitioners when choosing natural cosmetics...|$|R
