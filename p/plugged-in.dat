By default, only the JScript and VBScript modules are provided; third party implementations like ScreamingMonkey (for ECMAScript 4 support) can also be used.

5000|$|Recent {{developments}} in communication technology—internet, mobile, instant messaging, presence tracking, etc.—have {{begun to change}} the nature of vacation. Vacation today means absence from the workplace rather than temporary cession of work. It is now the norm in North America and the United Kingdom to carry on working or remain on call while on vacation rather than abandon work altogether. Office employees telecommute whilst on vacation. Workers may choose to unplug for a portion of a day and thus create the feeling of a [...] "vacation" [...] by simply separating themselves from the demands of constant digital communications. Antithetically, workers may take time out of the office to go on vacation, but remain <b>plugged-in</b> to work-related communications networks. While remaining <b>plugged-in</b> over vacation may generate short-term business benefits, the long-term psychological impacts of these developments are only beginning to be understood.|$|E

50|$|When these {{diagnostic}} {{cards were}} first introduced motherboards were expensive and well worth troubleshooting and repairing. By {{the late twentieth}} century large scale integration, mass production made motherboards inexpensive components.

50|$|FinTech SaaS (Software as a Service) {{refers to}} all atomic or {{composite}} software-based financial {{services that are}} available on-demand. When these services are provided through a BaaP, {{they will need to}} be compliant with the BaaP’s API specifications. The services may either be physically deployed in the BaaP's domain or work externally. This gives the potential for the ability to plug financial services from other banks into the BaaP to create new composite application services. The result is that traditional banking services can now be virtualized and dispatched via composite application services. This does, however, present a challenge in verifying that none of the <b>plugged-in</b> services will violate regulations that have been imposed by banking authorities.|$|E
50|$|Most DRM removal {{programs}} rely on re-compressing {{the media}} that is captured after it is output by iTunes. This causes some loss in quality. However, Hymn can remove DRM with no reduction in sound quality, since it captures the raw AAC stream generated by iTunes as it opens each song, and saves this data using a compression structure identical {{to that of the}} original file, preserving both the quality and the small file size. The resultant files can then be played outside of the iTunes environment, including operating systems not supported by iTunes.

The four cheer as the radio causes a local power failure, while all lights in the neighbourhood go out.

On top of that, an old man a few houses away fell from the stairs, because the lights had gone off.|$|E
