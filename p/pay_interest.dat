Those who now need to earn euros including countries, which need to <b>pay</b> <b>interest</b> on large debts, are likely better served with a slightly weaker euro leading to more export because a lower euro would better see investors chances for (companies in) southern European countries to grow themselves out of the crisis. As a result, investing there would become less risky and push interest rates for southern countries {{more in line with}} the European average.|$|E

Accordingly, the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places.

The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge.

Furthermore, numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to Roman provinces.

The Democrats hoped to once again press their measures to weaken the governor, but Morton was aware of their plans. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans.

5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Decree on Workers' Control, which {{called on the}} workers of each {{enterprise}} to establish an elected committee to monitor their enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to <b>pay</b> <b>interest</b> owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on imports and exports. In June 1918, it decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often these were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation {{did not take place}} until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.|$|E
5|$|Deregulation in the 1980s, {{culminating}} in the Big Bang in 1986, also encouraged the bank to enter the securities business. County Bank, its merchant banking subsidiary formed in 1965, acquired various stockbroking and jobbing firms to create the investment banking arm County NatWest. National Westminster Home Loans was established in 1980 and other initiatives included {{the launch of the}} Piggy Account for children in 1983, the Credit Zone, a flexible overdraft facility on which customers only <b>pay</b> <b>interest</b> (now commonplace, this so-called pink debt was innovative when launched) and the development of the Mondex electronic purse (later sold to MasterCard Worldwide) in 1990. The Action Bank advertising campaign spearheaded a new marketing-led approach to business development. Under the direction of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, later Lord Kingsdown, who became chairman in 1977, the bank also expanded internationally, forming National Westminster Bancorp in the United States of America with a network of 340 branches across two states, National Westminster Bank of Canada and NatWest Australia Bank; and opening branches on the European continent and in the Far East. In 1982, the Frankfurt office of International Westminster Bank merged with Global Bank AG to form Deutsche Westminster Bank. In 1985, Banco NatWest España was formed and National Westminster Bank SA was incorporated in 1988, taking over the bank's six branches in France and Monaco. In 1989, International Westminster Bank was merged into National Westminster Bank by Act of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The state {{suffered}} from financial difficulties {{during its first}} three decades. Jonathan Jennings attempted to begin a period of internal improvements. Among his projects, the Indiana Canal Company was reestablished to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio. The Panic of 1819 caused the state's only two banks to fold. This hurt Indiana's credit, halted the projects, and hampered the start of new projects until the 1830s, after the repair of the state's finances during the terms of William Hendricks and Noah Noble. Beginning in 1831, large scale plans for statewide improvements were set into motion. Overspending on the internal improvements led to a large deficit {{that had to be}} funded by state bonds through the newly created Bank of Indiana and sale of over nine million acres (36,000km²) of public land. By 1841 the debt had become unmanageable. Having borrowed over $13million, the equivalent to the state's first fifteen years of tax revenue, the government could not even <b>pay</b> <b>interest</b> on the debt. The state narrowly avoided bankruptcy by negotiating the liquidation of the public works, transferring them to the state's creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt. The internal improvements began under Jennings paid off as the state began to experience rapid population growth that slowly remedied the state's funding problems. The improvements led to a fourfold increase in land value, and an even larger increase in farm produce.|$|E
40|$|This paper reexamines {{the impact}} that <b>paying</b> <b>interest</b> on {{reserves}} has on price level indeterminacy, volatility, and economic well-being. Unlike the previous literature, this model includes an after-tax deficit financed by assets (bonds and reserves) whose returns are linked. I show {{that the number of}} steady-state equilibria and the corresponding level of indeterminacy are equal to, or greater than, those arising in the no-interest economy. When the level of indeterminacy is the same, the economic volatility is reduced by <b>paying</b> <b>interest.</b> However, greater indeterminacy in the interest economy results in greater volatility.

On March 17, 1942, Colombia and the United States signed an agreement that granted the former $16.5million in military assistance.

Other favorable loans and grants soon followed. For example, the Export-Import Bank provided $20million for highway construction, $10.3million for agricultural programs, and another $3.5million to build a hydroelectric plant.

25|$|In 2006, {{after the}} {{controversial}} 2004 BCCI election scandal involving Sharad Pawar's defeat to {{election to the}} office of president of the board at the hands of Agashe, the bank business started having financial troubles. Many sources claimed Agashe's actions may have been deliberate. Some sources also claimed that Agashe's business supposedly failed as backlash for thwarting Pawar's ambitions for presidency. In September of that same year, the cooperative bank was put under moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India. The board of directors for the bank was superseded soon after. In 2007, following the order of moratorium, the State Department of Cooperation appointed Mukund Ghaisas as administrator at the bank. Many of the bank's depositors held demonstrations at Agashe's Aundh residence and threatened criminal actions against the Agashe family, after which a speedy merger was promised by Agashe. Initial NPAs totaled Rs. 125 crore, 13% against the seven per cent maximum allowable under the RBI norms. After the non-performing assets of the bank grew to more than 43%, account holders and depositors held a day long token fast to protest against the misinformation provided in regards to the alleged duped loans. In 2008, the RBI gave the bank permission to <b>pay</b> <b>interest</b> on deposits made from January to June 2008; Agashe mortgaged personal property worth Rs. 200 crore in lieu of the recovery of the deposits worth Rs. 725 crore.
