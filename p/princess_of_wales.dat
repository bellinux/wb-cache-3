5|$|As a {{young man}} destined {{to serve in the}} navy, Prince George served for many years under the command of his uncle, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who was {{stationed}} in Malta. There, he grew close to {{and fell in love with}} his uncle's daughter, Princess Marie. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but the mothers—the <b>Princess</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> and the Duchess of Edinburgh—both opposed it. The <b>Princess</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales</b> thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. Marie's mother was the only daughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. She resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the <b>Princess</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wales,</b> whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married Ferdinand, the heir to the King of Romania, in 1893.|$|E
