This <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> locomotor activity often develops concomitantly with <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> their positive-reinforcing effects, which are believed {{to contribute to the}} etiology of substance use disorders. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine changes in sensitivity to the locomotor effects of opioids after their repeated administration and to determine the role of μ and κ receptors in mediating these effects. Separate groups of rats were treated with opioid receptor agonists and antagonists every other day for 10 days, and changes in locomotor activity were measured. Repeated {{administration of}} the μ agonists, morphine and buprenorphine, produced a <b>progressive</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> locomotor activity during the treatment period, and this effect was blocked by coadministration of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. The κ agonist spiradoline decreased locomotor activity when administered alone and blocked the <b>progressive</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> locomotor activity produced by morphine. The ability of spiradoline to block morphine-induced <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> locomotor activity was itself blocked by pretreatment with the κ antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. Repeated administration of high doses, but not low or moderate doses, of the mixed μ/κ agonists butorphanol, nalbuphine, and nalorphine produced a <b>progressive</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> locomotor activity during the treatment period. Doses of butorphanol, nalbuphine, and nalorphine that failed to produce a <b>progressive</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> locomotor activity when administered alone did so when subjects were pretreated with nor-binaltorphimine. These findings suggest that μ and κ receptors have functionally opposing effects on opioid-mediated locomotor activity and sensitization-related processes...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. (Economics) The Gauteng provincial {{government}} is currently exploring possible sources for raising revenue {{to finance the}} <b>increasing</b> demand <b>in</b> social services. In the current fiscal stance, the bulk of {{provincial government}} revenue is constituted of funds transferred from the national government {{in the form of}} equitable share to provinces. Thus, the main {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the overall impact of the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the motor vehicle license fees and tourism levy, as important sources of the Gauteng provincial government own sources of revenue, on economic activities in the Gauteng Province. The study uses the provincial Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> motor vehicle license fees and tourism levy, and to determine how such <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> will affect provincial socio-economic variables such as the gross domestic product (GDP), employment and household consumption expenditure. The findings of the study are that a 10 % <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> motor vehicle license fees or tourism levy negatively affects the Gauteng GDP, employment and household consumption. Nonetheless, the effect on provincial government revenue is positive. Given the negative effect of such an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> on key socio-economic variables, the study suggests that an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>taxation</b> on motor vehicle license fees or tourism levy should not be considered as options for raising revenue for the Gauteng Province...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the performance of}} the spine sign in detecting lower chest abnormalities in the lateral view. Methods: This retrospective study included 200 patients who had undergone lateral view and CT scans of the chest within 1 week. Two radiologists independently read the lateral views, and a third radiologist, blinded to the aim of the study, read the scans. The spine sign was considered as positive if the <b>progressive</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> lucency of the vertebral bodies was altered. Interreader agreement was calculated through k-statistics. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values, and accuracy were calculated compared with CT. Results: Agreements between readers ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 68. Positive spine sign could appear in two ways: absent or inversed <b>progressive</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> lucency of the vertebral bodies. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values, and accuracy were, respectively, 60 % and 70 %; 64 % and 84 %; 91 % and 97 %; 19 % and 29 %; and 61 % and 72 % for each reader (p-value ranging from 0. 026 to 0. 196). Abnormalities most frequently associated with positive spine sign were plate-like atelectasis, ground-glass opacity, pleural effusion and consolidation. Conclusion: The spine sign can present as an absent or inversed <b>progressive</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> lucency of the vertebral bodies. It has a moderate sensitivity but a good positive-predictive value, so it can be useful especially when it appears as inversed <b>progressive</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> lucency of the vertebral bodies to detect various abnormalities usually identifiable on chest radiographs. Advances in knowledge: On lateral chest radiographs, the spine sign is useful to detect lower chest abnormalities and is related to various underlying abnormalities and is, per se, non-specific.

40|$|Respiratory and {{metabolic}} {{patterns in}} response to variations in exercise workload (WL) and pedal frequency (RPM) were examined in 10 healthy males. Each subject performed WLs of low (L), moderate (M) and high (H) intensity, equivalent to 25 %, 50 % and 75 % V 02 m a x at 7 pedal frequencies (40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 RPM). ANOVA (3 X 7 design) indicated that WL and RPM had independent and significant effects on all respiratory and metabolic measures; i. e., the greater the WL and RPM, the higher the HR, V 02, VC 02, Ve, Fb, Vt, Vt/Ti, Vt/Te and Ti/TtQt and the lower the Ti and Te. However, analysis of the interaction effect revealed different response patterns for Fb, Vt, Ti, Vt/Ti, Vt/Te and Ve among the WLs. During L-WL, <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> RPM produced <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> Ve which were due to <b>progressive</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> both Fb and Vt. However, during M-WL and H-WL, <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> RPM produced <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> Ve which were accomplished by a constant Vt and a <b>progressive</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> Fb. My findings suggest that during low WLs, the signal for Vt is dependent on rate of contraction, while during M-WL and H-WL, the signal for Vt appears to depend on force of contraction and is independent of increasing RPM. When comparing the L-WL and M-WL, alterations in Ve, Fb, Vt/Ti and Vt/Te <b>in</b> relation to <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> pedal frequency were additive. However, when these two lower WLs were compared to the H-WL, the interaction between pedal frequency and Ve, Fb, Vt/Ti and Vt/Te was multiplicative. In addition, the interaction between WL and RPM on Vt and Ti was additive when comparing the M-WL and H-WL and multiplicative when these two lower WLs were compared to the H-WL. Correlation analysis indicated that for all WLs, Te was more highly related to Fb than was Ti, while Vt/Te was more highly related to Ve than was Vt/Ti. Our findings suggest that during M-WL and H-WL, <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> Ve are accomplished by <b>progressive</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> Fb and decreases in Te, while during L-WL, <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> Ve are achieved by <b>progressive</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> both Fb and Vt...|$|R
