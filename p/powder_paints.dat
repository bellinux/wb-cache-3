40|$|Both color keyed {{and color}} {{specific}} liquid primers {{have been used}} successfully in automotive paint application, reducing the use of costly topcoat materials. Generally, color keyed primer is close in color to the topcoat and {{is applied to the}} exterior surfaces of the vehicle body. Color specific primer identically matches the topcoat material color, and {{can be used as a}} replacement for topcoat on interior surfaces. Application of color <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> primer would provide for additional cost savings, more environment-friendly manufacturing, and higher customer satisfaction. Recent technology breakthroughs have led to the technical feasibility of applying multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> with full reclaim and therefore 100 % material utilization. The field feasibility of applying multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> in an automotive manufacturing facility is being assessed and validated by GM. More specifically, GM has developed the GM Canister <b>Powder</b> <b>Paint</b> Delivery System to meet the challenges of color <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> application. In anticipation of multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> application, GM is completing its Manufacturing Systems Qualification (MSQ) Process for the Canister System. Due to the newness of the enabling technology, GM is investigating all aspects of materials, process designs, facilities, operations, and people, for the implementation of color keyed/color specific <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> primer into new GM paint shops. Similar to GM's MSQ Process, qualification requirements in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry attest to the importance of validation in the implementation of new manufacturing technology. Beyond its technical purposes, validation can serve as a bridge between development and operation. During development, formal and relational contracts with(cont.) suppliers should be established to provide incentives for the supplier to perform throughout validation and commissioning. Involving the plant in validation along with suppliers is one means of education and thus empowerment, a key phase of organizational change as described by Professor Shoji Shiba. Leadership can use several change management techniques to help prepare the plant organization for operation of the new manufacturing technology. by Bevin Barberich. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) {{is mainly}} used in polyester-based <b>powder</b> <b>paints,</b> {{but also in}} laminates, {{insulating}} varnishes, coatings and adhesives. Several cases of contact allergy to TGIC have been reported during the last 10 years. Contact allergy to TGIC has developed in a factory producing the chemical, in a factory producing <b>powder</b> <b>paints</b> containing TGIC, and in industries using powder coating. In this paper, we report a man who developed a work-related dermatitis when working on the painting of metal frames. He was exposed to polyester powder pigments containing TGIC. When patch tested, he was negative to TGIC (prepared in 1988) 3 x and positive to polyester powder pigment. Only when a new test preparation of fresh TGIC powder was tested, was a positive reaction obtained. Chemical analyses showed {{that there was no}} TGIC in the test preparation from 1988, and that in the TGIC powder from 1988, there was only 30 % of the expected amount of TGIC. The investigations, clinical and chemical, strongly indicate degradation of TGIC in the test preparation and powder. Both substances and the test preparations made from them may change over time. Therefore, if a false-negative reaction due to a test preparation is strongly suspected, we recommend a re-test of the patient with a new test preparation of fresh material. As a general rule, patch testing should be performed with fresh substances and test preparations made from them, unless their stability and durability are known. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|An Electrostatic Fluidised Bed (EFB) {{coating process}} {{is used as}} an {{eco-friendly}} alternative to an electrostatic spraying process to coat components of particularly complex shapes with <b>powder</b> <b>paints.</b> Although fluidised beds are well known systems and are widespread throughout several industrial domains, the implementation of appropriate process control procedures is still extremely difficult. Fluidised bed processes are governed by the hydrodynamic behaviour of the suspended powders. The solution of the hydrodynamic laws in closed form is often not realisable because they are complicated or require large amounts of computational time. In contrast, empirical or simplified analytical models as well as learning machine techniques are often used for the control and automation of fluidised bed processes. Therefore, the current study proposes modelling an EFB coating process using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). SVMs were determined to appropriately match the experimental coating thicknesses and demonstrate good prediction capability. The SVMs were compared with both empirical and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to demonstrate how an SVM could be a particularly interesting alternative for modelling "in service" and high-duty equipment.

40|$|According to the {{experimental}} results and the basic concept that the capacitive contribution of the coating/metal system to EIS can reflect the change occurring at interface sensitively, the quantitative relationship between the adhesion and the analytical result of EIS is established. The approach is using the transmission line model (CR circuit) to obtain the discrete capacitance values, analyzing the physical meaning of the slope at the region in which the discrete capacitances change linearly with the discrete characteristic frequency. The data handling method is also given in detail. The relationship is validated by experiments. The results show that under certain conditions, the slopes are mainly determined by the speed of instantaneous delamination at organic coating/metal interface and are not influenced by the corrosion product built up at the artificial defect, so they have good reproducibility despite the EIS of duplicate samples showing very different configuration. The analytical results from EIS are often {{higher than that of}} mechanical measurements when adhesion is strong. Explanation of the discrepancy shows that the results from EIS are more accurate and reasonable. In regard to epoxy <b>powder</b> <b>paints</b> and A(3) steel, the results also indicate that the pretreatment of substrate using silane with and without hot-dip galvanized or phosphate treatment can influence markedly the adhesion between substrate and coating...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} analyzes the deformation behaviour under static and dynamic loading conditions of electrostatically sprayed epoxy-polyester powder coatings by local and uniaxial tests, trying {{to account for}} the separate contribution of the raw polymeric material alone and of the adhesion to the underlying metal substrate. First, thermo-rheological properties of the basic material (i. e., the thermosetting <b>powder</b> <b>paints)</b> were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and rheometry. Secondly, free-standing films were manufactured by electrostatic spraying of the thermosetting powders onto stainless steel substrates pre-coated with an intermediate layer of silicon-based heat curable release coating. The resulting free standing-films were macroscopically characterized by combined dynamic-mechanical analyses (DMA) and tensile tests. Finally, local mechanical characterization of the coating performance was carried out by micro-scale depth sensing scratch and indentation on coatings 'free-standing' and 'rigidly adhering' onto metal substrate. The experimental findings show the different mechanical behaviour of the polymeric coatings, whose thermal, rheological, dynamical properties were fully characterized, when deposited on untreated or pre-treated substrates as well as on intermediate layers of release coating, thus contributing to better understand how much of the coating properties are ascribable to the material chosen or to the interfacial adhesion between coating and substrate. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{electrostatic}} spray deposition (ESD) process of 'self organizing' TiO 2 -epoxy <b>powder</b> <b>paints</b> on metal substrates. The {{first part of}} the paper focuses on analyzing the influence of both electrical and aerodynamic operational parameters on ESD process. Design of experiments (DOE) was used to plan experimental trials. ANOVA tables were calculated and used as support instruments to interpret the experimental findings and to understand physical phenomena involved in the deposition process as well as the role of TiO 2. As a result, several process maps were produced which report consistent trends in coating thickness versus operational parameters. Best deposition conditions could therefore be deduced. Initial attempts to produce 'self-organizing' TiO 2 -based gradient coatings are also discussed. The second part of the paper focuses on assessing the influence of the target locations in the deposition booth on coating thickness of the TiO 2 -epoxy films. Design of experiments (DOE) was once again used to plan experimental trials and ANOVA tables were also calculated. Experimental findings are interpreted and the role of TiO 2 is also investigated. This leads to the best target locations being deduced. Finally, neural network solutions able to predict coating thickness according to settings of operational parameters were developed and validated by comparing them with experimental data and a first approximation regression model.

40|$|The {{study of}} new paint {{systems that are}} less harmful to the {{environment}} and to man than traditional solvent-borne systems, but have identical anti-corrosive characteristics, is an issue of great interest at the present time. The authors of this work have taken advantage of the opportunity to use different natural atmospheres in the Ibero-American region to study the behaviour of new water-borne, high-solids and powder paint systems, with and without pre-treatment. The study has involved coatings exposure in 7 natural atmospheres and different laboratory accelerated tests. It was completed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis, and adhesion, water up-take and electrochemical measurements. It has been concluded that water-borne acrylic paint systems incorporating primers pigmented with zinc phosphate and others show deficient behaviour in marine atmospheres, but better behaviour in industrial atmospheres. In marine atmospheres, water-borne epoxy paint systems, including zinc-rich primers, together with epoxy and epoxy-polyurethane high-solids paint systems, present the most efficient anti-corrosive behaviour. The coatings obtained with epoxy and epoxy-polyester <b>powder</b> <b>paints</b> only show good behaviour, when applied on an adequate pre-treatment, in atmospheres of low to medium corrosivity category (C 2 -C 3). Finally, the best correlation was observed between the results of natural exposure in marine atmospheres, salt spray and water up-take measurements. It was not possible to verify good correlation between natural exposure and prohesion, adhesion and electrochemical tests. The latter are highly sensitive to the chemical nature of coatings, and seem to be significantly more useful when comparing coatings with more identical nature. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2001.
