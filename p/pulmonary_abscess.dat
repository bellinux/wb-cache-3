Anaerobic bacteria can also be isolated in about 35% of individuals who suffer from nosocomial-acquired aspiration pneumonia [...] and pneumonia associated with tracheostomy with and without mechanical ventilation, where they are often isolated along with Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.

40|$|Abstract Background Ischemic stroke by septic {{embolism}} occurs {{primarily in}} the context of infective endocarditis or in patients with a right-to-left shunt and formation of a secondary cerebral abscess is a rare event. Erosion of pulmonary veins by a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>abscess</b> can lead to transcardiac septic embolism but to our knowledge no case of septic embolic ischemic stroke from a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>abscess</b> with secondary transformation into a brain abscess has been reported to date. Case presentation We report the case of a patient with a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>abscess</b> causing a septic embolic cerebral infarction which then transformed into a cerebral abscess. After antibiotic therapy and drainage of the abscess the patient could be rehabilitated and presented an impressive improvement of symptoms. Conclusion Septic embolism should be considered as cause of ischemic stroke in patients with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>abscess</b> and can be followed by formation of a secondary cerebral abscess. Early antibiotic treatment and repeated cranial CT-scans for detection of a secondary abscess should be performed. </p...|$|E
