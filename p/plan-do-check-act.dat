[...] Deming worked from the Shewhart cycle and over time eventually developed the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, which has the idea of deductive and inductive learning built into the learning and improvement cycle. [...] Deming finally published the PDSA cycle in 1993, in The New Economics on p.132. Deming has added to the myth that he taught the Japanese the PDSA cycle with this quote on p.247, [...] "The PDSA Cycle originated in my teaching in Japan in 1950. It appeared in the booklet Elementary Principles of the Statistical Control of Quality (JUSE, 1950: out of print).|$|E

50|$|The 2002 {{version of}} BS 7799-2 {{introduced}} the <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> (PDCA) cycle (Deming cycle), aligning it with quality standards such as ISO 9000. 27001:2005 applies this {{to all the}} processes in ISMS.|$|E
5000|$|Deming Cycle of Plan-Do-Check-ActThe <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> Cycle, {{created by}} W. Edwards Deming, is a {{management}} method to improve business method for control and continuous improvement of processes and products. It {{consists of four}} stages: ...|$|E
50|$|The 2015 {{version is}} also less {{prescriptive}} than its predecessors {{and focuses on}} performance. This was achieved by combining the process approach with risk-based thinking, and employing the <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> cycle at all levels in the organization.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{specific}} example of the on-going Japanese devotion to the <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> PDCA decision-making discipline pioneered by W.

5000|$|ISO 50001 {{focuses on}} a continual {{improvement}} process to achieve the objectives related to the environmental performance of an organization (enterprise, service provider, administration, etc.). The process follows a plan - do - check - act approach (<b>Plan-Do-Check-Act,</b> PDCA): ...|$|E
5000|$|The IASME {{standard}} {{follows the}} same implementation pattern {{used by the}} international standards community including PDCA (<b>Plan-Do-Check-Act)</b> principles [...] and the Information Security Management System (ISMS) which provides a management framework. Both are refined and expressed in business terms recognizable by most organisations.|$|E
50|$|The IT Infrastructure Library {{originated}} as {{a collection}} of books, each covering a specific practice within IT service management. ITIL was built around a process model-based view of controlling and managing operations often credited to W. Edwards Deming and his <b>plan-do-check-act</b> (PDCA) cycle.|$|E
5000|$|A3 leads towards {{problem solving}} over the structure, placed on an ISO - ISO A3 single sheet paper. This {{is where the}} process got its name. A3 {{is also known as}} SPS, which stands for [...] "Systematic Problem Solving". The process is based on the {{principles}} of Edward Deming's PDCA (<b>Plan-Do-Check-Act).</b>|$|E
50|$|An EMS {{follows a}} <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act,</b> or PDCA, Cycle. The diagram shows {{the process of}} first {{developing}} an environmental policy, planning the EMS, and then implementing it. The process also includes checking the system and acting on it. The model is continuous because an EMS {{is a process of}} continual improvement in which an organization is constantly reviewing and revising the system.|$|E
5000|$|Kaizen activities: Whether {{cross-functional}} workshops, team quality circles, individual suggestions, {{and many}} other exercises, kaizen activities are about scheduled moments to improve the work within the normal working day. The point of kaizen is that improvement is {{a normal part of}} the job, not something to be done “when there is time left after having done everything else.” Kaizen is scheduled, planned, and controlled by a teacher who makes sure Dr. Deming’s <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> is followed rigorously.|$|E
5000|$|PDCA (<b>plan-do-check-act</b> or plan-do-check-adjust) is an {{iterative}} four-step {{management method}} used {{in business for}} the control and continual improvement of processes and products. It {{is also known as}} the Deming circle/cycle/wheel, Shewhart cycle, control circle/cycle, or plan-do-study-act (PDSA). Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA. The added [...] "O" [...] stands for observation or as some versions say [...] "Grasp the current condition." [...] This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency with Lean manufacturing/Toyota Production System literature.|$|E
5000|$|Scientific {{referencing}} {{of learning}} perspectives: [...] Each audit should describe {{the findings in}} detail within the context and also highlight progress and development needs constructively. An auditor is not the parent of the program, {{but at least he}} or she is in a role of a mentor, if the auditor is regarded as part of a PDCA learning circle (PDCA = <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act).</b> There should be next to the description of the detected vulnerabilities also a description of the innovative opportunities and the development of the potentials.|$|E
50|$|His {{emphasis}} on a quantitative, mathematical basis for decision-making remains with us today. It is a foundation of the modern notion of Positivism, modern quantitative statistical analysis, and business decision-making. His description of the continuing cyclical relationship {{between theory and practice}} is seen in modern business systems of Total Quality Management (TQM) and Continuous Quality Improvement where advocates describe a continuous cycle of theory and practice through the four-part cycle of <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> (PDCA, the Shewhart cycle). Despite his advocacy of quantitative analysis, Comte saw a limit in its ability to help explain social phenomena.|$|E
50|$|Continual service {{improvement}}, {{defined in}} the ITIL continual service improvement volume, aims to align and realign IT services to changing business needs by identifying and implementing improvements to the IT services that support the business processes. It incorporates {{many of the same}} concepts articulated in the Deming Cycle of <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act.</b> The perspective of CSI on improvement is the business perspective of service quality, even though CSI aims to improve process effectiveness, efficiency and cost effectiveness of the IT processes through the whole lifecycle. To manage improvement, CSI should clearly define what should be controlled and measured.|$|E
50|$|On December 16, 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{approved}} Rule No. 33-9089, {{which went}} into effect on February 28, 2010. This rule requires companies to increase their reporting of risk management practices, including details about {{the manner in which}} risk oversight is administered. The ruling has generated increased interest in implementing the TSM approach to ensure compliance with the updated SEC guidelines. In January 2010, ISO 28000 (ISO/PAS 28000 - Specification for security management systems for the supply chain) was updated to include an explicit reference to the <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> model of quality management popularized by Deming.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second part}} to BS 7799 was first {{published}} by BSI in 1999, known as BS 7799 Part 2, titled [...] "Information Security Management Systems - Specification with guidance for use." [...] BS 7799-2 focused on how to implement an information security management system (ISMS), referring to the information security management structure and controls identified in BS 7799-2, which later became ISO/IEC 27001. The 2002 version of BS 7799-2 introduced the <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> (PDCA) (Deming quality assurance model), aligning it with quality standards such as ISO 9000. BS 7799 Part 2 was adopted by ISO as ISO/IEC 27001 in November 2005.|$|E
50|$|The 2013 {{standard}} puts {{more emphasis}} on measuring and evaluating how well an organization's ISMS is performing, {{and there is a}} new section on outsourcing, which reflects the fact that many organizations rely on third parties to provide some aspects of IT.It does not emphasize the <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> cycle that 27001:2005 did. Other continuous improvement processes like Six Sigma's DMAIC method can be implemented. More attention is paid to the organizational context of information security, and risk assessment has changed. Overall, 27001:2013 is designed to fit better alongside other management standards such as ISO 9000 and ISO/IEC 20000, and it has more in common with them.|$|E
50|$|A common {{misconception}} is {{that the}} purpose of preventive action is to avert the occurrence of a similar potential problem. This process is all part of corrective action, because it is a process of determining such similarities that should take place {{in the event of a}} discrepancy. Preventive action is any proactive methodology used to determine potential discrepancies before they occur and to ensure that they do not happen (thereby including, for example, preventive maintenance, management review or other common forms of risk avoidance). Corrective and preventive actions both include stages for investigation, action, review, and further action if required. It can be seen that both fit into the PDCA (<b>plan-do-check-act)</b> philosophy as determined by the Deming-Shewhart cycle.|$|E
50|$|One {{marker of}} a {{knowledge}} society is continuous innovation that demands lifelong learning, knowledge development, and knowledge sharing. The institution of education {{will need to}} become responsive to changing demands. Education professionals will need to learn along with everyone else, and as leaders of changing designs in learning, they {{will serve as a}} bridge between technology and teaching. The ability to individually reflect on personal learning requirements and seek knowledge in whatever method is appropriate characterizes lifelong learning. One model that supports this type of learning is the W. Edwards Deming <b>Plan-do-check-act</b> cycle that promotes continuous improvement. Educational professionals will need to prepare learners to be accountable for their own lifelong learning.|$|E

TSM takes the Improvement Initiatives and breaks them into bite sized chunks so that they can be delivered incrementally over a short period of time. The chunks or increments are subject to the PDCA cycle where the increment is first planned, then done, then checked, and then finally but most importantly the lessons learned the results achieved assessed so that the next increment the next/ subsequent PDCA cycles can be planned or re-planned to move most effectively to achieving the overall outcome for the Initiative.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} article, we {{examined}} the effects of the <b>plan-do-check-act</b> (PDCA) cycle and on-the-job-training (OJT) on workplace learning. We defined workplace learning based on the concept of an organizational learning cycle. Using survey data from a Japanese fire and marine insurance company, we found that PDCA, OJT (empowerment), and reflective communication had positive effects on workplace learning. These results suggest that quality management, empowerment and reflective practice may help to significantly improve workplace learning. We also discuss theoretical and managerial implications of this study...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the approaches to solving normally associated with (1) Total Quality Management and {{the followers of}} Deming and (2) Theory of Constraints championed by Goldratt. These two methods will be compared and contrasted. The quality movement’s original problem-solving model was the <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> model of Shewhart and popularized by Deming. Whether called the problem-solving process (Xerox), the Quality Improvement Cycle (AT&T), or the quality-Improvement story (Florida Power & Light), these more recent models are basically variations of the scientific method and the <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> (PDCA) cycle. They offer a systematic approach, a standardization to the problem-solving process. This paper emphasizes the seven step method, a structured approach to problem solving and process improvement. It leads a team through a logical sequence of steps that force a thorough analysis of the problem, its potential causes, and possible solutions. George Box has defined TQM as “the democratization of the scientific method. ” His definition implies the organizational-wide use of tools for the identification of problems, the collection and analysis of relevant data, and decisions based on the data. Although what defines the basic set of quality tools varies somewhat from place to place, a very popular collection {{is referred to as}} Ishikawa’s Seven Tools (or the seven basic QC tools) ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{corporations}} {{have recognized the}} importance of being perceived as socially responsible to the environment, employees or local community. They have worked hard to be labeled as sustainable organizations. Corporate behavior, however, implies a gap between theory and practice. Therefore, we consider it necessary to study how to transform corporations into sustainable organizations based on organizational change models. The paper brings an original contribution to the study of organizational sustainability by introducing a framework for sustainable organizational change using organizational culture components and Deming's <b>Plan-Do-Check-Act</b> (PDCA) cycle of continuous quality improvement...|$|E

Creativity and innovation practice bundles contribute towards creation of value, value stream and flow as well ((principle no. 1, and 3). Remaining practice bundles create {{flow of material}} and information (principle no. 3). The last bundle, i.e., low cost contributes to create pull in the system (principle no. 4). The fifth principle ‘Perfection’ is applicable at all stages of Lean implementation. It follows the <b>Plan–Do–Check–Act</b> (PDCA) cycle for improvement and ultimately perfection. Hence, we can conclude that the model is tested and validated qualitatively.|$|E
