40|$|Pig {{and poultry}} houses are {{responsible}} for <b>a</b> large emission <b>of</b> ammonia. Ammonia emission can be reduced by scrubbers systems such as acid scrubbers and biotrickling filters. Currently, air treatment systems are dimensioned on basis of the maximum ventilation capacity <b>of</b> <b>an</b> animal house, which means the scrubber is underloaded {{for most of the}} time. Therefore it is suggested to decrease the volume <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>scrubber</b> and construct <b>a</b> bypass system that bypasses part of the untreated air to the atmosphere if at times the total air flow is higher than the design air flow of the scrubber. Experimental data and a year-round model for the ammonia emission and air flow <b>of</b> <b>an</b> animal house are presented.

These findings suggest that, although Title IV has encouraged diffusion, many scrubbers have been installed because of state regulatory pressure.

30|$|An {{extension}} of the MARPOL Convention allows technical equipment that cleans emissions from sulphur to be used [25]. This purification method is called a “scrubber” and drastically reduces sulphur emissions (cf. EMSA [15]). The advantage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>scrubber</b> compared to other methods for achieving the sulphur directive is that the ship can continue {{to be driven by}} cheaper high-sulphur fuel and still meet the stricter sulphur restrictions (cf. Lin [30], Cooper [10], Agrawala et al. [1], Fridell et al. [20]). Scrubbing is not new, as it has long been used on land, but it is only recently that the technology has been applied in shipping. Other advantages are that the shipping company does not need to rebuild or replace the ship’s engine and there is sufficient availability of high-sulphur fuel [14]. There are two different types of scrubbers, wet scrubbers and dry scrubbers, on the market for marine use, and <b>a</b> <b>scrubber</b> can be installed on existing vessels or new vessels.|$|R
40|$|Light-duty {{passenger}} cars and large ocean-going vessels represent two particle emission sources {{that have the}} ability to affect human health, climate change and air quality in local communities and worldwide. Driving speed and engine technology are two factors that can affect vehicle emissions. In California, drivers can drive upwards of 70 % at speeds above the posted limits.

The first part of this thesis examines both high-speed driving and direct-injection effects on particle concentration and composition while the second part examines the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>scrubber</b> technology to remove particulate matter (PM) from large ocean-going vessel emissions. The results show that high-speed driving can affect both total particle count and composition significantly as well as direct-injection technology.

If they are sent to oil storage they will re-vaporize and go through the VRU, creating an endless cycle.|$|R

In accordance with various work on fully dynamic algorithms, and {{in contrast to}} prior work on bin packing, {{it is assumed that}} the packing may be arbitrarily rearranged to accommodate arriving and departing items. In this context our main result is a fully dynamic approximation algorithm for bin packing MMP that is 5 / 4 -competitive and requires Θ(log n) time per operation (i. e., for an Insert or <b>a</b> Delete <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item).
