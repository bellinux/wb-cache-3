The hydraulic retention time (HRT) for the porous pot and AGB systems was 12 hours and 6 hours, respectively. The influent {{was made up of}} synthetic wastewater. In the first group of toxic loading tests, the prepared cupric chloride solutions were separately injected into both the porous pot and AGB systems at six different concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 mg Cu 2 +/L), and phenol solutions were used at four different concentrations (10, 20, 30, and 45 mg phenol/L) in the second group of toxic loading tests. In addition, a control study was included for reference. The <b>porous</b> pot <b>reactor</b> and AGB were monitored for pH, ORP, COD, solids, and ammonia concentrations following a simulated toxic event. The COD removal efficiency of porous pot system decreased dramatically in response to the addition of Cu 2 + and phenol. The greatest decrease in COD removal efficiency was from 92 % to 52 % at a Cu 2 + concentration of 30 mg/L, and was from 98 % to 76 % at a phenol concentration of 45 mg/L. The longest time of COD removal efficiency continuous decreasing was 23 hours at a Cu 2 + concentration of 45 mg/L, and 7 hours at a phenol concentration of 10 mg/L.

The test series included besides the oxidation tests on B_ 4 C, also examinations on B_ 4 C oxidation related compounds (e. g. B_ 2 O_ 3). The evaluation and interpretation of the experiments was supported by basic modelling {{with respect to the}} understanding of occurring mechanisms and first determination of reaction kinetics parameters. The oxidation tests on B_ 4 C pellets were performed in the temperature range 600 to 1300 C under flowing Ar/O_ 2 and wet Ar atmosphere. Two types of pellets were investigated, the first ones had high density (TD = 98 %) and the second ones were <b>porous</b> <b>reactor</b> typical absorber pellets (Framatome, TD = 72 %). The evaporation tests on B_ 2 O_ 3 were conducted in dry flowing Ar and wet Ar atmosphere, in the same temperature range as the B_ 4 C oxidation tests. Wet Ar was produced by passing the Ar stream through a heated water bath with an adjustable temperature between 20 and 60 C. The performed tests showed that evaporation of B_ 2 O_ 3 and oxidation of B_ 4 C is strongly depended on environment conditions. Several mechanisms with different reaction kinetics and dependencies e. g. on temperature are interacting. In simplification the oxidation of B_ 4 C is governed by the formation of B_ 2 O_ 3 and by the transportation of the boron oxide in the gas phase. This results for long test times under wet Ar atmosphere and other stationary conditions in a constant consumption of B_ 4 C. Porous samples show a more complex and accelerated reaction behaviour compared to dense pellets. At least for modelling of the short time behaviour porosity effects have to be included. Using the developed modelling tools it could be shown that TG tests and BOX-rig tests, measuring different parameters (mass change and H_ 2 production, respectively) and working under different environmental conditions, can be compared and lead to the same general oxidation behaviour.

40|$|Membrane {{reactors}} {{are promising}} candidates for enhancement of productivity in complex reaction networks [1]. Earlier experimental studies on catalytic oxidation of ethane in a tubular packed-bed membrane reactor (PBMR) revealed, {{that it is}} possible to maximize selectivity and yield with respect to different products [2]. Due to the significant difference in feeding the reactants between the PBMR and the classical fixed-bed reactor (FBR), it appears to be necessary, to study the extent of radial temperature and concentration profiles on the specific reactor performances. Such effects must be analyzed using non-isothermal 2 D reactor models. Consequently, the focus of our work was to formulate and solve such models. Ethane oxidation was chosen as a suitable exothermic, kinetically controlled model reaction to perform this study. Based on experiments in a laboratory fixed-bed reactor a reaction network considering 5 sub-reactions was proposed. For a quantitative description of this network kinetic parameters were estimated, based on a Mars van Krevelen mechanism for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms for the deep oxidation reactions [3]. Both FBR and PBMR reactors were described by two-dimensional, non-isothermal, pseudo-homogenous models which were implemented in the simulation tool FEMLAB TM. To calculate the velocity and pressure fields, at first, the complete set of incompressible Navier Stokes equations were solved. Subsequently, the component and energy balances were calculated separately using the obtained velocity and pressure profiles. This simplification is justified, because frequently significant amounts of inert are present in the reactors. The PBMR was considered as to be operated in a dead end configuration. Furthermore, a constant flux density through the <b>porous</b> <b>reactor</b> wall was assumed in the PBMR simulation. Effective diffusion coefficients and heat conductivities were used based on standard correlations [4, 5]. A selected example of simulation results is given in Fig. 1. Typical tendencies, which can be seen are: (1) The temperature profile is much more uniform in the PBMR compared to the FBR (Fig. 1 a and b). This smoothing is one of the most attractive advantages of the PBMR concept. (2) In contrast to the FBR, where the gas velocity is quite constant over the whole catalyst bed, the PBMR might exhibit a significant axial velocity profile (Fig. 1 c and d). Thus, the contact time of the component fed at reactor inlet is longer in the PBMR than in the FBR. This leads to an enhanced conversion. (3) Local oxygen concentration is lower and radial profiles are more pronounced in the PBMR than in the FBR (Fig. 1 e and f). Under certain conditions this difference can enhance selectivity with respect to an intermediate product. Based on more systematic simulations, the necessity of the application of a 2 D model, compared to a simple 1 D model and the potential of the PBMR will be analyzed in detail. [1] K. K Sirkar, P. V.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{chemical}} reaction engineering intensive research {{is devoted to the}} development of new processes, allowing to improve selectivity and yields with respect to valuable intermediate. Typical examples, where alternative concepts are desirable, are partial oxidation reactions or hydrogenations. For such reactions improved performance can be achieved by e. g. optimised stage-wise dosing of one or several reactants (Hamel et al., 2003). The implementation of adjusted dosing profiles can be realised by feeding reactants at certain discrete positions of a fixed-bed reactor or by dosing them in a distributed manner using <b>porous</b> <b>reactor</b> walls, e. g. ceramic membranes (Fig. 1). As a further optimisation parameter not considered up to now is the temperature in the particular stages. This is the focus of the current work. In first part of this contribution results of an experimental investigation are presented. Studied were various stage-wise dosing strategies and/or residence time profiles in combination with the realisation of forced temperature profiles. It is shown that this concept allows significant selectivity and yield improvement of intermediate products in parallel-series reactions (Hamel et al., 2003). As an example reaction, the highly exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene on a VO X /γ-Al 2 O 3 -catalyst was performed. In a comparative study following concepts were investigated: a) a one-stage, b) a cascade of three packed bed membrane reactors (PBMR) and c) the conventional fixed bed reactor. The experimental set up was described elsewhere (Klose et al., 2003). The operating conditions were chosen to avoid intraparticle transport limitations and gas phase reactions. The ethane concentration was varied therefore between 0. 5 - 1. 0 vol. %, the oxygen concentration between 0. 35 and 18. 3 vol. %. The measurements were conducted in a temperature range between 550 and 650 °C. Based on an earlier theoretical analysis (Thomas, 2003), in the PBMR cascade various oxygen dosing profiles (decreasing, uniform, increasing) and in addition with forced temperature profiles were realised experimentally. In a second part, the formulation, solution and validation of a non-isothermal 2 D membrane reactor model will be presented. Profound knowledge is available regarding modelling of conventional tubular catalytic fixed-bed reactors. Radial dependencies of porosity and flow profiles are described typically with simplified 1 D models, assuming a fully developed flow (Winterberg et al., 2000). Only a few studies were oriented on 2 D calculations or more detailed CFD modelling (Dixon et al., 2003). Obviously the situation is more complex if reactants are also dosed along the reactor axis {{as in the case of}} the PBMR. To estimate the related local phenomena a pseudo homogeneous 2 D model should be useful. Depending on the membrane structure, diffusion dominated (molecular or Knudsen) and/or convection (viscous-flow) dominated transport have to be considered. A critical issue is therefore the proper formulation of boundary conditions at the reactor wall in the mass and energy balances. In our work mass transfer through the wall was described e. g. by the extended Fick (EFM) or the dusty gas model (DGM). Furthermore special care was taken in order to choose appropriate correlations describing radial mass and heat transport in the packed bed. The main focus of the parametric study performed was the estimation of internal temperature, oxygen concentration and flow profiles and the resulting effects on the reactor performance. As in the experimental study the ODH of ethane was chosen as a model reaction. LHHW reaction kinetics obtained from an early experimental study (Klose et al., 2004) were assumed to describe the reaction network. Selected simulation results obtained for a constant and a radial dependent porosity profile are shown in Fig. 2. The calculations were performed using the commercial software packed Femlab 3. 0 TM. These results show the relevance of two-dimensional modelling. References Dixon, A. G., M. Nijemeisland, H. Stitt, Int. J. of Chem. Reactor Eng. 2 (2004) A 24. Hamel, C., S. Thomas, K. Schädlich, A.

The PAHs of interest were naphthalene, methyl-naphthalene, ace-naphthene, acenaphthylene, and carbazole. The gasoline hydrocarbons included benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and p-xylene (BTEX). Two <b>porous</b> pot <b>reactors</b> were operated {{for a period of}} 10 months under the same influent contaminant concentrations. The contaminated groundwater was introduced into the reac-tors at a flow rate of 4 and 9 l/day, resulting in a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 32 and 15 h, respectively. In both reactors, high removal efficiencies were achieved for the PAHs (> 99 %), BTEX and MtBE (> 99. 7 %). All the PAHs of interest and the four BTEX compounds were detected at concentrations less than 1 lg/l throughout the study duration. Effluent MtBE from both reactors was observed at higher levels; nevertheless, its concentration was lower than the 5 lg/l Drinking Water Advisory for MtBE implemented in California...|$|R

Silica-like, nano-sized particles were prepared in the pores of the PP reactor powder with a controlled degree of adhesion between PP and silica. Magic-angle spinning (MAS) 29 SiNMR spectra showed that the chemical building blocks of the silica-like clusters are of Q 3 and Q 4 -type. For (vinyl triethoxy silane (VTES) -grafted PP) /silica nanocomposites, VTES was grafted via solid-state modification (SSM) in porous PP particles. Subsequently, silica particles were prepared by sol-gel technology in the VTES-grafted PP. MAS 29 Si NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy showed that the grafted VTES {{becomes part of the}} in-situ formed silica particles. The study on the mechanical properties of (VTES-graftedPP) /silica nanocomposites showed that the silica particles improved the impact toughness of PP by a factor of 2, when there is no chemical interactionbetween the particles and the matrix, while for (VTES-grafted PP) /silica nanocomposites the impact toughness decreased. This indicates that chemical bonding betweenthe filler particles and the PP-matrix results in brittle failure and supports the hypothesis that debonding is necessary for improving the impact toughness of PP with inorganic fillers...|$|R

The system comprises of a bimetallic palladium and copper (II) chloride catalyst contained in a trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and an aq. phase. Methane, oxygen and a co-reductant carbon monoxide constitute the gas phase. Typical operating conditions were a temp. of 85 Deg and a pressure of 83 bar and the yields of the Me trifluoroacetate product obsd. in this present work were less than those obtained in other batch autoclave works, which employed only 4 mL of liq. phase, compared with 50 mL in this study. Furthermore, an encouraging initial product formation rate of ca. 40 mol/m 3 h, quickly decreased after the first hour, and came to an apparent end after only 2 h. This observation had not been reported previously and the work performed in a semi-continuous <b>porous</b> tube <b>reactor</b> (300 mL of re-circulating liq. phase) also showed the same reaction characteristics as in the batch reactor.

40|$|The {{inner surface}} of a {{metallic}} tube (i. d. 0. 5 mm) was coated with a palladium (Pd) -based thin metallic layer by flow electroless plating. Simultaneous plating of Pd and silver (Ag) from their electroless-plating solution produced a mixed distributed bimetallic layer. Preferential acid leaching of Ag from the Pd–Ag layer produced a porous Pd surface. Hydrogenation of p -nitrophenol was examined {{in the presence of}} formic acid simply by passing the reaction solution through the catalytic tubular reactors. p- Aminophenol was the sole product of hydrogenation. No side reaction occurred. Reaction conversion with respect to p -nitrophenol was dependent on the catalyst layer type, the temperature, pH, amount of formic acid, and the residence time. A porous and oxidized Pd (PdO) surface gave the best reaction conversion among the catalytic reactors examined. p -Nitrophenol was converted quantitatively to p -aminophenol within 15 s of residence time in the <b>porous</b> PdO <b>reactor</b> at 40 °C. Evolution of carbon dioxide (CO 2) was observed during the reaction, although hydrogen (H 2) was not found in the gas phase. Dehydrogenation of formic acid did not occur to any practical degree in the absence of p -nitrophenol. Consequently, the nitro group was reduced via hydrogen transfer from formic acid to p -nitrophenol and not by hydrogen generated by dehydrogenation of formic acid...|$|R

Research in the field is currently focusing on more efficient ways to produce biodiesel, with the most promising avenue of research looking into the use of heterogeneous catalysis. This article presents a framework for kinetic reaction and diffusive transport modelling of the heterogeneously catalysed transesterification of triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), unveiled by a model system of tributyrin transesterification in the presence of MgO catalysts. In particular, the paper makes recommendations on multicomponent diffusion calculations such as the diffusion coefficients and molar fluxes from infinite dilution diffusion coefficients using the Wilke and Chang correlation, intrinsic reaction kinetic studies using the Eley-Rideal kinetic mechanism with methanol adsorption as the rate determining steps and multiscale reaction-diffusion process simulation between catalytic <b>porous</b> and bulk <b>reactor</b> scales...|$|R

The optimum current intensity was obtained at 9 A at which more than 90 % of copper was recovered in 4 hours.

40|$|AbstractA compact {{multifunctional}} Pd/alumina {{hollow fibre}} membrane reactor (HFMR) {{has been developed}} and used for the catalytic dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane to toluene. The developed HFMR consists of a thin and defect-free Pd membrane of 5 μm coated directly onto the outer surface of an alumina hollow fibre substrate. The substrate, was prepared by a phase inversion/sintering method, possess a unique asymmetric structure which can be characterised by a very porous inner surface from which finger-like voids extend across approximately 80 % of the fibre cross-section with the remaining 20 % consisting of a denser sponge-like outer layer. A 50 wt% Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is directly deposited into the asymmetric support, with a fraction of catalyst particles distributed uniformly in the finger-like macro-voids while the others on the lumen surface forming a “filter-cake”-like layer. A significant increase in gas permeation resistance occurs due to this “filter-cake”-like catalyst layer when the catalyst loading (weight per unit fibre length) is above 2. 3 mgcm- 1. Methylcyclohexane conversion increases with the increasing temperatures, because of the endothermic nature of the reaction; while decreases with the higher sweep gas flow rates due to the more serious catalyst deactivation in the HFMR. For a HFMR with 1. 0 mg cm- 1 of catalyst loading, methylcyclohexane conversion of approximately 26 % can be achieved at 610 °C with the sweep gas flowrate of 20 ml min- 1, while for a <b>porous</b> membrane <b>reactor</b> and a fixed-bed reactor the methylcyclohexane conversion of 50 % and 25 % can be achieved at identical operating temperature...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide {{reforming}} {{of methane}} {{is one of}} the most promising processes to convert methane and carbon dioxide, both well known as greenhouse contributors, to syngas. During the last decades, extensive efforts have been conducted to investigate the performance of catalytic reactors to produce high yield and selectivity of the syngas. Despite all the considerable efforts, this process is still not commercially viable due to its high endothermic reversibility nature, which requires high operating temperature (~ 1000 K). Besides, the occurrence of reverse water gas shift side reaction further reduces the process efficiency. Nevertheless, removal of the product(s) from the reaction zone with a membrane will shift the reaction equilibrium, and consequently increases the reactant conversion and product yield at lower operating temperatures. A thermodynamic tool based on the method of “Lagrange’s undetermined multipliers ” is used to evaluate the equilibrium performance of CORM in porous and dense membrane reactor in the temperature range of 700 – 1200 K. Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis has indicated that application of membrane reactor is able to enhance the performance of high endothermic reversible reaction (CORM) in terms of conversion, products yield and syngas ratio. However, when the temperatures exceed higher than 1000 K, the advantages of membrane reactor turn to be less significant. In addition, dense membrane reactor has shown better performance than <b>porous</b> membrane <b>reactor</b> when both membranes operate at the same permeability. Nonetheless, if the hydrogen selectivity is not the key factor for designing membrane <b>reactor,</b> utilization of <b>porous</b> membrane is more applicable for CORM process due to its higher permeability nature...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a micro-structured {{catalytic}} {{hollow fiber}} membrane reactor (CHFMR) has been prepared, characterized and evaluated for performing {{steam methane reforming}} (SMR) reaction, using Rh/CeO 2 as the catalyst and a palladium membrane for separating hydrogen from the reaction. Preliminary studies on a catalytic hollow fiber (CHF), a <b>porous</b> membrane <b>reactor</b> configuration without the palladium membrane, revealed that stable methane conversions reaching equilibrium values can be achieved, using approximately 36 mg of 2 wt. %Rh/CeO 2 catalyst incorporated inside the micro-channels of alumina hollow fibre substrates (around 7 cm long in the reaction zone). This proves the advantages of efficiently utilizing catalysts in such a way, such as significantly reduced external mass transfer resistance when compared with conventional packed bed reactors. It is interesting to observe catalyst deactivation in CHF when the quantity of catalyst incorporated is less than 36 mg, although the Rh/CeO 2 catalyst supposes to be quite resistant against carbon formation. The "shift" phenomenon expected in CHFMR was not observed by using 100 mg of 2 wt. %Rh/CeO 2 catalyst, mainly due to the less desired catalyst packing at {{the presence of the}} dense Pd separating layer. Problems of this type were solved by using 100 mg of 4 wt. % Rh/CeO 2 as the catalyst in CHFMR, resulting in methane conversion surpassing the equilibrium conversions and no detectable deactivation of the catalyst. As a result, the improved methodology of incorporating catalyst into the micro-channels of CHFMR is the key to a more efficient membrane reactor design of this type, for both the SMR in this study and the other catalytic reforming reactions...|$|R
