25|$|In the 20th century, the Newtonian {{concepts}} of absolute {{time and space}} were challenged by relativity. Einstein's <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence</b> put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to what exactly is meant {{by the force of}} gravity and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an operational definition defined by the act of weighing.|$|E

2500|$|Clocks in a {{gravitational}} field do not all {{run at the}} same rate. Experiments such as the Pound–Rebka experiment have firmly established curvature of the time component of spacetime. The Pound–Rebka experiment says nothing about curvature of the space component of spacetime. But note that the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation do {{not depend on the}} details of general relativity at all. Any theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence.</b> This includes Newtonian gravitation. A standard demonstration in general relativity is to show how, in the [...] "Newtonian limit" [...] (i.e. the particles are moving slowly, the {{gravitational field}} is weak, and the field is static), curvature of time alone is sufficient to derive Newton's law of gravity.|$|E
2500|$|The first crucial {{concept is}} {{coordinate}} independence: The {{laws of physics}} cannot depend on what coordinate system one uses. This is a major extension {{of the principle of}} relativity from the version used in special relativity, which states that the laws of physics must be the same for every observer moving in non-accelerated (inertial) reference frames. In general relativity, to use Einstein's own (translated) words, [...] "the laws of physics must be of such a nature that they apply to systems of reference in any kind of motion." [...] This leads to an immediate issue: In accelerated frames, one feels forces that seemingly would enable one to assess one's state of acceleration in an absolute sense. Einstein resolved this problem through the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although general {{relativity}} {{is not required}} to analyze the twin paradox, application of the Equivalence Principle of {{general relativity}} does provide some additional insight into the subject. We had previously noted that Stella is not stationary in an inertial frame. Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. [...] When she is coasting her rest frame is inertial, and Terence's clock will appear to run slow. But when she fires her rockets for the turnaround, her rest frame is an accelerated frame and she experiences a force which is pushing {{her as if she were}} in a gravitational field. Terence will appear to be high up in that field and because of gravitational time dilation, his clock will appear to run fast, so much so that the net result will be that Terence has aged more than Stella when they are back together. As will be discussed in the forthcoming section Curvature of time, the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation are not exclusive to general relativity. Any theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence,</b> including Newton's theory.|$|E

Bohr showed that, in order for Einstein's experiment to function, the box would have to be suspended on a spring {{in the middle of a}} gravitational field. In order to obtain a measurement of the weight of the box, a pointer would have to be attached to the box which corresponded with the index on a scale.

2500|$|It {{therefore}} {{follows that}} the laws of configuration of rigid bodies with respect to K' {{do not agree with}} the laws of configuration of rigid bodies that are in accordance with Euclidean geometry. If, further, we place two similar clocks (rotating with K'), one upon the periphery, and the other at the centre of the circle, then, judged from K, the clock on the periphery will go slower than the clock at the centre. The same thing must take place, judged from K' if we define time with respect to K' in a not wholly unnatural way, that is, in such a way {{that the laws}} with respect to K' depend explicitly upon the time. Space and time, therefore, cannot be defined with respect to K' as they were in the special theory of relativity with respect to inertial systems. But, according to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence,</b> K' is also to be considered as a system at rest, with respect to which there is a gravitational field (field of centrifugal force, and force of Coriolis). We therefore arrive at the result: the gravitational field influences and even determines the metrical laws of the space-time continuum.
