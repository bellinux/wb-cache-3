In the diary, which he kept in the evenings, Maclay opined about his colleagues and commented on various issues of pertinence during the period. It is speculated by some Senate historians that the original incitation for the diary's creation was his somewhat uneasy relationship with the first Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate John Adams; the two differed sharply on many political issues.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Purpose: radical prostatectomy (RP) is {{affected}} by urinary incontinence (UI) that, even if temporary, can severely impact patients quality of life. We investigated if a post surgery tutored and <b>personal</b> trained pelvic <b>floor</b> re-educational program improves continence recovery more than pelvic floor exercises performed by patients on their own. Patients and Methods: 332 incontinent (> 1 pad/daily) patients (pts) submitted to RP between 2006 and 2008 were prospectively randomized in group A (166 pts) and group B (166 pts). The first group performed an intensive tutored pelvic training program and the second formed the control group. The follow-up was at one year and the self report of recovery of continence was measured every 3, 6 and 12 months. Results: the median time of continence recovery in group A was 44 ± 2 days, while in group B it was 76 ± 4 days. Patients enrolled in the pelvic floo...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a tool (SIMFIX) addressed to control engineers and plant <b>floor</b> <b>personal.</b> It integrates a general purpose simulation package and a SCADA software {{in a single}} environment. With SIMFIX {{it is possible to}} build process models, simulate them and monitor the simulation using all the features available in a widely used SCADA software. INTRODUCTION Distributed Control Systems (DCS) [1] have been evolving rapidly since the mid- 1980 s thanks to its ability to improve accuracy, operability, and the ease of control strategies modifications in industrial plants. The DCS were initially built around proprietary hardware and software. With the increasing computational power of the personal computers, it became viable to use industry-standard computer hardware to develop cost effective DCSs. This encouraged the software industry to develop high quality inexpensive scan, control, alarm, and data acquisition (SCADA) packages. One can find nowadays many SCADA packages from different [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{languages}} {{defined by}} the standard IEC 6 - 1131 for Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), have both benefits and drawbacks compared to object-oriented programming languages. For example, the current programming approach is good for maintaining the system, since {{it is easy to}} program and comprehend for a plant <b>floor</b> <b>personal</b> with limited programming experience. The main drawbacks are reusability, code dependability and flexibility. This paper proposes an aspect-oriented programming (AOP) approach as an alternative solution, which can keep the benefits and eliminate the drawbacks. AOP is an emerging programming methodology in computer science, which helps the programmer by separating different crosscutting concerns in the program. These crosscutting concerns and tangled behavior are especially important issues in PLC programming, which makes AOP a suitable approach. The paper describes how to adapt the AOP methodology into PLC program development and how it can benefit the control design process...|$|R

60|$|The gale {{continues}} with unabated violence to-day, and the sprays {{rise to a}} still greater height, having been carried over the masonry of the building, or about ninety feet above {{the level of the}} sea. At four o’clock this morning it was breaking into the cook’s berth, when he rang the alarm-bell, and all hands turned out to attend to their <b>personal</b> safety. The <b>floor</b> of the smith’s, or mortar gallery, was now completely burst up by the force of the sea, when the whole of the deals and the remaining articles upon the floor were swept away, such as the cast-iron mortar-tubs, the iron hearth of the forge, the smith’s bellows, and even his anvil were thrown down upon the rock. Before the tide rose to its full height to-day some of the artificers passed along the bridge into the lighthouse, to observe the effects of the sea upon it, and they reported that they had felt a slight tremulous motion in the building when great seas struck it in a certain direction, about high-water mark. On this occasion the sprays were again observed to wet the balcony, and even to come over the parapet wall into the interior of the light-room.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} following research questions: How do physical features of high density college dormitories affect residents 2 ̆ 7 perception of crowding, {{and what kinds of}} design strategies are available for alleviating the perceived crowding? The data source was responses to a self-administered questionnaire from residents of living units which were randomly sampled from three dormitories of comparable physical density at Oregon State University. Seven hypotheses were used {{to examine the relationship between}} perceived crowding and physical features associated with different settings in selected dormitories. The first hypothesis sought to clarify how selected physical variables, compared with selected social and personal variables, contributed to perceived crowding both in dormitory dwellings (floor crowding) and rooms (room crowding). For the remaining hypotheses, comparisons were made to determine if differences existed between groups living on floors with varied corridor length, floor height (distance above ground level), and bathroom location, and between groups living in rooms with varied desk location, room location, and window orientation. Using multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance as the major tools for hypothesis testing, the study found that: (1) both room and dwelling crowding were not significantly affected by the selected physical, social, and <b>personal</b> variables; (2) <b>floor</b> crowding was significantly lower among residents of short corridors and among those who shared suite rather than community bathrooms. Variations in floor level did not affect perceived crowding; (3) room crowding was not significantly affected by variations in desk location, room location, and window orientation, but rather by the interactive effects of window orientation and floor height...|$|R
