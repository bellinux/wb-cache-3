25|$|Because it {{involved}} crossing public highways and acquiring land {{from a number}} of different owners a Light Railway Order made under the Light Railways Act 1896 was necessary and application for this was made in November 1925. A Public Inquiry was held by the Light Railway Commissioners in the Assembly Rooms at New Romney on 15 and 16 January 1926. The Minister of Transport indicated his intention to approve the application on 19 February 1926 and The Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Light Railway Order 1926 was made on 26 May. This incorporated the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Light Railway Company as a statutory <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> <b>undertaking,</b> gave it powers to construct and work the proposed railway and also included compulsory purchase powers over the land required (which ultimately had to be used to acquire six plots of land on the proposed route).|$|E

6000|$|... (b) So far we {{have been}} {{concerned}} with German property within Allied jurisdiction. The next provision is aimed at the elimination of German interests in the territory of her neighbors and former allies, and of certain other countries. Under Article 260 of the Financial Clauses it is provided that the Reparation Commission may, within one year of the coming into force of the Treaty, demand that the German Government expropriate its nationals and deliver to the Reparation Commission [...] "any rights and interests of German nationals in any <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> <b>undertaking</b> or in any concession[26] operating in Russia, China, Turkey, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, or in the possessions or dependencies of these States, or in any territory formerly belonging to Germany or her allies, to be ceded by Germany or her allies to any Power or to be administered by a Mandatory under the present Treaty." [...] This is a comprehensive description, overlapping in part the provisions dealt with under (a) above, but including, it should be noted, the new States and territories {{carved out of the}} former Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Turkish Empires. Thus Germany's influence is eliminated and her capital confiscated in all those neighboring countries to which she might naturally look for her future livelihood, and for an outlet for her energy, enterprise, and technical skill.|$|E
40|$|In a {{time when}} formal (impersonal) markets for credit were embryonic, the role of social {{relationships}} in raising funds for new ventures was crucial. “Investment tended to be cumulative social process” where trust and reputation played a role. Strong kinship and business ties linking partnership members were therefore critical in facilitating the flow of capital into new ventures. The way the diversified and broad-ranging businesses (railways, mines, <b>public</b> <b>utilities)</b> <b>undertaken</b> by the Paris-based partnership Parent Schaken et C. ie (P&S) were funded illustrates an important point about this topic. By making use of the basic tools of the Social Network Analysis, the paper shows how the P&S network of interpersonal relationships evolved and just how it mattered in facing the changing European financial scenarios when long-term investment developed and impersonal money markets took shape...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee. Both the {{calculation}} and allocation of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee for certain areas are analysed. The <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation, {{which is in}} accordance with the ordinance on equipping the building plots in areas of the municipal spatial plan of the Municipality of Kamnik (example 1), is presented within the thesis. The actual costs of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping which are based on the physical indicators of the ordinance on the equipping programme and the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee following the instruction for the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation (Official Gazette No. 4 / 99) are both calculated and strictly comply with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution (example 2). Activities in the areas of municipal elaborated spatial plans show different consumption of potable water, therefore, based on an assumption on potable water consumption in <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, we have calculated the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee according to estimated or actual potable water consumption (example 3). We have determined that the existing calculation and distribution of the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee method and distribution of the urban contribution (example 1) complies the least with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution. The results in the other two examples are similar, since both take into account the principle of contribution and counter - contribution, as demonstrated by the structural fractions of the distributed <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee among taxpayers. ...|$|R
