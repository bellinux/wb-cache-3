The uncertainty of the <b>procurement</b> <b>plan</b> is expressed by closed intervals on the cumulative demands. In order to choose a robust production plan, under the interval uncertainty representation, the min-max criterion is applied. We propose algorithms for determining the set of possible costs of a given production plan - due to the uncertainty on the cumulative demands. We then construct algorithms for computing a robust production plan with respect to the min-max criterion: the algorithm based on iterative adding constraints and the polynomial algorithms under certain realistic assumptions...|$|R
