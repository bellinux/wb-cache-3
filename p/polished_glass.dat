500|$|The Salisbury in St Martin's Lane {{was built}} {{as part of}} a six-storey block around 1899 on the site of an earlier pub that had been known under several names, {{including}} the Coach & Horses and Ben Caunt's Head; it is both Grade II listed, and on CAMRA's National Inventory, due {{to the quality of the}} etched and <b>polished</b> <b>glass</b> and the carved woodwork, summed up as [...] "good fin de siècle ensemble". The Freemasons Arms on Long Acre is linked with the founding of the Football Association in 1896; however, the meetings took place at The Freemason's Tavern on Great Queen Street, which was replaced in 1909 by the Connaught Rooms.|$|E

60|$|At length {{he sat up}} {{and knew}} the reason of that change that had come over the earth.

60|$|But {{she had to}} {{talk about}} it for a week before she {{actually}} made her raid, and then, with an instinctive need for an audience, she took with her a certain Miss Garradice, one of those mute, emotional nervous spinsters who drift detachedly, with quick sudden movements, glittering eyeglasses, and a pent-up imminent look, about our social system. There is something about this type of womanhood--it is hard to say--almost as though they were the bottled souls of departed buccaneers grown somehow virginal.

60|$|Here I left my guides, and, {{slipping}} to {{the nearest}} window, sought for an avenue of escape. The windows opened upon a great balcony which overlooked one of the broad avenues of Zodanga. The ground was about thirty feet below, and at a like distance from the building was a wall fully twenty feet high, constructed of <b>polished</b> <b>glass</b> about a foot in thickness. To a red Martian escape by this path would have appeared impossible, but to me, with my earthly strength and agility, it seemed already accomplished.

40|$|Abstract. To {{reduce the}} {{environmental}} impact of abrasive polishing, we have investigated using a compact robot and fixed-abrasive polishing. We look at a five-joint closed-link compact robot with a fine diamond stone on its main axis to <b>polish</b> a <b>glass</b> plate. In this method, we measured the chatter vibration in <b>glass</b> <b>polishing</b> motion due to the low stiffness of the robot arm. Therefore, we estimated a dynamic characteristic of the robot arm by a hammering test and measured the friction coefficient between the glass plate and the abrasive stone. From these results, we attempted a novel polishing method to prevent its self-vibration using micro-oscillating pressing force with a voice coil motor. As a result, the proposed method of <b>polishing</b> a <b>glass</b> plate with a compact robot and a fine diamond stone was found to be effective...|$|R
6000|$|I rather avoided {{him after}} dinner, for I confess he {{struck me as}} cruelly conceited, and the revelation was a pain. [...] "The usual twaddle"--my acute little study! That one's admiration {{should have had a}} reserve or two could gall him to that point! I had thought him placid, and he was placid enough; such a surface was the hard <b>polished</b> <b>glass</b> that encased the bauble of his vanity. I was really ruffled, and the only comfort was that if nobody saw {{anything}} George Corvick was quite as much out of it as I. This comfort however was not sufficient, after the ladies had dispersed, to carry me in the proper manner--I mean in a spotted jacket and humming an air--into the smoking-room. I took my way in some dejection to bed; but in the passage I encountered Mr. Vereker, who had been up once more to change, coming out of his room. HE was humming an air and had on a spotted jacket, {{and as soon as he}} saw me his gaiety gave a start.|$|E
6000|$|The {{morning was}} {{as still as}} death. Not a whisper of wind was stirring; the sea was like <b>polished</b> <b>glass,</b> the sky empty, the beach desolate. In my half-excited, half-feverish state, this stillness of things oppressed me. I tried to whistle, and the tune died away. I swore again,--the second time that morning. Then I went {{to the corner of}} the {{enclosure}} and stared inland at the green bush that had swallowed up Moreau and Montgomery. When would they return, and how? Then far away up the beach a little grey Beast Man appeared, ran down to the water's edge and began splashing about. I strolled back to the doorway, then to the corner again, and so began pacing to and fro like a sentinel upon duty. Once I was arrested by the distant voice of Montgomery bawling, [...] "Coo-ee--Moreau!" [...] My arm became less painful, but very hot. I got feverish and thirsty. My shadow grew shorter. I watched the distant figure until it went away again. Would Moreau and Montgomery never return? Three sea-birds began fighting for some stranded treasure.|$|E
6000|$|... “In {{the cases}} of {{polished}} metal and <b>polished</b> <b>glass,</b> the contrast shows evidently that the substance {{has much to do}} with the phenomenon; therefore let the substance alone be diversified as much as possible, by exposing polished surfaces of various kinds. This done, a scale of intensity becomes obvious. Those polished substances are found to be most strongly dewed which conduct heat worst; while those which conduct heat well, resist dew most effectually.” The complication increases; here is the Method of Concomitant Variations called to our assistance; and no other method was practicable on this occasion; for the quality of conducting heat could not be excluded, since all substances conduct heat in some degree. The conclusion obtained is, that cæteris paribus the deposition of dew is in some proportion to the power which the body possesses of resisting the passage of heat; and that this, therefore (or something connected with this), must be at least one of the causes which assist in producing the deposition of dew on the surface.|$|E

60|$|The {{appearance}} of Mr Bailey's governor {{as he drove}} along fully justified that enthusiastic youth's description of him to the wondering Poll. He had a world of jet-black shining hair upon his head, upon his cheeks, upon his chin, upon his upper lip. His clothes, symmetrically made, were of the newest fashion and the costliest kind. Flowers of gold and blue, and green and blushing red, were on his waistcoat; precious chains and jewels sparkled on his breast; his fingers, clogged with brilliant rings, were as unwieldly as summer flies but newly rescued from a honey-pot. The daylight mantled in his gleaming hat and boots as in a <b>polished</b> <b>glass.</b> And yet, though changed his name, and changed his outward surface, it was Tigg. Though turned and twisted upside down, and inside out, as great men have been sometimes known to be; though no longer Montague Tigg, but Tigg Montague; still it was Tigg; the same Satanic, gallant, military Tigg. The brass was burnished, lacquered, newly stamped; {{yet it was the}} true Tigg metal notwithstanding.|$|E
60|$|Often, on {{returning}} home {{from one of those}} mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and ageing face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the <b>polished</b> <b>glass.</b> The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul. He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead, or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.|$|E
6000|$|Nanda Brookenham, for a {{fortnight}} after Mr. Longdon's return, had found much to think of; but {{the bustle of}} business became, visibly for us, particularly great with her on a certain Friday afternoon in June. She was in unusual possession of that chamber of comfort in which so much of her life had lately been passed, the redecorated and rededicated room upstairs {{in which she had}} enjoyed a due measure both of solitude and of society. Passing the objects about her in review she gave especial attention to her rather marked wealth of books; changed repeatedly, for five minutes, the position of various volumes, transferred to tables those that were on shelves and rearranged shelves with an eye to the effect of backs. She was flagrantly engaged throughout indeed in the study of effect, which moreover, had the law of an extreme freshness not inveterately prevailed there, might have been observed to be traceable in the very detail of her own appearance. [...] "Company" [...] in short was in the air and expectation in the picture. The flowers on the little tables bloomed with a consciousness sharply taken up by the glitter of nick-nacks and reproduced in turn in the light exuberance of cushions on sofas and the measured drop of blinds in windows. The numerous photographed friends in particular were highly prepared, with small intense faces, each, that happened in every case to be turned to the door. The pair of eyes most dilated perhaps was that of old Van, present under a <b>polished</b> <b>glass</b> and in a frame of gilt-edged morocco that spoke out, across the room, of Piccadilly and Christmas, and visibly widening his gaze {{at the opening of the}} door, at the announcement of a name by a footman and at the entrance of a gentleman remarkably like him save as the resemblance was on the gentleman's part flattered. Vanderbank had not been in the room ten seconds before he showed ever so markedly that he had arrived to be kind. Kindness therefore becomes for us, by a quick turn of the glass that reflects the whole scene, the high pitch of the concert--a kindness that almost immediately filled the place, to the exclusion of everything else, with a familiar friendly voice, a brightness of good looks and good intentions, a constant though perhaps sometimes misapplied laugh, a superabundance almost of interest, inattention and movement.|$|E
