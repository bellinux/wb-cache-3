He toured the island, examining its volcanic mountains and fringing coral reefs. The Surveyor-general Captain Lloyd took him on the only elephant on the island to see an elevated coral plain. By then FitzRoy was writing the official Narrative of the Beagle voyages, and after reading Darwin’s diary he proposed incorporating it into the account, a suggestion Darwin discussed with his family.|$|E
5|$|Biblical and extrabiblical {{evidence}} suggests that of the Arabian tribes, the Qedarites were most prominent in their contacts with the world outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Like other nomadic groups, they lived primarily in unfortified encampments. Pastoralists and traders in livestock, such as male lambs, rams and goats, they also {{played a key role}} in the <b>prosperity</b> <b>of</b> Gaza's incense trade, controlling traffic in the desert regions between Egypt and Palestine. As a result of their trading activities, there were clans from among the Qedarites that became wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and {{a particular kind of}} kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'.

5|$|In 1086, {{when the}} Domesday Book was compiled, England had a {{population}} of two million. About 10% lived in urban areas. By 1801, the population was 8.3million, and by 1901 30.5million. Due in particular to the economic <b>prosperity</b> <b>of</b> South East England, it has received many economic migrants from {{the other parts of}} the United Kingdom.

5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; {{a strong sense of}} optimism and faith in progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of <b>prosperity</b> <b>of</b> the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1785, Espejo took an {{interest}} in the welfare of his community and the <b>prosperity</b> <b>of</b> Quito. His works between that year and 1792 clearly show the influence of Enlightenment philosophers, whose ideas Espejo adapted to local conditions. As many thinkers realized the power of economics as a social force, Espejo, influenced by Feijoo and Adam Smith among others, showed his desire for commercial and agricultural reforms, especially conservation and proper use of land. To advance these ideas, he founded the Escuela de la Concordia (School of Concord).|$|E

5|$|The Dutch {{soon found}} trade in deerskins and venison in the East Asian market to be a lucrative {{endeavor}} and recruited Plains Aborigines to procure the hides. The deer trade attracted the first Han traders to aboriginal villages, but {{as early as}} 1642 the demand for deer greatly diminished the deer stocks. This drop significantly reduced the <b>prosperity</b> <b>of</b> aboriginal peoples, forcing many aborigines to take up farming to counter {{the economic impact of}} losing their most vital food source.|$|E
5|$|The best {{interests}} of society require that causes of action should not be deferred an unreasonable time. This remark is peculiarly applicable to land titles. Nothing so much retards the growth and <b>prosperity</b> <b>of</b> a country as insecurity of titles to real estate.

5|$|The <b>prosperity</b> <b>of</b> {{the slate}} {{industry}} {{led to the}} growth of a number of other associated industries. Shipbuilding increased at a number of coastal locations, particularly at Porthmadog, where 201 ships were built between 1836 and 1880. Engineering companies were set up to supply the quarries, notably De Winton at Caernarfon. In 1870, De Winton built and equipped an entire workshop for the Dinorwig Quarry, with machinery powered by overhead shafting that in its turn was driven by the largest water-wheel in the United Kingdom, over 50feet in diameter.|$|E

5|$|The <b>prosperity</b> <b>of</b> the stockyards {{was due to}} {{both the}} {{concentration}} of railroads {{and the evolution of}} refrigerated railroad cars. Its decline was due to further advances in post-World War II transportation and distribution. Direct sales of livestock from breeders to packers, facilitated by advancement in interstate trucking, made it cheaper to slaughter animals where they were raised and excluded the intermediary stockyards. At first, the major meatpacking companies resisted change, but Swift and Armour both surrendered and vacated their plants in the Yards in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The rise of {{successful}} freedmen—through either political influence in imperial service, or wealth—is {{a characteristic of}} early Imperial society. The <b>prosperity</b> <b>of</b> a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by , and by their ownership {{of some of the}} most lavish houses at Pompeii, such as the House of the Vettii. The excesses of nouveau riche freedmen were satirized in the character of Trimalchio in the Satyricon by Petronius, who wrote in the time of Nero. Such individuals, while exceptional, are indicative of the upward social mobility possible in the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{religions}} in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents {{to renounce}} all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see Idolatry). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant {{they were unable}} to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and <b>prosperity</b> <b>of</b> the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century.|$|E
