40|$|The {{tropical}} marine sponge Acanthella cavernosa (Dendy) converts potassium [14 C] cyanide to axisonitrile- 3 (1); this precursor is {{also used}} for the synthesis of axisothiocyanate- 3 (2) suggesting that isocyanides are precursors to isothiocyanates in A. cavernosa. Likewise, <b>potassium</b> [14 C] <b>thiocyanate</b> {{is used for the}} synthesis of axisothiocyanate- 3; unexpectedly this precursor also labelled axisonitrile- 3. These results demonstrate either an interconversion between cyanide and thiocyanate prior to secondary metabolite formation or that the secondary metabolites can themselves be interconverted. Specimens of the dorid nudibranch Phyllidiellu pustulosa, preadapted to a diet of A. cavernosa, fed on 14 C-labelled sponges and were subsequently found to contain the radioactive terpenes (1) and (2). Specimens of P. pustulosa, which had not expressed a dietary preference for A. cavernosa in the field, did not generally feed in aquarium tests with 14 C-labelled sponges and, therefore, provided non-radioactive extracts. Since control experiments demonstrated the inability of P. pustulosa to synthesise the metabolites de novo, we therefore conclude that P. pustulosa acquires secondary metabolites by dietary transfer from A. cavernosa...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the effects of the swine, in different periods of life on the toxicokinetics of cyanide using thiocyante as biomaker. Twenty and two swines, was divided into four groups (60 days of age, 95 days of age, sows with 80 days of gestation and lactating swine), were dosed orally with 3, 0 mg/kg/body weigth of <b>potassium</b> cyanide (KCN). <b>Thiocyanate</b> concentrations in blood were measured within 24 h. The time of peak concentration (Tmax) and constant of elimination (Kel) were higher in lactating sows (15 hs and 0, 045, respectively); on the other hand, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of thiocyanate was observed in pregnant females (161, 8). The elimination half life (t 1 / 2) and volume of distribution (Vd) were higher in adult sows (41, 57 and 1, 23, respectively). Whereas the clearance and the area under the curve (AUC) of thiocyanate was higher in young animals (354183, 28) the clearance was lower (0, 007) in these animals. In coclusion, the results {{of the present study}} evidence that the metabolism of cyanide varies greatly considering the physiologic state of female swine being the young animals probably more sensitive to the toxic effects of chronic exposure to low doses of cyanide...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Enzymes have vital {{roles in}} several {{industrial}} processes (foods, cosmetics, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals) {{due to their}} highly selective nature and high activity at very low concentrations. Recent efforts to identify new sources of useful enzymes have been concentrated on the marine environment {{because of the potential}} to make use of processing wastes. About 35 - 50 % of the mass of the fish caught is a waste that is disposed off at sea or in landfills. The extraction of enzymes from fish processing waste can reduce environment problems and improve the economics of the fish industry. Collagenases are a group of enzymes that can be extracted from fish waste. Approach: Comprehensive reviews of the literature on the extraction, purification, characterization and use of collagenases was carried out. Results: Collagenases have different molecular weights based on their types and sources. They have the ability to break down the peptide bonds in collagen at physiological pH. They are classified into two types: serine and metallocollagenase. Collagenolytic activities have been shown at a wide range of temperatures (20 - 40 °C) and pH (6 - 8). Many activators can be used to achive collagenase activity including 4 -Aminophenylmercuric Acetate (APMA), trypsin, <b>potassium</b> or sodium <b>thiocyanate,</b> iodoacetamide and <b>potassium</b> iodide. Dithiothreitol (DTT), mercaptoethanol, ethylendiaminetetracetic acid, o-phenanthroline and cysteine inactivate the enzyme. Collagenases enzymes can be extracted with a variety of techniques using different buffering systems (tris-HCl, sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride and cacodylate). All techniques involve the use of ammonium sulphate fractionation and centrifugation to precipitate the enzyme. Collagenases are normally purified using chromatographic techniques such as gel-filtration, ion-exchange and affinity column chromatography. Collagenase can be assayed with a number of methods, including: colorimetric absorbance, viscometry, radioactivity and fluorescence spectroscopy. Collagenases are partly responsible for toughness in red meats and are used as tenderizers in food industry, have application in the fur and hide tanning to ensure uniform dying of leather, used in medicine to treat burns and ulcers, eliminate scar tissues, transplantation of organs. >Conclusion: Understanding {{of the nature of the}} enzymes and identifying the most suitable resources and the methods for their extraction and purification will have significant impact on the fish processing, food and medical industries...|$|R

50|$|The {{target of}} C5 convertase is {{complement}} protein C5. C5 is a two-chain (α, β) plasma glycoprotein (Mr = 196,000). C5 and C3 have similar structure. However, C5 {{does not appear}} to contain the internal thiol ester group reported for C3 and C4. C5 has relatively few disulfide bonds. There are three disulfide bonds in C5a, the α-chain has 15 half-Cystines, and the β-chain has only 6 half-Cystines. This comparatively low level of stabilizing disulfide bridges may provide a partial explanation for the irreversible conformational change imparted on C5 after cleavage to C5a and C5b. In addition, the relatively low number of disulfide bonds could account for instability of C5 when exposed to chaotrophs such as <b>potassium</b> <b>thiocyanate.</b> Electron micrographs of negatively stained C5 indicate that the protein is irregular in shape and contains several lobes.|$|E
