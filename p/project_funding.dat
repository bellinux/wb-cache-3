5|$|Little {{progress}} was made, but in 2005 the Environment Agency and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust promoted {{the formation of}} the Itchen Navigation Trust. They were committed to conserving the remains, rather than a full restoration to navigable standards. A request was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund in the United Kingdom for funds to restore the watercourse. Known as The Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail <b>Project,</b> <b>funding</b> was granted and a five-year restoration project began. Work has included widening the aperture at College Mead Lock and the construction of a bypass channel around Malm Lock to assist the movement of fish and other aquatic fauna. The navigation has been designated a European Special Area of Conservation as well as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, due to the rich diversity of wildlife found along the system, and its historical importance.|$|E
5|$|The Banglapedia project {{originated}} {{when the}} Asiatic Society of Bangladesh {{was working on}} a three-volume study titled History of Bangladesh, 1704-1971 in 1991. The editors felt the need for a standard desk reference, as that project progressed laboriously, culling facts from various libraries. The idea finally led to a concept paper prepared by Sirajul Islam and his colleagues and submitted to the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh in early 1994. The Banglapedia project was formally adopted on 19 February 1997, and Islam was appointed project director and chief editor. As the head of the Project Implementation Committee, his task was to plan and manage the <b>project</b> <b>funding.</b> In 1996, some three dozen committees were formed with three to four people in each committee to recommend the entries. Twenty-seven thousand entries were proposed, requiring a 20 volume compendium. Because of financial constraints, the number of entries was cut down to around 6,000. The project officially took off in 1998.|$|E

5|$|After the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{came into}} being in 1947 as a {{civilian}} agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the Chairman of its General Advisory Committee (GAC). From this position he advised {{on a number of}} nuclear-related issues, including <b>project</b> <b>funding,</b> laboratory construction and even international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always heeded. As Chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race. When the government questioned whether to pursue a crash program to develop an atomic weapon based on nuclear fusion—the hydrogen bomb—Oppenheimer initially recommended against it, though he had been in favor of developing such a weapon during the Manhattan Project. He was motivated partly by ethical concerns, feeling that such a weapon could only be used strategically against civilian targets, resulting in millions of deaths. He was also motivated by practical concerns, however, as at the time there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer felt that resources would be better spent creating a large force of fission weapons. He and others were especially concerned about nuclear reactors being diverted from plutonium to tritium production. They were overridden by Truman, who announced a crash program after the Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb in 1949. Oppenheimer and other GAC opponents of the project, especially James Conant, felt personally shunned and considered retiring from the committee. They stayed on, though their views on the hydrogen bomb were well known.|$|E

Lacking success with microwaves, Hershberger visited the NRL (where he had earlier worked) and saw their 200-MHz pulsed set. Back at the SCL, he and Robert H. Noyes built an experimental set with a 110-MHz (2.73-m) pulsed transmitter and a receiver patterned on {{the one at the}} NRL. A request for <b>project</b> <b>funding</b> was turned down by the War Department, but, with the backing of the Chief Signal Officer, Maj. Gen. James B.

25|$|The first {{indication}} of delays came in March 2007, {{when the national}} government started trading accusations with authorities of the Zagreb County. The government accused the county authorities of willfully slowing down the project as the county failed to adopt required amendments of their spatial planning documents. In turn, the county accused the government of insufficient <b>project</b> <b>funding</b> and that accusations levied by the central government were intended to disguise lack of money. This situation led to announcements made in 2008, that the motorway would be built {{from the direction of}} Sisak, however that was not immediately feasible as land was not purchased and construction design had to be adjusted. Even so, the works were announced to start north of Sisak at the beginning of 2009. The plan to start construction in 2009 from Sisak were confirmed in July 2008, when Hrvatske autoceste denied rumors that the route may be shortened to the northern outskirts of Sisak, instead of Mošćenica suburb of Petrinja located immediately to the south of Sisak. By August 2008, the planning of a tunnel under Zagreb shunting yard was abandoned in favor of a viaduct extending {{to the north of the}} planned Jakuševec interchange. Construction of the latter started shortly afterwards, but stalled.|$|E
