40|$|Background Pertussis (whooping cough) is {{a highly}} infective cause of cough that causes {{significant}} morbidity and mortality. Existing case definitions include paroxysmal cough, whooping and <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting</b> but diagnosis can be difficult. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated cough. Methods We systematically searched CINAHL, Embase, Medline and SCI-EXPANDED/CPCI-S up to June 2016. Eligible studies compared clinical characteristics in those positive and negative for Bordetella pertussis infection, confirmed by laboratory investigations. Two authors independently completed screening, data extraction and quality and bias assessments. For each characteristic RevMan was used to produce descriptive forest plots. We used the bivariate meta-analysis method to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Results Of 1969 identified papers, 53 were included. Forty-one clinical characteristics were assessed for diagnostic accuracy. In adult patients, paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had a high sensitivity (93. 2 %, CI 83. 2 - 97. 4 and 81. 8 %, CI 72. 2 - 88. 7 respectively) and low specificity (20. 6 %, CI 14. 7 - 28. 1 and 18. 8 %, CI 8. 1 - 37. 9 respectively), whereas <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting</b> and whooping had low sensitivity (32. 5 %, CI 24. 5 - 41. 6 and 29. 8 %, CI 8. 0 - 45. 2 respectively) and high specificity (77. 7 %, CI 73. 1 - 81. 7 and 79. 5 %, CI 69. 4 - 86. 9 respectively). <b>Post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting</b> in children is moderately sensitive (60. 0 %, CI 40. 3 - 77. 0) and specific 66. 0 %, CI 52. 5 - 77. 3). Conclusions In adult patients the presence of whooping or <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting</b> should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas {{the lack of a}} paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children, <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting</b> is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test...|$|E
40|$|Pertussis (whooping cough) is {{an acute}} {{bacterial}} illness, characterized by paroxysmal cough, gagging, <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting,</b> and an inspiratory whoop. Pertussis {{is caused by}} Bordetella pertussis, {{one of a number}} of species of Bordetella bacteria. Complications of pertussis, especially in infants and very young children, include pneumonia, seizures, encephalopathy and death. Although vaccination protects young children, older children and adults may become infected due to waning immunity. Because they usually have milder symptoms, older children and adults with pertussis may not seek medical care, thereby increasing the likelihood of transmission to unvaccinated infants and very young children...|$|E
40|$|Pertussis, {{commonly}} known as whooping cough, is a vaccine-preventable disease spread by close contact with the respiratory secretions of infected individuals.

40|$|Pertussis, or {{whooping}} cough, is {{a highly}} contagious disease caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. The disease is characterised by paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop and <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting.</b> 1 Pertussis is transmitted via direct contact with discharges from the respiratory tract of infected individuals (probably via droplets), and the incubation period is 9 – 10 days on average. 2 A second-ary attack rate of 90 % has been recorded in non-immune household contacts. 2 Worldwide, the incidence of per-tussis {{has been reported to}} be highest in children under 5 years, except where infant vaccination programs have achieved consistently high vaccination rates. 2 In NSW, there have been several changes to the immuni-sation schedule affecting pertussis vaccination in recent years. From 1985, a combined whole cell diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine (DTPw) was included in the immunisation schedule at ages 2, 4 and 6 months, with a booster at 18 months. 3 In 1994, a fifth dose was introduced Pertussis in New South Wales, 1993 – 2005 : the impact of vaccination policy on pertussis epidemiology Abstract: Objective: To assess whether changes in vaccination policy have affected the epidemiology of pertussis in NSW between 1993 and 2005...|$|E
40|$|Pertussis (whooping cough) is an {{infectious}} illness {{caused by the}} bacterium Bordetella pertussis.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesBordetella {{pertussis}} {{continues to}} circulate even {{in countries with}} good childhood vaccination coverage. This study was undertaken to define the relationship between documented disease and the clinical criteria proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). MethodsNasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from previously healthy 6 – 14 -year-old school children in Tehran, presenting with persistent cough of at least 2 - week duration. Specimens were examined for Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ResultsOut of 6601 students, 328 (5. 0 %) had been coughing for at least 2 weeks. Of these children with cough, 182 (55. 5 %) experienced whooping, 194 (59. 1 %) suffered a paroxysmal cough, and 73 (22. 3 %) had <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting.</b> Twenty-one (6. 4 %) samples tested positive for B. pertussis and six (1. 8 %) for B. parapertussis by PCR. Culture of four (1. 2 %) specimens was positive for B. pertussis. In comparison to PCR, the sensitivity and the specificity of the WHO clinical criteria (year 2000) were 95. 2 % and 15. 0 %, respectively.

40|$|Pertussis {{has been}} {{monitored}} in Switzerland since 1991 by the nationwide Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network (SSSN), consisting of approximately 200 general practitioners, internists and pediatricians representing about 3 % {{of the total}} primary care physicians of these specialities. SSSN members report patients with cough ? 14 days plus either an epidemiological link or characteristic symptoms (paroxysms, whoop, <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting)</b> {{on a weekly basis}} to the Federal Office of Public Health. Confirmatory PCR from nasopharyngeal specimens is offered for free. A total of 4992 cases have been reported until 2006. Yearly incidence has dropped from 70 cases per 100, 000 inhabitants in 1992 to 40 in 2006, with a single epidemic in 1994 - 1995 with 280 - 370 cases/ 100, 000. On average 80 % of reported cases were tested by PCR, 24 % of these were confirmed as Bordetella pertussis infections. For 2. 6 % of patients complications were reported, most commonly pneumonia, asthma bronchiale, otitis media, bronchitis and rib fractures. On average, 1. 5 % of patients were hospitalized. Disease in vaccinated patients was mitigated with less frequent complications (unvaccinated: 5. 1 %; 3 doses: 3. 0 %; ? 4 doses: 1. 7 %), hospitalizations (unvaccinated: 3. 6 %; ? 1 dose: 1. 1 %) and various clinical symptoms compared to unvaccinated patients.

40|$|Background Recent {{reports of}} {{pertussis}} epidemiology from Asia, Africa and South America have been limited, but the World Health Organization estimates indicate that these regions {{have the highest}} disease burden. Difficulty in estimating the prevalence of pertussis is {{due to lack of}} access to diagnostic methods, misdiagnoses, under-reporting, and different countries' reporting criteria. A syndrome characterized by severe episodes of coughing resembling whooping cough (pertussis) has also been defined as pertussis-like syndrome. Objective To report eleven cases of pertussis or pertussis-like syndrome in the pediatric ward of Hasan Sadikin Hospital. Methods This retrospective study was conducted by reviewing medical records from 2008 - 2010. Characteristics of 11 pertussislike syndrome patients were documented including age, gender, history of pertussis immunization, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, initial diagnosis, treatment and clinical response. Isolation of Bordetella pertussis using Bordet-Gengou agar was also noted. Pertussis diagnoses were grouped based on two classifications: probable and confirmed. Results Eleven patients were diagnosed with pertussis-like syndrome, including 5 boys and 6 girls. Most subjects were less than 6 months of age. Only one subject had received previous pertussis immunization. Dyspnea, paroxysmal cough, and fever were the most common symptoms. All were initially diagnosed to have had severe bacterial pneumonia, and later changed to probable pertussis. Three subjects exhibited <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting</b> and cyanosis, while none had apneic symptoms. All B. pertussis isolations yielded negative results. Ampicillin or cephalosporin was initially administered. Patients receiving subsequent clarithromycin showed good clinical responses. Conclusion All infants were likely considered to have pertussis, as most had no pertussis immunizations. However, B. pertussis isolation was unsuccessful in all cases. As such, diagnoses could not be confirmed. [Paediatr In don es. 2012; 5 2 : 28 - 31]...|$|E
40|$|A 40 -year-old {{man with}} no {{underlying}} lung disease has a 7 -day history of mild shortness of breath with exertion, as well as cough that is now productive of purulent sputum. He reports no paroxysms of cough and no contact with ill persons in his community. He {{does not appear to}} be in distress. His temperature is 37 °C, his pulse 84 beats per minute, and his respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute. On auscultation of the lungs, no rales are heard; scattered wheezes are heard in the lung bases. How should he be evaluated and treated? Summary and Recommendations The patient described in the vignette most likely has a viral infection causing uncomplicated acute bronchitis. On the basis of data from clinical trials, antibacterial agents are not recommended. Chest radiography is not indicated, given the absence of signs of pneumonia on physical examination. In the absence of an influenza outbreak in the community, no rapid testing for viral causes should be ordered, and no antiviral therapy should be prescribed; influenza is especially unlikely in a patient who is afebrile. In the absence of a history of contact with a person with suspected pertussis (or a person with a history of persistent cough), this diagnosis is unlikely. If paroxysms of cough developed later or if whooping or <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting</b> occurred, testing for pertussis would be reasonable. The patient should be advised that the cough may persist for an additional 10 to 21 days and that infrequently, it persists longer. For his wheezing and shortness of breath with activity, clinical experience suggests that a β 2 -agonist such as albuterol may provide relief, although data from clinical trials are inconsistent. On the basis of clinical experience, the patient might be offered short-term use of codeine or hydrocodone-containing preparations or inhaled corticosteroids if the cough is persistent, although data from trials to support their use are lacking...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In Lithuania, the {{vaccination}} coverage against pertussis is high. Nevertheless, {{there is a}} significant increase in pertussis cases in fully immunized children. The aim of our {{study was to determine the}} frequency of classical symptoms of laboratory confirmed pertussis and describe its epidemiology in children fully vaccinated against pertussis. Methods From May to December 2001, 70 children aged 1 month to 15 years, suffering from prolonged cough were investigated in the Centre of Paediatrics, Vilnius University Children's Hospital. The collected information included personal data, vaccination history, clinical symptoms of the current illness, and treatment before hospitalization. At the admission to the hospital blood samples were taken from all studied children for Bordetella pertussis IgM and IgA. Results A total of 53 (75. 7 %) of the 70 recruited patients with prolonged cough showed laboratory evidence of pertussis. 32 of them were fully vaccinated with whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTP). The age of fully vaccinated patients varied from 4 to 15 years (average 10. 9 ± 3. 1; median 11). The time period between the last vaccination dose (fourth) and the clinical manifestation of pertussis was 2. 6 – 13 years (average 8. 9 ± 3. 0; median 9). More than half of the children before the beginning of pertussis were in contact with persons suffering from long lasting cough illness in the family, school or day-care center. The mean duration from onset of pertussis symptoms until hospitalization was 61. 4 ± 68. 3 days (range, 7 to 270 days; median 30). For 11 patients who had had two episodes (waves) of coughing, the median duration of cough was 90 days, and for 21 with one episode 30 days (p Conclusion Fully vaccinated children fell ill with pertussis at the median of 11 years old, 9 years following pertussis vaccination. More than half of the children could catch pertussis at home, at school or day-care center.

40|$|Bordetella {{pertussis}} is the causative bacteria of whooping cough. Whooping cough is {{a highly}} contagious infection, which is characterized by coughing with whooping and <b>post-tussive</b> <b>vomiting.</b> In particular, infants under 6 months of age {{who have not been}} fully vaccinated, are at risk for serious complications or even death. Initially, pertussis vaccination was successful in protecting young children against whooping cough. However, despite high vaccination coverage rates in the Netherlands, the incidence of pertussis again increased since 1996, similar to the situation in many other countries. In 2012, the Netherlands experienced the largest pertussis epidemic since the start of vaccination in the 1950 s, with over 8, 000 notified disease cases. The current Dutch pertussis vaccination schedule consists of four primary pertussis vaccinations for infants administered at 2, 3, 4 and 11 months of age with an additional acellular preschool booster vaccination at 4 years of age. In this thesis we evaluated the effects of the change in 2005 from the whole cell pertussis (wP) infant vaccination to acellular (aP) vaccination of baby’s in preschool and school children. Despite waning antibody levels at 4 years of age, pertussis specific T-cell responses had remained present in both wP- and aP-primed children, but were much higher in aP-vaccinated than in wP-primed children. Moreover, there was only a limited to absent rise in the already high levels of all T-cell cytokines upon the preschool aP booster vaccination at 4 years of age in the aP-primed children. In contrast, a typical T-cell memory response was observed in wP-primed children with increased T-cell responses both after a low-dose or a high-dose aP preschool booster. We furthermore showed that the preschool aP booster a resulted in significantly higher pertussis-specific IgG antibody levels in aP-primed children compared with wP-primed children and that antibody levels remained higher {{for at least two years}} post-booster till age 6 years. The avidity of antibody responses was also higher in aP-primed children immediately post-booster compared to wP-primed children, but no differences were found anymore in 6 -year-old children. We further demonstrated that pertussis-specific T-cell immunity in wP-primed children gradually had increased with age in children 6 and 9 years of age, two to five years following the aP booster vaccination at age 4 years, most probably due to natural contact with circulating pertussis bacteria. After an extra pertussis aP booster vaccination at age 9 years, the high pre-vaccination T-cell immune responses were only minimally enhanced upon the extra vaccination. In conclusion, evaluating cellular immune responses to pertussis vaccination in addition to antibody levels provides important information for recommendations about new vaccination schedules. Our findings suggest that it seems worthwhile to study the possible benefits of postponing the preschool pertussis booster vaccination to a later age and to use a low-dose vaccine. Development of new vaccines with longer lasting immunity is a future goal to prevent pertussis...|$|E
