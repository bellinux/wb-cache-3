40|$|The {{expansion}} of communication systems is the undeniable {{advantage of the}} most contemporary digital technologies. However, when a specialist user such as an inventor or an idea owner communicates through a communication system, their intellects are exposed to theft. Upon {{the analysis of the}} requirements of such users, it became evident that in order to implement a global, reliable, yet secure system for specialist users, designing a <b>network</b> <b>architecture</b> that provides centralized private connectivity is crucial. This paper proposes a <b>network</b> <b>architecture</b> that provides centralized private connectivity and accommodates the requirements of the network infrastructure of such a system. The proposed virtual <b>private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) <b>architecture</b> is designed to provide a trusted environment with centralized control and distributed networking, which is different from existing VPN models. It is entitled as Inventor-Investor Network (IINet) and the name is derived from its significant benefits for inventor and investor sets of users. The real experimental IINet prototype is implemented using OpenVPN.

40|$|Abstract—Agent-based virtual <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> <b>architecture</b> (ABVA) {{refers to}} the {{environment}} where a third-party provider runs and administers remote access virtual <b>private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) service for organizations that {{do not want to}} maintain their own in-house VPN servers. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimally connecting users of an organization to VPN server locations in an ABVA environment so that request denial probability and latency are balanced. A user request needs a certain bandwidth between the user and the VPN server. The VPN server may deny requests when the bandwidth is insufficient (capacity limitation). At the same time, the latency perceived by a user from its current location to a VPN server is an important consideration. We present a number of schemes regarding how VPN servers are to be selected and the number of servers to be tried so that request denial probability is minimized without unduly affecting latency. These schemes are studied on a number of different topologies. For our study, we consider Poisson and non-Poisson arrival of requests under both finite and infinite population models to understand the impact on the entire system. We found that the arrival processes have a significant and consistent impact on the request denial probability and the impact on the latency is dependent on the traffic load in the infinite model. In the finite model, arrival processes have an inconsistent impact to the request denial probability. As to the latency in the finite model, arrivals that have a squared coefficient of variation less than one is consistently largest, followed by the Poisson case, then the case that the squared co-efficient of variation is more than one. Finally, a strength of this work is the comparison of infinite and finite models; we found that a mismatch between the infinite and the finite model is dependent both on the number of users in the system and the load.

40|$|The Multi-protocol Label Switching {{is one of}} the {{proposed}} technologies useful for traffic engineering in the specific aspects of measurement and control of Internet traffic and virtual <b>Private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) is a concept that significant on the future of business communication, it replace existing <b>private</b> <b>network</b> with flexible <b>architecture</b> that is easily manage and at a same time it provide enhanced service. The Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) virtual <b>Private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) is a popular IP VPN service based on RFC 2547 and its successor documents (dubbed 2547 bis). The main importance of MPLS is that it integrates the key features of both Layer 2 and Layer 3. Most importantly, it is not limited to any Layer 2 or Layer 3 protocol. In particular, MPLS has several applications and can be extended across multiple products segments (such as an MPLS router, an IP services switch/router, a multi service switch, an Optical Ethernet switch, as well as optical switches). Many service providers offer MPLS VPN to their large enterprise customers, who need only attach their local, customer edge (CE) site routers to the nearest service provider edge (PE) router and exchange routing information. MPLS reduces the complexity of forwarding using encapsulated fixedlength labels for making high speed forwarding decisions. The service provider distributes customer IP routing information to other customer sites and uses its backbone to forward customer IP packets from one customer site to another. This is done by very new concept which is called multicast virtual <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> (mVPNs) ...|$|R
