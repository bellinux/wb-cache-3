40|$|During the post-Darwinian {{history of}} taxonomy, the Linnaean {{hierarchy}} has maintained {{its role as}} a means for representing hierarchical taxonomic relationships. During the same period, the principle of descent has taken on an increasingly important role as the basis for reformulated versions of fundamental taxonomic concepts and principles. Early in this history, the principle of descent provided an explanation for the existence of taxa and implied a nested, hierarchical structure for taxonomic relationships. Although an evolutionary explanation for taxa contradicted the Aristotelian context within which the Linnaean hierarchy was developed, the nested, hierarchical structure of taxonomic rela· tionships implied by evolution was compatible with the practical use of the Linnaean hierarchy for conveying hierarchical relationships and seems to have reinforced this practice. Later changes associated with the development of taxon concepts based on the principle of descent led to changes in the interpretation of the Linnaean categories as well as certain modifications related to use of the Linnaean hierarchy in representing phylogenetic relationships. Although some authors questioned use of the Linnaean hierarchy in <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>taxonomies,</b> most continued to use it in one form ot artother. More recently, taxonomists have considered the relevance of the principle of descent to nomenclature. They have found fundamental inconsistencies between concepts of taxa based on that principle and methods currently used to define taxon names, which are based on the Linnaean hierarchy. Although these inconsistencies can be corrected without totally eliminating the Linnaean hierarchy, the necessary changes would greatly reduce the importance of that hierarchy, particularly in the area of nomenclature. Moreover, the earlier development of taxon concepts based on the principle of descent effectively proposed taxonomic categories of greater theoretical significance than those of the Linnaean hierarchy. The historical trend of granting increasing importance to the principle of descent has reduced the significance of the Linnaean hierarchy {{to the point where it}} may no longer be worth retaining...|$|R

5|$|Scientists have {{commonly}} understood Tyrannosauroidea {{to include}} the tyrannosaurids and their immediate ancestors.

To make the family more exclusive, Thomas Holtz redefined it in 2004 to include all species more closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex than to Ornithomimus velox, Deinonychus antirrhopus or Allosaurus fragilis. Sereno published a new definition in 2005, using Ornithomimus edmontonicus, Velociraptor mongoliensis and Troodon formosus as external specifiers.

5|$|The {{development}} of a <b>phylogenetic</b> approach to <b>taxonomy</b> suggested the Liliales formed {{some of the earliest}} monocots. Molecular analysis indicates that divergence amongst the Liliales probably occurred around 82 million years ago. The closest sister family to the Liliaceae are the Smilacaceae with the Liliaceae separating 52 million years ago. Liliaceae thus arose during the late (Maastrichtian) Cretaceous to early (Paleocene) Paleogene periods. Major evolutionary clades include the Lilieae (Lilium, Fritillaria, Nomocharis, Cardiocrinum, Notholirion) from the Himalayas about 12mya and the Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa, Gagea) from East Asia at about the same time. The Medeoleae (Clintonia and Medeola) may have appeared in North America but were subsequently dispersed, as may have the Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae. Liliaceae fossils have been dated to the Paleogene and Cretaceous eras in the Antarctic.|$|R
40|$|Laser Raman {{microspectroscopy}} {{was used}} as a microchemical analysis technique to characterize the wall chemistry of organic-walled microfossils (acritarchs and prasinophytes) extracted from Proterozoic (Tonian: ca. 900 Myr) and early Palaeozoic (Silurian: ca. 420 Myr) marine sediments in the Volta Basin of Ghana, and the Ghadamis Basin of Libya, respectively. Raman spectra of Proterozoic acritarchs show spectral features characteristic of kerogenous compounds at ~ 1350 and ~ 1600 cm − 1, consistently with previously published reports. In addition, spectra from prasinophyte algae from the Silurian sample also show an interesting spectral feature at ~ 1707 cm − 1 indicative of carbonyl moieties.

To map this remarkable biochemical diversity, we present an identification and screening method based on the infrared spectra of native silk feedstock and cocoons.

500|$|In <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>taxonomy,</b> the clade Pterosauria has {{usually been}} defined as node-based and {{anchored}} to several extensively studied taxa {{as well as those}} thought to be primitive.

500|$|The major {{diversification}} {{amongst the}} Angiosperms (flowering plants) can be dated {{to the end}} of the Early Cretaceous period which stretched from 146 to 100 million years ago (mya). The development of a phylogenetic approach to taxonomy, starting with Charles Bessey's The <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>taxonomy</b> of flowering plants (1915) suggested the Liliales formed some of the earliest monocots, with an estimated date of origin of 124mya for the stem node (most recent common ancestor of the clade of interest and its sister clade) age and between 117mya to 82mya for the crown node (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) age. Molecular analysis suggests that the Liliaceae sensu APG ("core Liliales") were part of one of four early clades of Liliales, namely Campynemataceae, Melanthiaceae, Alstroemeriaceae + Luzuriagaceae + Colchicaceae and Smilacaceae + Liliaceae, dated to 68–65mya (stem node) with the separation of the Smilaceae and Liliaceae sister clades (crown node) occurring later at around 55–52mya.

40|$|A {{diversity}} of hypotheses {{have been proposed}} for <b>phylogenetic</b> relationships and <b>taxonomy</b> within the genus Odorrana, and great {{progress has been made}} over the past several decades. However, there is still some controversy concerning relationships among Odorrana species. Here, we used many paratypes and topotypes and utilized 1. 81 kb of mitochondrial sequence data to generate a phylogeny for approximately 4 / 5 of Odorrana species, and Odorrana haplotypes form a strongly supported monophyletic group relative to the other genera sampled. The deepest phylogenetic divergences within Odorrana separate 3 lineages whose interrelationships are not recovered with strong support. These lineages include the ancestral lineage of O. chapaensis, the ancestral lineage of a strongly supported clade comprising many western species, and the ancestral lineage of a strongly supported clade comprising all other Odorrana sampled. Within the latter clade, the first phylogenetic split separates O. ishikawae from a well-supported clade comprising its other species. These divergences likely occurred in the middle Miocene, approximately 12 - 15 million years ago. Separation of the ancestral lineage of Odorrana from its closest relative, Babina in our study, likely occurred in the early Miocene or possibly late Oligocene. Rates of lineage accumulation remained high from the middle Miocene through the Pleistocene. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

(2) Genus Quadrulella, one of the few arcellinid genera building its shell from self-secreted siliceous elements, and the mixotrophic Hyalosphenia papilio branch within the Nebela group in agreement with the general morphology of their shell and the presence of an organic rim around the aperture (synapomorphy for Hyalospheniidae).
