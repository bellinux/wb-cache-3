40|$|Three {{unrelated}} Oriental Jewish {{families with}} a total of eight subjects with progressive hereditary <b>sensory</b> <b>neuropathy</b> are reported.

Here, we provide unprecedented evidence that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors trigger a painful neuropathy and aggravate paclitaxel-induced neuropathies in mice. By using transgenic mice with altered neuronal vascular endothelial growth factor receptor expression, systemic inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors was shown {{to interfere with the}} endogenous neuroprotective activities of vascular endothelial growth factor on sensory neurons. In vitro, vascular endothelial growth factor prevented primary dorsal root ganglion cultures from paclitaxel-induced neuronal stress and cell death by counteracting mitochondrial membrane potential decreases and normalizing hyperacetylation of α-tubulin. In contrast, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors exerted opposite effects. Intriguingly, vascular endothelial growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors exerted their effects through a mechanism whereby Hdac 6, through Hsp 90, controls vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 -mediated expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl 2.

40|$|International audienceGait {{initiation}} (GI) is the {{transient period}} between posture and movement. Its central programming {{takes into account}} the environmental constraints as well as the constraints induced by the body itself. Patients with <b>peripheral</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuropathies</b> display a severe proprioceptive deficit leading to balance and gait impairments and rely on a variety of compensatory mechanisms and are known to be dependent on vision. GI was studied on eight healthy subjects and five patients in order to assess the effect of somatosensory loss on the different phases of GI, combined with a manipulation of the visual inputs. Our main hypothesis is that the proprioceptive deficit would induce an adaptation of the GI process, especially when modifying the lower part of peripheral vision. The results show that the pathology induces some adaptations of the GI process, characterized by a decrease of the motor performance (assessed by the maximal anteroposterior velocity of the center of gravity {{at the end of the}} first step), a decrease in the spatial parameters (assessed by the peak amplitude of the backward shift of the center of foot pressure during the anticipation phase and the length of the first step), and a non-modification of the temporal parameters (assessed by the duration of the anticipation phase and of the first step). The suppression of the lower part of peripheral vision has no effect on the GI process. The role of the lower part of peripheral vision seems therefore to be less critical for GI, than for balance and locomotion...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Poisoning by {{organophosphate}} insecticides causes cholinergic toxicity. Organophosphate induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is a sensory-motor {{distal axonopathy}} which usually occurs after ingestion of large doses of certain organophosphate insecticides and {{has so far}} only been reported in patients with preceding cholinergic toxicity. Surprisingly, it was recently reported by other authors that an exclusively <b>sensory</b> <b>neuropathy</b> developed in eight patients after repeated unquantified exposures to chlorpyrifos, which did not cause clear-cut cholinergic toxicity. The objective was to assess whether an exclusively <b>sensory</b> <b>neuropathy</b> develops in patients severely poisoned by various OPs.  METHODS—Toxicological studies and electrophysiological measurements were performed in <b>peripheral</b> motor and <b>sensory</b> nerves in 11 patients after acute organophosphate poisoning among which two subjects were poisoned with chlorpyrifos.  RESULTS—Three patients developed OPIDP, including one poisoned by chlorpyrifos. Exclusively <b>sensory</b> <b>neuropathy</b> was never seen after either single or repeated acute organophosphate poisoning. A mild sensory component {{was associated with a}} severe motor component in two of the three cases of OPIDP, the other was an exclusively motor polyneuropathy.  CONCLUSION—A sensory-motor polyneuropathy caused by organophosphate insecticides might occur after a severe poisoning and the sensory component, if present, is milder than the motor one. Bearing in mind the toxicological characteristics of these organophosphate insecticides, other causes should be sought for <b>sensory</b> <b>peripheral</b> <b>neuropathies</b> in patients who did not display severe cholinergic toxicity {{a few weeks before the}} onset of symptoms and signs. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Adverse event reports (AERs) {{submitted}} to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to confirm platinum agent-associated adverse events, and to clarify the rank-order of these drugs in terms of susceptibility.

Results: Based on 1, 644, 220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, CDDP, CBDCA, and L-OHP all proved to cause nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and <b>peripheral</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuropathy.</b> Higher susceptibility to nausea was found for CDDP than CBDCA and L-OHP.

40|$|Although {{a variety}} of {{industrial}} chemicals, {{as well as several}} chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancer or HIV, preferentially induce a <b>peripheral</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuropathy</b> what remains unclear is why these agents induce a sensory vs. a motor or mixed neuropathy. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} endothelial cells that vascularize the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which houses the primary afferent sensory neurons, are unique in that they have large fenestrations and are permeable to {{a variety of}} low and high molecular weight agents. In the present report we used whole-mount preparations, immunohistochemistry, and confocal laser scanning microscopy to show that the cell body-rich area of the L 4 mouse DRG has a 7 fold higher density of CD 31 + capillaries than cell fiber rich area of the DRG or the distal or proximal aspect of the sciatic nerve. This dense vascularization, coupled with the high permeability of these capillaries, may synergistically contribute, and in part explain, why many potentially neurotoxic agents preferentially accumulate and injure cells within the DRG. Currently, cancer survivors and HIV patients constitute the largest and most rapidly expanding groups that have chemically induced <b>peripheral</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>neuropathy.</b> Understanding the unique aspects of the vascularization of the DRG and closing the endothelial fenestrations of the rich vascular bed of capillaries that vascularize the DRG before intravenous administration of anti-neoplastic or anti-HIV therapies, may offer a mechanism based approach to attenuate these chemically induced peripheral neuropathies in these patients...|$|E
