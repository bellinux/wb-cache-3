500|$|The first scandal to taint the Grant {{administration}} in 1869 was Black Friday, {{also known as}} the Gold Panic, which was an attempt by two aggressive financiers to corner the price of gold without regard to the nation's economic welfare. The intricate financial scheme was primarily conceived and administered by Wall Street manipulators Jay Gould and his partner James Fisk. Their plan was to convince President Grant not to sell Treasury gold, in order to increase the sales of agriculture products overseas and increase the shipping business of Gould's Erie Railroad. Gould and Fisk were able to get Grant's brother-in-law, Abel Rathbone Corbin, involved with the scheme {{as a way to get}} access to Grant himself. [...] Gould had also given a $10,000 bribe to the assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Daniel Butterfield, in exchange for inside information. On June 5, 1869, while Grant was traveling from New York to Boston on The Providence, a ship owned by both Gould and Fisk, the two speculators urged Grant not to sell any gold from the Treasury and attempted to convince him that a high price of gold helped farmers and the Erie Railroad. President Grant, however, was stoic and did not agree to Fisk and Gould's suggestion to stop releasing Treasury Gold into the market. Grant's Secretary of Treasury, George S. Boutwell, continued to sell Treasury gold on the open market. In late August 1869, President Grant consulted with businessman, A. T. Stewart, Grant's initial Cabinet nominee for Secretary of Treasury, concerning the Treasury's selling gold. Stewart advised Grant that the Treasury should not sell gold, in order that the Government would not be involved in the gold market. Grant accepted Stewart's advise and wrote to Boutwell that selling extra Treasury gold would upset agriculture sales. Boutwell had, on September 1, originally ordered $9,000,000 in gold to be sold from the Treasury in order to buy up U.S. Bonds with greenbacks. However, after receiving a letter from Grant, Boutwell cancelled the order. Previously, Secretary Boutwell had been selling regularly at $1,000,000 of gold each week. On September 6, 1869, Gould bought the Tenth National Bank, which was used as a buying house for gold, and Gould and Fisk then began buying gold in earnest. As the price of gold began to rise, Grant became suspicious of possible manipulation and wrote a letter to Secretary Boutwell on September 12, stating [...] "The fact is, a desperate struggle is now taking place...I write this letter to advise you of what I think you may expect, to <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> your guard." [...] However, President Grant's personal associations with Gould and Fisk gave them the clout that they needed to continue their financial scam on Wall Street.|$|E

2500|$|In 1942, Buñuel {{applied for}} American citizenship, because he {{anticipated}} that MoMA {{would soon be}} put under federal control. [...] But that same year, Dalí published his autobiography, The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí, in which {{he made it clear}} that he had split with Buñuel because the latter was a Communist and an atheist. News of this reached Archbishop Spellman, who [...] angrily confronted Barry with the question: [...] "Are you aware that you are harbouring in this Museum the Antichrist, the man who made a blasphemous film L'Age d'Or?" [...] At the same time, a campaign on the part of Hollywood, through its industry trade paper, the Motion Picture Herald, to undermine the MoMA film unit resulted in a 66% reduction in the department's budget and Buñuel felt himself compelled to resign. [...] In 1944, he returned to Hollywood for the third time, this time as Spanish Dubbing Producer for Warner Brothers. Before leaving New York, he confronted Dalí at his hotel, the Sherry Netherland, to tell the painter about the damage his book had done and then shoot him in the knee. Buñuel did not carry out the violent part of his plan. Dalí explained himself by saying: [...] "I did not write my book to <b>put</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>on</b> a pedestal. I wrote it to put ME on a pedestal".|$|E
2500|$|Holland and Smith {{disagreed}} {{about which}} actor {{should have the}} part of Ali; Holland preferred Bilginer, while Smith preferred Salih. Holland believed Bilginer possessed the right [...] "look" [...] and that Salih was not tall or tough-looking enough, [...] "he didn't have the sort of physical presence that <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> your guard." [...] He also believed that Sandy Ratcliff, the actress playing Ali's wife Sue, would have [...] "made mincemeat of [...] ". Additionally, Holland visioned Ali with a moustache, and unlike Bilginer, Salih was unable to grow one. Conversely, Smith felt that Salih was [...] "the genuine article. Not Turkish, but Turkish-Cypriot. He would have so much actual knowledge {{to bring to the}} character [...] He wouldn't have to act the part, he was the part." [...] Both actors were given a script reading with the actress who would play Ali's wife, Sandy Ratcliff, who arrived for the reading 45 minutes late. Bilginer read with Ratcliff first, and Holland and Smith have commented that he [...] "had obviously thought about the part [...] because there was much more physical power in his performance. At one stage Julia and Tony were worried that he might even hit Sandy!" [...] Salih read next, and after being introduced to Ratcliff who apologised for her tardiness, to which Salih replied [...] "Not to worry. Typical bloody woman!" [...] His quip impressed Holland and Smith; they have since commented that Salih almost got the part on the strength of that line alone, as the felt it typified the character perfectly. Salih was eventually given the part of Ali, but as there were only two suitable Turkish speaking actors available, and as Ali would need a brother, Bilginer was given the part of Mehmet Osman.|$|E
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it. ' When they sent [...] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.
