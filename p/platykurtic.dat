The Pearson Chi-Square statistic is generally more powerful for the increasing, unimodal, leptokurtic, <b>platykurtic</b> andbath-tub shaped alternatives. Finally, both the Nominal Kolmogorov- Smirnov and the Pearson Chi-Square test statistic are generally more powerful for the bimodal alternative. We also address the issue of the sensitivity of the test statistics to the alternatives under the ‘zig-zag’ null. In comparison to the uniform null of Steele and Chaseling [10], our investigation shows that the Discrete KS test statistic is most sensitive to the decreasing trend alternative; the Pearson Chi-Square statistic is most sensitive to both the leptokurtic and <b>platykurtic</b> trend alternatives.

40|$|THE {{purpose of}} the present survey of data was to check em-pirically on two hypotheses: i. Easy tests tend to yield {{negatively}} skewed score distribu-tions; hard tests, positively skewed distributions. This hypothe-sis is so prevalent that references need not be cited. 2. Symmetric score distributions are ordinarily <b>platykurtic.</b> This conclusion has been reached from theoretical considerations by Keats (5) (a symmetric beta function is always <b>platykurtic)</b> and Lord (6, 7). The same conclusion has been reached from practical experience by Mollenkopf (8), by Conrad and by Tucker (both cited in 8, p. 214). The practical advantages of a <b>platykurtic</b> score distribution are cited by Ferguson (2) and by Jackson and Ferguson (4).

30|$|A {{multiple}} {{linear regression}} model generalizes the simple linear regression model by allowing the response variable to depend {{on more than one}} explanatory variable. In this paper, we have explored the idea of using a symmetric <b>platykurtic</b> distribution for analyzing nonnormal errors in the multivariate linear regression model. The symmetric <b>platykurtic</b> distribution serves {{as an alternative to the}} normal distribution with <b>platykurtic</b> nature. The maximum likelihood estimators of the model parameters are derived and we found them feasible. Through simulation studies, the properties of these estimators are studied. Traditional OLS estimation is carried out in parallel and the results are compared. The simulated results reveal that the ML estimators are more efficient than the OLS estimators in terms of the relative efficiency of one-step-ahead forecast mean square error. A comparative study of the developed regression model with the Gaussian model revealed that this model gives good fit to some data sets. The asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimators are studied, and the large sample theory with respect to regression coefficients is also presented. The utility of the proposed model is demonstrated with real-time data. This regression model is much more useful for analyzing data sets arising from agricultural experiments, portfolio management, space experiments, and a wide range other practical problems.

30|$|A {{flexible}} way to {{deal with}} outliers in linear regression is to assume that the errors follow an exponential power (EP) distribution. Specifically, assuming an EP distribution decreases the influence of outliers and, as a result, increases the robustness of the analysis (Box and Tiao 1962; Liang et al. 2007; Salazar et al. 2012; West 1984). In addition, the EP distribution includes the Gaussian distribution as a particular case. Further, the EP distribution may have tails either lighter (<b>platykurtic)</b> or heavier (leptokurtic) than Gaussian. <b>Platykurtic</b> distributions may be a result of truncation, whereas leptokurtic distributions provide protection against outliers. Salazar et al. (2012) have developed three types of Jeffreys priors for linear regression models with independent EP errors. Unfortunately, two of those priors lead to useless improper posterior distributions and only one leads to a proper posterior distribution. Here we develop explicit expressions for reference priors for all the six possible orderings of the model parameters.|$|E
