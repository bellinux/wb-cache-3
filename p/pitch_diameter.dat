25|$|The process uses a {{milling cutter}} with a {{cross-section}} that is slightly smaller than the final cross-section of the cut; {{it has the same}} diameter as the worm. The cutter is then angled to the gashing angle. The gashing angle is calculated from the lead and <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> of the worm; often tables are available with the gashing angles for common diameters and leads. The cutter is centered over the blank and then plunged into it to the proper depth. The cutter is finally withdrawn and the blank indexed to the next tooth space and cut. This is repeated until all of the tooth spaces have been cut.|$|E

For Conductor on Round Core (CORC), twist <b>pitch</b> and <b>diameter</b> will influence the characteristics of critical current. The influence of twist <b>pitch</b> and <b>diameter</b> on the critical current characteristics of CORC was studied. In this paper, the simulation of magnetic field distribution of the conductor using FEM was accomplished, and the critical current of the conductor was calculated and discussed in different twist <b>pitch</b> and <b>diameter.</b> Then, the sample of HTS CORC was fabricated, and the critical current was measured at liquid nitrogen temperature and self-field.

2500|$|Conical {{micrometer}} anvils, specifically {{suited to}} {{resting on the}} sides of the thread, are made for various thread angles, with 60° being the most common. Mics with such anvils are usually called [...] "thread mics" [...] or [...] "pitch mics" [...] (because they directly measure the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter).</b> Users who lack thread mics rely instead on the [...] "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire (or gauge pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then measuring from wire to wire with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion factor (produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied with the measured value to infer a measurement of the thread's <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter.</b> Tables of these conversion factors were established many decades ago for all standard thread sizes, so today a user need only take the measurement and then perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The 3-wire method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific diameter, commonly the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter,</b> or on specialty threads such as multi-start or when the thread angle is not 60°. [...] Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point) as it occurs to storage or software through an interface (such as USB or RS-232), in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality assurance and quality control can be achieved using statistical process control.|$|E

Inserts of different <b>pitch</b> to <b>diameter</b> ratios of 6. 25, 8. 33, 12. 5, and 16. 67 with center core rod were used for this investigation.

5000|$|Thread limit or <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> {{limit is}} a {{standard}} used for classifying the tolerance of the thread <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> for taps. For imperial, H or L limits are used which designate how many units of 5 ten thousandths of an inch over or undersized the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> is from its basic value, respectively. Thus a tap designated with an H limit of 3, denoted H3, would have a <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> 5 ten thousandths × 3 = 1.5 thousandths of an inch larger than base <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> and would thus result in cutting an external thread with a looser fit than say an H2 tap. Metric uses D or DU limits {{which is the same}} system as imperial, but uses D or DU designators for over and undersized respectively, and goes by units of 0.013 mm.Generally taps come in the range of H1 to H5 and rarely L1.The <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> of a thread is measured where the radial cross section of a single thread equals [...]5 x Pitchexample: 16 pitch thread = 1/16" [...] = [...]0625" [...] the pitch actual <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> of the thread is measured at the radial cross section measures [...]03125" ...|$|E

50|$|Others followed. Examples were a French {{mechanic}} surnamed Senot, who in 1795 {{created a}} screw-cutting lathe capable of industrial-level production, and David Wilkinson of Vermont, who employed a slide rest in 1798. However, these inventors were soon overshadowed by Henry Maudslay, who in 1800 created a screw-cutting lathe that is frequently {{cited as the}} first. Clearly, his was not the first; however, his did become the best known, spreading {{to the rest of}} the world the winning combination of leadscrew, slide-rest, and change gears, in an arrangement practical to use and robust enough for cutting metal. These late-18th-century screw-cutting lathes represented the breakthrough development of the technology. They permitted the large-scale, industrial production of screws that were interchangeable. Standardization of threadforms (including thread angle, <b>pitches,</b> major <b>diameters,</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>diameters,</b> etc.) began immediately on the intra-company level, and by the end of the 19th century, it had been carried to the international level (although pluralities of standards still exist).|$|R
50|$|The major {{diameter}} of external threads is normally {{smaller than the}} {{major diameter}} of the internal threads, if the threads are designed to fit together. But this requirement alone does not guarantee that a bolt and a nut of the same pitch would fit together: the same requirement must separately {{be made for the}} minor and <b>pitch</b> <b>diameters</b> of the threads. Besides providing for a clearance between the crest of the bolt threads and the root of the nut threads, one must also ensure that the clearances are not so excessive as to cause the fasteners to fail.|$|R

50|$|When gear {{dimensions}} {{are in the}} metric system the pitch specification is generally in terms of module or modulus, which is effectively a length measurement across the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter.</b> The term module is understood to mean the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> in millimeters divided {{by the number of}} teeth. When the module is based upon inch measurements, it is known as the English module to avoid confusion with the metric module. Module is a direct dimension, unlike diametral pitch, which is an inverse dimension ("threads per inch"). Thus, if the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> of a gear is 40 mm and the number of teeth 20, the module is 2, which means that there are 2 mm of <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> for each tooth. The preferred standard module values are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40 and 50.|$|E
