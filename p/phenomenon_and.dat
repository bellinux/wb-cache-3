The contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as the Man in the Moon, the rabbit and the buffalo, among others.

5|$|Books and scripts {{that use}} the general story line of Austen's novels but change or {{otherwise}} modernise the story also became popular {{at the end of}} the 20th century. Clueless (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of Emma that takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> spawned its own television series. Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), based on the successful 1996 book of the same name by Helen Fielding, was inspired by both Pride and Prejudice and the 1995 BBC adaptation. The Bollywoodesque production Bride and Prejudice, which sets Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, a politico-economic {{discourse}} emerged. It concerned {{itself with}} distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying {{the place of}} Greek slavery. The influence of Marx is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery {{as a mode of}} production. The Positivists represented by the historian Eduard Meyer (Slavery in Antiquity, 1898) were soon to oppose the Marxist theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social <b>phenomenon,</b> <b>and</b> not economic.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic <b>phenomenon,</b> <b>and</b> weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E

Key has committed the National Party to working towards reducing greenhouse emissions in New Zealand by 50% within the next fifty years. Commentators note that as recently as 2005, Key made statements indicating that he was sceptical of the effects and impact of climate change.|$|E

Despite Rose's protestations that her grandfather is dead, Jackie insists that he has returned and has been visiting her for some time. A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat, surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing. TV broadcasts confirm {{that this is a}} worldwide <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> Jackie explains that a few months previously millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world. Humans have come to accept them and believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones.|$|E
5|$|The genus Amphidromus {{is unusual}} in that it {{includes}} species that have dextral shell-coiling and species that have sinistral shell-coiling. In addition, some species within this genus are particularly notable because their populations simultaneously include individuals with left-handed and right-handed shell-coiling. This is an extremely rare <b>phenomenon,</b> <b>and</b> very interesting to biologists. Studies focused on the soft anatomy of Amphidromus are scattered and fragmentary. Information on the internal anatomy is known only from a few species, and no larger, comparative morphological study has ever been carried out.|$|E

5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> {{was in a position to}} investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} instead waits, the cabin gets transported to Aosagi Island. Yomogi, Mayuzumi, and Cocoro avoid the {{avalanche}} that was {{mentioned in the}} newspaper. The Yuni from 2011 is left at Akakura to be rescued by the rescue team in 2011, and to go to SPHIA in 2012 to repeat the loop, making sure that Cocoro, Yomogi, and Mayuzumi survive the week. Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; he thinks that she, too, was experiencing the transfer <b>phenomenon,</b> <b>and</b> that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. He thinks the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child {{over the edge of}} a cliff while singing. The game ends with Satoru meeting Mayuzumi, who says she does not recognize him.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Sadler went to Europe {{and studied}} {{psychiatry}} {{for a year}} under Sigmund Freud. Sometime between 1906 and 1911, Sadler attempted to treat a patient with an unusual sleep condition. While the patient was sleeping he spoke to Sadler and claimed to be an extraterrestrial. Sadler spent years observing the sleeping man {{in an effort to}} explain the <b>phenomenon,</b> <b>and</b> eventually decided the man had no mental illness and that his words were genuine. The man's identity was never publicized, but speculation has focused on Sadler's brother-in-law, Wilfred Kellogg. Over the course of several years, Sadler and his assistants visited the man while he slept, conversing with him about spirituality, history, and cosmology, and asking him questions. A larger number of interested people met at Sadler's home to discuss the man's responses and to suggest additional questions. The man's words were eventually published in The Urantia Book, and the Urantia Foundation was created to assist Sadler in spreading the book's message. It is not known who wrote and edited the book, but several commentators have speculated that Sadler played a guiding role in its publication. Although it never became the basis of an organized religion, the book attracted followers who devoted themselves to its study, and the movement continued after Sadler's death.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of globular clusters remains a poorly understood <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> it remains uncertain whether {{the stars in}} a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{memorials}} {{commemorate the}} events and the casualties of World War I. These war memorials include civic memorials, larger national monuments, war cemeteries, private memorials {{and a range of}} utilitarian designs such as halls and parks, dedicated to remembering those involved in the conflict. Huge numbers of memorials were built in the 1920s and 1930s, with around 176,000 erected in France alone. This was a new social <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> marked a major cultural shift in how nations commemorated conflicts. Interest in World War I and its memorials faded after World War II, and did not increase again until the 1980s and 1990s, which saw the renovation of many existing memorials and the opening of new sites. Visitor numbers at many memorials increased significantly, while major national and civic memorials continue to be used for annual ceremonies remembering the war.|$|E
