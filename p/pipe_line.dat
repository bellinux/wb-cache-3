5|$|In the 1910s, several power {{companies}} built lines through the area. The General <b>Pipe</b> <b>Line</b> Company completed an oil pipeline connecting the San Joaquin Valley's Midway-Sunset Oil Field with the port at San Pedro in 1913. Its alignment followed the Ridge Route north of Gorman {{and south of}} Reservoir Summit, a longer distance {{than any of the}} earlier transportation routes, but from Gorman south to the present location of Pyramid Lake, where it turned east to Reservoir Summit, it roughly followed the later Ridge Route Alternate. That same year, the Midway Gas Company opened a natural gas line, and the Pacific Light and Power Company opened a power line, both staying fairly close to the entire Ridge Route.|$|E

In turn, the actual construction and operation of the pipelines would be carried out by the War Emergency Pipelines company (WEP), a non-profit corporation backed by a consortium of the largest oil companies in the United States: Atlantic Refining, Cities Service Oil, Consolidated Oil, Gulf Oil, Pan American Petroleum and Transportation, Standard Oil, Tidewater Associated Oil, Shell Oil, Socony-Vacuum Oil, Sun Oil and the Texas <b>Pipe</b> <b>Line</b> Company. The WEP was led by W. Alton Jones and Burt Hull, both with extensive backgrounds in the industry, with Oscar Wolfe as its chief engineer.

40|$|Abstract: Gas {{hydrates}} are ice like crystals, {{but they}} are different in structure. gas hydrates formation in gas transporting <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> causes clogging the <b>pipe</b> <b>lines,</b> and prevents transporting gas. therefore gas hydrates formation should be prevented because clogging price is high and it’s time- consuming. To stop gas hydrate formation in gas transporting <b>pipe</b> <b>lines,</b> chemical inhibitors are used. These inhibitors are divided into thermodynamic and synthetic inhibitors. Synthetic inhibitors are used with low density and prevents making and growing of crystal hydrates. This article will focus on analyzing synthetic inhibitors, and their function the task orders are as followed: 1. Synthetic investigation of hydrate formation with and without presence of inhibitor. 2. Using Kashchiev- Firozabad model and experimental data of gas transporting <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> for drawing synthetic graphs of gas hydrates formation with presence of synthetic inhibitors...|$|R
50|$|In {{the most}} {{prevalent}} system, the area under irrigation is divided into different blocks according to topography determined by contour plan. The water requirement for each block is determined, and <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> are designed for these blocks depending on the available head and required discharge. Field delivery chambers are then constructed on the distribution <b>pipe</b> <b>lines,</b> and valves are fitted to control {{the flow of the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>lines,</b> with flow from the main delivery chamber controlled by these valves. In this system, lines for lower fields have more discharge, because the force of gravity is greater, so water distribution can be unequal.|$|R

25|$|In 1947 an {{even bigger}} field opened at Leduc, 20 miles (32km) south of Edmonton, and in 1948 oil mining began at Redwater. Both these fields were overshadowed in {{importance}} in 1956 {{with the discovery of}} the Pembina field west of Edmonton. Other fields were discovered east of Grande Prairie and in central Alberta. From collection and distribution points near Edmonton the oil is sent by pipeline to refineries, some as distant as Sarnia, Toronto and Montreal to the east, Vancouver to the west, and especially the U.S. to the South. Interprovincial <b>Pipe</b> <b>Line</b> (IPL) began in 1949, transporting oil to refineries in the east.

25|$|From 1912 Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila ("Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company") — {{founded in}} 1909 by Weetman Pearson {{to develop the}} newly found Mexican oil fields, nationalized in 1938 as Pemex — also had its own tanker fleet. They quickly adopted Isherwood's new {{longitudinal}} framing system that allowed much larger ships and a simpler construction process. Just before World War I it owned a fleet of 20 tankers. Standard Oil did not participate directly in the newly discovered oil fields in Texas — such as Spindletop — and Oklahoma, which gave opportunities for new oil companies as Gulf Oil and Texas Fuel Company, later Texaco. Avoiding the use of Standard Oil's <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> system, they started using tankers to get their oil to the East Coast. In combination with the oil fields discovered in Mexico and Venezuela, this caused {{a rise in the}} demand for tankers, which gave opportunities for the first independents, such as the Norwegian Wilh. Wilhelmsen, that launched its first tanker in 1913.|$|E

He was also of the opinion that, as a newspaper editor, he would {{no longer be able to}} speak with the same freedom if he were in office. He advocated women's suffrage, and Western Australia was one of the early jurisdictions to give women the vote. He also strongly supported Forrest in his development policy, in the building of the <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> to the goldfields, and the making of Fremantle harbour. He was interesting himself very much in the Perth public library, museums, and national gallery of which he became president, and also in the proposed university. He was a prominent member of the Church of England, holding the offices of registrar of the Diocese of Perth and chancellor of St George's Cathedral. He declined a knighthood in 1902 but accepted it in 1911, and two years later was created KCMG.|$|E

40|$|The <b>line</b> <b>pipe</b> forming {{operation}} {{can be divided}} into two parts, first is to achieve the required shape in terms of curvature and ovality after formation of the <b>line</b> <b>pipe.</b> The curvature and ovality ultimately affects the final dimensional controls at the later stage i. e. after mechanical expansion of the <b>line</b> <b>pipe.</b> The second part is to make right welding joint geometry to make the final long seam weld of <b>line</b> <b>pipe.</b> The welding joint geome-try ultimately controls soundness of final seam weld at later stage i. e. during submerged arc welding of the <b>line</b> <b>pipe.</b> As far as curvature or shape of <b>line</b> <b>pipe</b> is concerned, important operation is making the required curvature along the edges of TMCP and ACC (Thermo mechanical controlled processing and accelerated cooling process) plate for <b>line</b> <b>pipe</b> (Plate Edge Crimping press) up to the 150 mm in width minimum and forming of the <b>line</b> <b>pipe</b> at J-C-O press.

40|$|Abstract—In {{the oil and}} gas industry, high {{pressure}} long distance <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> are widely used for efficient and effective movement of natural gas, oil and other petroleum products. The gases are transported at extremely high operating pressures that can range from 200 to 1600 PSI depending on the size and length of the <b>line</b> <b>pipe.</b> For operating safety, Hydrostatic test is used for confirming mechanical integrity of <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> and is applied to check for leakages before putting the <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> in use. The test aims to evaluate the point of failure of the material and assess the structural integrity of a welded pipe. In present work, an experiment is carried out to confirm weld integrity of two X 70 grade carbon steel pipes under the manufacturing process of hot rolling with left and right hand spiral plants. The tests are conducted at pressure in excess of the UTS of the steel / pipes and aimed to sustain the pressure as per API convention. Both the pipes attained the expected results; however the results of theoretical predicted pressure minutely diverge as the thickness variation is not considered...|$|R
