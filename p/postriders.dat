2500|$|The new law {{consisted}} of 56 sections and began by defining who was {{and who was}} not liable for militia duty. [...] All [...] "able-bodied free white male inhabitants of this State, {{between the ages of}} eighteen and forty-five years", were required to perform militia duty, subject to the following exemptions: [...] "Judges of the supreme and circuit courts, secretary of state, auditor and treasurer of the State, clerks of the supreme and circuit courts, postmasters who have the care of the mails of the United States, <b>postriders,</b> ferrymen on all public roads, and ministers of the gospel". [...] However, in addition to the compulsory service for all able bodied free white males, the law also authorized the raising of Volunteer Militia Companies for up to five years at a time. [...] Each regiment was authorized to raise up to three of these Volunteer Companies, one company each of Riflemen, Artillery and Cavalry. [...] The election of the officers of the Volunteer Companies was to be certified by the regimental commander. [...] The Volunteer Companies were to remain under the authority of the regiment from which they were formed and were subject to the same rules and regulations as all other militiamen except that the Volunteer Companies were authorized to select their own uniforms.|$|E
50|$|Post riders or <b>postriders</b> {{describes}} {{a horse and}} rider postal delivery system that existed at various times and various places throughout history. The term is usually reserved for instances where a network of regularly scheduled service was provided under some degree of central management by the State or State licensed monopoly.|$|E
50|$|While relay rider {{networks}} were a common feature of every ancient empire, these were {{primarily for the}} exclusive use of the government or military and carried no civil correspondence as a rule. What differentiated <b>postriders</b> from these earlier efforts {{was that they were}} open to the public and created for the public convenience. The other distinguishing feature was that post riders operated on a schedule.|$|E
50|$|During the 1920s, the 1920 definitives were {{gradually}} {{supplanted by}} a new series with a 3/4 profile of Gustav. In 1924, the Universal Postal Union celebrated its 50th anniversary and its Congress was held in Stockholm, so Sweden issued two series marking it, the first {{with a view of}} the Stockholm skyline, and the second with two designs; a <b>postrider</b> watching an airplane, and a carrier pigeon over a globe. Both sets were primarily aimed at collectors, but are nevertheless prized today.|$|R
60|$|We {{have before}} us {{a volume of}} {{autograph}} letters, chiefly of soldiers and statesmen of the Revolution, and addressed to a good and brave man, General Palmer, who himself drew his sword in the cause. They are profitable reading in a quiet afternoon, and in a mood withdrawn from too intimate relation with the present time; {{so that we can}} glide backward some three quarters of a century, and surround ourselves with the ominous sublimity of circumstances that then frowned upon the writers. To give them their full effect, we should imagine that these letters have this moment been brought to town by the splashed and way-worn <b>postrider,</b> or perhaps by an orderly dragoon, who has ridden in a perilous hurry to deliver his despatches. They are magic scrolls, if read in the right spirit. The roll of the drum and the fanfare of the trumpet is latent in some of them; and in others, an echo of the oratory that resounded in the old halls of the Continental Congress, at Philadelphia; or the words may come to us as with the living utterance of one of those illustrious men, speaking face to face, in friendly communion. Strange, that the mere identity of paper and ink should be so powerful. The same thoughts might look cold and ineffectual, in a printed book. Human nature craves a certain materialism and clings pertinaciously to what is tangible, as if that were of more importance than the spirit accidentally involved in it. And, in truth, the original manuscript has always something which print itself must inevitably lose. An erasure, even a blot, a casual irregularity of hand, and all such little imperfections of mechanical execution, bring us close to the writer, and perhaps convey some of those subtle intimations for which language has no shape.|$|R
