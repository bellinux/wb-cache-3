50|$|The <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> {{is made up}} {{of small}} piping that has {{numerous}} bends. Clogging of the piping may occur if the coolant system is not flushed or if the coolant is not changed regularly. If clogging occurs the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> will not work properly. If coolant flow is restricted, heating capacity will be reduced or even lost altogether if the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> becomes blocked. Control valves may also clog or get stuck.|$|R
50|$|Cars with dual climate {{function}} (allowing {{driver and}} passenger to each set a different temperature) may use a <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> split in two, where different amounts of coolant {{flow through the}} <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> on either side to obtain the desired heating.|$|R
50|$|A <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> {{is a small}} {{radiator}} located {{under the}} dashboard of the vehicle, and it consists of conductive aluminium or brass tubing with cooling fins to increase surface area. Hot coolant passing through the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> gives off heat {{before returning to the}} engine cooling circuit.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the engine}} has warmed up, the coolant is kept {{at a more}} or less {{constant}} temperature by the thermostat. The temperature of the air entering the vehicle's interior can be controlled by using a valve limiting the amount of coolant that goes through the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> Another method is blocking off the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> with a door, directing part (or all) of the incoming air around the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> completely, so it does not get heated (or re-heated if the air conditioning compressor is active). Some cars use a combination of these systems.|$|R

25|$|On many {{automobile}} engines, {{including all}} Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict {{flow to the}} <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> The passenger side tank of the radiator {{is used as a}} bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.|$|R
50|$|A {{system of}} valves or baffles, or both, is usually {{incorporated}} to simultaneously operate a small radiator inside the vehicle. This small radiator, {{and the associated}} blower fan, is called the <b>heater</b> <b>core,</b> and serves to warm the cabin interior. Like the radiator, the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> acts by removing heat from the engine. For this reason, automotive technicians often advise operators {{to turn on the}} heater and set it to high if the engine is overheating, to assist the main radiator.|$|R
50|$|Electrolysis {{can cause}} {{excessive}} corrosion {{leading to the}} <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> rupturing. Coolant will spray directly into the passenger compartment followed with white colored smoke, a significant driving hazard.|$|R
50|$|The {{squirrel}} cage {{fan of the}} vehicle's ventilation system forces air through the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> to transfer heat from the coolant to the cabin air, which is directed into the vehicle through vents at various points.|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> cools {{the heated}} coolant {{from the engine}} by {{transfering}} its heat to the cabin air, it can also act as an auxiliary radiator for the engine. If the radiator is working improperly, the operator may turn the heat on (together with the cabin blower fan placed on full speed, and with the windows opened) in the passenger cabin, resulting in a certain cooling effect on the overheated engine coolant. This idea only works to a certain degree, as the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> is not large enough nor does it have enough cold air going though it to cool large amounts of coolant significantly.|$|R
50|$|The 301 Turbo package (RPO code LU8) {{utilized}} {{air conditioning}} (C60) {{due to the}} turbo-specific <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> box, and automatic transmission (TH350 (non-lockup) for 1980, and THM350C (lock-up) for 1981) and 3.08 positraction rear axle ratio (G80).|$|R
50|$|Products {{manufactured}} {{from this}} plant include HVAC, EC modules, Evaporators, Radiators, Condensers, and <b>Heater</b> <b>cores.</b> Processes include Forming of coil stock, Nocolok and vacuum brazing, Tube welding, Injection molding, Stamping, Module assembly, Surface treatment, Testing, and Prototype build.|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> {{is usually}} located under the {{dashboard}} {{inside of the}} vehicle and is enclosed in the ventilation system's ducting, servicing it often requires disassembling {{a large part of}} the dashboard, which can be labour-intensive and therefore expensive.|$|R
2500|$|Block heaters {{that run}} {{directly}} on the vehicle's own gasoline or diesel fuel supply are also available; these do not require an external power source. The coolant is heated and circulated, usually by thermosiphon, through the engine and the vehicle's <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although the Vibe and Matrix {{are similar}} designs, the two brands {{actually}} use several different components, which are brand-specific, for their {{heating and air}} conditioning systems. These components include the air conditioning compressor and related hoses, the heater hoses, the <b>heater</b> <b>core,</b> and the serpentine belt.|$|R
2500|$|Separate to {{the latent}} heat {{accumulator}} is the Residual Heat function (activated by a button labelled [...] "REST"), {{which allows the}} demister and cabin heater to use the heat of an engine that has recently been turned off (using an electric pump to push hot coolant through the <b>heater</b> <b>core).</b>|$|R
25|$|One of {{the widest}} uses of heat {{exchangers}} is for air conditioning of buildings and vehicles. This class of heat exchangers is commonly called air coils, or just coils {{due to their}} often-serpentine internal tubing. Liquid-to-air, or air-to-liquid HVAC coils are typically of modified crossflow arrangement. In vehicles, heat coils are often called <b>heater</b> <b>cores.</b>|$|R
50|$|A larger radiator, <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> inlets and hoses were new, for {{improved}} coolant flow and heater performance. Door lock cylinders and ignition lock switches were also revised for greater theft protection. The standard 6.6 L (400 cid) V8 engine got a slight detuning for better fuel economy, while the 7.5 L V8 soldiered on {{for one more}} year.|$|R
50|$|In a car {{equipped}} with air conditioning, outside air is first forced {{through the air}} conditioner's evaporator coil. This {{can be thought of}} as a <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> filled with very cold gas, which cools rather than heats the incoming air. In order to obtain the desired temperature incoming air may first be cooled by the air conditioning and then heated again by the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> In a vehicle fitted with manual controls for the heater and air conditioning compressor, using both systems together will dehumidify the air in the cabin, as the evaporator coil removes moisture from the air due to condensation. This can result in increased air comfort levels inside the vehicle. Automatic temperature control systems can take the best course of action depending upon the external air temperature, the internal one and the cabin air temperature value or a rapid defrost effect requested by the user.|$|R
50|$|Although {{not part}} of the HSD as such, all HSD {{vehicles}} from the 2004 Prius onwards have been fitted with an electric air-conditioning compressor, instead of the conventional engine-driven type. This removes the need to continuously run the engine when cabin cooling is required. Two positive temperature coefficient heaters are fitted in the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> to supplement the heat provided by the engine.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{problem is}} a leak {{in one of the}} connections to the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> This may first be noticeable by smell (ethylene glycol is widely used as coolant and has a sweet smell); it may also cause (somewhat greasy) fogging of the windshield above the windshield heater vent. Glycol may also leak directly into the car, causing wet upholstery or carpeting.|$|R
50|$|The Roadster had no top or tonneau cover, and no {{provision}} or intention of having either. No automatic transmission was offered, only the manual 5-speed. A small <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> delivered warmth to the windshield for defrosting, since the US DOT requirements mandated it. There was no radio, no heater, no air conditioner, and further more {{no place to}} install any of those.|$|R
50|$|A <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> is a radiator-like device used in {{heating the}} cabin of a vehicle. Hot coolant from the vehicle's engine is {{passed through a}} winding tube of the core, a heat {{exchanger}} between coolant and cabin air. Fins attached to the core tubes serve to increase surface for heat transfer to air that is forced past them, by a fan, thereby heating the passenger compartment.|$|R
50|$|Engine cooling {{systems can}} also have bleed screws. They can {{take the form of}} a bolt with a hole through the middle that is {{threaded}} into a hole on the vehicle's cylinder head. This hole goes into the water jacket of the cylinder head. In other designs, the bleed screw is placed in the uppermost hose which leads to the <b>heater</b> <b>core,</b> i.e. at the highest point of the cooling system.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine in most cars and trucks is cooled by a water and antifreeze mixture that is circulated through the engine and radiator by a water pump to enable the radiator to give off engine heat to the atmosphere. Some of that water can be diverted through the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> to give some engine heat to the cabin, or adjust {{the temperature of the}} conditioned air.|$|R
50|$|In its short life, the XR4Ti {{had some}} minor changes either by design or by {{implemented}} Technical Service Bulletins. Examples include: monochromatic paint (red, black, and white), uprated <b>heater</b> <b>cores,</b> larger rear hatch glass (in {{conjunction with the}} single rear wing), improved steering rack, upgraded dash construction, etc. Many of these parts {{were taken from the}} Sierra Mk.II body shell which was only sold in continental Europe with some being Merkur-specific parts. Most of these changes occurred in the 1987 model year.|$|R
50|$|For primary defogging, heat is {{generally}} {{provided by the}} vehicle's engine coolant via the heater core; fresh air is blown through the <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> and then ducted to and distributed over the interior surface of the windshield by a blower. This air is in many cases first dehumidified by passing it through the vehicle's operating air conditioning evaporator. Such dehumidification makes the defogger more effective and faster, for the dried air has a greater capacity to absorb water from the glass at which it is directed.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common example of purely {{mechanical}} thermostat technology in use today is {{the internal combustion engine}} cooling system thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air-cooled radiator. This type of thermostat operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature. The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax. Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range. On many automobile engines, including all Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict flow to the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> The passenger side tank of the radiator is used as a bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b> This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.|$|R
50|$|As {{was typical}} of early front wheel drive cars, the 1000 {{featured}} inboard drum brakes up front to reduce unsprung suspension weight and an easier implementation of an independent front suspension (but atypically Subaru would retain this unusual design into the seventies). Other unique features of the 1000 were a lack of a <b>heater</b> <b>core,</b> the heating system took its warmth directly from the radiator, and a hybrid suspension system that used torsion bars in combination with coil springs (much like the front suspension of the Subaru 360).|$|R
5000|$|Another {{problem area}} for late 450 SLs and early 380 SLs was the {{automatic}} climate control system. Based on a [...] "servo", which controlled coolant {{flow to the}} <b>heater</b> <b>core,</b> as well as vacuum to actuate the vents {{in the interior of}} the car, the system proved unreliable. It was installed on 450 SLs from 1976 through end of production in 1980, and continued on the 1981 MY of the 380 SL. Models produced prior to 1976 had a manual climate control system, models produced after 1981 received a more reliable automatic climate control system.|$|R
40|$|Two SAFE 30 modules {{were tested}} to {{determinate}} the thermal conductivity {{efficiency of the}} tri-cusps filled between the heat pipe and the <b>heater</b> <b>cores.</b> The modules consisted of four one-inch diameter tubes with heaters joined to an empty 1 inch diam. tube. The test was conducted on a vacuum chamber with 4 configurations: tri-cusps filled with and without radiation shielding and non-filled tri-cusps with and without radiation shielding. The tri-cusps material helps the bonding of the heat pipe to the four electric <b>heater</b> <b>cores,</b> filling {{the gap between the}} pipes. The baseline configuration is a brazed joint between the pipe. The test consisted of controlling the power applied to the heaters until a set surface temperature is reach. The temperatures varied between a max. of 800 C to 500 C. Test data, input energy and chamber surface temperature from each individual test, was used as boundary conditions for the model. Nodes located on the same location as the test thermocouples were plotted again test data to determinate the accuracy of the analysis. The unknown n variables on the analysis are the radiation emissivity of the pipe and chamber and the radiation view factor between the module and the chamber. A correlation was determined using a parametric analysis varying the surface emissivity and view factor until a good match was reach...|$|R
50|$|The use {{of water}} cooling carries {{the risk of}} damage from freezing. Automotive and many other engine cooling {{applications}} {{require the use of}} a water and antifreeze mixture to lower the freezing point to a temperature unlikely to be experienced. Antifreeze also inhibits corrosion from dissimilar metals and can increase the boiling point, allowing a wider range of water cooling temperatures. Its distinctive odor also alerts operators to cooling system leaks and problems that would go unnoticed in a water-only cooling system. The heated coolant mixture {{can also be used to}} warm the air conditioning system inside the car by means of the <b>heater</b> <b>core.</b>|$|R
50|$|Water coolers for desktop {{computers}} were, {{until the end}} of the 1990s, homemade. They were made from car radiators (or more commonly, a car's <b>heater</b> <b>core),</b> aquarium pumps and home-made water blocks, laboratory-grade PVC and silicone tubing and various reservoirs (homemade using plastic bottles, or constructed using cylindrical acrylic or sheets of acrylic, usually clear) and or a T-Line. More recently a growing number of companies are manufacturing water-cooling components compact enough to fit inside a computer case. This, and the trend to CPUs of higher power dissipation, has greatly increased the popularity of water cooling, although only a very small minority of computers are water-cooled.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} time, Ford offered seat belts as a dealer option (not factory installed, with {{instructions}} {{provided by a}} Service Bulletin). Also new for 1955 was Ford's first factory installed air conditioner. This “Select Aire” option featured an integrated <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> and evaporator coil unit within the dash and cold air discharge vents located {{on top of the}} dash [...] {{on either side of the}} radio speaker. The [...] "Select Aire" [...] design was carried over to the 1956 models [...] with slightly different cold air vents in the same location as on the 1955 models. The condenser was mounted in front of the radiator as in later cars.|$|R
2500|$|In 1938, Nash Motors {{developed}} the first automobile heater warmed by hot engine cooling water, and using fresh air. This [...] "Conditioned Air System" [...] {{is characterized by}} a cowl-mounted outside air receiver that passes fresh air through a <b>heater</b> <b>core</b> utilizing hot engine coolant for a heat source. The Nash system also pioneered the use of slight pressurization within the passenger compartment to eliminate the infiltration of cold outside air during winter use. This was a fan-boosted filtered ventilation and heating for the passengers, not the modern meaning of an [...] "air conditioning" [...] system. Nash was also the first automobile to make use of a disposable filter in the air-intake to clean incoming air.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe puffing and micro-explosion of {{a single}} burning droplet {{comprised}} of neat diesel, rapeseed methyl ester (RME); binary fuel mixtures of diesel–ethanol, diesel–RME, RME–ethanol; and ternary microemulsion of these fuel blends at various compositions have been studied using high speed backlight imaging method. Fuel droplet was suspended {{on the tip of}} a 130 μm gauge thermocouple and it was ignited using a glow <b>plug</b> <b>heater.</b> Based on the temporal variation of droplet projected area, the characteristics of fuel droplets studied were classified into smooth burning, puffing and explosion. A ternary plot has been proposed to identify the mixture composition of the blends that can result in smooth burning, puffing and explosion. Micro-explosion phenomenon was observed in the ternary blends with ethanol percentages between 10 % and 40 %. Secondary droplets resulted from the puffing and explosion of suspended parent droplet were observed to undergo further explosion. The time scales associated with complete disintegration of secondary droplets are found to be comparable to the mixing and the chemical reaction time scales of sprays in diesel engines...|$|R
