5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> <b>coverage.</b> In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E

40|$|The 1984 Canada Health Act {{does not}} require that the provinces subsidize <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs.</b> Many provinces do, however, provide {{categorical}} coverage to the elderly, social assistance recipients and others, although the generosity of coverage is highly variable.

40|$|The Medicare <b>Prescription</b> <b>Drug,</b> Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 forced {{individuals}} who qualify for Medicare and Medicaid, known as dual eligibles, to shift their <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> from Medicaid to Medicare Part D. Under Medicaid, dual eligibles received expansive coverage. Medicare Part D, however, presented several problems for dual eligibles, including less expansive drug formularies, higher copayments, and a difficult to navigate market where dual eligibles selected their insurance plans. This thesis evaluates {{the role of}} the National Governors Association (NGA) and state budgets in influencing the outcome of the switch in coverage for dual eligibles.

40|$|On 8 December 2011, Québec’s Minister of Health and Social Services {{amended the}} province’s Pharmacy Act by {{introducing}} Bill 41 to expand pharmacists’ role in patient care.

Bill 41 aims to increase access to health care and reduce physician wait times by extending the scope of pharmacist services to mirror that of physicians (e. g., modify the form of the medication and its dosage). The reform is currently pending due to disputes between the Ministry of Health and Social Services and the Quebec Association of Pharmacy Owners over remuneration for pharmacists. Should Bill 41 come into force, it is unclear whether the expansion of pharmacists’ roles, which in principle would duplicate physician services, should be considered part of the public basket of medically necessary care. Current negotiations suggest that only those with public coverage will also be covered for expanded services thereby placing equity of finance for those with private insurance in question...|$|R
