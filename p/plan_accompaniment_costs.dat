An ensemble of water sounds, woodblocks, and other unpitched percussion accurately mark the seconds, minutes, quarters, and night-watch (更籌) between 03:57:36 and 04:16:48 {{at the start of}} the solar period jingzhe (驚蟄) (ca. 6 March—the date of the world premiere in 2012). As the seconds start ticking, an offstage voice sings verses chanted by the 'human cockcrow' (雞人) above the Song palace gates before daybreak."A second ensemble of high voice, panpipes, ocarinas, membrane flutes, mouth organs, zithers, bells, chimes, and other percussion, play the festive odes 'Yü li' (魚麗) and 'Nan you jia yü' (南有嘉魚) from the ancient Book of Songs (詩經), using melodies, ornaments, orchestration, instrumental ranges, seating <b>plan,</b> <b>accompaniment,</b> and tuning systems documented in Song and later sources. The odes are sung in Late Middle Chinese pronunciation, and conceal a second 'clock' in broad 4/2 superimposed on the rapid 3/4 of the first."The third ensemble executes a series of quarter-tone glissandi that are geometrically exact musical transcriptions of seven characters from the Song Emperor Huizong’s (宋徽宗) 'Slender Gold' calligraphy (瘦金體), chosen to form seven of the eight words of a Tang emperor’s verse in praise of a clock: 「制器垂象，永鑒無惑」. [...] The missing eighth character is replaced by Huizong's imperial cipher, 'First Man Under Heaven' (天下一人). [...] These glissandi are metrically aligned with the first 'clock' in 3/4, but to all intents and purposes come across as completely ametrical."The 'clocks' start in steady time, gradually accelerate as if mounting in panic, then slowly unwind, a breakdown which finally drags odes, clocks, and signature into silence with it. Emperor Huizong was a great artist, but traditionally denigrated as an incompetent ruler (昏君) responsible for the destruction of his dynasty. The great astronomical clock (渾天) of Kaifeng was dismantled and looted when the city fell to Tartar invaders in 1127." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the work is}} to explicit the best practices in the development of integrated curricular programs that emphasize the construction of the competency in information of the students, based on the concept of information literacy. The essential elements and practices to the establishment, <b>planning,</b> implementation, <b>accompaniment</b> and evaluation of the programs in schools and faculties are listed. The dimensions involved are examined: the educational dimension, where are explored the social and political role of education and educational institutions; the curricular dimension, translated in objectives and actions toward the integrated courses(transdisciplinarity) and the resource-based learning; the dimension of pedagogic practices, towards problems resolution and research projects, the evaluation process, directed to competency in information. The concept is defined upon a socio-cognitive constructionist view, developed in apprentices and teachers, integrated in the curriculum. The dissemination of the best practices is essential to the sustainability of educational programs that aim at the competency in information...|$|R

It was planned that the Wakatake-class ships should have names, but upon completion they were given numbers. This proved to be extremely unpopular with the crews and was a constant source of confusion in communications, so in 1928, names were assigned.|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{is one of}} the {{diseases}} with a higher social and sanitary impact and therefore, it {{is one of the}} priorities in the service we provide. The success of the interventions with people suffering from diabetes lies in the efficacy of the pharmacological treatments as well as in the change of lifestyles and the different confrontations how these patients face their process. Health workers feel quite frustrated as a result of the slight success of our actions to achieve them to follow an adequate diet, make physical exercise or improve their self-sufficiency and self control when dealing with the different situations that should be faced because of diabetes. For such reason, the primary care professionals from Guadalhorce valley Sanitary District applied several different interventions from those generally used for many years. These intensive interventions will consist on eight group sessions of diabetological education, <b>planning</b> and <b>accompaniment</b> at the physical exercises and patients will also receive personalized diet advice; the intervention will be developed during three months, and afterward the level of glycosylated haemoglobin will be measured in order to see if it has improved. Therefore, we are going to evaluate in an objective way the effectiveness of this intensive intervention comparing it to the habitual intervention followed in Primary Health Care...|$|R
40|$|M. Cur. Over {{the years}} the field {{and scope of the}} Registered Tutor in South Africa has become more comprehensive. The nurse tutor's {{activities}} have extended from just the preparation of school leavers who entered professional training to the formal education of nurses at all levels of basic, post-basic and post-graduate nursing programmes and informal education, to highly experienced professional nurses in in-service and informal continuing education programmes. The nurse tutor's educational duties cover both the classroom and the various fields of nursing practice. She is therefore concerned with the educative process at a variety of levels. In the clinical teaching situation she might have to participate in health education activities for patients, clients and relatives and educate future and newly qualified nurse practitioners to fulfil their role as health educators, as well as instructors of students, pupils and assistant nurses. To some extent she also participates in the education of other health service personnel either at formal or at clinical instruction level. Since 1986 the nurse tutor's scope has further extended with the institution of the comprehensive four-year course. Her administrative functions namely <b>planning,</b> organisation, <b>accompaniment</b> and evaluation contributes to her main function teaching. The new course provides for the opportunity to use a variety of teaching methods besides the traditional lecture method. Also, she participates in curriculum building as well as the planning of her own syllabus. She now also has a greater input in the clinical field by guiding the students...|$|R

It was merely an experiment on Lynch's part because he wanted to see his paintings move.|$|R
40|$|Borderline {{personality}} disorder (BPD) {{is a serious}} and complex mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 5. 9 %, characterized by pervasive difficulties with emotion regulation, impulse control, and instability in interpersonal relationships and self-image. Impairments in interpersonal functioning {{have always been a}} prominent characteristic of BPD, indicating a need for research to identify the specific interpersonal processes that are problematic for diagnosed individuals. Previous research has concentrated on self-report questionnaires, unidirectional tests, and experimental paradigms wherein the exchange of social signals between individuals was not the focus. We propose joint musical improvisation as an alternative method to investigate interpersonal processes. Using a novel, carefully <b>planned,</b> ABA' <b>accompaniment</b> paradigm, and taking into account the possible influences of mood, psychotropic medication, general attachment, and musical sophistication, we recorded piano improvisations of 16 BPD patients and 12 matched healthy controls. We hypothesized that the insecure attachment system associated with BPD would be activated in the joint improvisation and manifest in measures of timing behavior. Results indicated that a logistic regression model, built on differences in timing deviations, predicted diagnosis with 82 % success. More specifically, {{over the course of the}} improvisation B section (freer improvisation), controlsâ timing deviations decreased (temporal synchrony became more precise) whereas that of the patients with BPD did not, confirming our hypothesis. These findings are in accordance with previous research, where BPD is characterized by difficulties in attachment relationships such as maintaining strong attachment with others, but it is novel to find empirical evidence of such issues in joint musical improvisation. We suggest further longitudinal research within the field of music therapy, to study how recovery of these timing habits are related to attachment experiences and interpersonal functioning in general. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Belgian {{mental health}} care is {{currently}} reforming towards a balanced care that is more community based. The realization of this reform requires specific attention to self‐care, empowerment, participation and full‐citizenship of people with a psychiatric vulnerability. All these elements {{are part of the}} vision and practice of recovery. With this research we aim to evaluate the extent to which residential services for long stay operate according to recovery oriented practices. Methods: We performed a Recovery Oriented Practices Index (ROPI) in eight residential services in Belgium. This ROPI instrument provides an overall view on several aspects of the functioning of a service with respect to the attitude towards recovery: such as the degree of fulfilling basic care needs or participation of patients {{in the development of the}} treatment plan. A ROPI consists of four interviews with different panels (patients, managers, practitioners and members of the accompaniment team) as well as a study of service documents (brochures etc.) and anonymous treatment plans. An integration of the collected data allows the scoring of eight scales for each service. Results: Most team members spend a sufficient amount of time and personal attention to the residents. However, in some cases the perspective of the patient himself is not taken into account in the determination of patient needs. Patient participation is rather exceptional in the ins <b>accompaniment</b> <b>plans,</b> in the determination of the wishes and good qualities of the patient and in the use of crisis measures. Furthermore, none of the services used shared decision making in the illness management of the patients. The organization of groups of recovery work or mutual support, knowing to improve empowerment, is rare. Discussion: There is still work to be done to ensure patient participation, empowerment and respect for the patient perspective in the residential services. A possible intervention is to offer training in recovery oriented practices to team members and managers of residential services for long stay.

40|$|This paper 1 {{will not}} tell you much about medieval or modern Irish oral tradition, {{although}} {{there is much to}} be said on the subject. Indeed, my contribution was originally <b>planned</b> as an <b>accompaniment</b> to a talk by Dr. Kevin O’Nolan of University College, Dublin, who had been invited by Professor Foley to share with you some of his groundbreaking researches into the oral compositional nature of some of our medieval Irish texts; most regrettably, Dr. O’Nolan was unable to accept the invitation owing to poor health. 2 My own interests center not so much on the realities of Irish oral tradition as on the conceptualizations of “oral composition ” and “literary composition ” that {{are to be found in}} the texts produced by the rich scribal culture of Ireland between the sixth and sixteenth centuries A. D. The Irish literati and semi-literati, like any other people faced with the prospect of writing, theorized about and agonized over the repercussions of the shift from the oral mode of verifying and perpetuating cultural “truth ” to the written mode of so doing, a shift of which these elite members of their society were keenly aware. Most scholars in the tight, arcane little fi eld of medieval Irish studies, as those of you who are so generous with your time as to have gained acquaintance with it may know, have until recently not paid much attention to this problem of transition that so racked the minds of the medieval Irish. Thanks, however, to the work of O’Nolan, Proinsias Mac Cana, Seán Ó Coileáin, Edgar Slotkin, and others, 3 we have become more sensitive to the oral-versus-literary tension that provides a key subtext to so many of the medieval Irish texts Celticists have been mulling over philologically for the past hundred years. One could now even propose a radical re-evaluation of medieval Irish literature in the wake of our being made aware of this clash of communicative legitimacies, going so far as to say (at least to an audience of kindly and indulgent non-Celticists) that most of what “happens ” in these literary texts, on the levels of both form and content, is directly and even self-consciously expressive of this clash. Such dialectical self-refl exivity i...|$|R
