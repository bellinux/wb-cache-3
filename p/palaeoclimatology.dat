They grew in columns, with an observed maximum of six in each, {{and the number of}} columns varied based on the animal's size. Known column counts for the two species are: 51 to 53columns per maxilla and 48 to 49 per dentary (teeth of the upper jaw being slightly narrower than those in the lower jaw) for E. regalis; and 52columns per maxilla and 44 per dentary for E. annectens (an E. saskatchewanensis specimen).|$|E

2500|$|The {{most prestigious}} of these awards are the Gold Medals (Founder's Medal 1830 and the Patron's Medal 1838). The award is given for [...] "the {{encouragement}} {{and promotion of}} geographical science and discovery", and are approved by Queen Elizabeth II. The awards originated as an annual gift of fifty guineas from King William IV, first made in 1831, [...] "to constitute a premium for the encouragement and promotion of geographical science and discovery". The Society decided in 1839 to change this monetary award into two gold medals: Founder’s Medal and the Patron’s. The award {{has been given to}} notable geographers including David Livingstone (1855), Nain Singh Rawat (1876), Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen (1878), Alfred Russel Wallace (1892), and Frederick Courtney Selous (1893) to more recent winners including Percy Harrison Fawcett (1916), Professor William Morris Davis (1919), Sir Halford John Mackinder (1945), Professor L. Dudley Stamp (1949), Professor Richard Chorley (1987) and Professor David Harvey (1995). In 2004 Harish Kapadia was awarded the Patron's Medal for contributions to geographical discovery and mountaineering in the Himalayas, making him the second Indian to receive the award in its history. In 2005 the Founder's Medal was awarded to Professor Sir Nicholas Shackleton for his research in the field of Quaternary <b>Palaeoclimatology</b> and the Patron's Medal was awarded to Professor Jean Malaurie for a lifelong study of the Arctic and its people.
