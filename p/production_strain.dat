40|$|A “second-generation” <b>production</b> <b>strain</b> {{was derived}} from a Corynebacterium glutamicum {{pantothenate}} producer by rational design to assess its potential to synthesize and accumulate the vitamin pantothenate by batch cultivation. The new pantothenate <b>production</b> <b>strain</b> carries a deletion of the ilvA gene to abolish isoleucine synthesis, the promoter down-mutation P-ilvEM 3 to attenuate ilvE gene expression and thereby increase ketoisovalerate availability, and two compatible plasmids to overexpress the ilvBNCD genes and duplicated copies of the panBC operon. Production assays in shake flasks revealed that the P-ilvEM 3 mutation and the duplication of the panBC operon had cumulative effects on pantothenate production. During pH-regulated batch cultivation, accumulation of 8 mM pantothenate was achieved, which is the highest value reported for C. glutamicum. Metabolic flux analysis during the fermentation demonstrated that the P-ilvEM 3 mutation successfully reoriented the carbon flux towards pantothenate biosynthesis. Despite this repartition of the carbon flux, ketoisovalerate not converted to pantothenate was excreted by the cell and dissipated as by-products (ketoisocaproate, dl- 2, 3,-dihydroxy-isovalerate, ketopantoate, pantoate), which are indicative of saturation of the pantothenate biosynthetic pathway. Genome-wide expression analysis of the <b>production</b> <b>strain</b> during batch cultivation was performed by whole-genome DNA microarray hybridization and agglomerative hierarchical clustering, which detected the enhanced expression of genes involved in leucine biosynthesis, in serine and glycine formation, in regeneration of methylenetetrahydrofolate, in de novo synthesis of nicotinic acid mononucleotide, and in a complete pathway of acyl coenzyme A conversion.

Continuous experiments with cell retention, repetitive fed-batch, and an in situ product recovery (ISPR) process with fully integrated electrodialysis were tested. Although the continuous approach achieved a high volumetric productivity (Q(P)) of 110 g L- 1 d(- 1), this approach was not pursued because of long-term <b>production</b> <b>strain</b> instabilities.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{bacterium}} Bacillus subtilis, {{which is}} not a natural riboflavin overproducer, has been converted into an excellent <b>production</b> <b>strain</b> by classical mutagenesis and metabolic engineering. To our knowledge, the enhancement of riboflavin excretion from the cytoplasm of overproducing cells has not yet been considered as a target for (further) strain improvement. Here we evaluate the flavin transporter RibM from Streptomyces davawensis with respect to improvement of a riboflavin <b>production</b> <b>strain.</b> Results The gene ribM from S. davawensis, coding for a putative facilitator of riboflavin uptake, was codon optimized (ribM opt) for expression in B. subtilis. The gene ribM opt was functionally introduced into B. subtilis using the isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) -inducible expression plasmid pHT 01 : Northern-blot analysis of total RNA from IPTG treated recombinant B. subtilis cells revealed a ribM opt specific transcript. Western blot analysis showed that the his 6 -tagged heterologous gene product RibM was present in the cytoplasmic membrane. Expression of ribM in Escherichia coli increased [14 C]riboflavin uptake, which was not affected by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m -chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Expression of ribM opt supported growth of a B. subtilis Δ ribB ::Erm r Δ ribU ::Kan r double mutant deficient in riboflavin synthesis (Δ ribB) and also deficient with respect to riboflavin uptake (Δ ribU). Expression of ribM opt increased roseoflavin (a toxic riboflavin analog produced by S. davawensis) sensitivity of a B. subtilis Δ ribU ::Kan r strain. Riboflavin synthesis by a model riboflavin B. subtilis <b>production</b> <b>strain</b> overproducing RibM was increased significantly depending on the amount of the inducer IPTG. Conclusions The energy independent flavin facilitator RibM could in principle catalyze riboflavin export and thus may be useful to increase the riboflavin yield in a riboflavin production process using a recombinant RibM overproducing B. subtilis strain (or any other microorganism). </p...|$|E
40|$|A novel fed-batch {{approach}} {{for the production}} of L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) with recombinant E. coli is presented concerning the on-line control of the key fermentation parameters glucose and tyrosine. Two different <b>production</b> <b>strains</b> possessing either the tyrosine feedback resistant aroF(fbr) (encoding tyrosine feedback resistant DAHP-synthase (3 -desoxy-D-arabino-heptusonate- 7 -phosphate)) or the wild-type aroF(wt) were used as model systems to elucidate the necessity of finding an individual process optimum for each genotype. With the aid of tyrosine control, wild-type aroF(wt) could be used for L-Phe production achieving higher final L-Phe titers (34 g/L) than the aroF(fbr) strain (28 g/L) and providing higher DAHP-synthase activities. With on-line glucose control, an optimum glucose concentration of 5 g/L could be identified that allowed a sufficient carbon supply for L-Phe production {{while at the same time}} an overflow metabolism leading to acetate by-product formation was avoided.

In industrial processes predominantly the gram+ species Corynebacterium is used, especially Corynebacterium glutamicum.
