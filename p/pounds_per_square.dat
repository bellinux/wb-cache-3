Shortly after that, crew members raised the orbiter's cabin pressure from 10.2 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch to 14.7 psi. The cabin's pressure was lowered {{in the event}} that a problem during the mating process necessitated an emergency spacewalk.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{widespread}} {{standards for}} pressure measurement of diving gas. In the USA {{and perhaps a}} few other places the pressure is measured in <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch (psi), {{and the rest of}} the world uses bar. Sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units, such as kilopascal (kPa) or megapascal (MPa), or in atmospheres (atm, or ATA), particularly gauges not actually used underwater.|$|E
5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw {{the introduction of}} a Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at 5 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch (34kPa; 0.34 bar) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger, and was fitted to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was fitted to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then {{standard}} 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cuin) displacement: the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch (141kPa; 1.44atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400m), 1,285 horsepower (958kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800m) and 1,320 horsepower (984kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700m) and 1,160 horsepower (865kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100m).|$|E
5|$|John Kadlec of Beta Engineering {{originally}} planned {{the use of}} 8-inch HCS, which he specified could withstand 120 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> foot, a load which exceeded specifications on all 8-inch HCS. During the bidding process, the owners were advised by a bidder, Precon, that the specified load could not be handled by the HCS without reinforcements from a composite concrete topping. However, Kadlec advised the owners that the plans called for 8-inch HCS which could withstand the load without reinforcement from topping. The contract was thus awarded to Coreslab, despite Coreslab's design tables indicating that the specified project loads were 38% higher than the maximum load. In 1992, over {{a decade after the}} mall's construction, Coreslab retracted the claim to be able to support the load without the use of a composite topping.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of solid mechanics, torsion is the {{twisting}} of an object due to an applied torque. Torsion is expressed in newton <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> meter (Pa) or <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> inch (psi) while torque is expressed in newton metres (N·m) or foot-pound force (ft·lbf). In sections perpendicular to the torque axis, the resultant shear stress in this section is perpendicular to the radius.|$|R

5|$|Steam is {{provided}} by an elderly Marshall portable boiler– essentially a portable engine without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by steam generator. It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being {{passed on to the}} Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). The boiler provides steam at 50 <b>Pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and the other from Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board. Along with the boiler in the outdoor courtyard area are a waterwheel pump unit built by G. H. Harris of Wadebridge, a Lee Howl pump and Lister deep well pump.|$|E

2500|$|Snails {{tend not}} to breed when packed too densely or when the [...] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime {{apparently}} works like a pheromone and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and {{they also have a}} higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. Dwarfing is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than heredity factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for H. aspersa is not more than one-third <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> foot (3.6kg/m²) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1gram and not more than 0.2 <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> foot (2.2kg/m²) for snails that weigh less.

25|$|The {{dimension}} of stress {{is that of}} pressure, and therefore its coordinates are commonly measured in the same units as pressure: namely, pascals (Pa, that is, newtons per square metre) in the International System, or <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch (psi) in the Imperial system. Because mechanical stresses easily exceed a million Pascals, MPa, which stands for megapascal, is a common unit of stress.|$|E
25|$|Both {{systems of}} measure were {{widely used in}} {{mechanical}} engineering, though not in electrical engineering. Some units of measure such as the horsepower or the British thermal unit (BTU) have special names {{but by and large}} unit names are generated from their constituent components – for example, <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch. In contrast, the metric system has a special name for pressure—the pascal.|$|E
25|$|As one descends, in {{addition}} to the normal atmospheric pressure at the surface, the water exerts increasing hydrostatic pressure of approximately 1 bar (14.7 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch) for every 10m (33 feet) of depth. The pressure of the inhaled breath must balance the surrounding or ambient pressure to allow inflation of the lungs. It becomes virtually impossible to breathe air at normal atmospheric pressure through a tube below three feet under the water.|$|E

50|$|The SI {{unit for}} {{pressure}} is the pascal (Pa), equal to one newton <b>per</b> <b>square</b> metre (N·m−2 or kg·m−1·s−2). This special {{name for the}} unit was added in 1971; before that, pressure in SI was expressed in units such as N·m−2. When indicated, the zero reference is stated in parenthesis following the unit, for example 101 kPa (abs). The <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch (psi) is still in widespread use in the US and Canada, for measuring, for instance, tire pressure. A letter is often appended to the psi unit to indicate the measurement's zero reference; psia for absolute, psig for gauge, psid for differential, although this practice is discouraged by the NIST.|$|R
2500|$|A single boiler, {{originally}} wood-fired, generated steam at 90 <b>pounds</b> pressure <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch, {{although it}} seems that pressure of up to 125 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> inch was possible.

25|$|To reduce {{errors in}} sensing {{attitude}} and velocity, designers cut friction {{to a minimum}} in the platform gyros and accelerometers by floating the bearings on a thin film of dry nitrogen. The nitrogen was supplied from a sphere holding 2 cu ft (56.6 l) of gas at 3,000 psig (<b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch gauge, i.e. psi above one atmosphere) (20,7 MPa). This sphere is 21inches (0,53 m) in diameter and is mounted at location 22, {{to the left of}} the ST-124-M3. Gas from the supply sphere passes through a filter, a pressure regulator, and a heat exchanger before flowing through the bearings in the stable platform.|$|E
25|$|Airy was {{consulted}} about wind {{speeds and}} pressures {{likely to be}} encountered on the proposed Forth suspension bridge being designed by Thomas Bouch for the North British Railway in the late 1870s. He thought that pressures no greater than about 10 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> foot could be expected, a comment Bouch took to mean also applied to the first Tay railway bridge then being built. Much greater pressures, however, can be expected in severe storms. Airy was called to give evidence before the Official Inquiry into the Tay Bridge disaster, and was criticised for his advice. However, little was known {{about the problems of}} wind resistance of large structures, and a Royal Commission on Wind Pressure was asked to conduct research into the problem.|$|E
25|$|Contracts totaling $31,100,000 were {{finalized}} with McShain and {{the other}} contractors on September 11, and ground was broken for the Pentagon the same day. Among the design requirements, Somervell required the structural design to accommodate floor loads of up to 150 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> foot, which was done in case the building became a records storage facility at some time {{after the end of}} the current war. A minimal amount of steel was used as it was in short supply during World War II. Instead, the Pentagon was built as a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the Potomac River, and a lagoon was created beneath the Pentagon's river entrance. To minimize steel usage, concrete ramps were built rather than installing elevators. Indiana limestone was used for the building's façade.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Research {{explains}} that the Sun is 93 million miles away and its light takes 8 minutes to reach the earth. Light from the next closest star, Alpha Centauri, takes more than 4 years to get to us at a speed greater than 186,000 miles per second. The sun weighs the same as 330,000 earths and is 95% hydrogen and helium gas and not solid. The Sun is compressed by gravity so tightly that the gas at the center is more than 100 times heavier than water with a pressure of one billion tons <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch while the surface is about one <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch.

5000|$|J. Baldwin {{invented a}} permanent, transparent, {{insulated}} geodesic dome — using {{a framework of}} aluminum tubing, covered with argon-filled laminated vinyl sheet [...] "pillows" [...] — which he dubbed the [...] "Pillow Dome," [...] said to have withstood 135-mph winds and thirty inches of snow. [...] The structure weighed just one-half <b>pound</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> foot of floor space. [...] For {{a variety of reasons}} including durability and toxicity concerns from vinyl chloride vapor emitted by vinyl sheeting, Baldwin later recommended the use of ETFE film; ETFE had further advantages including transparency and ease of keeping the surface clean, but its ultraviolet transparency reduces its suitability for occupied structures. Baldwin intentionally did not patent his invention. The basic approach has since been applied in large-scale applications such as the Eden Project in Cornwall, England.|$|R
25|$|Maintenance of {{adequate}} tire inflation {{is the most}} frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by goat's heads and other burs, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.|$|E
25|$|The tunnel was {{constructed}} using a TBM, originating from the Strawberry Portal and mining at a slight downhill gradient of approximately 18 feet per 100 linear feet (0.25%). Much like the West Tunnel, the TBM {{in the east}} tunnel encountered water-bearing strata of metamorphic and granitic rock. The presence of water, coupled with {{the depth of the}} tunnel below the surface, up to 2,100 feet underground, forced the tunneling team to deal with water pressures in the tunnel heading in excess of 200 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch. Also, much like the West tunnel mining efforts, the TBM had to traverse branches of the San Andreas fault, and on one occasion in late 2006, the TBM became stuck as mining efforts approached some particularly difficult ground. Hand-mining efforts above the TBM shield were eventually employed to free the stuck machine. The tunnel was completed in May 2008 with the installation of pipeline being completed in 2009.|$|E
25|$|During construction, many {{problems}} were encountered in scaling up the WAGR design. Problems {{with the construction}} of the pressure vessel liner had distorted it, so that the boilers, which were to fit in an annular space between the reactor and the pressure vessel, could not be installed, and the liner had to be partially dismantled and rebuilt. This work only cost about £200,000, but there was a huge cost of financing for an extra 18 unproductive months a power station costing around £100 million, of which some 60% was already on the ground. Serious problems were also discovered with the design of the boilers, which had to withstand the pounding of hot carbon dioxide (CO2), pressurised to 600 <b>pounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch (4.1 megapascals) and pumped around the reactor coolant circuit by massive gas circulators, and the casings, hangers and tube supports all had to be redesigned. The cost of these modifications, and financing during the delays, caused severe financial pressures for the consortium and its backers, and in 1969 APC collapsed into administration.|$|E
2500|$|The {{names of}} most derived units of measure in the {{imperial}} and US customary systems are concatenations of the constituent parts of the unit of measure, for example the unit of pressure is the <b>pounds</b> [...] <b>per</b> <b>square</b> inch.
