40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of two spray-based decontamination methods for surface contamination reduction and to determine the potential for contamination spread by these methods. Methods and Results: Material coupons (treated plywood and concrete) were contaminated with c. 1 × 107 spores of Bacillus atrophaeus by aerosol deposition. Decontaminants (<b>pH-adjusted</b> bleach or Spor-Klenz® RTU) were applied to coupons by either backpack sprayer or gas-powered sprayer. Contact time, reapplication frequency and rinse method were also varied. In addition to surface removal efficacy, partitioning of contamination between the rinsate and aerosol fractions was determined. Results indicated that <b>pH-adjusted</b> bleach was effective (≥ 6 logs reduction) when two applications and a 30 min contact time were administered, regardless of the decontaminant application method or material. Spor-Klenz® RTU was effective on wood, but achieved ≤ 3 logs reduction on concrete. A shortened application procedure with <b>pH-adjusted</b> bleach resulted in lower efficacy on wood, and a greater apparent potential for contamination spread. Conclusions: Consideration of material surface type is important when selecting a decontaminant. Also, achieving conditions that effectively inactivate surface biological contamination are critical to preventing the spread of contamination.

40|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} (ESIMS) {{is widely used}} to characterize neutral and ionic species in solvents. Typically, electrical, thermal, and pneumatic potentials are applied to create electrosprays from which charged ionic species are ejected for downstream analysis by mass spectrometry. Most recently, ESIMS has been exploited to investigate ambient proton transfer reactions at air-water interfaces in real time. We assessed the validity of these experiments via complementary laboratory experiments. Specifically, we characterized the products of two reaction scenarios via ESIMS and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR) : (i) emulsions of <b>pH-adjusted</b> water and isoprene (C 5 H 8) that were mechanically agitated, and (ii) electrosprays of <b>pH-adjusted</b> water that were collided with gas-phase isoprene. Our experiments unambiguously demonstrate that, while isoprene does not oligomerize in emulsions, it does undergo protonation and oligomerization in electrosprays, both with and without <b>pH-adjusted</b> water, confirming that C-C bonds form along myriad high-energy pathways during electrospray ionization. We also compared our experimental results with some quantum mechanics simulations of isoprene molecules interacting with hydronium at different hydration levels (gas versus liquid phase). In agreement with our experiments, the kinetic barriers to protonation and oligomerization of isoprene were inaccessible under ambient conditions. Rather, the gas-phase chemistries during electrospray ionization drove the oligomerization of isoprene. Therefore, we consider that ESIMS could induce artifacts in interfacial reactions. These findings warrant a reassessment of previous reports on tracking chemistries under ambient conditions at liquid-vapor interfaces via ESIMS. Further, we took some high-speed images of electrosprays where {{it was possible to}} observe the main characteristics of the phenomena, i. e. Taylor cone, charge separation, and Coulomb fission. Finally, we took the freedom to speculate on possible mechanisms that take place during electrospray ionization that affected our system and possibly may influence other common analytical techniques on ESIMS...|$|E

Marine sediments with a gradient of Cu and Zn concentrations were prepared by direct-spiking without and with pH-adjustment to pH 7, {{and also by}} serial dilution of direct-spiked sediment (4000 姠g- 1, pH 7 adjusted) with uncontaminated sediment. Porewater concentrations of Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn in direct-spiked sediments without pH adjustment were orders of magnitude higher than the equivalent sediments adjusted to pH 7 or those prepared by the serial dilution method. Despite pH-adjustment, porewater Cu and Zn concentrations of direct-spiked sediment remained higher than concentrations observed within metal-contaminated natural sediment. The serial dilution of metal-spiked, <b>pH-adjusted</b> sediment substantially decreased Cu and Zn partitioning to the dissolved phase, and minimized the variation of potential competitive ions (H+, Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +) over the entire gradient of spiked Cu and Zn concentrations.

In this study we consider the possibility of using a food industy by-product, grape pomace, as the substrate. Five species of Lactobacillus were grown in chambourcin grape pomace and water at 21 °C. Adjusted pH trials were also run. Survival study - Plate counts and pH were collected at intervals over a 120 d period. ANOVA comparision of regression lines fitted to the plate counts for each species confirm a slower population decline in <b>pH-adjusted</b> samples (p= 4. 8 e- 6). The exception, L. fermentum, grew in the unadjusted sample. ANOVA comparision of the regression lines fitted to the pH values for each species indicated a difference (p= 1. 6 e- 6) between <b>pH-adjusted</b> and unadjusted samples. The pH of many of the unadjusted samples rose {{over the course of the}} study possible due to malolactic fermentation. With the notable exception of L. fermentum, we conclude that grape pomace is a poor substrate for long-term survival of the species tested. EPS study - samples were grown for 4 d and the soluble fiber extracted by ethanol precipitation and freeze-dried. Significant differences were found between the quantity of extract recovered from <b>pH-adjusted</b> and unadjusted samples (p= 1. 8 e- 3). This difference is probably due to hydrolysis of the substrate by the base.

This field has yet to advance due to challenges in systematically linking physicochemical properties to toxicity. The aim of this work was to develop a library of comparable NMs and study their behaviour and ageing in different scenarios. A library of metal oxide NMs based on a PVP capped ceria synthesis protocol was developed and extensively characterised. The protocol was successfully modified to produce PVP capped zinc oxide and copper oxide NMs, of comparable sizes. These NMs along with commercial uncoated ceria NMs were subjected to time and temperature dependent studies.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Decontamination studies investigating {{the effectiveness of}} products and processes for the inactivation of Bacillus species spores have traditionally utilized metering viable spores in a liquid suspension onto test materials (coupons). The current study addresses the rep-resentativeness of studies using this type of inoculation method compared to when coupons are dosed with a metered amount of aerosolized spores. The understanding of this comparability is important {{in order to assess}} the representativeness of such laboratory-based testing when deciding upon decontamination options for use against Bacillus anthracis spores. Temporal inactivation of B. anthracis surrogate (B. subtilis) spores on representative materials using fumigation with chlorine dioxide, spraying of a <b>pH-adjusted</b> bleach solution, or immersion in the solution was investigated as a function of inoculation method (liquid suspension or aerosol dosing). Results indicated that effectiveness, measured as log reduction, was statistically significantly lower when liquid inoculation was used for some material and decontaminant combina-tions. Differences were mostly noted for the materials observed to be more difficult to decontaminate (i. e., wood and carpet). Significant differences in measured effective-ness were also noted to be a function of the <b>pH-adjusted</b> bleach application method used in the testing (spray or immersion). Based upon this work and the cited literature, it is clear that inoculation method, decontaminant appli-cation method, and handling of non-detects (i. e., or detection limits) can {{have an impact on the}} sporicidal efficacy measurements...|$|E
40|$|Responses to many {{growth and}} stress {{conditions}} {{are assumed to}} act via changes to the cellular redox status. However, direct measurement of <b>pH-adjusted</b> redox state during growth and stress has never been carried out. Organellar redox state (E GSH) was measured using the fluorescent probes roGFP 2 and pHluorin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, we investigated changes in organellar redox state in response to various growth and stress conditions {{to better understand the}} relationship between redox-, oxidative- and environmental stress response systems. E GSH values of the cytosol, mitochondrial matrix and peroxisome were determined in exponential and stationary phase in various media. These values (- 340 to - 350 mV) were more reducing than previously reported. Interestingly, sub-cellular redox state remained unchanged when cells were challenged with stresses previously reported to affect redox homeostasis. Only hydrogen peroxide and heat stress significantly altered organellar redox state. Hydrogen peroxide stress altered the redox state of the glutathione disulfide/glutathione couple (GSSG, 2 H(+) / 2 GSH) and pH. Recovery from moderate hydrogen peroxide stress was most rapid in the cytosol, followed by the mitochondrial matrix, with the peroxisome the least able to recover. Conversely, the bulk of the redox shift observed during heat stress resulted from alterations in pH and not the GSSG, 2 H(+) / 2 GSH couple. This study presents the first direct measurement of <b>pH-adjusted</b> redox state in sub-cellular compartments during growth and stress conditions. Redox state is distinctly regulated in organelles and data presented challenge the notion that perturbation of redox state is central in the response to many stress conditions...|$|E

Electrical penetration graph analysis revealed that variables associated with whitefly probing and ingestion {{did not differ significantly}} in pH (4, 7. 4, and 9) adjusted artificial diets. To investigate virus retention and release, whiteflies allowed to acquire LIYV virions in a pH 7. 4 artificial diet were fed pH 4, 7. 4, or 9 virion-free artificial (clearing) diets. Immunofluorescent localization analyses indicated that virions remained bound to the foreguts of approximately 20 %- 24 % of vectors after they fed on each of the 3 <b>pH-adjusted</b> clearing diets. When RNA preparations from the clearing diets were analyzed by reverse transcription (RT) nested-PCR and, in some cases, real-time qPCR, successful amplification of LIYV-specific sequence was infrequent but consistently repeatable for the pH 7. 4 diet but never observed for the pH 4 and 9 diets, suggesting a weak pH-dependent effect for virion release. Viruliferous vectors that fed on each of the 3 <b>pH-adjusted</b> clearing diets transmitted LIYV to virus-free plants. These results suggest that changes in pH values alone in artificial diet do not result in observable changes in whitefly feeding behaviors, an observation that marks a first in the feeding of artificial diet by whitefly vectors; {{and that there is a}} potential causal and contingent relationship between the pH in artificial diet and the release/inoculation of foregut bound virions...|$|E

The resulting supernatants (SPNTs 2) were analysed by OD (at 600 and 280 nm) and SDS-PAGE in order to characterise proteins still soluble as a function of pH. Particle size in SPNTs 1 was analysed by Steric Exclusion Chromatography. The OD 600 nm revealed that during acidification soluble casein in both control and heat-treated samples exhibits variations in its optical properties or size as previously shown with micellar casein. In heat-treated samples, soluble casein and heat-induced covalent soluble aggregates precipitate at the same pH value. A progressive acidification of the soluble phase did not separate them. Increasing the temperature of acidification from 20 to 38 °C resulted in an increase in the precipitation pH of the proteins. However choice of acidifier did not have a significant effect on OD profiles. The soluble covalent aggregates from mHtd 7 · 2 were smaller, more numerous, and had a higher content of κ-casein than mHtd 6 · 5. Both types of aggregates began to precipitate at the same pH value but precipitation occurred over a narrower pH-range for soluble aggregates prepared from mHtd 7 · 2.

B. thailandensis KACC 12027 (4 log CFU/mL) was inoculated in microwell plates containing tryptic soy broth <b>pH-adjusted</b> to 4, 5, 6, and 7 with ascorbic acid, citric acid, and lactic acid and with water activities adjusted to 0. 94, 0. 96, 0. 98, and 1. 0 with NaCl, followed by incubation at 35 oC for 30 h. The optical density (OD) {{of the samples}} was measured at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 30 h at 595 nm to estimate the growth of B. thailandensis. Growth of B. thailandensis was observed only at water activity of 1. 0. In general, more bacterial growth (p lactic acid> citric acid after incubation at 35 oC for 30 h. These results indicate that organic acids in meat processing-related formulations should be useful in decreasing the risk related to an emerging high risk agent (B. pseudomallei).

40|$|Proteins from herring (Clupea harengus) light muscle were {{extracted}} using acidic or alkaline solubilization; 92 and 89 % of {{the initial}} muscle proteins were solubilized at pH 2. 7 and 10. 8, respectively, of which 96 and 94 % were recovered during precipitation at pH 5. 5. Consistency of the <b>pH-adjusted</b> muscle homogenates increased with increased raw material age and homogenization intensity; it declined following holding on ice. Some hydrolytic myofibrillar protein degradation occurred during cold storage of the acidified (pH 2. 7) homogenates. With alkalized homogenates, hydrolysis was negligible. The total lipid content changed from 0. 13 g/g of protein in the muscle to 0. 04 g/g of protein in both the acid- and alkali-produced protein isolates. Corresponding values for the phospholipid content were from 0. 037 to 0. 02 g/g of proteins. Acid- and alkali-produced proteins made gels with equal strain and color. Stress values were equal or lower in acid- versus alkali-produced protein gels. When ice-stored raw material was used, strain and stress values of gels were reduced...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} observe and {{quantify}} long-range neuronal connections in intact mouse brain by light microscopy, {{it is first necessary}} to clear the brain, thus suppressing refractive-index variations. Here we describe a method that clears the brain and preserves the signal from proteinaceous fluorophores using a <b>pH-adjusted</b> non-aqueous index-matching medium. Successful clearing is enabled through the use of either 1 -propanol or tert-butanol during dehydration whilst maintaining a basic pH. We show that high-resolution fluorescence imaging of entire, structurally intact juvenile and adult mouse brains is possible at subcellular resolution, even following many months in clearing solution. We also show that axonal long-range projections that are EGFP-labelled by modified Rabies virus can be imaged throughout the brain using a purpose-built light-sheet fluorescence microscope. To demonstrate the viability of the technique, we determined a detailed map of the monosynaptic projections onto a target cell population in the lateral entorhinal cortex. This example demonstrates that our method permits the quantification of whole-brain connectivity patterns at the subcellular level in the uncut brain...|$|E
30|$|Methanol {{liberation and}} {{methoxyl}} loss during chlorine bleaching of softwood kraft pulp were quantitatively investigated {{to estimate the}} degree of structural modification of lignin aromatics. An increase in the chlorine multiple led to enhanced methoxyl loss from lignin. Our result, using <b>pH-adjusted</b> chlorine water (pH 5.7), by which chlorination under oxidation-favorable conditions was achieved, strongly supported {{the importance of the}} oxidation reaction by chlorine during delignification and lignin degradation. It was also suggested that methanol can be produced not only via catalytic hydrolysis by chlorine but via oxidative cleavage of the ether bond as well. The infrared spectrum of chlorolignins suggested that chlorine oxidation can open aromatic rings to muconic acid derivatives without cleaving ether bonding of the methoxyl group. No straight relation between the methoxyl content and the kappa number of chlorinated pulps was shown. The methoxyl content of bleached kraft pulps subjected to successive chlorination and alkali extraction showed a good relation with the kappa number. This means that almost all the portions of the oxidatively modified lignin structure were successfully removed during these treatments, and the aromatic structures of residual lignin in chlorinated and alkali-extracted pulps were thought to remain intact.|$|E
40|$|Botrytis cinerea is a fungal {{pathogen}} that greatly {{reduces the}} postharvest quality of rose flowers. A postharvest dip in 200 µL L- 1 sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 10 s at 20 °C provided the greatest control of B. cinerea on ‘Akito’ and ‘Gold Strike’ flowers. NaOCl derived from Clorox® Ultra household bleach solution {{was more effective}} than laboratory grade NaOCl in reducing disease symptoms. Lowering the pH of the NaOCl solution from pH 9. 7 (unadjusted) to pH 7. 0 greatly improved its efficacy. Treating ‘Gold Strike’ flowers in this <b>pH-adjusted</b> NaOCl solution was more effective in reducing the level of infection on petals than postharvest dips in the conventional fungicides Medallion®, Phyton®, Switch® and Vangard®. Applying NaOCl prior to a 3 - or 10 -d commercial shipment also provided the most consistent disease control {{for a wide range}} of rose cultivars as compared to conventional fungicides. Of particular interest, the efficacy of NaOCl and Phyton® was greatest when these compounds were applied to ‘Gold Strike’ flowers after incubation at 20 °C and 90 % RH for 6 – 9 h. Our findings highlight NaOCl as a promising new candidate for the control of B. cinerea on rose flowers...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Though {{used for}} infections {{of the central}} nervous system, the {{pharmacodynamics}} of anti-microbial agents is commonly evaluated only in commercially available bacterial growth media. In the present study, the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on bacterial killing by cefepime and rifampicin were investigated. Methods: CSF was collected from patients who did not receive antibiotics. Time–kill curves were per-formed over 24 h using drug concentrations of 0. 25 -, 0. 5 -, 1 -, 2 -, 4 - and 8 -fold the respective MIC for the Staphylococcus aureus test strain. Killing curves were performed in Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB), in CSF incubated in ambient air (CSFAIR) and in CSF in air with 5 % CO 2 (CSFCO 2). CO 2 served to adjust the pH of CSF to physiological values. Results: Sustained bacterial killing was achieved by cefepime at lower drug concentrations in CSFCO 2 than in MHB. In contrast, rifampicin concentrations above the MIC were required to exert sustained killing in CSFCO 2. Both drugs were least effective in CSFAIR. Conclusions: Standard susceptibility tests may lead to over- or underestimation of the activity of dis-tinct antibiotics in CSF. Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity in <b>pH-adjusted</b> CSF can provide useful information on drugs considered {{for the treatment of}} bacterial infections residing in CSF...|$|E
