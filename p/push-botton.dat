40|$|This book {{considers}} {{the protection of}} metallic underground structures from corrosion, {{as well as the}} operation of highly effective protection systems. A briei description is presented of existing automatic anticorrosion devices. Special attention is paid to the description of basic circuit components of these devices. Proglms of mainte-nance, adjustment, and testing of protective units and of the individual subassemblies of these units are analyzed in detail. Also included are servicing methods of auto-matic electrodraining systems and cathode stations. The book is intended for specialists dealing with opera-tion, maintenance and adjustment of protective systems.
