5000|$|In Japan {{during the}} late 1930s and early 1940s, in common with most large economies of the time, {{research}} was being conducted into <b>pressurised</b> <b>cabins</b> for high-altitude flight. In similar fashion to the Lockheed XC-35, in the United States, Tachikawa incorporated a pressurised cabin into new forward and centre fuselage sections {{for one of the}} locally built Lockheed Type LO Transport Aircraft. The resulting research aircraft was given the long designation Tachikawa-Lockheed Type-B high altitude research aircraft and the company designation Tachikawa SS-1. The first conversion was completed in May 1943, re-engined with 2x [...] Mitsubishi Ha-102 14-cylinder radial engines. The two conversions carried out a brief flight testing programme.|$|E
50|$|He was {{involved}} {{in one of the}} more ambitious aeronautical flights of the early twentieth century, sponsored by Lucy, Lady Houston, the Houston-Mount Everest Flight Expedition. Flying in formation higher than any before; Lord Clydesdale, as he was known, was chief pilot on the first flight over Mount Everest in 1933, flying a Westland PV-3 biplane. The extremity endured by the crews of these aeroplanes helped demonstrate the need for <b>pressurised</b> <b>cabins</b> in modern aircraft. It was also the first detailed and scientific survey of the Himalaya region. Indirectly, the expedition resulted in the formation of Scottish Aviation Ltd (now part of BAE Systems).

50|$|In 1936, at GÃ¶ring's invitation, Rowehl's {{unit was}} {{transferred}} to the Luftwaffe, where it became the Squadron for Special Purposes, under the General Staff of the 5th Branch (intelligence). The greater financial resources of the Luftwaffe enabled Rowehl to recruit more pilots - he sought out men with experience with aerial photography companies, international airlines and aircraft manufacturers, and two had been aviation adventurers in the 1920s and earlier in the 1930s, Count Hoensbroech and Count Soerma. He also advised on the development of specialised aircraft. The unit used converted bombers, beginning with the Heinkel He 111, later also the Dornier Do 215, Junkers Ju 86 and Junkers Ju 88, Dornier Do 217, Henschel Hs 130, and Messerschmitt Me 410. These were equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks and with an oxygen-nitrogen fuel mix that would supercharge the engine for 20-25 minutes to facilitate escape. Some had <b>pressurised</b> <b>cabins.</b> They were disguised as civilian planes or had minimal markings. Rowehl also advised Zeiss on the development of special automatic cameras which used infra-red film.|$|E

40|$|Lately, {{commercial}} aviation {{has been moving}} towards the reduction of environmental impact and direct operating costs, due to the rapid increase in aircraft demand and air traffic congestion predicted for the next years. Several researchers have been abandoning the fully exploited conventional configuration and exploring novel arrangements, such as flying wings and blended wing bodies. The Flying V concept, proposed at TU Berlin in collaboration with Airbus GmbH, represents {{the focus of this}} research project, since the preliminary analyses have estimated remarkable aerodynamic benefits and weight savings. It is a V-shape flying wing with two cylindrical <b>pressurised</b> <b>cabins</b> placed in the wing leading edge and engines over the trailing edge; elevons provide longitudinal control and vertical tails double as winglets. The primary research goal is the aerodynamic design of the Flying V aircraft to assess whether this concept has better aerodynamic performances than the reference conventional configuration during cruise. The design philosophy selected for this project consists of a multi-fidelity design space exploration followed by two different design paths: dual step optimization, where planform and airfoil variables are subsequently varied, and single step optimization. Athena Vortex Lattice is used to rapidly investigate the feasible design space, whereas the Stanford University Unstructured code in the Euler mode is adopted for an accurate wave and vortex-induced drag estimation. The profile drag is computed by a separate empirical module. The three-dimensional geometry is automatically generated within the ParaPy framework (a Knowledge Based Engineering environment) according to a multi-level parametrization: the wing planform shape is parametrized with 10 variables, the profiles with 43 parameters, and the winglets are defined by 3 additional variables. Subsequently, the unstructured volume grid is produced by the Salome platform wrapped in ParaPy and then fed into the aerodynamic solver. The aerodynamic design is performed at one single cruise condition: the Mach number is equal to 0. 85, the lift coefficient to 0. 26, and the altitude to 13, 000 m. The baseline configuration is progressively improved: the wave and vortex induced drag components are reduced, the wetted area is slightly decreased and the pitching moment coefficient about the reference centre of gravity location is almost null. The maximum lift to drag ratio of the single step optimized configuration is 23. 7 at the cruise point: this value confirms the estimation of 25 of the conceptual phase. A 12 % reduction in subsonic drag is achieved, with the desired pitching moment. The Flying V is then compared to the NASA Common Research Model, a conventional configuration benchmark, by using the same solver and a similar mesh refinement. The maximum lift to drag ratio of the NASA Common Research Model is 18. 9, hence the Flying V is 25 % aerodynamically more efficient at the design cruise condition.

2500|$|The <b>pressurised</b> <b>cabin</b> {{was used}} to counter the {{physiological}} problems encountered by pilots at high altitudes. The cabin was not like the fully <b>pressurised</b> <b>cabin</b> of a modern airliner; the pressure differential provided by the modified cockpit of the VI was only two {{pounds per square inch}} (which was double the Air Ministry requirement). To achieve this, the forward and rear cockpit bulkheads were completely enclosed, with all control and electrical cables exiting though special rubber sealing grommets. In addition, the side cockpit door was replaced with alloy skin and the canopy was no longer a sliding unit: externally there were no slide rails. Once the pilot was in, the canopy was locked in place with four toggles and sealed with an inflatable rubber tube. It could be jettisoned by the pilot in an emergency. The windscreen of production Mk VIs was the same as the type fitted to the Mark III and some Mk Vs although it was fitted with an inward opening clear-view panel on the port quarter pane. The effect was to make [...] seem like [...] to the pilot, who would still have to wear an oxygen mask. Pressurisation was achieved by a Marshall-manufactured compressor located on the starboard side of the engine, fed by a long intake below the starboard exhaust stubs. Mk VIs were built with the Coffman cartridge starter, with a small teardrop fairing just ahead of the compressor intake.|$|R
