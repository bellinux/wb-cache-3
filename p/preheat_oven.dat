Then a thin compact layer of TiO 2 nanoparticles {{referred to as the}} blocking layer (approximately 80  nm) is deposited by aerosol spray-pyrolysis at 450 °C using ambient air as carrier gas[15]. For spray-pyrolysis, a solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Sigma Aldrich, 75  wt.% in isopropanol) and absolute ethanol is used in the ratio 1 : 9 by volume.

30|$|Basket heating {{apparatus}} {{consists of a}} container (basket) shaped as a cube, a cylinder or a sphere, made of wire mesh to hold the sample, an oven to maintain the temperature and a thermocouple to measure the temperature inside the sample. Measuring the runaway temperature involves the following steps: charging the basket with a sample, inserting the thermocouple {{in the middle of}} the basket, then placing this basket inside a <b>preheated</b> <b>oven</b> and finally recording the temperature with a data logger (Wang et al. 2006). The objective of this method is to determine the critical oven temperature that gives rise to self-heating. This approach assumes a single Arrhenius reaction rate, constant and isotropic material properties, and no water evaporation (Wang et al. 2006; Drysdale 1985). The measurements are normally analysed using the Frank-Kamenetskii theory as explained later in this review. Bowes et al. implemented this method to measure the self-heating and ignition temperature of sawdust for different concentrations of oxygen (Bowes & Thomas 1966). This method is time and material consuming since a great number of tests must be performed to obtain the critical temperature. Moreover, locating the critical temperature is not straightforward. Worden attempted to implement this method to study the spontaneous ignition of cotton soaked with linseed oil, however, the critical temperature could not be determined due to difficulties in ascertaining the sub-critical conditions (Worden 2011). In other words, using boiled oil (oil with cobalt accelerant), Worden could not find conditions that did not ignite. This leads one to conclude that there is no safe quantity of rags soaked with boiled linseed oil, and that even a single oil soaked rag at room temperature can self-heat. In practical terms, these findings question the classical theory of self-heating that stipulates the existence of a sub-critical condition for which a material does not self-ignite. The classical theory of self-heating does not cover self-ignition reaction involving radical and catalytic reactions. New theoretical and numerical treatments remain to be developed for spontaneous ignition induced by radical and catalytic reactions.|$|R

HRXRD longitudinal ω- 2 θ scans were recorded with an analyzer composed of Ge channel-cut crystals, while a pole figure was taken in skew geometry and with open detector. To assess the morphology and microstructure of the films, the samples were cleaved into smaller pieces for investigation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S- 4800, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; TecnaiTMG 2 F 30, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA), the latter through the standard mechanical thinning and ion-milling processes.

The raw sausages were cooked at different time-temperature combinations and based on mean scores of various sensory parameters, cooking at a temperature of 140 [*]±[*] 5 °C for 25 minutes {{was found to be}} optimum. Raw sausages were hung vertically on skewers which were placed at the ridges along the two ends of hot air oven (Yorco sales Pvt. Ltd. India, Model-YS 1 - 431, S. No. 02 B 2843). Raw sausages were cooked in a <b>preheated</b> hot air <b>oven</b> at 140 [*]±[*] 5 °C for a total time of about 25 minutes. The internal temperature of sausages was monitored by a thermometer and cooked to an internal temperature of 80 [*]±[*] 2 °C.|$|R
40|$|Background: Because {{of their}} main characteristics: transparency, {{opalescence}} and color density, the tooth structures are {{extremely difficult to}} restore by means of completely inconspicuous restorations of the natural tooth tissue characteristics. The aim is to show successful aesthetic restoration of III Class dental lesions in upper incisors by means of high quality composites. Materials and method: A female patient visited the clinic being {{not satisfied with the}} esthetics of her front teeth. The intraoral examination showed previous restorations and carious lesions in 12, 11, 21, 22. After defining the tooth color a silicone key was made. The treatment was performed under anesthesia, the existing restorations were removed and the carious lesions in teeth 11, 12, 21, 22 were treated with restorations using Vanini edge preparation. The teeth were restored by means of stratification technique. After etching and rinsing, bonding was applied for 20 sec. and then polymerized. After fixing the silicone key enamel shade was applied and then dentine shades UD 2, UD 3, UD 4 of 0. 5 mm thickness each. The polymerization was done layer by layer. Applied were 10 to 15 layers in total. The composite material was <b>preheated</b> in <b>oven</b> up to 55. Teeth 21 and 22 are restored with Enamel Plus HRi (Micerium). Results and Discussion: Excellent aesthetics is achieved with composite material. They have enamel and dentine shades and allow high quality aesthetics. The polishing is excellent in Enamel Plus HRi (Micerium) which is typical for this type of composite. The result of the carious lesion treatment in this patient is real improvement of the dental appearance of her anterior incisors. Conclusion: Materials show excellent aesthetic results due to their characteristics and the stratification technique used...|$|R
