30|$|Stepping back, it {{is clear}} that other {{crossbow}} triggers {{from other parts of the}} easternmost trench of Pit 1 (such as the front and central corridors), are more variable in shape (when looked at very closely). They also have fewer incised marks overall (and no ink marks yet) and exhibit different locations where any marks are typically placed on the trigger part (e.g. on the side, in the middle, between the two <b>prongs</b> <b>part</b> B, etc. Fig.  7 c). Such greater variability may be due to a different supply chain behind how these other crossbows (rather than the more standardised Gong-related group) came to the pit. For example, perhaps they were stored for a longer time in a military arsenal (rather than coming straight from a manufacturing workshop) or perhaps they were made by different and/or less centralised workshop cells.|$|R
50|$|The Trenton <b>Prong</b> is <b>part</b> of the Precambrian {{basement}} {{which is}} discontinuously exposed in the north-central Appalachians. The rocks {{that make up}} the prong are mostly Ediacaran and Cambrian aged rocks, that includes the Wissahickon Formation. Other rocks present include metabasalt, gabbro, gneiss, migmatite and granofels. The prong is heavily eroded, presenting as low, gently rolling hills.|$|R
50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the one-piece wooden clothes-peg for hanging up coats that was invented by the Shaker community in the 1700s. During the 1700s laundry was hung on bushes, limbs or lines to dry but no clothespins can be found in any painting or prints of the era. The clothespin for hanging up wet laundry only appears in the early 19th century patented by Jérémie Victor Opdebec. This design does not use springs, but is fashioned in one piece, with the two <b>prongs</b> <b>part</b> of the peg chassis with only a small distance between them—this form of peg creates the gripping action due to the two prongs being wedged apart and thus squeezing together in that the prongs want to return to their initial, resting state. This form of peg is often fashioned from plastic, or originally, wood. In England, clothes-peg making used to be a craft associated with gypsies, who made clothes-pegs from small, split lengths of willow or ash wood.|$|R
50|$|We {{therefore}} use a three-pronged clamp {{to maintain}} the Büchner flask. We place this clamp such that the two <b>prongs</b> surround the <b>part</b> of the flask connected to the vacuum tube, the lasting prong resting on the other side.|$|R
5000|$|The Reading <b>Prong</b> is <b>part</b> of the Precambrian {{basement}} {{which is}} discontinuously exposed in the north-central Appalachians. The rocks {{that make up}} the prong consist of diverse gneisses. [...] The New England Province and the Blue Ridge province share many geological similarities, and some experts consider the Reading Prong merely a continuation of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which reach their northern terminus at South Mountain near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania. In the gap between the Blue Ridge and the Reading Province, the two mountainous regions descend into the Appalachian Piedmont. Together, the Blue Ridge province and the New England province are {{often referred to as the}} Crystalline Appalachians. Rocks of the Reading Prong are characterized by elevated concentrations of uranium, the decay of which produces gaseous radon, a potentially hazardous source of indoor contamination in structures constructed on the prong.|$|R
50|$|The maitreya is semi-seated {{on a stool}} {{with its}} right leg crossed over the left in deep meditation. The face of the statue, has {{a hint of a}} smile, and {{exhibits}} a sense of serene concentration. The right arm of the statue, at the elbow, rests on its lap while its delicate hand reaches towards its cheek giving the impression of deep thought. One shoulder of the maitreya is slightly higher than the other and the upper body is slightly bent forward which also creates the impresses on the viewer an aura of deep thought. The statue wears a crown which is rather elaborate with many <b>prongs</b> and <b>parts</b> of the crown rest on the shoulders of the maitreya. The statue is also dressed in a complicated scarf-like vestment that curves around the body with wing-like projections. The left foot rests on a base which is shaped like a lotus flower. The statue is probably of Silla provenance because of the style is more formalized than realistic.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{selected}} 2nd overall by the Hartford Whalers in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, Pronger {{has played}} for Hartford, the St. Louis Blues, Edmonton Oilers, and Anaheim Ducks before being {{traded to the}} Philadelphia Flyers before the 2009-10 season. He was captain of the Blues, Ducks and Flyers. He {{has appeared in the}} Stanley Cup finals with three different teams (Edmonton, Anaheim, and Philadelphia), winning the Cup with the Ducks in 2007. Pronger won the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player for the 1999-2000 season and was the first defenceman to win the award since Bobby Orr in 1972. A mainstay on Team Canada, Pronger won Olympic gold medals at Salt Lake City 2002 and Vancouver 2010 {{and is a member of}} the Triple Gold Club. Pronger was also considered one of the NHL's dirtier players and has been suspended eight times. On January 27, 2017, in a ceremony during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, <b>Pronger</b> was <b>part</b> of the second group of players to be named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.|$|R
50|$|A {{pitchfork}} is {{an agricultural}} tool {{with a long}} handle and long, thick, widely separated pointed tynes used to lift and pitch or throw loose material, such as hay, straw or leaves. True pitchforks typically have {{only two or three}} tynes, while manure forks have four or more. However, some forks with more than three tynes are also used for handling loose material such as hay or silage. Other forks have up to ten tynes with different lengths and spacing depending on purpose. They are usually made of steel with a long wooden handle, but may also be made from wood, wrought iron, bamboo, or alloy. In some parts of England a pitchfork is known as a <b>prong</b> and, in <b>parts</b> of Ireland, a sprong refers to a four-pronged pitchfork. The pitchfork is similar to the shorter and sturdier garden fork.|$|R
40|$|The Manhattan <b>Prong</b> tour is <b>part</b> of the New York Landscape Regions Collection of Google Earth Tours. This tour takes {{students}} to Central Park in New York City to see metamorphic rock, glacial features, differential weathering, and Cleopatra's Needle, an Egyptian obelisk {{brought to the}} city in 1881. They can also examine bedrock, float, mass wasting, jointing, and glacial polish in the Pound Ridge Reservation, and observe a metamorphic outcrop of Fordham Gneiss near Katonah, New York. The convergent boundary features of the Staten Island serpentine belt, formed during the Taconic Orogeny, can be viewed, and students can follow the Mianus River Gorge as it crosses the Cameron's Line fault. There is also {{a tour of the}} New York City water supply system with a lab activity to accompany it. Educational levels: Middle school, High school...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{will examine}} the state courts 2 ̆ 7 {{approach}} to FAA preemption on a vacatur motion since the most recent Supreme Court FAA preemption decisions. This Article will demonstrate that, {{with little or no}} analysis, state courts over-apply the FAA to commercial arbitration awards, particularly the 2 ̆ 2 manifest disregard 2 ̆ 2 prong, causing what I call 2 ̆ 2 over-preemption 2 ̆ 2 and frustrating their own state 2 ̆ 7 s interests in the application of its arbitration law. Part II of this Article will briefly review Supreme Court FAA preemption jurisprudence. Part III of this Article will use illustrative state court decisions to demonstrate that the state courts are applying FAA preemption in the vacatur context in an inconsistent manner and thus over-preempt the FAA. Part IV of this Article will show that, even after balancing the competing policy concerns of federalism and judicial uniformity, this 2 ̆ 2 over-preemption 2 ̆ 2 is not required under the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence and that only in very limited circumstances must a state court apply the grounds for vacatur set forth in section 10 of the FAA. Part IV will also demonstrate that state courts need not apply the 2 ̆ 2 manifest disregard 2 ̆ 2 <b>prong</b> as <b>part</b> of the FAA, even if the FAA were held to apply. Part V will conclude by setting forth a framework for state courts to use when considering what law applies to a motion to vacate that takes into account Supreme Court precedent and policy considerations...|$|R
