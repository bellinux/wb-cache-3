5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with <b>phosphite.</b> <b>Phosphite</b> boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of <b>phosphite</b> boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of <b>phosphite</b> adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of <b>phosphite</b> into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with <b>phosphite,</b> particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, <b>phosphite</b> boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of <b>phosphite</b> boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of <b>phosphite</b> adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of <b>phosphite</b> inhibits growth of P.cinnamomi in B.sessilis, {{but does not}} kill the pathogen. In one study, a foliar spray containing <b>phosphite</b> inhibited the growth of P.cinnamomi by over 90% in plants infected with B.sessilis two weeks after spraying, and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying; yet most plants infected shortly before or after spraying were dead 100 days later, while nearly all plants infected seven months later spraying survived a further 100 days. <b>Phosphite</b> is not known to affect plant growth, but {{has been shown to}} reduce pollen fertility: one study recorded fertility reductions of up to 50%, and, in a separate experiment, fertility reductions that persisted for more than a year.|$|E
40|$|Inhibition {{of thermal}} {{oxidation}} of polypropylene (PP) by three synthesized aliphatic and aromatic <b>phosphites</b> containing two different antioxidant functional {{groups in the}} same molecule was observed in an air-circulating oven at 115 °C. The stabilizing effect increases with increasing concentration of antioxidants. Long-term heat aging of PP is more efficiently reduced by the prepared <b>phosphites</b> than two available commercial phenolic antioxidants. It was shown that besides the chemistry of trivalent phosphorus, the reactions of the secondary structure of the aromatic and aliphatic <b>phosphites</b> also influence the overall performance. <b>Phosphites</b> containing substituents, compound (III), able to form non-propagating species, such as hindered phenols, are able to perform through chain-terminating mechanism as welt.

40|$|Organophosphorus {{compounds}} {{are common}} additives included in liquid lubricants for many applications, in particular automotive applications. Typically, organic <b>phosphites</b> function as friction-modifiers whereas phosphates as anti-wear additives. While the antiwear action of phosphates is now well understood, the {{mechanism by which}} <b>phosphites</b> reduce friction is still not clear. Here we study the tribochemistry of both <b>phosphites</b> and phosphates using gas phase lubrication (GPL) and elucidate the microscopic mechanisms {{that lead to the}} better frictional properties of <b>phosphites.</b> In particular, by in situ spectroscopic analysis we show that the friction reduction is connected to the presence of iron phosphide, which is formed by tribochemical reactions involving <b>phosphites.</b> The functionality of elemental phosphorus in reducing the friction of iron-based interfaces is elucidated by first principle calculations. In particular, we show that the work of separation and shear strength of iron dramatically decrease by increasing the phosphorus concentration at the interface. These results suggest that the functionality of <b>phosphites</b> as friction modifiers {{may be related to the}} amount of elemental phosphorus that they can release at the tribological interface...|$|R

5|$|The <b>phosphite</b> {{group is}} {{protected}} by a base-labile 2-cyanoethyl group. Once a phosphoramidite has been coupled to the solid support-bound oligonucleotide and the <b>phosphite</b> moieties have been converted to the P(V) species, {{the presence of the}} phosphate protection is not mandatory for the successful conducting of further coupling reactions.|$|E
5|$|Extremely {{sensitive}} to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, Banksia coccinea is an indicator species {{for the presence}} of the disease. There is no known means of eradicating dieback. Much of the Stirling Range National Park is infested, though Fitzgerald River National Park has been largely spared. Applying <b>phosphite</b> to infested areas has been shown to reduce the mortality rates to around 50%. B. coccinea has shown some symptoms of toxicity to application of <b>phosphite,</b> with some patchy necrosis of leaves, but the plant's uptake of the compound is somewhat lower compared with uptake by other shrub species. Unusually, the symptoms {{do not appear to be}} proportional to exposure levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly formed}} tricoordinated <b>phosphite</b> triester linkage is not natural and is of limited {{stability}} under {{the conditions of}} oligonucleotide synthesis. The treatment of the support-bound material with iodine and water {{in the presence of}} a weak base (pyridine, lutidine, or collidine) oxidizes the <b>phosphite</b> triester into a tetracoordinated phosphate triester, a protected precursor of the naturally occurring phosphate diester internucleosidic linkage. Oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions using tert-Butyl hydroperoxide or, more efficiently, (1S)-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)-oxaziridine (CSO). The step of oxidation is substituted with a sulfurization step to obtain oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (see Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and their synthesis below). In the latter case, the sulfurization step is best carried out prior to capping.|$|E

5|$|The {{plant is}} {{fairly easy to}} grow in a {{mediterranean}} climate with good drainage and a light (sandy) soil; however, with medium to high susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, it is unreliable in conditions that favour {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mould, such as summer humidity or poor drainage. The use of <b>phosphite</b> fungicides does reduce the spread of Phytophthora. It generally does poorly in eastern Australia, although it is grown commercially in southeastern South Australia as a cut flower crop. It is also grown in California and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{substantially}} more reactive P(III) derivatives of nucleosides, 3'-O-chlorophosphites, were successfully {{used for the}} formation of internucleosidic linkages. This led to the discovery of the <b>phosphite</b> triester methodology. The group led by M. Caruthers took the advantage of less aggressive and more selective 1H-tetrazolidophosphites and implemented the method on solid phase. Very shortly after, the workers from the same group further improved the method by using more stable nucleoside phosphoramidites as building blocks. The use of 2-cyanoethyl phosphite-protecting group in place of a less user-friendly methyl group led to the nucleoside phosphoramidites currently used in oligonucleotide synthesis (see Phosphoramidite building blocks below). Many later improvements to the manufacturing of building blocks, oligonucleotide synthesizers, and synthetic protocols made the phosphoramidite chemistry a very reliable and expedient method of choice for the preparation of synthetic oligonucleotides.|$|E
25|$|Geological {{findings}} in 2013 showed that reactive phosphorus species (like <b>phosphite)</b> were in abundance {{in the ocean}} before 3.5 Ga, and that Schreibersite easily reacts with aqueous glycerol to generate <b>phosphite</b> and glycerol 3-phosphate. It is hypothesized that Schreibersite-containing meteorites from the Late Heavy Bombardment could have provided early reduced phosphorus, which could react with prebiotic organic molecules to form phosphorylated biomolecules, like RNA.|$|E

25|$|Dieback is {{notoriously}} difficult to treat, {{although there has}} been some success with <b>phosphite</b> and phosphorous acid, which are currently used to inoculate wild B.brownii populations. However this is not without potential problems as it alters the soil composition by adding phosphorus. Some evidence suggests that phosphorous acid may inhibit proteoid root formation.|$|E
25|$|The Chen–Mapp {{reaction}} {{also known}} as the -Phosphorimidate Rearrangement or Staudinger–Claisen Reaction installs a <b>phosphite</b> in the place of an alcohol and takes advantage of the Staudinger reduction to convert this to an imine. The subsequent Claisen is driven by the fact that a P=O double bond is more energetically favorable than a P=N double bond.|$|E

500|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{is known}} to be {{susceptible}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, but reports on the degree of susceptibility vary from low to high. A study of Banksia attenuata woodland [...] southeast of Perth across 16 years, and following a wave of [...] P.cinnamomi infestation, showed that A. cuneatus populations were not significantly reduced in diseased areas. <b>Phosphite</b> (used to combat dieback) has some toxic effects in A.cuneatus, with some necrosis of leaf tips, but the shrub uptakes little of the compound when compared with other shrubs. Specimens in coastal dune vegetation showed some sensitivity to the fungus Armillaria luteobubalina, with between a quarter and a half of plants exposed succumbing to the pathogen.|$|E
500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the {{naturally occurring}} nucleotides (nucleoside-3'- or 5'-phosphates) and their phosphodiester analogs are insufficiently reactive to afford an expeditious synthetic preparation of oligonucleotides in high yields. The selectivity {{and the rate}} of the formation of internucleosidic linkages is dramatically improved by using 3'-O-(N,N-diisopropyl phosphoramidite) derivatives of nucleosides (nucleoside phosphoramidites) that serve as building blocks in <b>phosphite</b> triester methodology. To prevent undesired side reactions, all other functional groups present in nucleosides have to be rendered unreactive (protected) by attaching protecting groups. Upon the completion of the oligonucleotide chain assembly, all the protecting groups are removed to yield the desired oligonucleotides. Below, the protecting groups currently used in commercially available and most common nucleoside phosphoramidite building blocks are briefly reviewed: ...|$|E
500|$|A 0.02–0.2 M {{solution}} of nucleoside phosphoramidite (or {{a mixture of}} several phosphoramidites) in acetonitrile is activated by a 0.2–0.7 M {{solution of}} an acidic azole catalyst, 1H-tetrazole, 5-ethylthio-1H-tetrazole, 2-benzylthiotetrazole, 4,5-dicyanoimidazole, or a number of similar compounds. A more extensive information {{on the use of}} various coupling agents in oligonucleotide synthesis {{can be found in a}} recent review. [...] The mixing is usually very brief and occurs in fluid lines of oligonucleotide synthesizers (see below) while the components are being delivered to the reactors containing solid support. The activated phosphoramidite in 1.5– 20-fold excess over the support-bound material is then brought in contact with the starting solid support (first coupling) or a support-bound oligonucleotide precursor (following couplings) whose 5'-hydroxy group reacts with the activated phosphoramidite moiety of the incoming nucleoside phosphoramidite to form a <b>phosphite</b> triester linkage. The coupling of 2'-deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites is very rapid and requires, on small scale, about 20s for its completion. In contrast, sterically hindered 2'-O-protected ribonucleoside phosphoramidites require 5-15 min to be coupled in high yields. The reaction is also highly sensitive to the presence of water, particularly when dilute solutions of phosphoramidites are used, and is commonly carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile. Generally, the larger the scale of the synthesis, the lower the excess and the higher the concentration of the phosphoramidites is used. In contrast, the concentration of the activator is primarily determined by its solubility in acetonitrile and is irrespective of the scale of the synthesis. Upon the completion of the coupling, any unbound reagents and by-products are removed by washing.|$|E
