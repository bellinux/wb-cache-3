40|$|In {{preemptive}} real-time systems, scheduling analyses need—in {{addition to}} the worst-case execution time—the context-switch cost. In case of preemption, the <b>preempted</b> and the <b>preempting</b> task may interfere on the cache memory. This interference leads to additional cache misses in the <b>preempted</b> task. The delay due to these cache misses {{is referred to as}} the cache-related preemption delay (CRPD), which constitutes the major part of the context-switch cost. In this paper, we present a new approach to compute tight bounds on the CRPD for LRU set-associative caches, based on analyses of both the <b>preempted</b> and the <b>preempting</b> task. Previous approaches analyzing both the <b>preempted</b> and the <b>preempting</b> task were either imprecise or unsound. As the basis of our approach we introduce the notion of resilience: The resilience of a memory block of the <b>preempted</b> task is the maximal number of memory accesses a <b>preempting</b> task could perform without causing an additional miss to this block. By computing lower bounds on the resilience of blocks and an upper bound on the number of accesses by a <b>preempting</b> task, one can guarantee that some blocks may not contribute to the CRPD. The CRPD analysis based on resilience considerably outperforms previous approaches...|$|R

5|$|Germany {{launched}} an offensive against France and, {{adhering to the}} Manstein Plan also attacked the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on 10 May 1940. That same day British forces landed in Iceland and the Faroes to <b>preempt</b> a possible German invasion of the islands. The U.S., in close co-operation with the Danish envoy to Washington D.C., agreed to protect Greenland, laying the political framework for the formal establishment of bases in April 1941. The Netherlands and Belgium were overrun using blitzkrieg tactics {{in a few days}} and weeks, respectively. The French-fortified Maginot Line and {{the main body of the}} Allied forces which had moved into Belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly wooded Ardennes region, mistakenly perceived by Allied planners as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles. As a result, the bulk of the Allied armies found themselves trapped in an encirclement and were beaten.

5|$|In Diane's {{immediate}} aftermath, one of {{the first}} priorities in response was to distribute adequate inoculations for typhoid amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water. The United States Army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters. After the floods of Hurricane Diane, more than 100,000people fled to shelter or away from their houses. The American Red Cross quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In the two weeks after the storm, Americans donated about $10million to the Red Cross. The countries of Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies. Additional flooding affected New England in September and October 1955, although neither was as major as those caused by Hurricane Diane. Following Diane, hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof doors and windows to <b>preempt</b> similar disasters in the future.|$|E
5|$|Major-General Hunter's flying column set {{out from}} Kassinger, a small town {{a few miles north}} of Merowe, at five-thirty the evening of July 29, marching only at night so as to avoid both the heat of the sun and the eyes of any Mahdist lookouts. There was no road or path to follow, and the terrain upon which Hunter's flying column marched was nearly nontraversable; the route alternated between broken, rocky ground and ankle-high sand, {{ultimately}} proving extremely difficult to navigate in the dark of night. Added to these difficulties was the measure of speed imposed upon the column, as the mounted Major-General Hunter and Lieutenant MacDonald drove their units to their breaking points in order to <b>preempt</b> Mahdist reinforcements. The column advanced until midnight, completing a march of over sixteen miles. Sleeping during the day was made impossible by the sweltering heat; only when adequate shade was found in the barren desert could the exhausted men of Hunter's flying column rest.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey's {{first state}} {{constitution}} was adopted on July 2, 1776.

With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other, New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war. Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later, during this state of emergency, on July 2, 1776, the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment. Its primary objective {{was to provide a}} basic governmental framework that would <b>preempt</b> New Jersey's fall into anarchy. And yet this Constitution served as the charter document for the State's government for the next 68 years.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I {{were all}} volunteers. Particularly during the war's early stages, not all male {{settlers}} of fighting age {{were expected to}} abandon their civilian lives for service abroad. Many {{of them were in}} vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to <b>preempt</b> the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone. Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local security by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told readers that men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that conscription might be required if not enough joined up.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{had shown}} the {{potential}} of the Soviet armies to successfully conduct an offensive. This battle can be seen {{as one of the first}} major instances in which the Soviets attempted to <b>preempt</b> a German summer offensive.

Although only two of the three were victories, it still offers concise and telling evidence of the ability of the Soviets to turn the war in their favor. This finalised itself after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a positive effect on Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to have the last word in naming front commanders for instance). After the great purge in 1937, failing to anticipate the war in 1941, and underestimating German military power in 1942, Stalin finally fully trusted his military.|$|E

5|$|The year of 1967 started {{badly for}} the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). During {{the early years}} of the war, the rules of {{engagement}} prevented U.S. fighter-bombers from hitting North Vietnamese air bases, and that allowed North Vietnamese fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets, thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads before they even reached their target. Then, instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft, North Vietnamese pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases. To <b>preempt</b> further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the North Vietnamese Air Force, the United States Air Force became interested in luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters up against a decoy target, and shoot them down in the air using missile-armed fighter aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force had become more aggressive towards U.S. strike formations, and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the right time to launch a decoy operation.|$|E

Raindance was extended through 7 April, by which time 730 U.S. sorties had been flown. On 22 May the Air Force conducted Operation Stranglehold, a five-day campaign focused on Routes 6 and 7, PAVN's logistical lifeline. Regardless, the North Vietnamese launched Campaign Thoan Thang (Total Victory) during late June and managed to take Muang Soui {{with the assistance of}} armoured units.

5|$|His {{loyalty to}} the Ottomans eroded, however, due {{to the impact of}} the new governments's Turkification {{policies}} which he viewed as repressive against his ideals. Because of his dissatisfaction with the Young Turks, Darwaza was driven to support Arab independence from the empire. In 1908, he joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), but withdrew soon after because of its Turkish nationalist political agenda. He played an active role in establishing a branch for the Party of Harmony and Freedom in Nablus in 1911. The party was founded in Istanbul and joined by Arab members to counter the policies of the CUP. In 1913, he joined a anti-Zionist group based in Nablus that sought to prevent the sale of Arab-owned land to Jews by submitting petitions to the Ottoman sultan, or by buying land for sale to <b>preempt</b> its purchase by Jews. In June 1913, he helped to prepare and became secretary of the First Palestinian Congress (also known as the Arab Congress of 1913) in Paris. In congress, he was also the delegate for the Jamma'in subdistrict of the District of Nablus. Meanwhile, Darwaza was still working in the DTPS.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} to estimate the Worst Case Response Time (WCRT) of each task in a preemptive multi-tasking single-processor real-time system utilizing an L 1 cache.

This cache reload delay caused by <b>preempting</b> task(s) is then incorporated into WCRT analysis. Two sets of applications are used to test our approach.

The rebels intended to dethrone George {{in favor of the}} king's fraternal nephew, Demna, who was {{considered by many to be}} a legitimate royal heir of his murdered father, David V. Demna's cause was little but a pretext for the nobles, led by the pretender's father-in-law, the amirspasalar ("constable") Ivane Orbeli, to weaken the crown. George III was able to crush the revolt and embarked on a crackdown campaign on the defiant aristocratic clans; Ivane Orbeli was put to death and the surviving members of his family were driven out of Georgia. Prince Demna, castrated and blinded on his uncle's order, did not survive the mutilation and soon died in prison. Once the rebellion was suppressed and the pretender eliminated, George went ahead to co-opt Tamar into government with him and crowned her as co-ruler in 1178.
