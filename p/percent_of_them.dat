40|$|Background: Gastrointestinal tract is {{uncommon}} localization for lipomas, but {{if present}} they are 90 % submucosal and 10 % subserosal. Intestinal submucosal lipomas {{are the most}} common benign nonepithelial intestinal tumors usually found incidentally. Rarely, they may cause obstruction, ulceration, perforation, intussusceptions, prolapse and massive hemorrhage. Methods: Fourty cases of intestinal submucosal lipomas were analyzed using 1. clinical symptoms, 2. imaging characteristics, 3. histopathological parameters. Twenty eight patients were treated with surgical intestinal resection because of intussusceptions, intestinal obstruction and intestinal bleeding and twelve patients underwent local tumor resection. Results: Forty <b>percents</b> <b>of</b> patients were in 7 th decade, 30 % in 8 th and 30 % in the sixth decade. The male/ female ratio was 1 : 1. Colonic sumbucosal lipomas were found in 60 % of cases, duodenal in 30 % and jejunal in 10 %. Forty <b>percents</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were diagnosed in association with carcinomas, 20 % with polypoid adenomas, 30 % caused inflammation and ulcerations and 10 % intussusceptions. Most of the tumors were asymptomatic. Conclusion: Colon and duodenum are the most frequent locations of intestinal submucosal lipomas. They are rare tumors usually found incidentally in association with carcinomas and polypoid adenomas. The correct diagnosis of a symptomatic, submucosal lipoma indicates a local excision, and eliminates possible complications and an unnecessary extensive resection...|$|R

A questionnaire containing questions about various applications of microbiology course, the best teaching procedures, the best time for teaching section and the importance of teaching each lesson were completed and were analyzed using chi-square test at significance level α= 0. 05. In the present study, 162 persons (27 GPs, 71 interns and 64 physiopathology students) participated. The majority of physicians (70. 4 %) believed that general microbiology exerts a low impact in clinical judgment and professional practice, while 81. 5 % GPs and 56. 3 % of the interns believed that systematic part of microbiology reveals high influence in this regards. Almost all the participants (95. 5 %) believed that time allocated to the microbiology teaching is suitable.
