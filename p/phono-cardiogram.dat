40|$|This paper {{presents}} a proposed procedure {{to analyze the}} PCG (<b>Phono-CardioGram)</b> signal recorded by an electronic stethoscope. The procedure concludes heart sound cycle segmentation followed by a detecting step to categorize the normal cases from that which are characterized as an abnormal one (mainly Mitral Regurgitation MR and Mitral Stenosis MS). This is achieving using Shannon energy envelop. Furthermore, a diagnosing step is added to recognize the MR and MS cases from other abnormal cases using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) applied to the segmented murmur period. The MR and MS cases were selected {{since it is the}} most popular abnormal heart cases recorded in the Middle East countries. The obtained results pleased and agreed many cardiac specialists. The MATLAB is the main software environment used in this work...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Cardiac {{events of}} early {{diastole}} were studied in 50 normal subjects and 46 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) by simultaneous {{recordings of the}} mitral valve echogram (MVE), <b>phono-cardiogram,</b> and apexcardiogram (ACG). Left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time (IRT), measured between A, and onset of the MVE opening motion, had almost the same values in normals 54 ± 7 msec, and MS 51 ± 16 msec. The interval between A, and the ACG "O" point was approximately double that of IRT: 99 ± 11 msec in nor-mal subjects, 109 ± 20 msec in MS. The normal MVE opening mo-OPENING OF THE MITRAL VALVE is associated with cardiac events such as left ventricular relaxation and onset of the mitral flow. Since the advent of echocardiography, traditional theories of mitral valve mechanics have been challenged. Several authors 1 - 6 reported that the opening snap (OS) and "O " point of the apexcardiogram accuratel...|$|E
40|$|The {{duration}} of the various phases of left ventricular systole has been measured {{in a series of}} So normal subjects using high speed simultaneous recordings of the electrocardiogram, the <b>phono-cardiogram,</b> the carotid pulse, and the apex cardiogram. The five phases of systole measured were: total electromechanical systole (Q-A 2 interval); left ventricular ejection time (LVET); pre-ejection period (PEP); isovolumetric contraction time (IVCT); total mechanical systole (TMS). The Q-A 2 interval, left ventricular ejection time, and total mechanical systole were linearly and inversely related to heart rate. The pre-ejection period and the isovolumetric contraction time were not significantly related to heart rate. The validity of the method has been substantiated by comparing simultaneous records of direct and indirect pulseforms in a small series ofpatients. The findings are reproducible and serial daily studies at different heart rates showed no deviationfrom the normal range. The results have been compared with those reported by various authors and they are in close agreement. Methods used to assess cardiac function...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a data acquisition system for the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the <b>phono-cardiogram</b> (PCG). Diagnosing heart sounds and heart murmurs using the stethoscope is an established practice clinically. However it requires considerable experience and training, to ensure validity and reproducibility. Echocardiography provides more definitive diagnosis in this respect but it is expensive and not widely available. With the advancement in personal computers (PC), this data acquisition unit interfaces with any desktop or notebook PC and functions as a virtual instrument for the heart diagnostic system. The ECG has been a reliable reference for the cardiologists to determine the first (S 1) and second (S 2) heart sound. Transformation of the heart sound signal using DSP technique, that is the Instantaneous Energy (IE) and Instantaneous Frequency (IF) for heart diagnostic can be a new approach for cardiologists. Furthermore, combining phonocardiogram with ECG for online diagnosis may be an important way forward. This paper {{describes the}} development of two channel acquisition system for heart diagnostic base on DSP technique...|$|E
40|$|In 1866 Ebstein {{described}} {{the first case}} of the anomaly that now bears his name. Since then over 300 cases have been reported. The essential pathology consists of malformation and downward displacement of the tricuspid valve, {{as a result of}} which the functional right ventricular cavity is reduced in size. The degree of incapacity is ex-tremely variable and is related to the severity of the tricuspid valve deformity and displacement. The diagnosis in a typical case should be readily made but this may be difficult in milder forms, especially where cyanosis is absent. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the clinical features, with emphasis on the auscultatory signs, in 9 cases of mild Ebstein's anomaly. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The patients (6 male, 3 female) ranged in age from 6 to 42 years (Table I). Phonocardiograms, using a New Electronic Products (N. E. P.) multichannel appara-tus, chest x-ray films, and routine 12 -lead electrocardio-grams with lead V 4 R, were obtained in all patients. Eight (Cases 1, 2, 4 - 9) underwent cardiac catheteriza-tion, 1 of whom (Case 7) was catheterized elsewhere. In 3 patients (Cases 2, 4, and 6), an external <b>phono-cardiogram</b> and simultaneous right ventricular pres-sures were recorded during cardiac catheterization...|$|E
40|$|Depression of {{myocardial}} contractility after ethanol ingestion in man {{has previously}} been shown only in patients with heart disease. In the present study, normal subjects, aged 23 - 30 years, ingested six ounces of 43 % alcohol over a two hour period (Group I, 6 subjects) or a one hour period (Group II, 5 subjects). Systolic time intervals were measured every 15 min from simultaneous ECG, <b>phono-cardiogram</b> and carotid pulse tracings. Heart rate, total electromechanical systole and left ventricular ejection time (LVET) were not changed at any time from pre-alcohol values and, except for a small (5 mm Hg) and transient change in diastolic pressure in Group II, aortic pressures also were unchanged. However, in Group I, after 60 min, at a blood ethanol of 74 + 3 mg%, left ventricular depression was manifested by increased pre-ejection period (PEP) from 90 + 2 to 96 3. 1 msec, isovolumic time (IVT) from 44 ± 3. 5 to 52 4 (P <. 01), and PEP/LVET ratio from 0. 299 + 0. 009 to 0. 323 0. 01 (P <. 05). Further depression occurred at two hours with blood ethanol at 111 + 6 mg%. Doubling ingestion rate (Group II) produced reduction of left ventricular per-formance at 30 min at a blood level of 50 ± 3 mg%. Feeding of isocaloric sucrose in 5 subjects (Group III) as a control produced a decrease in PEP, LVT, and PEP/LVET. Thus, alcohol in nonintoxicating doses elicits a depression of cardiovascular function in normal unhabituated subjects...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the relation of}} heart rate and systolic function to echocardiographically derived indexes of left ventricular relaxation, M-mode echocardiograms of the left ventricle and mitral valve with a simultaneous <b>phono-cardiogram</b> were recorded at rest from 28 normal men. The effects of altering the inotropic state and ventricular loading conditions were examined during isometric handgrip exercise and the Valsalva maneuver in a subset of IS men. The left ventricular endocardial echocardiograms were digitized to provide a display of left ventricular internal dimension and its first derivative (dD/dt). The time course of relaxation, defined as the interval from left ventricular minimal systolic dimension to the point when {{the rate of change}} of dimension (dD/dt) decreased to 50 % of peak, was directly related to the RR interval (r = 0. 64, p < 0. 0001) in the entire group, and this relation remained throughout the interventions. The slopes of the regression lines of relaxation time (RT) and electromechanical systole (QS 2) on the RR interval were similar. Diastolic time decreased proportionately more than relaxation time as the RR interval decreased, so that the proportion of diastole occupied by the relaxation time varied with cycle length. Peak diastolic dD/dt, normalized for variations in end-diastolic dimensions ([dD/dt]/D), was directly related to left ventricular shortening fraction (r = 0. 71 p < 0. 0001) and this relation remained during isometric grip. There was no correlation between the heart rate at rest and (dD/dt) /D over the range of 44 to 99 beats/min. It is concluded that the cardiac cycle length and shortening fraction are important variables associated with the time course and peak rate of cardiac muscle lengthening, respectively. Both must be included in any inter-group comparisons of diastolic function...|$|E
