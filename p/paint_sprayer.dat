His symptoms began 6 to 8 hours after exposure to the agent and spontaneously disappeared by the next morning. He had diffuse, fine reticulonodular shadows on a chest roentgenogram and a restrictive impairment of pulmo-nary function. Immunoglobulin G antibody to toluene di-isocyanate-human serum albumin was present in bronchoal-veolar lavage fluid and sera; IgA antibody was present only in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Also, the patient had sensi-tized bronchoalveolar lymphocytes to toluene diisocyanate-human serum albumin. The histologic findings suggested hy-persensitivity pneumonitis. The results of bronchoalveolar lavage, which was repeated on four separate occasions, showed lymphocytosis and a predominance of suppressor-cytotoxic T cells. The findings from serial determinations of humoral antibodies showed no changes consistent with the results of clinical and laboratory studies. In contrast, blasto-genic responses of bronchoalveolar lymphocytes to toluene diisocyanate markedly decreased, and the patient showed clinical improvement despite continued exposure to the agent...|$|E
40|$|There {{the purpose}} is to {{increase}} the reliability and the longevity of pipeline systems on the basis of development of computing methods of damping of pressure changes of viscous compressible fluid in the pipeline with the damper with regard to the strain of walls of pipeline and damper.

40|$|Hydrocarbon {{exposure}} {{has been}} shown {{to play an important role}} in the development of renal dysfunction in several occupational settings. In this study, renal screening was performed in a group of <b>paint</b> <b>sprayers</b> with exposure to hydrocarbon-based paints, recruited from a car manufacturing plant where personal protective equipment was widely used. The hydrocarbon exposure scores and various markers of renal injury were compared between these subjects and a group of <b>paint</b> <b>sprayers</b> from a previous study who did not use personal protective equipment regularly. Cumulative hydrocarbon exposure scores were calculated from a validated questionnaire. Serum creatinine, urinary total protein, albumin, transferrin, retinol-binding protein, and N-acetylglucosaminidase were evaluated, Both groups experienced heavy hydrocarbon exposure but sprayers who regularly used personal protective equipment had significantly reduced exposure scores due to improved skin and respiratory protection. A significant number of sprayers from both groups had elevated levels of serum creatinine. Interestingly, urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, a marker of proximal tubular damage, was abnormal in a significant proportion of sprayers in the unprotected group but normal in those with improved protection. Our results are in keeping with the hypothesis that hydrocarbon exposure through paint spraying may result in active proximal tubular damage which may be reduced by improvement of protection at the worksite. However, renal impairment independent of tubular injury may result from chronic paint exposure, even with improved protection...|$|R

50|$|Eventually, the {{advantages}} of using polyaspartic esters as {{the main component of}} the co-reactant for reaction with an aliphatic polyisocyanate in low to zero volatile organic compound (VOC) coatings has been realized. The rate of reaction of polyaspartic esters can be manipulated, thus extending the pot-life and controlling the cure rate of aliphatic coatings. This allows formulators to create high solids coatings systems which are user-friendly with longer working times and still maintain a fast-cure. Traditional aliphatic polyurea formulations required high-pressure, high-temperature plural component spray systems to be applied due to fast initial reaction rates. Aliphatic polyaspartics can be formulated with slower reaction rates to accommodate batch-mixing and application by roller-applied methods or spray-applied through conventional single components <b>paint</b> <b>sprayers</b> without the use of solvent. As with aliphatic polyurethane or acrylic coatings, polyaspartic coatings are UV and light stable and will not yellow like aromatic epoxies, polyureas and polyurethanes.|$|R
50|$|Currently an {{electric}} motor {{is the most popular}} choice to power stationary tools, though in the past they were powered by windmills, water wheels and steam. Some museums and hobbyists still maintain and operate stationary tools powered these older power sources. Portable electric tools may be either corded or battery-powered. Compressed air is the customary power source for nailers and <b>paint</b> <b>sprayers.</b> A few tools (called powder-actuated tools) are powered by explosive cartridges. Tools that run on gasoline or gasoline-oil mixes are made for outdoor use; typical examples include most chainsaws and string trimmers. Other tools like blowtorches will burn their fuel externally to generate heat. Compressed air is universally used where there is a possibility of fuel or vapor ignition - such as automotive workshops. Professional level electric tools differ from DIY or 'consumer' tools by being double insulated and not earthed - in fact they must not be earthed for safety reasons.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Robot {{design has}} {{recently}} become a burgeoning {{area of research}} for intelligent computation and applications range over diverse scales, from robot insects to Mars explorers. Despite the human associations, standard robot dynamics has {{more in common with}} inanimate action than animate action. The Carnegie Trust Scholarship Research Project described herein is intended to redress the balance by addressing the question: How does a robot become able to act intentionally? The question provides a focus for the project which will investigate into the fundamentals of robotic learning and action. The supporting experience in goal direction of the Intelligent Computation Group at St Andrews provides a unique opportunity for a novel answer to emerge. Detail A robot may be defined as a programmable, multifunction manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools, or specific devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks (Robot Institute of America).

40|$|Inorganic coating {{materials}} {{are being developed}} to slow or stop corrosion of reinforcing steel members inside concrete structures. It is much simpler {{and easier to use}} these {{coating materials}} than it is to use conventional corrosion-inhibiting systems based on impressed electric currents. Unlike impressed electrical corrosion-inhibiting systems, these coatings do not require continuous consumption of electrical power and maintenance of power-supply equipment. Whereas some conventional systems involve the use of expensive arc-spray equipment to apply the metallic zinc used as the sacrificial anode material, the developmental coatings can be applied by use of ordinary <b>paint</b> <b>sprayers.</b> A coating material of the type under development is formulated as a liquid containing blended metallic particles and/or moisture-attracting compounds. The liquid mixture is sprayed onto a concrete structure. Experiments have shown that even though such a coat resides on the exterior surface, it generates a protective galvanic current that flows to the interior reinforcing steel members. By effectively transferring the corrosion process from the steel reinforcement to the exterior coating, the protective current slows or stops corrosion of the embedded steel. Specific formulations have been found to meet depolarization criteria of the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) for complete protection of steel reinforcing bars ("rebar") embedded in concrete...|$|R
40|$|The zinc protoporphyrin/haemoglobin (ZPP/Hb) {{ratio was}} {{measured}} in the field with a haematofluorometer. A significant increase in ZPP/Hb ratio with advancing age was found in 1295 men who denied any excess exposure to lead. Ninety-seven per cent of the results were below 110 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (4. 4 microgram ZPP/g Hb). The ZPP/Hb ratio was determined in a lead-exposed population of 2275 men, and in 305 a blood lead analysis was also performed. A blood lead limit of 2. 9 mumol/l (60 microgram/ 100 ml) corresponds to about 500 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (20 microgram/g). This limit was exceeded in workers engaged in secondary lead smelting, storage battery manufacture, car radiator repair, crystal glass manufacture, storage battery repair, ship breaking, metal foundries, the ceramic industry, scrap metal handling, and PVC plastic manufacture. Other occupations caused lower lead exposures with ZPP/Hb ratios between 110 and 500 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) : such ratios were found in men from shooting ranges, in leaded pane manufacturers, gunsmiths, car <b>paint</b> <b>sprayers,</b> type setters, steel rolling mill workers, shipbuilders and welders, car mechanics, lead pigment handlers, and solderers. Increased ZPP/Hb ratios and blood lead levels in 210 workers were associated with a decrease in haemoglobin concentration in the blood. Thus, the haematofluorometer {{has proved to be}} very useful for screening purposes. A blood lead determination should be performed if the ZPP/Hb ratio exceeds 300 microgram ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (12 microgram/g) ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{summer and}} we are {{cleaning}} up after winter. The newest most popular tool is a high pressure washer. High pressure washers are used to wash old fences, sides of building, patios, patio furniture, sidewalks, steps and garage floors. Soap and chemicals {{are added to the}} fluid to ensure a good clean wash. These tools do a great job! Commonly used high pressure tools are <b>paint</b> <b>sprayers,</b> hydraulic equipment, and diesel injection engines. They all deliver fluid at high pressure. The nozzles of paint and grease guns emit a fine stream of liquid at pressures of 600 to 1, 200 pounds per square inch (psi). The power from hydraulic lines circulates at between 1, 800 and 2, 200 psi. Fine jets of fluid are driven at such terrific velocity as to equal the pressure of a bullet driven from the muzzle of a rifle! If a pressure gun is discharged into your skin even from 10 centimeters away, small particles of oil, paint, dirt and rust may get injected into the tissues. Damage seems small and the bit of broken skin seems trivial. Don’t be fooled, you may have a very serious injury. In time the affected area may become severely swollen and painful. Time lapse between the injection and painful swelling depends on the material injected. Paint, paint thinners/solvents immediately cause swelling, inflammation and even tissue death by dissolving the human fatty tissues. Hydraulic fluid may take much longer to become painful but 3 or 4 days later the fluid may cause small cysts to form and burst to the surface. This can continue for months. Scar tissue forms and you get stiffness...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: Firstly, {{to examine}} {{relationships}} between the birth and death addresses of children dying from leukaemia and cancer in Great Britain, and the sites of potential environmental hazards; and secondly to measure relative case densities close to, and at increasing distances from, different hazard types. DESIGN: Home address postcodes (PCs) and their map coordinates were identified at birth and at death in children who died from leukaemia or cancer. Potentially hazardous industrial addresses and PCs were listed from business and other directories, and map coordinates obtained from the Central Postcode Directory or else located directly on Ordnance Survey (OS) maps. Railway lines and motorways were digitised from OS maps. Numbers of deaths (and births) at successive radial distances from these hazards were counted and compared with expected numbers. The latter {{were based on a}} count of all PCs at similar distances. Relative case density ratios at successive distances from the hazards were obtained from observed and expected numbers, aggregated over similar sites. This was repeated for different hazard types and results were tested for evidence of systematic centrifugal case density gradients. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: All 22, 458 children dying from leukaemia or cancer aged 0 - 15 years, in England, Wales, and Scotland, between 1953 and 1980. MAIN RESULTS: Relative excesses of leukaemias and of solid cancers were found near the following: (1) oil refineries, major oil storage installations, railside oil distribution terminals and factories making bitumen products; (2) motor car factories, coach builders, and car body repairers; (3) major users of petroleum products including manufacturers of solvents, <b>paint</b> <b>sprayers,</b> fibreglass fabricators, <b>paint</b> and varnish makers, plastics and detergent manufacturers, and galvanisers; (4) users of kilns and furnaces including steelworks, power stations, galvanisers, cement makers, brickworks, crematoria and aluminium, zinc, and iron/steel foundries; (5) airfields, railways, motorways and harbours. The findings for leukaemias and for solid cancers were indistinguishable. The hazard proximities of birth addresses were stronger than for death addresses. For children who had moved house between birth and death, the proximity effect was limited to the birth addresses. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancers are geographically associated with two main types of industrial atmospheric effluent namely: (1) petroleum derived volatiles and (2) kiln and furnace smoke and gases, and effluents from internal combustion engines...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} general and {{specific}} incidence of occupational asthma within a defined geographic area; to audit {{the diagnosis of}} occupational asthma; to determine proposed mechanisms of asthma; and to determine the employment state of workers at diagnosis. DESIGN [...] A surveillance scheme of physicians likely to see cases of occupational asthma. SETTING [...] The West Midlands Region of the United Kingdom. SUBJECTS [...] Workers with occupational asthma diagnosed {{within the boundaries of}} the West Midlands Region. MAIN MEASURES [...] Demographic data, employer, agent to which exposed, date of diagnosis, method of diagnosis, proposed mechanism of asthma, and employment state. RESULTS [...] A recognised incidence of 43 (95 % confidence interval CI 35 - 52) new cases per million general workers per year was detected. Specific occupational incidences varied from 1833 (95 % CI 511 - 2990) per million <b>paint</b> <b>sprayers</b> to eight per million clerks. Specific incidence by District Health Authority varied from 103 in Solihull to 14 per million general workers in South Warwickshire. Agents to which workers were exposed at the time of diagnosis were generally well recognised (isocyanates 20. 4 %, flour 8. 5 %, colophony 8. 3 %). The most commonly used method of diagnosis was serial peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement. Its use varied (specialist unit 72 %, general chest physicians 50 %, compensation board 48 %). Workers were still exposed and therefore could have usefully performed PEF readings in 4 % of cases where they were omitted from the specialist centre, 16 % seen by chest physicians, and 2 % seen by the Compensation Board. Other methods of diagnosis were used only infrequently outside the specialist unit. Fifty six per cent of reporting physicians considered that the mechanism of asthma was allergy compared with 18 % who believed that it was irritation. Twenty eight per cent of workers were exposed to the suspected causative agent at the time of diagnosis, 38 % were either on long term sickness absence, had retired, or had become unemployed. More workers (38 %) who were exposed to agents recognised for statutory compensation before the 1991 changes seen at the specialist centre reach compensation and were reported to the scheme by the Compensation Board than those seen by chest physicians (9 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] These recognised incidences are likely to be an underestimate of the true incidence. They highlight at risk occupations and suggest underdiagnosis in some District Health Authorities. They suggest that diagnostic methods are underused outside specialist centres and that the mechanism of asthma is generally considered to be allergic...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine biochemical alterations of liver function among <b>paint</b> manufacturers and <b>sprayers</b> associated with exposure to organic solvents. Two paint manufacturing factories and 22 various kinds of spray painting factories (16 car painting, two aircraft painting, three video terminal painting; and one trailer painting) were included. Air concentrations of organic solvents were collected by personal samplers and analysed by gas chromatography. A total of 180 workers were given a comprehensive physical examination, a questionnaire, a liver function test, and a test for hepatitis B surface antigen. The questionnaire contained questions regarding detailed personal medical history, intake of alcohol, and use of medicine. Mixtures of solvents were used throughout the factories, and xylene and toluene were the major components found in almost all air samples with average contents of 46 % and 29 % on a weight basis of 67 air samples. No strong hepatotoxic solvents were detected. Workers were classified according to the different exposure patterns and different air concentrations of breathing zones as: high (eight hour time weighted average (8 h TWA) hygienic effects of solvents 0. 25 - 9. 83, median 1. 66), short term high (8 h TWA hygienic effects of solvents 0 - 3. 38, median 0. 12), and low (8 h TWA hygienic effects of solvents all below 0. 38). After applying a multivariate model to control the non-occupational factors (alcohol, medication, age, and hepatitis B viral infection), increase in gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity was found to be associated with severity of exposure to the mixture of solvents. Because the possible effects on GGT activity of non-occupational factors were controlled for, it is concluded that increased GGT activity among exposed workers may be due to a higher exposure to the mixture of solvents...|$|R
