40|$|Abstract. The {{strength}} {{properties of the}} rock under unloading conditions are essentially different from the rock under loading conditions. At present, the study on the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> rock mass is common, but the research for <b>unloading</b> {{strength properties}} <b>of</b> jointed rock mass, especially the influence of structural plane on unloading strength is seldom. The paper studied the failure characters <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> rock mass, and the influences of structural plane properties on unloading strength based on triaxial test are considered emphatically. Finally the strength criterion <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> rock mass is proposed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of aging on skeletal myocyte apoptosis {{is not well}} understood. In this study we examined apoptosis and apoptotic regulatory factor responses to muscle atrophy induced via limb unloading following loading-induced hypertrophy. Muscle hypertrophy was induced by attaching a weight to one wing of young and aged Japanese quails for 14 days. Removing the weight for 7 or 14 days after the initial 14 days of loading induced muscle atrophy. The contralateral wing served as the intra-animal control. A time-released bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pellet was implanted subcutaneously with wing weighting to identify activated satellite cells/ muscle precursor cells throughout the experimental period. Bcl- 2 mRNA and protein levels decreased after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading,</b> but they were unchanged after 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in young muscles. Bcl- 2 protein level but not mRNA level decreased after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in muscles <b>of</b> aged birds. Seven days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> increased the mRNA level of Bax in muscles from both young and aged birds. Fourteen days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> increased mRNA and protein levels of Bcl- 2, decreased protein levels of Bax, and decreased nuclear apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) protein level in muscles of aged birds. BrdU-positive nuclei were found in all unloaded muscles from both age groups, {{but the number of}} BrdU-positive nuclei relative to the total nuclei decreased after 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> compared with 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> The TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) index was higher after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in both young and aged muscles and after 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in aged muscles. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that almost all of the TUNEL-positive nuclei were also BrdU immunopositive, suggesting that activated satellite cell nuclei (both fused and nonfused) underwent nuclear apoptosis during unloading. There were significant correlations among levels of Bcl- 2, Bax, and AIF and TUNEL index. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that apoptosis regulates, at least in part, unloading-induced muscle atrophy and loss of activated satellite cell nuclei in previously loaded muscles. Moreover, these data suggest that aging influences the apoptotic responses to prolonged unloading following hypertrophy in skeletal myocytes. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|As coal mass {{is often}} at {{unloading}} status during mining process, {{it is of}} great significance to push on the research on permeability evolution <b>of</b> <b>unloaded</b> coal samples at different loading rates. A series <b>of</b> triaxial <b>unloading</b> experiments were conducted for initially intact coal samples using an improved rock mechanics testing system, and the permeability was continuously measured by the constant pressure differential method for methane. Permeability evolution law <b>of</b> <b>unloaded</b> coal samples and the influence mechanism of loading rates on that were studied. The results <b>of</b> triaxial <b>unloading</b> experiments indicate that the permeability of coal samples increases throughout the whole testing process without a descent stage, which {{is different from the}} permeability evolution law in conventional triaxial compression tests. The maximum permeability <b>of</b> <b>unloaded</b> coal sample, which is 4 to 18 times to its initial permeability, often appears before reaching the peak stress and increases with the decrease of axial loading rate. Stress state corresponding to the surge point of permeability <b>of</b> the <b>unloaded</b> coal samples is also discussed...|$|R

After just 4 h, the uptake of 2 -deoxy-D-glucose fell (- 19 percent) and declined further after an additional 20 h <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> This diminution at 24 h was associated with slower oxidation of C- 14 -glucose and incorporation of C- 14 -glucose into glycogen.

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypotheses}} that apoptotic suppressors: (a) increase during muscle overload, (b) decrease {{in response to}} unloading following hypertrophy, and (c) respond to unloading in an aging-dependent fashion. Following 14 days of stretch-induced overloading, the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) was elevated by 140 % and 116 % in patagialis (PAT) muscles of young and old quail, respectively, {{when compared to the}} contralateral control side. XIAP messenger RNA (mRNA) or protein was not different in experimental and control muscles of young birds after 7 or 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> In old birds, PAT XIAP mRNA and protein were 47 % and 67 % greater in experimental than in control muscles, respectively, after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> Furthermore, XIAP mRNA had returned to control level by 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading,</b> but XIAP protein content was 57 % greater than control muscles after 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> Higher levels <b>of</b> XIAP during <b>unloading</b> in old than in young muscles may be an attempt to counterbalance apoptosis-induced muscle atrophy.

40|$|Apoptotic {{signaling}} {{was examined}} in the patagialis (PAT) muscles of young adult and old quail. One wing was loaded for 14 days to induce hypertrophy and then unloaded for 7 or 14 days to induce muscle atrophy. Although the nuclear Id 2 protein content was not different between unloaded and control muscles in either age group, cytoplasmic Id 2 protein content <b>of</b> <b>unloaded</b> muscles was higher than that in contralateral control muscles after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in young quails. Nuclear and cytoplasmic p 53 contents and the p 53 nuclear index <b>of</b> the <b>unloaded</b> muscles were higher than those in control muscles after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in young quails, whereas in aged quails, the p 53 and Id 2 contents and p 53 nuclear index <b>of</b> the <b>unloaded</b> muscles were not altered by unloading. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that myo-nuclei and activated satellite cell nuclei contributed to the increased number of p 53 -positive nuclei. Conversely, unloading in either young adult or aged PAT muscles did not alter c-Myc protein content. Although Cu-Zn-SOD content was not different in unloaded and control muscles, Mn-SOD content increased in PAT muscles after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in young quails, suggesting that unloading induced an oxidative disturbance in these muscles. Moderate correlational relationships existed among Id 2, p 53, c-Myc, SOD, apoptosis-regulatory factors, and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling index. These data indicate that Id 2 and p 53 {{are involved in the}} apoptotic responses during unloading-induced muscle atrophy after hypertrophy in young adult birds. Furthermore, our data suggest that there is an aging-dependent regulation of Id 2 and p 53 during <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> previously hypertrophied muscles.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the process}} of deep tunnel excavation, the {{surrounding}} rock mass, which often endures high initial geo-stress, is in the state <b>of</b> typical <b>unloading.</b> As the adjustment of stress induced by excavation, rock mass behaves a peculiar kind of mechanical deformation characteristics, different from those in loading conditions. As thus, a series <b>of</b> representative <b>unloading</b> tests on hard granite from DaGangShan power station in China, which is being excavation at 1500 meters deep below earth surface, are carried out to simulate dynamically excavation process for studying the peculiar mechanical deformation characteristics. On the basis <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> tests, a series of research results are acquired as follows： (1) Under unloading condition, lateral deformation occurs in the unloading direction and volumetric strain changes from compression deformation to dilation deformation. (2) Under unloading condition, hard granites behave brittle failure and Mogi-coulomb criterion can well describe the failure characteristics. (3) According to curves <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> tests, the constitutive model is deduced for simulation analysis...|$|R

40|$|Interleukin- 15 (IL- 15) mRNA is constitutively {{expressed}} in skeletal muscle. Although IL- 15 has proposed hypertrophic and anti-apoptotic roles in vitro, {{its role in}} skeletal muscle cells in vivo is less clear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if skeletal muscle aging and unloading, two conditions known to promote muscle atrophy, would alter basal IL- 15 expression in skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that IL- 15 mRNA expression would increase as a result of both aging and muscle unloading and that muscle would express the mRNA for a functional trimeric IL- 15 receptor (IL- 15 R). Two models <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> were used in this study: hindlimb suspension (HS) in rats and wing unloading in quail. The absolute muscle wet weight of plantaris and soleus muscles from aged rats was significantly less when compared with muscles from young adult rats. Although 14 days of HS resulted in reduced muscle mass of plantaris and soleus muscles from young adult animals, this effect was not observed in muscles from aged animals. A significant aging times unloading interaction was observed for IL- 15 mRNA in both rat soleus and plantaris muscles. Patagialis (PAT) muscles from aged quail retained a significant 12 and 6 % of stretch-induced hypertrophy after 7 and 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading,</b> respectively. PAT muscles from young quail retained 15 % hypertrophy at 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> but regressed to control levels following 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> A main effect of age was observed on IL- 15 mRNA expression in PAT muscles at 14 days of overload, 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading,</b> and 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> Skeletal muscle also expressed the mRNAs for a functional IL- 15 R composed of IL- 15 RÎ±, IL- 2 / 15 R-Î², and -Î³c. Based on these data, we speculate that increases in IL- 15 mRNA in response to atrophic stimuli may be an attempt to counteract muscle mass loss in skeletal muscles of old animals. Additional research is warranted to determine the importance of the IL- 15 /IL- 15 R system to counter muscle wasting. Copyright Â© 2007 the American Physiological Society.
