25|$|The folio size, 307 × 445mm, has {{the ratio}} of 1.45:1. The <b>printed</b> <b>area</b> had the same ratio, and was shifted {{out of the middle}} to leave a 2:1 white margin, both {{horizontally}} and vertically. Historian John Man writes that the ratio was chosen to be close to the golden ratio of 1.61:1. To reach this ratio more closely the vertical size should be 338mm, but {{there is no reason why}} Gutenberg would let this non-trivial difference of 8mm go by in a work so detailed in other aspects.|$|E
25|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, the {{mechanics}} of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, Lord Stanhope had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the <b>printed</b> <b>area.</b> With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, it doubled the output of the old style press. Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, {{after more}} sheets had been printed, {{the number of}} lines per page was {{increased}} from 40 to 42, presumably to save paper. Therefore, pages 1 to 9 and pages 256 to 265, presumably the first ones printed, have 40 lines each. Page 10 has 41, and from there on the 42 lines appear. The increase in line number was achieved by decreasing the interline spacing, rather than increasing the <b>printed</b> <b>area</b> of the page. Finally, the print run was increased, necessitating resetting those pages which had already been printed. The new sheets were all reset to 42 lines per page. Consequently, there are two distinct settings in folios 1-32 and 129-158 of volume I and folios 1-16 and 162 of volume II.|$|E

2500|$|The Gutenberg {{press was}} much more {{efficient}} than manual copying. It remained largely unchanged in the eras of John Baskerville and Giambattista Bodoni, over 300 years later. By 1800, Lord Stanhope had constructed a press completely from cast iron, reducing the force required by 90% while doubling {{the size of the}} <b>printed</b> <b>area.</b> While Stanhope's [...] "mechanical theory" [...] had improved the efficiency of the press, it was only capable of 250 sheets per hour. German printer Friedrich Koenig was the first to design a non-manpowered machine—using steam. He moved to London in 1804, and met Thomas Bensley; he secured financial support for his project in 1807. With a patent in 1810, Koenig designed a steam press [...] "much like a hand press connected to a steam engine." [...] The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811.|$|E
2500|$|The {{paper size}} is 'double folio', with two pages printed {{on each side}} (four pages per sheet). After {{printing}} the paper was folded once {{to the size of}} a single page. Typically, five of these folded sheets (10 leaves, or 20 printed pages) were combined to a single physical section, called a quinternion, that could then be bound into a book. Some sections, however, had as few as four leaves or as many as 12 leaves. Some sections may have been printed in a larger number, especially those printed later in the publishing process, and sold unbound. The pages were not numbered. The technique was not new, since it had been used to make blank [...] "white-paper" [...] books to be written afterwards. What was new was determining beforehand the correct placement and orientation of each page on the five sheets to result in the correct sequence when bound. The technique for locating the <b>printed</b> <b>area</b> correctly on each page was also new.|$|E
