25|$|The first {{condition}} {{is to allow}} for applications near band edges.

The fourth condition is that which allows a 2:1 operation bandwidth.

25|$|All {{circuits}} have, in practice, some inductance, {{which may}} have beneficial or detrimental effects. For a tuned circuit, inductance is used to provide a frequency-selective circuit. Practical inductors {{may be used to}} provide filtering, or energy storage, in a given network. The inductance <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>length</b> of a transmission line is one of the properties that determines its characteristic impedance; balancing the inductance and capacitance of cables is important for distortion-free telegraphy and telephony. The inductance of long AC power transmission lines affects the power capacity of the line. Sensitive circuits, such as microphone and computer network cables, may utilize special cabling construction, limiting the inductive coupling between circuits.|$|E

25|$|In 1714, Brook Taylor derived the {{fundamental}} frequency of a stretched vibrating string {{in terms of its}} tension and mass <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>length</b> by solving a differential equation. The Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782) made important mathematical studies of the behavior of gases, anticipating the kinetic theory of gases developed more than a century later, and has been referred to as the first mathematical physicist. In 1733, Daniel Bernoulli derived {{the fundamental}} frequency and harmonics of a hanging chain by solving a differential equation. In 1734, Bernoulli solved the differential equation for the vibrations of an elastic bar clamped at one end. Bernoulli's treatment of fluid dynamics and his examination of fluid flow was introduced in his 1738 work Hydrodynamica.|$|E
25|$|Because Los Angeles {{is older}} than most other cities in California, the LADWP is {{currently}} faced with several unique issues. Most of the power lines in Los Angeles were built above-ground before it became customary to run power lines below-ground; as a result, the horizon line of the typical Los Angeles boulevard looks much more cluttered than boulevards in most Southern California cities. Starting in 2007, LADWP has a long-term project to upgrade the overhead power lines and convert them to underground. This difficult conversion has been slowed by budget constraints, the impact on traffic, the pursuit of other modernization projects, and the lingering effects of a workforce reduction over the last decade. Budget issues are particularly acute in the department's transmission system, where underground transmission costs about 10 to 14 times the cost of overhead transmission, <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>length,</b> and the technical and environmental challenges which confront such installations. Additionally, undergrounding of the three 500 kV transmission lines (five lines, if the Pacific AC Intertie's two 500 kV lines terminating in Los Angeles are included) is presently technically infeasible. Upgrading the overhead lines {{is expected to take}} 10 to 15 years. The upgrading of LADWP's overhead power lines consists of eliminating the V-shape brackets on the power poles that are holding up the crossarm and replacing them with cross-brackets that are put on the crossarm. Some of the wooden power poles are being replaced with metal poles.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA wire-cylinder-plate {{electrode}} configuration {{is presented}} to generate ionic wind with a dc corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. The objective {{of the work is}} to maximize the power supplied to the flow in order to increase acceleration while avoiding breakdown. Thus, the proposed experimental setup addresses the problem of decoupling the mechanism of ion generation from that of ion acceleration. Using a wire-plate configuration as a reference, we have focused on improving the topography of the electric field to (1) separate the ionization and acceleration zones in space, and (2) guide the trajectory of charged particles as parallel to the median axis as possible. In the proposed wire-cylinder-plate setup, a dc corona discharge is generated in the space between a wire and two cylinders. The ions produced by the corona then drift past the cylinders and into a channel between two plates, where they undergo acceleration. To maximize the ionic wind it is found that the geometric configuration must be as compact as possible and that the voltage applied must be right below breakdown. Experimentally, the optimized wire-plate reference setup provides a maximum flow velocity of 8 m s− 1, a flow rate <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> electrode <b>length</b> of 0. 034 m 2 s− 1, and a thrust <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> electrode <b>length</b> of 0. 24 N m− 1. The wire-cylinder-plate configuration provides a maximum flow velocity of 10 m s− 1, a flow rate <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> electrode <b>length</b> of 0. 041 m 2 s− 1, and a thrust <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> electrode <b>length</b> of 0. 35 N m− 1. This 46 % increase in thrust is obtained by increasing the electric power <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> electrode <b>length</b> by only 16 % (from 175 to 210 W m− 1), which confirms the gain in efficiency obtained with the decoupled system. In comparison with a simple wire-wire corona configuration, the wire-cylinder-plate configuration increases the ionic wind velocity by up to a factor of 3, and the thrust by an order of magnitude...|$|R
