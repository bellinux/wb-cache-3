50|$|As {{in other}} Scorpionidae, the venom of Pandinus species is rather mild, human {{fatalities}} are unknown. Symptoms are mostly restricted to local pain, described {{similar to those}} of a bee sting. At least P. imperator rarely stings at all, and often prefers to use its massive <b>pincers</b> <b>for</b> prey capture and even for defense. The defensive behavior of the other species is not yet studied in detail.|$|R

30|$|There {{existing}} {{a number}} of non-destructive inspection techniques <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> structures which give some rough sketches of the interior structure, few of them provides concrete and complete interior information of concrete structures. A few years ago, the X-ray computerized tomography (CT <b>for</b> short) <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> structures being practicalized, it costs very expensive {{and the effect of}} the X-rays to human bodies and the environment cannot be ignored. Therefore it is not suitable to apply the X-ray CT for the daily maintenance of concrete structures. It is required to develop a safe, cheaply running and concretely interior-describing non-destructive inspection technique <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> structures, to establish which is our main purpose. In view of the above argument, the authors are trying to develop an ultrasonic CT technique <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> structures. In this paper, as the first step of its development, we study how the ultrasonic waves propagate in concrete structures and pose a problem to develop ultrasonic CT, applying which we propose a non-destructive inspection technique <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> cover by application of the ultrasonic CT <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> structures.|$|R

40|$|A {{generation}} {{method of}} three-dimensional {{finite element model}} based on CT image <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> crack is proposed. Aiming at concrete crack, firstly, the paper adopts watershed algorithm to achieve the segmentation of CT image <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> crack and uses Canny operator to extract the crack edges. Secondly, by using Marching Cubes algorithm the three-dimensional surface model <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> crack is constructed. Finally, {{on the basis of}} three-dimensional surface model, the paper employs constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) algorithm to generate three-dimensional finite element model <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> crack. In the paper, the finite element method (FEM) software ABAQUS is used to achieve the analysis of loading for crack regions. The results show that this proposed method can achieve three-dimensional finite element model generation of concrete structures and mechanical analysis for the cracks which significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of numerical simulation <b>for</b> the <b>concrete</b> structures...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella is an {{important}} foodborne pathogen often associated with poultry and highly prevalent in poultry processing plants. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the efficacy of a commercial grade <b>concrete</b> sealant (BioSealed <b>for</b> <b>Concrete</b> TM) to prevent bacterial attachment, colonization and antimicrobial effects against multiple strains of Salmonella (S. enteritidis, S. Kentucky, S. Typhimurium, S. Senftenberg and S. Heidelberg) on concrete blocks. Individual strains of Salmonella spp. were inoculated onto the concrete blocks and divided into 4 different treatment groups: (A) Bricks which were not treated with BioSealed <b>for</b> <b>Concrete</b> TM (B) Bricks which were treated with BioSealed <b>for</b> <b>Concrete</b> TM before inoculation (C) Bricks which were treated with BioSealed <b>for</b> <b>Concrete</b> TM after inoculation and (D) Bricks which were treated with BioSealed <b>for</b> <b>Concrete</b> TM before and after inoculation. External and internal surfaces of the treated concrete blocks were swabbed, serially diluted and plated onto XLD agar. Reductions of survival counts were enumerated and recorded as log 10 CFU/cm 2. Significantly (p 0. 05) in the survival populations of Salmonella were observed between treatments A and B for all five strains tested and between treatments C and D for any of the strains tested. This indicates that BioSealed <b>for</b> <b>Concrete</b> TM proved to be a potent antimicrobial against multiple strains of Salmonella and can be used as an alternative method to control this pathogen in processing plant environments...|$|R
