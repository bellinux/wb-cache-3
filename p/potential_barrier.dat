5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump <b>potential</b> <b>barrier</b> Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E
5|$|Khan's {{selection}} {{as a candidate}} was {{seen as part of}} a wider move towards the left in Labour that emerged during the 2015 leadership election that followed Miliband's resignation. Key policies that Khan proposed included a London 'living rent'; a quota system for ethnic minority officers in the Metropolitan Police; increased home building; and a campaign for a London Living Wage. Commentators raised Khan's Muslim religion as a <b>potential</b> <b>barrier</b> to election, after a poll (not mentioning Khan by name) suggested that 31% of Londoners would be 'uncomfortable' with a Muslim mayor. Khan, who was London's first Muslim MP, argued that the election of a Muslim could encourage London to become recognised as a more cosmopolitan city. While Khan had stated that he would serve a full term as MP for Tooting if he were to become Mayor of London, he later announced that would stand down as MP for Tooting if he were elected Mayor.|$|E

30|$|<b>Potential</b> <b>barriers</b> around {{quantum dots}} (QDs) {{play a key}} role in {{kinetics}} of photoelectrons. These barriers are always created, when electrons from dopants outside QDs fill the dots. <b>Potential</b> <b>barriers</b> suppress the capture processes of photoelectrons and increase the photoresponse. To directly investigate the effect of <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> on photoelectron kinetics, we fabricated several QD structures with different positions of dopants and various levels of doping. The <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> as a function of doping and dopant positions have been determined using nextnano 3 software. We experimentally investigated the photoresponse to IR radiation as a function of the radiation frequency and voltage bias. We also measured the dark current in these QD structures. Our investigations show that the photoresponse increases ~ 30 times as the height of <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> changes from 30 to 130 meV.|$|R

25|$|The Klein paradox, {{discovered}} by Oskar Klein in 1928, presented further quantum mechanical {{objections to the}} notion of an electron confined within a nucleus. Derived from the Dirac equation, this clear and precise paradox showed that a high-energy electron approaching a <b>potential</b> <b>barrier</b> has a high probability of passing through the barrier, or escaping, by transforming to a particle of negative mass. Apparently, an electron could not be confined within a nucleus by any potential well. The meaning of this paradox was intensely debated at the time.|$|E
25|$|Photoemission {{can occur}} from any material, {{but it is}} most easily {{observable}} from metals or other conductors because the process produces a charge imbalance, and if this charge imbalance is not neutralized by current flow (enabled by conductivity), the <b>potential</b> <b>barrier</b> to emission increases until the emission current ceases. It is also usual to have the emitting surface in a vacuum, since gases impede the flow of photoelectrons and make them difficult to observe. Additionally, the energy barrier to photoemission is usually increased by thin oxide layers on metal surfaces if the metal has been exposed to oxygen, so most practical experiments and devices based on the photoelectric effect use clean metal surfaces in a vacuum.|$|E
25|$|In the {{theoretical}} {{physics of the}} false vacuum, the system moves to a lower energy state– either the true vacuum, or another, lower energy vacuum– through {{a process known as}} bubble nucleation. In this, instanton effects cause a bubble to appear in which fields have their true vacuum values inside. Therefore, the interior of the bubble has a lower energy. The walls of the bubble (or domain walls) have a surface tension, as energy is expended as the fields roll over the <b>potential</b> <b>barrier</b> to the lower energy vacuum. The most likely size of the bubble is determined in the semi-classical approximation to be such that the bubble has zero total change in the energy: the decrease in energy by the true vacuum in the interior is compensated by the tension of the walls.|$|E

25|$|Researchers in {{the field}} do not agree on a theory for cold fusion. One {{proposal}} considers that hydrogen and its isotopes can be absorbed in certain solids, including palladium hydride, at high densities. This creates a high partial pressure, reducing the average separation of hydrogen isotopes. However, the reduction in separation is not enough {{by a factor of}} ten to create the fusion rates claimed in the original experiment. It was also proposed that a higher density of hydrogen inside the palladium and a lower <b>potential</b> <b>barrier</b> could raise the possibility of fusion at lower temperatures than expected from a simple application of Coulomb's law. Electron screening of the positive hydrogen nuclei by the negative electrons in the palladium lattice was suggested to the 2004 DOE commission, but the panel found the theoretical explanations not convincing and inconsistent with current physics theories.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate forces {{opposing}} Sherman's advance {{were from}} the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, commanded by Lt. Gen. John C.

Although the Union forces outnumbered the men to their front by two to one (30,720 to 13,792), they faced a formidable maze of both natural and man-made defenses. First was a thick entanglement of trees, which was broken intermittently by swampland. Chickasaw Bayou, a stream that was chest-deep, 50 yards wide, and choked with trees, also acted as a <b>potential</b> <b>barrier</b> to Sherman's men because it was parallel to the planned line of advance and could interrupt communication between units.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> {{and facilitators}} to change should guide {{the choice of}} {{implementation}} strategy. Implementation researchers believe that existing methods {{for the evaluation of}} <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> and facilitators are not satisfactory. Discrete choice experiments (DCE) are relatively new in the health care sector to investigate preferences, and may be of value in the field of implementation research. The objective of our study was to investigate the complementary value of DCE for the evaluation of barriers and facilitators in implementation research. Methods Clinical subject was the implementation of the guideline for breast cancer surgery in day care. We identified 17 <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> and facilitators to the implementation of this guideline. We used a traditional questionnaire that was made up of statements about the <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> and facilitators. Respondents answered 17 statements on a five-point scale ranging from one (fully disagree) to five (fully agree). The <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> and facilitators were included in the DCE as decision attributes. Data were gathered among anaesthesiologists, surgical oncologists, and breast care nurses by means of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. Results The overall response was 10 %. The most striking finding was that the responses to the traditional questionnaire hardly differentiated between barriers. Forty-seven percent of the respondents thought that DCE is an inappropriate method. These respondents considered DCE too difficult and too time-consuming. Unlike the traditional questionnaire, the results of a DCE provide implementation researchers and clinicians with a relative attribute importance ranking {{that can be used to}} prioritize <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> and facilitators to change, and hence to better fine-tune the implementation strategies to the specific problems and challenges of a particular implementation process. Conclusion The results of our DCE and traditional questionnaire would probably lead to different implementation strategies. Although there is no 'gold standard' for prioritising <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> and facilitators to the implementation of change, theoretically, DCE would be the method of choice. However, the feasibility of using DCE was less favourable. Further empirical applications should investigate whether DCE can really make a valuable contribution to the implementation science. </p...|$|R

On mono-crystalline silicon, measurement accuracy of this contactless inline technique has already been demonstrated. In this work the investigation of measurement accuracy is extended to multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) and reveals for base resistance measurements severe measurement artifacts of up to a factor 2 upon chemical standard treatments, such as damage etching and acidic texturization. The investigation identifies <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> at grain boundaries as reason for these artifacts which form upon chemical treatments and further increase with storage time after such chemical steps. It is found that these <b>potential</b> <b>barriers</b> vanish almost completely after thermal treatments, such as a standard emitter diffusion. As a consequence, the emitter sheet resistance calculated from the inductive sheet resistances before and after emitter diffusion may be significantly underestimated if the presumed base resistance is overestimated.
