40|$|Abstract-The technicaland safety {{requirements}} for intracochlear electrical stimulation to restore {{hearing in the}} profoundly deaf are reviewed. A svaern has been implantedin human subjects which comprises a 16 -contact. flexible electrode arra. y, radio receiver/stimulator and surg&al disconnect which permits changing from <b>percutaneous</b> <b>cable</b> to transcutaneous telemetry. The design, fabrication, and mechanical and electrical testing {{of each of the}} components are discussed in detail. Major improvements over previous systems include controlled introduction of anisotropic flexing properties in the electrode a r a y to facilitate insertion and optimal contact orientation, enlarged and stabilised contact surface area {{and the development of a}} new connector technology which combines high density, high reliability, biocompatibility and ease of operation during surgery...|$|E
40|$|Ventricular assist device (VAD) {{implantation}} {{has become}} an established treatment {{in the case of}} end-stage heart failure. One of the most important limitations is represented by the need of an extra-corporeal power supply and controller connected to the pump through a <b>percutaneous</b> <b>cable.</b> This may lead to local or even systemic infections that can jeopardize post-operative results. In the case of cable infections, medical treatment is usually less effective {{because of the presence of}} biofilms reduces the probability of complete pathogen eradication with specific antibiotic therapy (1). Nowadays ultrasound (US) imaging and computed tomography (CT) are recognized to be the best diagnostic tools to detect and define VAD specific infections. These diagnostic tools allow to identify the presence of infective effusions around the implante...|$|E
50|$|Another {{technology}} undergoing {{clinical trials}} {{is the use}} of trans cutaneous induction to power and control the device rather than using <b>percutaneous</b> <b>cables.</b> Apart from the obvious cosmetic advantage this reduces the risk of infection and the consequent need to take preventative action. A pulsatile pump using this technology has CE Mark approval and is in clinical trials for US FDA approval.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical circulatory support devices, such as total {{artificial}} {{hearts and}} left ventricular assist devices, rely on external energy sources for their continuous operation. Clinically approved power supplies rely on <b>percutaneous</b> <b>cables</b> connecting an external energy source to the implanted device {{with the associated}} risk of infections. One alternative, investigated in the 70 s and 80 s, employs a fully implanted nuclear power source. The heat generated by the nuclear decay can be converted into electricity to power circulatory support devices. Due to the low conversion efficiencies, substantial levels of waste heat are generated and must be dissipated to avoid tissue damage, heat stroke, and death. The present work computationally evaluates {{the ability of the}} blood flow in the descending aorta to remove the locally generated waste heat for subsequent full-body distribution and dissipation, with the specific aim of investigating methods for containment of local peak temperatures within physiologically acceptable limits. To this aim, coupled fluid–solid heat transfer computational models of the blood flow in the human aorta and different heat exchanger architectures are developed. Particle tracking is used to evaluate temperature histories of cells passing through the heat exchanger region. The use of the blood flow in the descending aorta as a heat sink proves to be a viable approach for the removal of waste heat loads. With the basic heat exchanger design, blood thermal boundary layer temperatures exceed 50 °C, possibly damaging blood cells and proteins. Improved designs of the heat exchanger, with the addition of fins and heat guides, allow for drastically lower blood temperatures, possibly leading to a more biocompatible implant. The ability to maintain blood temperatures at biologically compatible levels will ultimately allow for the body-wise distribution, and subsequent dissipation, of heat loads with minimum effects on the human physiology...|$|R
