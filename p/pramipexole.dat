5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, <b>pramipexole,</b> ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|Pharyngitis {{may also}} be caused by mechanical, {{chemical}} or thermal irritation, for example cold air or acid reflux. Some medications may produce pharyngitis such as <b>pramipexole</b> and antipsychotics.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} (e.g. <b>pramipexole</b> and ropinirole) {{resulted in}} some improvement in {{a minority of}} people, but numerous side effects, including the onset of impulse control disorders like compulsive gambling and shopping, have led to concern about this approach.|$|E
25|$|Restless leg {{syndrome}} may resolve if {{the underlying}} problem is addressed. Otherwise treatment includes lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes that may help include stopping alcohol and tobacco use, and sleep hygiene. Medications used include levodopa or a dopamine agonist such as <b>pramipexole.</b> RLS affects an estimated 2.5–15% of the American population. Females are more commonly affected than males and it becomes more common with age.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} in {{the brain}} have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors. Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa, but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms {{with the aim of}} delaying motor complications. When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, <b>pramipexole,</b> ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine, and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|Medication {{is often}} not {{necessary}} in children as symptoms usually alleviate spontaneously as the child ages. However, because the disorder may affect wakeful behavior, many adults who continue to suffer from RMD may seek treatment. Benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants have been considered as therapeutic options in managing the disorder. Infantile and adolescent RMD respond well to low doses of clonazepam. Prescription medications such as ropinirole or <b>pramipexole</b> given to restless legs syndrome patients do not show any clinical improvement in many patients with RMD.|$|E
25|$|The {{dopamine}} neurotransmitter mediates synaptic transmission by binding to five specific GPCRs. These five receptor proteins {{are separated}} into two classes due {{to whether the}} response elicits an excitatory or inhibitory response on the post-synaptic cell. There are many types of drugs, legal and illegal, that effect dopamine and its interactions in the brain. With Parkinson's disease, a disease that decreases the amount of dopamine in the brain, the dopamine precursor Levodopa {{is given to the}} patient {{due to the fact that}} dopamine cannot cross the blood–brain barrier and L-dopa can. Some dopamine agonists are also given to Parkinson's patients that have a disorder known as restless leg syndrome or RLS. Some examples of these are ropinirole and <b>pramipexole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a common {{neurological}} disorder characterized by a degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra {{and a loss of}} dopamine in the putamen. It is described as a motor disease, but it also produces cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The most common treatment is dopamine replacement therapy, which consists in the administration of levodopa (L-Dopa) or dopamine agonists (such as <b>pramipexole</b> or ropinirole) to patients. Dopamine replacement therapy is well known to improve motor symptoms but its effects in cognitive and behavioral symptoms are more complex. Dopamine has been related to the normal learning of stimuli with behavioral and motivational significance, attention, and most importantly the reward system. In accordance with the role of dopamine in reward processing, addictive drugs stimulate dopamine release. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, the role of dopamine in the reward system and addiction has been proposed as the origin of DDS. Models of addiction have been used to explain how dopamine replacement therapy produces DDS. One of these models of addiction proposes that over the usage course of a drug there is a habituation to the rewarding that it produces at the initial stages. This habituation is thought to be dopamine mediated. With long-term administration of L-dopa the reward system gets used to it and needs higher quantities. As the user increases drug intake there is a loss of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum which acts in addition to an impairment in goal-direction mental functions to produce an enhancement of sensitization to dopamine therapy. The behavioral and mood symptoms of the syndrome are produced by the dopamine overdose.|$|E
50|$|While <b>pramipexole</b> is used {{clinically}} (see below), its D3-preferring {{receptor binding}} profile {{has made it}} a popular tool compound for preclinical research. For example, <b>pramipexole</b> has been used (in combination with D2- and or D3-preferring antagonists) to discover the role of D3 receptor function in rodent models and tasks for neuropsychiatric disorders. Of note, it appears that <b>pramipexole,</b> {{in addition to having}} effects on dopamine D3 receptors, may also affect mitochondrial function via a mechanism that remains less understood. A pharmacological approach to separate dopaminergic from non-dopaminergic (e.g. mitochondrial) effects of <b>pramipexole</b> has been to study the effects of the R-stereoisomer of <b>pramipexole</b> (which has much lower affinity to the dopamine receptors when compared to the S-isomer) side-by-side with the effects of the S-isomer.|$|E

50|$|Commonly used {{medications}} for EPS are anticholinergic agents such as benztropine (Cogentin), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), and trihexyphenidyl (Artane).
