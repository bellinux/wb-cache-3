5|$|During June–August 1906, the {{government}} proposed quadrupling the postage rate for second-class mail, which included newspapers, from one cent to four cents per pound. In response, Boyce proposed buying the Post Office Department for $300million (USD), {{claiming that he}} would reduce <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> by half, eliminate chronic deficits by applying business methods to postal operations, establish a rural postal express, pay rent to the United States Department of the Treasury for postal buildings, and return profits over seven percent. This offer was rejected by {{the government}}, but it did halt their planned second-class postage rate increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> followed broadly British practice and new services, like airmail and express delivery, were added over the years. From 1926 reduced rates applied for mail to Britain and Ireland, and from 1 March 1938 to 4 September 1939, Palestine {{was part of}} the All Up Empire airmail rates system.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> resulted in two new values on 6 January 2003. Two more were released on 25 August {{of the same}} year. The 75c showed a ringed plover and the 95c depicted a sparrowhawk. The August releases were priced at 7c and 48c using the stonechat and peregrin falcon designs. As usual these were printed in sheets of 100.|$|E

25|$|The {{last of the}} Gerl definitives {{consisted}} of 14 dog designs, 9 elk designs and 6 winged ox and eagle designs issued on 17 different dates between 1974 and 1980. For {{the first time a}} £1 value was put on sale. Some of the values produced were to replace different values as needed because of changing <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> due to inflation. Unwatermarked paper, that had been introduced with the 1972 Christmas stamp, was used {{for the first time on}} definitives.|$|E
25|$|Definitive stamps — stamps for {{everyday}} postage {{and are usually}} produced to meet current <b>postal</b> <b>rates.</b> They often have less appealing designs than commemoratives, though there are notable exceptions. The same design {{may be used for}} many years. The use of the same design over an extended period may lead to unintended color varieties. This may make them just as interesting to philatelists as are commemoratives. A good example would be the US 1903 regular issues, their designs being very picturesque and ornamental. Definitive stamps are often issued in a series of stamps with different denominations.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial edict of 12 Ramasan 1256 {{and later}} {{ordinances}} made {{the distinction between}} three types of mail items: ordinary letters, registered letters (markings te'ahudd olunmoshdur), and official letters (markings tahirat-i mühümme). Fees were calculated {{by the type of}} mail, the weight, and the distance (measured in hours): in 1840, an ordinary letter, weighing less than 10g, had a cost per hour of 1 para. Special fees applied to samples, insured mail, special delivery, and printed matters, etc. These <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> changed frequently, and new services were added over the years. Upon joining the Universal Postal Union on 1 July 1875, Ottoman overseas rates conformed to UPU rules.|$|E

5000|$|Faced in 1978 {{with the}} problem of {{supplying}} stamps to satisfy an anticipated <b>postal</b> <b>rate</b> increase that had not yet been specifically determined, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp bearing the letter [...] "A" [...] instead of a numerical denomination, announcing that this stamp would cover whatever new first-class <b>postal</b> <b>rate</b> was approved by congress. Subsequent decades saw the issue of B, C, D, E, F, G and H stamps that similarly covered the periodic later rate increases.|$|R
25|$|In early May 1948, the Jewish {{provisional}} government, {{known as}} Minhelet Ha'am, {{did not have}} its own postage stamps ready, so it used existing labels, both JNF labels, which otherwise have been printed since 1902 for fundraising purposes, and local community tax stamps. The JNF labels were given a Hebrew overprint meaning postage (doar), (as shown in the picture), whereas local community tax stamps were not given overprints. The JNF stamps were printed from May 3 to 14, 1948, their sale ended on May 14, 1948, with remaining stocks ordered to be returned and destroyed. Use of these stamps was tolerated until May 22, 1948. The Mandate's <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> remained unchanged during this period.|$|E
25|$|As {{the least}} {{improved}} {{section of the}} original Albany Post Road, it {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1982. Its history as a formal road dates to the mid-17th century, when it was built on established Native American trails. Later it would see military use, particularly by the Continental Army during the Revolution, and commercial use as part of a stagecoach route. Some of the milestones placed {{during the early years of}} American independence to more accurately calculate <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> are still present and have been preserved and restored. It is still in public use and maintained by the town. The town has recently angered some of the residents by proposing to pave the road.|$|E
25|$|Hill has two legacies. The {{first was}} his model for {{education}} of the emerging middle classes. The second was his model for an efficient postal system to serve business and the public, including the postage stamp and the system of low and uniform <b>postal</b> <b>rates,</b> which is often taken for granted in the modern World. In this, he not only changed postal services around the world, but also made commerce more efficient and profitable, notwithstanding {{the fact that it}} took 30 years before the British Post Office's revenue recovered to the level it had been at in 1839. Uniform Penny Post continued in the UK into the 20th century, and at one point, one penny paid for up to four ounces.|$|E

When giving the contract the King, Stefan Batory, introduced a uniform <b>postal</b> <b>rate</b> of 4 groszy per letter not exceeding 1 łut (about 12.66 grams) for any distance in Poland. This was the first uniform <b>postal</b> <b>rate</b> to be introduced in the world. Sebastiano Montelupi died in 1600 aged 84 and Valerio Montelupi continued to run the postal service till his death in 1613.|$|R
25|$|Postal {{history has}} become a philatelic {{collecting}} speciality in its own right. Whereas traditional philately {{is concerned with the}} study of the stamps per se, including the technical aspects of stamp production and distribution, philatelic postal history refers to stamps as historical documents; similarly re postmarks, postcards, envelopes and the letters they contain. Postal history can include the study of <b>postal</b> <b>rates,</b> postal policy, postal administration, political effects on postal systems, postal surveillance and the consequences of politics, business, and culture on postal systems; basically {{anything to do with the}} function of the collection, transportation and delivery of mail. The specialized area of philatelic history defines postal history as the study of rates charged for postal services provided, routes followed and special handling of letters. Areas of special interest include disrupted or transitional periods, such as wars and military occupations, and mail to remote areas.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s {{at least}} 12½% of all British mail was {{conveyed}} under the personal frank of peers, dignitaries {{and members of}} parliament, while censorship and political espionage were conducted by postal officials. Fundamentally, the postal system was mismanaged, wasteful, expensive and slow. It had become inadequate {{for the needs of}} an expanding commercial and industrial nation. There is a well-known story, probably apocryphal, about how Hill gained an interest in reforming the postal system; he apparently noticed a young woman too poor to redeem a letter sent to her by her fiancé. At that time, letters were normally paid for by the recipient, not the sender. The recipient could simply refuse delivery. Frauds were commonplace; for example, coded information could appear {{on the cover of the}} letter; the recipient would examine the cover to gain the information, and then refuse delivery to avoid payment. Each individual letter had to be logged. In addition, <b>postal</b> <b>rates</b> were complex, depending on the distance and the number of sheets in the letter.|$|E

500|$|The {{last few}} years of Galaxys life were marked by stories of unpaid contributors. John Varley, for example, {{reported}} {{that he was still}} owed money for his stories five years after they appeared. [...] Submissions from well-known writers fell away, and the lack of financial support from UPD meant that the pay rate was an unattractive one cent per word. [...] Higher <b>postal</b> <b>rates,</b> higher paper costs, and continuing competition from the paperback science fiction market all added to the pressure on Galaxy. These problems were not resolved by the sale to McCaffrey, who did not even have enough money to pay for circulation postage, with the result that not every Galaxy subscriber received a copy of the final issue. [...] Frederik Pohl places the blame for Galaxys demise on Arnie Abramson, who, Pohl contends, [...] "simply did not perform [...] basic functions of a publisher": paying the authors, ensuring subscribers received copies, and meeting other obligations.|$|E
