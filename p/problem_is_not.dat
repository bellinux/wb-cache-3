5|$|This <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{exclusive}} to electric vehicles. In 2007 {{research at the}} Technical University Munich showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance. The researchers measured the distances of 35 approaching vehicles to a pedestrian in the moment when they just got audible in a stationary background noise. These distances were then compared to the stopping distances of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cause}} of Crohn's disease is unknown it is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of environmental, immune and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder, in which the body's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract possibly directed at microbial antigens. While Crohn's is an immune related disease, it {{does not appear to be}} an autoimmune disease (in that the immune system is not being triggered by the body itself). The exact underlying immune <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clear; however, it may be an immunodeficiency state. About half of the overall risk is related to genetics with more than 70 genes found to be involved.|$|E

25|$|We {{have found}} it {{desirable}} to avoid the term 'solution' altogether for the traffic <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> such much a problem waiting for a solution as a social situation requiring {{to be dealt with}} by policies patiently applied over a period and revised {{from time to time in}} light of events.|$|E

25|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about it is that the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> about the chance that the other side is black, it's about the chance that you drew the all black card.

25|$|Cartesian dualism and Popper's three {{worlds are}} {{two forms of}} what is called {{epistemological}} pluralism, that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include psychophysical parallelism and epiphenomenalism. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of rare {{diseases}} which resemble GH deficiency, including the childhood growth failure, facial appearance, delayed bone age, and low IGF levels. However, GH testing elicits normal or high levels of GH in the blood, demonstrating that the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> due to a deficiency of GH but rather to a reduced sensitivity to its action. Insensitivity to GH is traditionally termed Laron dwarfism, but over the last 15 years many different types of GH resistance have been identified, primarily involving mutations of the GH binding protein or receptors.|$|E
25|$|PNAS has {{received}} occasional criticism for releasing papers to science journalists {{as much as}} a week before making them available to the general public; this practice is known as a news embargo. According to critics, this allows mainstream news outlets to misrepresent or exaggerate the implications of experimental findings before the scientific community is able to respond. Science writer Ed Yong, on the other hand, has argued that the real <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> embargoes themselves, but the press releases issued by research institutes and universities.|$|E

50|$|A {{linear system}} that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> time-invariant can <b>be</b> solved using other {{approaches}} {{such as the}} Green function method. The same method must be used when the initial conditions of the <b>problem</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> null.|$|R

25|$|There are 972 {{schools in}} the territory. Most of these {{are located in the}} area's larger towns and villages. Attendance numbers {{diminish}} as one moves into the area's frontiers, particularly the vast, forested areas south of Ebolowa and Sangmélima. Here, students are expected to walk long distances to attend school each day, or else to stay with relatives or alone in towns where schools are located. This <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> as pronounced at the level of primary school, as these tend to be more widely distributed even in the remoter areas. Nevertheless, all {{schools in the}} province tend to be overcrowded.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem. Though {{we think that the}} problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Hence, {{it is very important that}} the definition of the problem is the same among all group members. Only then is it possible for the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials. The British Society of Audiology has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of non-speech sounds. The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{difference}} between these two <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always clear. Moreover, the historical literature is often ambiguous as to whether it is addressing the segregation or the combination problem.|$|R
