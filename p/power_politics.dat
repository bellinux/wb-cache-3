5|$|As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was {{instrumental}} in turning French policy away from the Gaullist policy of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar. Despite stiff ultra-nationalist, Gaullist and communist opposition, the French Assembly voted a number of resolutions in favour of his new policy of integrating Germany into a community. The International Authority for the Ruhr changed in consequence. Schuman's guiding principles were moral, based on the equality of states (international democracy), not the <b>power</b> <b>politics</b> of domination.|$|E
5|$|The {{reality of}} defeat for Austria caused a reevaluation of {{internal}} divisions, local autonomy, and liberalism. The new North German Confederation {{had its own}} constitution, flag, and governmental and administrative structures. Through military victory, Prussia under Bismarck's influence had overcome Austria's active resistance {{to the idea of}} a unified Germany. Austria's influence over the German states may have been broken, but the war also splintered the spirit of pan-German unity: most of the German states resented Prussian <b>power</b> <b>politics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} {{historical}} novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine <b>power</b> <b>politics</b> that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E

40|$|This vision paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} <b>power</b> and <b>politics</b> in requirements engineering (RE). It offers a working definition of both terms and reviews the existing literature both in RE and related disciplines. It argues that, given the increased complexity, uncertainty and organisational embeddedness faced by RE in practice, <b>power</b> and <b>politics</b> have become increasingly relevant factors {{that have not been}} adequately considered. Building upon recent relevant research, a research agenda is proposed that presents a methodological framework which examines <b>power</b> and <b>politics</b> through the structure of power relations and the process of decision-making. This framework will require validation through empirical research as a first step to developing models of <b>power</b> and <b>politics</b> that could be of practical use for RE. Although the potential problems faced by the study of <b>power</b> and <b>politics</b> in an RE context are acknowledged, it is argued that the potential benefits could be significant...|$|R

25|$|Cardinal Richelieu's policy {{involved}} {{two primary}} goals: centralization {{of power in}} France and opposition to the Habsburg dynasty (which ruled in both Austria and Spain). Shortly after he became Louis' principal minister, he {{was faced with a}} crisis in Valtellina, a valley in Lombardy (northern Italy). To counter Spanish designs on the territory, Richelieu supported the Protestant Swiss canton of Grisons, which also claimed the strategically important valley. The Cardinal deployed troops to Valtellina, from which the Pope's garrisons were driven out. Richelieu's early decision to support a Protestant canton against the Pope was a foretaste of the purely diplomatic <b>power</b> <b>politics</b> he would espouse in his foreign policy.|$|E
