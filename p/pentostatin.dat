25|$|If {{a patient}} is {{resistant}} to either cladribine or <b>pentostatin,</b> then second-line therapy is pursued.|$|E
25|$|Other {{treatments}} include rituximab infusion or self-injection with Interferon-alpha. In limited cases, {{the patient}} {{may benefit from}} splenectomy (removal of the spleen). These treatments are not typically given as the first treatment because their success rates are lower than cladribine or <b>pentostatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Pentostatin</b> is {{chemically}} {{similar to}} cladribine, {{and has a}} similar success rate and side effect profile, but it is always given over a much longer period of time, usually one dose by IV infusion every two weeks for three to six months.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{who need}} {{treatment}} usually receive either one week of cladribine, given daily by intravenous infusion or a simple injection under the skin, {{or six months}} of <b>pentostatin,</b> given every four weeks by intravenous infusion. In most cases, one round of treatment will produce a prolonged remission.|$|E
25|$|T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is {{difficult}} to treat, {{and it does not}} respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: purine analogues (<b>pentostatin,</b> fludarabine, cladribine), chlorambucil, and various forms of combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone CHOP, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone , vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} with CLL, it is incurable by present {{treatment}}s, so treatment is directed towards suppressing the disease for many years, rather than totally and permanently eliminating it. The primary chemotherapeutic plan is combination chemotherapy with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, plus a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone. The use of a corticosteroid has the additional benefit of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. In resistant cases, single-agent treatments with nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine, <b>pentostatin,</b> or cladribine may be successful. Younger and healthier patients may choose allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation {{in the hope of}} a permanent cure.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and <b>pentostatin.</b> The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
2500|$|Cladribine (2CDA) and <b>pentostatin</b> (DCF) are the {{two most}} common {{first-line}} therapies. [...] They both belong to a class of medications called purine analogs, which have mild side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy regimens.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{clinical}} trials {{are studying the}} effectiveness of cladribine followed by rituximab in eliminating residual hairy cells that remain after treatment by cladribine or <b>pentostatin.</b> [...] It is not currently known if the elimination of such residual cells will result in more durable remissions.|$|E
2500|$|Splenectomy {{can produce}} {{long-term}} remissions in patients whose spleens {{seem to be}} heavily involved, but its success rate is noticeably lower than cladribine or <b>pentostatin.</b> [...] Splenectomies are also performed for patients whose persistently enlarged spleens cause significant discomfort or in patients whose persistently low platelet counts suggest Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
2500|$|Hairy cells {{respond to}} normal {{production}} of some cytokines by T cells with increased growth. [...] Treatment with Interferon-alpha suppresses {{the production of}} this pro-growth cytokine from T cells. [...] A low level of T cells, which is commonly seen after treatment with cladribine or <b>pentostatin,</b> and the consequent reduction of these cytokines, is also associated with reduced levels of hairy cells.|$|E
2500|$|Many older {{treatment}} approaches, such as Interferon-alpha, {{the combination}} chemotherapy regimen [...] "CHOP", and common alkylating agents like cyclophosphamide showed very little benefit. <b>Pentostatin</b> and cladribine administered as monotherapy (without concurrent rituximab) provide some benefit {{to many people}} with HCL-V, but typically induce shorter remission periods and lower response rates than when they are used in classic HCL. [...] More than half of people respond partially to splenectomy.|$|E
2500|$|Single-drug {{treatment}} is typical. [...] Unlike most cancers, only one drug is normally {{given to a}} patient at a time. [...] While monotherapy is normal, combination therapy—typically using one first-line therapy and one second-line therapy—is being studied in current clinical trials and is used more frequently for refractory cases. [...] Combining rituximab with cladribine or <b>pentostatin</b> {{may or may not}} produce any practical benefit to the patient. Combination therapy is almost never used with a new patient. [...] Because the success rates with purine analog monotherapy are already so high, the additional benefit from immediate treatment with a second drug in a treatment-naïve patient is assumed to be very low. [...] For example, one round of either cladribine or <b>pentostatin</b> gives the median first-time patient a decade-long remission; the addition of rituximab, which gives the median patient only three or four years, might provide no additional value for this easily treated patient. [...] In a more difficult case, however, the benefit from the first drug may be substantially reduced and therefore a combination may provide some benefit.|$|E
2500|$|More than 95% of new {{patients}} are treated well {{or at least}} adequately by cladribine or <b>pentostatin.</b> [...] A majority of {{new patients}} can expect a disease-free remission time span of about ten years, or sometimes much longer after taking one of these drugs just once. [...] If re-treatment is necessary in the future, the drugs are normally effective again, although {{the average length of}} remission is somewhat shorter in subsequent treatments.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the weeks}} {{following}} treatment the patient's {{immune system is}} severely weakened, but their bone marrow will begin to produce normal blood cells again. [...] Treatment often results in long-term remission. About 85% of patients achieve a complete response from treatment with either cladribine or <b>pentostatin,</b> and another 10% receive some benefit from these drugs, {{although there is no}} permanent cure for this disease. [...] If the cancer cells return, the treatment may be repeated and should again result in remission, although the odds of success decline with repeated treatment. [...] Remission lengths vary significantly, from one year to more than twenty years. [...] The median patient can expect a treatment-free interval of about ten years.|$|E
