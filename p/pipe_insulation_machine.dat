40|$|Mechanical <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> {{systems are}} {{commonly}} applied to cold piping surfaces in most industrial and commercial buildings {{in order to}} limit the heat losses and prevent water vapor condensation on the pipe exterior surfaces. Due {{to the fact that}} the surface temperature of these pipelines is normally below the ambient dew point temperature, water vapor diffuses inside the <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> systems and often condenses when it reaches the pipe exterior surfaces. The water droplets accumulated in the <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> system increase its overall thermal conductivity by thermal bridging the cells or the fibers of the insulation material. The moisture ingress into <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> threatens the thermal performance and the overall efficiency of the building mechanical system. This phenomenon is also responsible for the mold growth inside occupied spaces and causes the pipelines to be more vulnerable to corrosion. Although a wide range of vapor barriers are used for preventing water vapor penetration into <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation,</b> common experience in the field shows that water vapor will inevitably ingress into the insulation materials from the end joints or from the cracks created during insulation installation. How to account for the moisture ingress on <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> service life and thermal performance is still an open question. Thermal conductivity is one of the most important properties for evaluating the thermal performance of the <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> systems. Using a new test apparatus, the thermal conductivity of <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> systems below ambient temperature and in wet conditions with moisture ingress was measured. Fiberglass and phenolic <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> were tested to investigate the moisture effects on the material thermal conductivity. The data showed that these two types of <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> systems had quite different water absorption rates due to different characteristics of the material and its structure. A serious degradation of fiberglass <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> thermal performance was observed and the thermal conductivity increased by as much as 3 times when the moisture content was about 12 percent in volume. Tested at a different condition, the thermal conductivity of phenolic <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> increased to 1. 6 times of the original value and the moisture content was 5 % in volume. Considering the gravity effect, the moisture content on the top and bottom C-shells were separately measured and discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|When pipes {{are used}} for chilled water, glycol brines, refrigerants, and other chilled fluids, energy must be spent to {{compensate}} for heat gains through {{the wall of the}} pipes. Higher fluid temperature at the point of use decreases the efficiency of the end-use heat exchangers and increases the parasitic energy consumption. Mechanical <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> systems are often used to limit the heat gains and save energy in commercial buildings. <b>Pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> systems play an important role for the health of the occupied space. When a chilled pipe is uninsulated or inadequately insulated, condensation might occur and water will drip onto other building surfaces possibly causing mold growth. The critical issue with cold pipes is that the temperature difference between the pipe and its surrounding ambient air drives water vapor inside the insulation system and condensation commonly occurs when the water vapor comes in contact the chilled pipe surface. This paper experimentally studies this issue for <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> systems operating at below ambient temperature. The moisture content and the associated thermal conductivity of several <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> systems were measured under various wet condensing conditions with moisture ingress.

The publication describes a method for selection of the more energy effective and cost profitable <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> type in solar thermal systems. A certain proportion of the solar thermal system generated energy is missed as the heat loss in pipes between the solar energy absorbing devices to the heat-accumulation tank. Pipe isolation is necessary for both an outdoor and indoor pipes of solar energy heating system. Outdoor <b>pipes</b> <b>insulation</b> should conformed to outdoor climate conditions and indoor <b>pipes</b> <b>insulation</b> accordingly should conform to indoor conditions. Amount of pipe heat losses mostly depends on pipe diameter, heat carrier temperature, air temperature of the room or environment.

Instantaneous pipeline heat losses are calculated according to the instantaneous heat carrier, outdoor and indoor air temperatures. Results of calculations using the average values are not correct.

This study outlines the findings of computer modelling to quantify the energy and cost savings by using <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> between the collector and storage tank. System sizes of 270 Litre storage tank, together with either selectively surfaced, flat plate collectors (4 m 2 area), or 30 evacuated tube collectors, were used. Insulation thicknesses of 13 mm and 15 mm, pipe runs both ways of 10, 15 and 20 metres and both electric and gas boosting of systems were all considered. The TRNSYS program was used to model the system performance at a representative city in each of the 6 climate zones for Australia and New Zealand, according to AS/NZS 4234 – Heat Water Systems – Calculation of energy consumption and the ORER RECs calculation method. The results show:  Energy savings from <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> are very significant, even in mild climates such as Rockhampton. Across all climates zones, savings ranged from 0. 16 to 3. 5 GJ per system per year, or about 2 to 23 percent of the annual load.  There is very little advantage in increasing the insulation thickness from 13 to 15 mm. For electricity at 19 c/kWh and gas at 2 c/MJ, cost savings of between 27 and 100 per year are achieved across the climate zones. Both energy and cost savings would increase in colder climates with increased system size, solar contribution and water temperatures.  The <b>pipe</b> <b>insulation</b> substantially improves the solar contribution (or fraction) and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), as well as giving small savings in circulating pump running costs in milder climates.
