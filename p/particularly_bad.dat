5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast reservoir of fresh water, {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it is running out, owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers have warned it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, and is therefore non-renewable. The problem is <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> in the sandy shanty towns {{where the majority of}} the population lives. Many people already have to buy water, which is expensive compared with the average wage.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{costs of the}} war were high {{in some of the}} southern English colonies, including those that saw little military activity. Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily tobacco) to European markets, and they also suffered because of several <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> harvests. South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} of Marsyas fell {{back to a}} sacred grove of Zeus at Labraunda and deliberated whether to surrender to the Persians or to flee Asia altogether. However, while deliberating, {{they were joined by}} a Milesian army, and with these reinforcements resolved instead to carry on fighting. The Persians then attacked the army at Labraunda, and inflicted an even heavier defeat, with the Milesians suffering <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> casualties.|$|E

5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E
5|$|After {{having a}} <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> day at school, Bart gets {{caught in a}} downpour and loses control of his skateboard. He crashes down the {{stairwell}} of the Legitimate Businessman's Social Club, a Mafia bar owned by the Springfield Mafia. Fat Tony, {{the leader of the}} Mafia, and his henchmen Legs and Louie are initially inhospitable towards Bart, but they are impressed by his ability to pick the winning horse in a horse race on the radio. When Bart makes up an excellent Manhattan cocktail for the mobsters, Fat Tony hires him as their bartender and errand boy. As Bart adopts more and more gangster-like traits, Marge grows anxious and tells Homer to go and meet the Mafia, but Homer approves of them after they let him win at poker.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of raptor nests, or eyries (also spelt aerie), these are often used for many years, with new {{material}} added each breeding season. In some cases, the nests grow large enough to cause structural damage to the tree itself, <b>particularly</b> during <b>bad</b> storms where {{the weight of the}} nest can cause additional stress on wind-tossed branches.|$|R
5|$|The {{situation}} {{might well}} have continued until the spring thaw had the German High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht) not launched Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein (Operation Watch on the Rhine) on 16 December 1944. The land offensive was to improve the German military position by capturing Antwerp and separating the British Army from United States Army forces. Part of the planning for the German land operation required the attack to be conducted {{under the cover of}} bad winter weather, which kept the main Allied asset, the Tactical Air Forces, on the ground. It initially succeeded, but the weather also grounded the Luftwaffe for the most part. Nevertheless, the Luftwaffe did manage to put 500 aircraft into the air on 16 December, more than had been achieved for a long time. This first day had been the originally planned date for the strike against Allied airfields, named Operation Bodenplatte. However, the weather proved <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> and operations were shut down.|$|E
25|$|Vandalism {{has also}} been a problem. Crosses of Sacrifice have been smashed or the bronze swords stolen, with the {{vandalism}} being <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> in the 1970s.|$|E

Despite also having a third independent generator driven by a 6-cylinder Ruston diesel engine, at times of high electrical demand, the main generators drew around 95bhp from each engine, leaving insufficient power to the propellers, the service speed suffering as a result, <b>particularly</b> in <b>bad</b> weather.|$|R

25|$|A {{shot that}} misses both {{the rim and}} the {{backboard}} completely {{is referred to as}} an air ball. A <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a brick.

25|$|Whitlam's {{radical and}} {{imperious}} style eventually alienated many voters, {{and some of}} the state governments were openly hostile to his government. As it did not control the senate, much of its legislation was rejected or amended. The Queensland Country Party government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen had <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> relations with the Federal government. Even after it was re-elected at elections in May 1974, the Senate remained an obstacle to its political agenda. At the only joint sitting of parliament, in August 1974, six keys pieces of legislation were passed.|$|E
25|$|His results {{during the}} 1950s were often inconsistent. One <b>particularly</b> <b>bad</b> result was his 19th place (only one from bottom) at the URSch-22, Moscow 1955, with 6/19. During the 1960s {{he became more}} versatile, as he gained {{experience}} at the top level. He won at Kraków 1959 with 8½/11, shared 1st–2nd places with GM Samuel Reshevsky at Buenos Aires 1960 with 13/19, and won at Córdoba, Argentina 1960 with 6/7.

50|$|The {{practicality}} of {{the automobile}} was initially limited {{because of the lack}} of suitable roads. Travel between cities was mostly done by railroad, waterways, or carriages. Roads were mostly dirt and hard to travel, <b>particularly</b> in <b>bad</b> weather. The League of American Wheelman maintained and improved roads as it was viewed as a local responsibility with limited government assistance. During this time, there was an increase in production of automobiles coupled with a swell of auto dealerships, marking their growth in popularity.|$|R

There are also connections with the buses of Hanauer Straßenbahn AG, which is also part of the RMV network.

The 2006 Atlantic Hurricane Season was a typical year which left the Yucatán untouched, but in the 2007 Atlantic Hurricane season Yucatán was hit by Hurricane Dean (also a category 5 storm), nevertheless Dean left little damage on {{the peninsula}} despite heavy localized flooding.|$|E
