5|$|While both gun turrets were rotated by steam power, the new forward {{guns were}} loaded by {{hydraulic}} power, unlike the original guns which were hand worked. Thunderer {{was the first}} ship to have hydraulic loading gear. From 1874, the forward turret alone was converted to hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>operation</b> for training (turret traverse), elevation and ramming. This allowed the turret crew to be reduced from 48 to 28; the aft turret remaining hand-worked as a comparison. <b>Power</b> <b>operation</b> was considered successful, although it was later implicated in the 1879 explosion.|$|E
5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high <b>power</b> <b>operation</b> for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor <b>power</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{building}} reactors in 1943. A group was created in Bacher's P Division, the P-7 (Water Boiler) Group, {{under the leadership of}} Donald Kerst, that included Charles P. Baker, Gerhart Friedlander, Lindsay Helmholtz, Marshall Holloway and Raemer Schreiber. Robert F. Christy from the T-1 Group provided support with the theoretical calculations, in particular, a calculation of the critical mass. He calculated that 600 grams of uranium-235 would form a critical mass in a tamper of infinite size. Initially it was planned to operate the Water Boiler at 10kW, but Fermi and Samuel K. Allison visited in September 1943, and went over the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive fission products would be created {{that would have to be}} chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the Water Boiler would only run at 1kW until more operating experience had been accumulated, and features needed for high <b>power</b> <b>operation</b> were shelved for the time being.|$|E

25|$|An {{improved}} junction {{replaces the}} diamond with turnouts, {{which can be}} of as fine an angle as possible, so that this junction can carry branch traffic at high speed. This configuration assumes <b>power</b> <b>operation</b> of the points, as high speed turnouts are generally not suitable for mechanical operation. The high speed turnouts may require more than one point machine each. The turnouts can have no superelevation while the curve in the branch can; therefore the radius in the turnouts must be greater than the radius of the curve in the branch.|$|E
25|$|After a {{pause for}} {{evaluation}} of procedures, the Army continued its use of reactors, operating the Mobile Low-Power Reactor (ML-1), which started full <b>power</b> <b>operation</b> on February 28, 1963, becoming the smallest nuclear power plant on record to do so. This design was eventually abandoned after corrosion problems. While the tests had shown that nuclear power was likely to have lower total costs, the financial pressures of the Vietnam War caused the Army to favor lower initial costs and it stopped the development of its reactor program in 1965, although the existing reactors continued operating (MH-1A until 1977).|$|E
25|$|During <b>power</b> <b>operation,</b> {{heavy water}} was {{circulated}} by primary pumps through the U-tubes containing the fuel assemblies which heated the water. The heated water then flowed through an inverted U-tube steam generator where {{the heat was}} transferred to the secondary side light water which turned to steam. The steam flowed to an oil-fired superheater which increased the steam quality before the steam entered the turbine which spun the electrical generator. After passing through the steam generator, the primary loop water was pumped back to the reactor by the primary pumps to repeat the cycle. The primary loop heavy water was pressurized to ensure that the heavy water remained liquid and did not flash to steam at any point in the loop.|$|E

25|$|A Soviet design, {{built to}} produce {{plutonium}} {{as well as}} power. RBMKs are water cooled with a graphite moderator. RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU {{in that they are}} refuelable during <b>power</b> <b>operation</b> and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making containment buildings for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the Chernobyl disaster. Their main attraction is their use of light water and un-enriched uranium. As of 2010, 11 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still {{considered one of the most}} dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|In {{countries}} with nuclear power, radioactive wastes comprise less than 1% of total industrial toxic wastes, {{much of which}} remains hazardous for long periods. Overall, nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants. Coal-burning plants are particularly noted for producing large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash due to concentrating naturally occurring metals and mildly radioactive material from the coal. A 2008 report from Oak Ridge National Laboratory concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear <b>power</b> <b>operation,</b> and that the population effective dose equivalent, or dose to the public from radiation from coal plants is 100 {{times as much as}} from the operation of nuclear plants. Indeed, coal ash is much less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel on a weight per weight basis, but coal ash is produced in much higher quantities per unit of energy generated, and this is released directly into the environment as fly ash, whereas nuclear plants use shielding to protect the environment from radioactive materials, for example, in dry cask storage vessels.|$|E
