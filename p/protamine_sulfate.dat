Bacteriol. 82 : 233 – 238. 1961. —To define the energy-yielding reaction(s) during fermentation of purines by Clostridium acidi-urici, an eightfold purified acetokinase {{was obtained by}} <b>protamine</b> and ammonium <b>sulfate</b> fractionation of crude extracts. Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the disappearance of acetyl phosphate using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) as phosphate acceptor or by following the generation of acetyl phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) + acetate. The optimal pH for the reaction was observed to be 7. 4. Km values for acetyl phosphate, ADP, and magnesium ions were shown to be 2. 1 × 10 − 3 m, 3. 2 × 10 − 3 m, and 2. 4 × 10 − 3 m, respectively. Acetyl phosphate disappearance is dependent upon ADP and is stoichiometric with addition of the latter. The acetokinase reaction probably represents the major energy-yielding reaction during purine fermentation by this organism. A pathway for acetate generation from formiminoglycine is proposed, and evidence {{for a number of}} enzyme activities intermediate between formiminoglycine degradation and acetate formation is given.

50|$|CPB {{mechanically}} circulates and oxygenates {{blood for}} the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. It uses a heart-lung machine to maintain perfusion to other body organs and tissues while the surgeon works in a bloodless surgical field. The surgeon places a cannula in right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the body. The cannula is connected to tubing filled with isotonic crystalloid solution. Venous blood that {{is removed from the}} body by the cannula is filtered, cooled or warmed, oxygenated, and then returned to the body. The cannula used to return oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, but it may be inserted in the femoral artery. The patient is administered heparin to prevent clotting, and <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> is given after to reverse effects of heparin. During the procedure, hypothermia may be maintained; body temperature is usually kept at 28 °C to 32 °C (82.4-89.6 °F). The blood is cooled during CPB and returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body's basal metabolic rate, decreasing its demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the crystalloid solution used to prime the bypass tubing dilutes the blood.|$|E
40|$|In vivo {{studies in}} rats {{demonstrated}} that the binding of a highly cationic antigen (cationized human IgG, pI greater than 9. 5) to glomerular polyanion could be significantly reduced by prior application of a small polycation, <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate.</b> The degree of inhibition was dose dependent and the highest dose used, 4 mg/ 100 g body weight, reduced antigen binding by approximately 70 %. In further experiments the ability of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> to enhance elimination of cationic antigen-antibody immune complexes from the glomerular capillary wall was examined. Daily treatment with <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> starting after induction of nephritis, produced a significant but only moderate reduction in {{the persistence of the}} antigen, without having any effect on proteinuria.

40|$|Infection is {{a common}} {{complication}} {{associated with the use}} of transcutaneous and implanted medical devices. These infections are generally difficult to treat and frequently require removal of the biomaterial before the infection can be completely eradicated. The presence of a bacterial biofilm recalcitrant to treatment often mediates these infections. We studied the influence of a polycationic protein, <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> on the efficacy of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin against a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A P. aeruginosa biofilm was developed on 1 -cm sections of red rubber catheter material and then treated with various combinations of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and ciprofloxacin. The present work demonstrated that ciprofloxacin in combination with protamine was more effective against biofilms than was ciprofloxacin alone. <b>Protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> at 50 micrograms/ml combined with antibiotic at 0. 5 microgram/ml reduced the number of viable cells by an average of 98. 97 %, while <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> at 50 micrograms/ml alone resulted in an average 107. 8 % increase and antibiotic alone resulted in an average 58. 6 % reduction after 24 h. Furthermore, <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> in combination with ciprofloxacin, inhibited P. aeruginosa in a dose-dependent fashion. It was further observed that treatment with the combination of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and ciprofloxacin had a more drastic effect on planktonic organisms as compared with the P. aeruginosa biofilms; the MBC was reduced to < 0. 05 microgram/ml in the presence of 25 micrograms of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> per ml. These findings were substantiated by ultrastructure studies of treated cells using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The synergism between ciprofloxacin and <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> significantly enhanced the efficacy of ciprofloxacin against planktonic and biofilm P. aeruginosa...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The bladder is {{normally}} impermeable to possible hostile environmental factors and toxic urinary wastes. Any {{disruption of the}} permeability barrier would permit the leakage of urine constituents into the underlying cells layers and subsequent inflammation. <b>Protamine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> which increases urothelial permeability, is used in experimental models of cystitis. We examined whether <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> alone could cause bladder inflammation or if the association of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and urine is needed for this condition. Materials and Methods: Female Wistar rats (Center for the Development of Experimental Models for Medicine and Biology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil) had the bladder catheterized and instilled with <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> (10 mg) or sterile saline for 30 minutes. To exclude urine other groups of rats underwent bilateral nephrectomy and the same procedure was used. One day after instillation the bladders were removed for histopathology. Edema and vascular congestion were graded from 0 -none to 3 -severe. Polymorphonuclear and mast cells were counted. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed for statistical analysis. Results: Intravesical instillation of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> in nonnephrectomized rats led to inflammation, in contrast to findings in rats instilled with saline. On the other hand, nephrectomized rats showed no inflammatory changes following the instillation of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> or saline. The mast cell count was similar in all groups. Conclusions: Bladder inflammation in this experimental model of urothelial injury was not due to <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> alone. The association of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and urine was necessary to trigger the inflammatory cascade. Thus, urine indeed has {{an important role in}} the development of bladder inflammation in an environment of higher urothelial permeability...|$|E

40|$|<b>Protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> is {{considered}} a weak anticoagulant, yet little is known concerning the mechanism of this effect or its relation to prior heparin exposure. This investigation defined the influence of increasing doses of protamine, with and without prior heparin anticoagulation, on the activated clotting time (ACT), thrombin clotting time (TCT), prothrombin time (PT), partial thrombosplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen level, platelet count, and platelet aggregation to ADP in dogs (n = 8). Four doses of intravenous <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> (1. 5, 3. 0, 6. 0, and 15. 0 mg/kg) were studied in each animal, with at least 5 days between individual studies. Four dogs received heparin, 150 IU/kg 10 min prior to <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> administration, and four dogs received <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> alone. <b>Protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> caused anticoagulation, both in the presence and absence of heparin, with significant changes occurring in the ACT, PTT, platelet count, and platelet aggregation. Relevant changes did not occur in the TCT, PT, or fibrinogen levels. Platelet effects were capable of causing bleeding with standard or excess use of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> especially if platelet numbers were already decreased, as might occur in surgical procedures where thrombocytopenia commonly accompanies major blood loss and replacement. The ACT, reflecting both the coagulation cascade and platelet function, was the test most profoundly affected by protamine overdosage, and therefore may be misleading {{as a measure of}} protamine reversal of heparin. The TCT, which is sensitive to heparin anticoagulation but not protamine-induced anticoagulation, should be more accurate in differentiating inadequate heparin reversal from the effects of excess protamine...|$|E
40|$|Polycations induce calcium {{signaling}} in glomerular podocytes. BackgroundThe neutralization of the polyanionic {{surface of}} the podocyte by perfusion of kidneys with polycations, such as <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> leads to a retraction of podocyte foot processes and proteinuria. This study investigates the effects of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> or anionic, neutral, or cationic dextrans on the cytosolic calcium activity ([Ca 2 +]i) in podocytes. Methods[Ca 2 +]i was measured in single cultured differentiated mouse podocytes with the fluorescence dye fura- 2 /AM. ResultsProtamine sulfate caused a concentration-dependent and partially reversible increase of [Ca 2 +]i (EC 50 approximately 1. 5 μmol/liter). Pretreatment of the cells with heparin (100 U/liter) inhibited the protamine sulfate-mediated increase of [Ca 2 +]i. Like <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> diethylaminoethyl dextran (DEAE-dextran) concentration dependently increased [Ca 2 +]i in podocytes (EC 50 approximately 20 nmol/liter), whereas dextran sulfate or uncharged dextran (both 10 μmol/liter) did not influence [Ca 2 +]i. A reduction of the extracellular Ca 2 + concentration (from 1 mmol/liter to 1 μmol/liter) partially inhibited the <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and the DEAE-dextran–induced [Ca 2 +]i response. Flufenamate (100 μmol/liter) or Gd 3 + (10 μmol/liter), which are known to inhibit nonselective ion channels, did not influence the [Ca 2 +]i increase induced by <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate.</b> In the presence of thapsigargin (50 nmol/liter), an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase, both <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and DEAE-dextran increased [Ca 2 +]i. ConclusionsThe data indicate that polycations increase podocyte [Ca 2 +]i. The increase of [Ca 2 +]i may be an early event in the pathogenesis of protamine sulfate-mediated retraction of podocyte foot processes...|$|E

There is now interest, {{specifically in the}} US, to use bovine mucosa as an additional source {{for the production of}} heparin. The anticoagulant action of heparin can be neutralized by <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> and in this study the ability of protamine to bind and neutralize the anticoagulant activities of heparin from porcine mucosa, bovine mucosa and bovine lung were assessed. <b>Protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> was able to bind and precipitate similar amounts of heparins from different sources on a mass basis. However, differential amounts of anticoagulant activities were neutralized by <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> with neutralization of porcine mucosa more effective than for bovine lung and bovine mucosa. For all heparins, potentiation of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin and heparin cofactor II was preferentially neutralized over antithrombin-mediated inhibition of factor Xa or plasma clotting time. Whole blood thromboelastography showed that neutralization by <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> was more effective than the antithrombin dependent thrombin inhibition assays indicated.

40|$|<b>Protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> {{enhanced}} transfection of Streptococcus pneumoniae by DNA of omega 3 phage by {{factors as}} large as 10 (5) -fold, provided it {{was present at the}} time the cells were added to the DNA. For DNA concentrations well below 1 microgram/ml, the optimum amount of <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> was near 1 microgram/ml of cells. Higher DNA concentrations required more protamine for maximum effect, and in all cases transfection fell when protamine was in excess. Transformation was not enhanced by low protamine levels and was inhibited by higher levels. A recipient strain with low but finite endonuclease activity and normal transformability showed higher transfection than did the wild type at low DNA concentrations but less than did the wild type at high DNA concentrations. <b>Protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> enhanced its transfection at low, but not high, DNA concentrations. The behavior of this strain and the enhancement of transfection by <b>protamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> of wild-type cells were each consistent with less cutting of the donor DNA at the cell surface, {{which is part of the}} normal entry process in naturally competent gram-positive bacteria.
