40|$|Damages {{have four}} main functions: reparation, placing of the costs, {{distribution}} of the losses and prevention. The rules about damages evolved before liability insurance had the extension it has today, 97 % of the Swedish populations is covered by liability insurance, since it {{is included in the}} comprehensive household insurance. Liability insurance should be looked at {{in the light of the}} damage rules, but the rules about damages are adapted to the insurance possibilities. The Law of damages contains, though the general adjustment article 6 : 2, the adjustment article 2 : 4 about children and the adjustment article 2 : 5 about the mentally ill, a possibility to adjust a non reasonable damage claim. If the liability insurance covers the damages no adjustment is made. Even when the adjustment articles are being used the damages is a heavy burden for the <b>person</b> who is <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the <b>damages.</b> The liability insurance contains exemptions <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> caused by criminal actions amongst other things and therefore there is still a need for the adjustment articles. It is voluntary to have liability insurance for private individuals. The severity of the consequences <b>for</b> the <b>person</b> <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the <b>damages</b> leads to that is should be involuntary, at least for children. This year a change was made to the Law of damages and the legal guardian of children is now, not only responsible <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> causes when they are negligent, but also in some situations absolute <b>liable.</b> The ground <b>for</b> the change is to clarify the legal guardianâ€™s responsibilities and decrease delinquency. The change is an unjust divergence from damage principles and will not fulfill its purpose...|$|R
