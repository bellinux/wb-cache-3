In North America almost 90% of online retail transactions were made with this <b>payment</b> <b>type.</b> Turban et al. goes on to explain that it would be difficult for an online retailer to operate without supporting credit and debit cards due to their widespread use. Increased security measures include use of the card verification number (CVN) which detects fraud by comparing the verification number printed on the signature strip on the back of the card with the information on file with the cardholder's issuing bank. Also online merchants have to comply with stringent rules stipulated by the credit and debit card issuers (Visa and MasterCard) this means that merchants must have security protocol and procedures in place to ensure transactions are more secure. This can also include having a certificate from an authorized certification authority (CA) who provides PKI (Public-Key infrastructure) for securing credit and debit card transactions.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{study is to}} {{understand}} whether free cash flow is a determinant of the <b>payment</b> <b>type</b> offered by acquiring firms in hospitality acquisitions. According to the pecking order theory, investments are financed using internal funds first, new issues of debt second, and new issues of equity last {{in order to use}} the cheapest financing source possible. This is consistent with using free cash flow first in the financing of acquisitions. To test this hypothesis in the context of acquisition <b>payment</b> <b>type</b> offers, a measure of free cash flow was formulated and regressed against the type of payment offer used by hospitality acquirers. Other motivators of cash financing were also tested in the model. Small firms tend to have large cash holdings and often limited access to the capital markets. Thus we tested the relationship between the acquirer’s use of cash financing and size of acquirer. In addition, hospitality firms with strong growth opportunities hold significant cash balances to provide the flexibility to pursue positive NPV investment. Thus we included a measure of the acquirer’s growth opportunities as well. The results of the model indicated that larger hospitality firms and hospitality firms with low growth opportunities tend to use cash financing in their acquisitions...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary Triangle Transit {{seeks to}} answer two related questions: •	Are lower-income riders {{more likely than}} other riders to use a less {{efficient}} payment method that contributes to overpayment? •	What policies can Triangle Transit adopt to address potential inequities between payments by lower- and higher-income riders? Findings 1. 	Triangle Transit’s poorer riders {{are more likely to}} pay with a pass than with cash. Regression analysis that controls for other factors affecting <b>payment</b> <b>type</b> confirms this finding. 2. 	Overpayment is a persistent problem among Triangle Transit users, but particularly among cash users. 3. 	Though access to alternative transportation (cars) is important to employment prospects, it is not a statistically significant predictor of overpayment. However, employment status is closely linked to the likelihood a user pays with a pass or cash. 4. 	Descriptive statistics suggest that income, <b>payment</b> <b>type,</b> and transfers are predictors of overpayment. Lower income, cash use, and higher transfer rates are positive predictors of overpayment. Regression analysis also confirms that income and transfer are large and statistically significant predictors of overpayment. Recommendations 1. 	Triangle Transit should increase visibility of 30 -day passes at highly-travelled stops. 2. 	Triangle Transit should move to an electronic “Smart Card” system. As part of this transition, Triangle Transit should reduce transfer fees for customers paying with a “Smart Card. ” 3. 	Triangle Transit should ask a series of new questions in the next round of its rider survey, particularly related to payment decisions. 4. 	Reduce cash fares by 25 percent...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect of {{information}} asymmetry on insider trading activities in hospitality firms. In particular, this study will use a market microstructure approach to detect insider trading activities of hospitality firms prior to merger announcements. Since the <b>payment</b> <b>type</b> of a merger is determined by private managerial information, it can act as a proxy of information asymmetry. Depending on the <b>payment</b> <b>type</b> of a merger, insiders may make different transactions with their private share holdings before the merger announcement. Insider selling (buying) activities may forecast their firm 2 ̆ 7 s negative (positive) abnormal performance after mergers. In general, the management of a hospitality corporation is separated from the ownership of the firm. Thus, managers as well as shareholders and other outsiders may all have different information about the value of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s real or financial assets and it may be many years before all the information is revealed. This information asymmetry implies that a hospitality firm 2 ̆ 7 s managers may have private information about their firm 2 ̆ 7 s true valuation and use the information to make managerial decisions related to the type of payment offer in a merger. There have been no studies of hospitality mergers that have looked at the process through which insider information becomes reflected in security prices.

40|$|Mergers and Acquisitions(M&A) {{are major}} {{strategic}} initiatives undertaken by many organisations. The choice of <b>payment</b> <b>type</b> in (M&A) { Cash, Stock Debt, {{or a combination}} of these { can have a substantial impact on the successful completion of the transaction. In this thesis, we provide an empirical investigation into the determinants of the Number of Mergers by introducing the Announced Total Value (ATV) according to the <b>payment</b> <b>type</b> investment characteristics of the companies involved as additional variables which have not been considered in previous studies. We considered the payment types and TVA of a particular <b>payment</b> <b>type</b> of the companies involved in (M&A) to explore their effects on the number of Mergers completed in given year. It is generally regarded to be preferable by shareholders of the target company to receive a Cash payment rather than shares of the bidding company as we can see 67. 33 % of the total Mergers were completed by Cash. We have focused on how the number of Mergers depends on ATV in between the bidding companies. From the univariate analysis of total number of Mergers, number of Mergers by Cash and number of Mergers by Stock on the Mean, Median and the Standard Deviation of the ATV, we have found that Negative binomial regression model performs better than the Poisson regression model and all of these three response variables have positive weak but significant ant association with the standard deviation of the ATV. So we can recommend that the Standard Deviation of the ATV can be treated as significant cant predictor to model the number of Mergers in a given year. The Bi-variate Poisson regression model shows the positive effect of the mean ATV for Mergers by Stock on the joint distribution of the number of Mergers by Cash and Stock, which is statistically significant cant. After the Adjustment of Overdispersion Parameters for the Mergers by Cash(1 = 0 : 08267357) and the Number of Mergers by Stock (2 = 0 : 08267357) respectively, the negative impact of the standard deviation of ATV by Stock on their joint distribution of the number of Mergers by Cash and Stock becomes statistically significant cant. Here we have found that, the standard deviation of ATV by Stock influence the joint distribution of the number of Mergers by Cash and Stock in the presence of overdispersion. The research can be further extended in particular at how mixed offers of the payment types is determined by considering investment characteristics such as the target growth rate, relative size of the company, debt ratio, investment portfolio, tax effects and budget constraints etc. Department of Mathematical SciencesThesis (M.

In the alternative public-private partnership (PPP) systems, payment mechanisms follow the selected PPP system. For example, the build-operate-transfer system provides compensation based on project demand using real-tolls usage payments; the design-build-finance-operate (DBFO) system provides shadow-tolls usage payments; and the performance-based DBFO system provides compensation based on contractor's performance using service availability payments.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} the effectiveness {{and efficiency of}} the Department of Human Servicesʹ management of Smart Centresʹ Centrelink telephone services. Introduction In 2013 – 14 the Department of Human Services (Human Services) delivered $ 159. 2  billion payments to customers and providers. The department delivers these payments and related services {{on behalf of the}} Australian Government through a variety of channels including telephone, on-line, digital applications and face-to-face through some 400 service centres located across Australia. While there has recently been strong growth in digital channels and the department is actively encouraging the use of these self‑service channels, demand for telephone services remains strong. In 2013 – 14, the department handled 59. 5  million telephone calls about Centrelink, Child Support and Medicare services. The majority of calls, 43. 1  million annually or more than 800   000 per week, related to Centrelink services. Human Services manages over 50 Centrelink‑related telephony lines, each with its own ‘ 1800 ’ or ‘ 13 ’ telephone number. Each of the main payment types such as the aged pension and employment services has its own line, and calls are managed and distributed nationally through a virtual network. Previously referred to as call centres, the department now provides telephone services through a network of 29 Smart Centres, with some $ 338  million expended on Centrelink telephone services in 2013 ­– 14. The department’s shift to Smart Centres began in 2012 – 13 and is still being implemented.
