40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether random amplified polymorphic DNA (AP-PCR) analysis is able to differentiate genetically different clones of mutans streptococci, in 22 Brazilian family members. Stimulated saliva samples were collected from fathers, mothers and infants. For 5 - 18 months babies with erupting primary dentition, plaque samples were collected using sterile tooth <b>pick</b> <b>tips.</b> From these samples, mutans streptococci were isolated on SB- 20 agar plates. After growth, representative colonies were identified by biochemical methods on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation. Streptococcus mutans isolates were obtained from all family members and AP-PCR typed separately with a random primer (OPA- 13). Bacterial cell lysates were used as template in PCR reactions and the amplified DNA fragments obtained were compared by agarose gel electrophoresis. Results demonstrated that the father shared the baby's genotype in three families and the mother shared the baby's genotype in 12 families seven babies harbored Streptococcus mutans strains similar to those of their siblings.

40|$|The squid giant axon {{was placed}} in a shallow narrow trough and current was sent in at two {{electrodes}} in opposite sides of the trough and out at a third electrode several centimeters away. The potential difference across the membrane was measured between an inside fine capillary electrode with its tip in the axoplasm between the pair of polarizing electrodes, and an outside capillary electrode with its <b>tip</b> <b>flush</b> with the surface of one polarizing electrode. The initial transient was roughly exponential at the anode make and damped oscillatory at the sub-threshold cathode make with the action potential arising from the first maximum when threshold was reached. The constant change of membrane potential, after the initial transient, was measured {{as a function of the}} total polarizing current and from these data the membrane potential is obtained as a function of the membrane current density. The absolute value of the resting membrane resistance approached at low polarizing currents is about 23 ohm cm. 2. This low value is considered to be a result of the puncture of the axon. The membrane was found to be an excellent rectifier with a ratio of about one hundred between the high resistance at the anode and the low resistance at the cathode for the current range investigated. On the assumption that the membrane conductance is a measure of its ion permeability, these experiments show an increase of ion permeability under a cathode and a decrease under an anode...|$|R
40|$|Canine oocyte {{maturation}} and fertilization {{take place}} within the oviducts under increasing plasma levels of progesterone (P 4). In order to investigate the role of P 4 in these processes, 51 Beagle bitches were treated with the P 4 receptor antagonist aglepristone {{at the end of}} proestrus and 32 females were kept untreated. Fifteen treated and 13 control bitches were inseminated at Days + 1 and + 2 after ovulation (Day 0). Stages of oocyte maturation and embryo development were determined after ovariectomy at different time points after ovulation. Aglepristone did not prevent ovulation but delayed the resumption of oocyte meiosis and inhibited its progression: first metaphase (M) I stages were observed at 173 h post-ovulation and 39 % of oocytes reached MII as late as 335 h post-ovulation in treated females whereas first MI occurred at 76 h and 100 % of oocytes were in MII at 109 h post-ovulation in controls. Aglepristone extended the stay of morphologically normal oocytes within the oviducts: first signs of oocyte degeneration were observed at 335 h in treated vs. 100 - 110 h post-ovulation in control bitches. In inseminated females, aglepristone prevented sperm progression toward the oviducts and fertilization, although motile spermatozoa were observed in the uterine <b>tip</b> <b>flush</b> and within the cranial uterine glands. A proteomic analysis of the tubal fluid from treated and control non inseminated bitches at Day + 4 evidenced 79 differential proteins potentially involved in the oocyte phenotype. In conclusion, P 4 plays key roles in post-ovulatory canine oocyte maturation, aging and in fertilization...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Early stage {{colorectal}} tumors can {{be removed}} by endoscopic mucosal resection but larger such tumors (> 20 mm) may require piecemeal resection. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) using newly developed endoknives has enabled en-block resection of lesions regardless of size and shape. However ESD for colorectal tumor is technically difficult. Therefore, we performed EMR with small incision (EMR with SI) for more reliable EMR, ESD with snaring (simplified ESD) and ESD using thestandard Flush knife and the novel ball <b>tipped</b> <b>Flush</b> knife (Flush knife BT) for easier and safer colorectal ESD. AIMS: The aims of our study were 1) to compare the treatment results of the following 3 methods (EMR with SI/simplified ESD/ ESD) for early stage colorectal tumors, and 2) to assess the performance of Flush knife BT in colorectal ESD. METHODS: We treated 24 / 44 / 468 colorectal tumors and examined the clinicopathological features and treatment results such as tumor size, resected specimen size, procedure time, en-bloc resection rate, complication rate. We also treated 58 colorectal tumors (LST-NG: 20, LST-G: 36, other: 2) using standard Flush knife and 80 colorectal tumors (LST-NG: 32, LSTG: 44, other: 2) using Flush knife BT, and examined the clinicopathological features and treatment results mentioned above and also the procedure speed. RESULT: The median tumor size (mm) (EMR with SI/ simplified EMR/ESD) was 20 / 17 / 30 (EMR with SI vs. simplified ESD:p=n. s, simplified ESD vs. ESD:p< 0. 0001). The median resected specimen size (mm) was 22. 5 / 26 / 41 (EMR with SI vs. simplified ESD: p= 0. 0018, simplified ESD vs. ESD: p< 0. 0001). The procedure time (min.) was 19 / 27 / 60 (EMR with SI vs. simplified ESD: p=n. s, simplified ESD vs. ESD: p< 0. 0001) The en-block resection rate (%) was 83. 3 / 90. 9 / 98. 9. The complication rate (post-operative bleeding rate/perforation rate) was 0 / 0, 2. 3 / 4. 5, 1. 5 / 1. 5 (simplified ESD vs. ESD : p=n. s). In the treatment results of ESD for LSTs by knives, {{there was no difference}} between standard Flush knife and Flush knife BT for clinicopathological features and treatment results (procedure time, complication rate and en bloc R 0 resection rate). However, procedure speed (cm 2 /min.) of LST-G was significantly faster in the Flush knife BT than in standard Flush knife. (standard Flush knife: 0. 21 vs. Flush knife BT: 0. 27, p= 0. 034). CONCLUSION: EMR with small incision (EMR with SI) and ESD with snaring (simplified ESD) are good option to fill the gap between EMR and ESD in the colorectum, and also considered to become the nice training for the introduction of ESD. Flush knife BT appears to improve procedure speed compared with standard Flush knife, especially for LST-G in colorectal ESD...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether a single treatment with ethanol/water (70 : 30) will sterilize infected vascular catheters. Methods: A double-blinded, block-randomized trial was conducted in a sheep model comparing the effi-cacy of one 3 h treatment with ethanol/water (70 : 30) with heparinized saline for treatment of Hickman vas-cular catheters infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis. Catheters were cultured using endoluminal brushes, blood cultures, roll plates of catheter <b>tip,</b> broth <b>flushed</b> through the catheter and hub swabs. Results: There were significantly more sterile catheters in the ethanol treatment group than the saline treatment group (9 / 11 versus 0 / 11, P < 0. 01, McNemar’s x 2 test). The median number of positive cul-tures in the ethanol treatment group was less than in the saline treatment group (0 versus 5, P 5 0. 009, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Conclusions: A single treatment of 70 % ethanol is effective and clinical trials are warranted for treatment of infected vascular catheters using this regimen...|$|R
