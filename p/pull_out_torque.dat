40|$|Single phase {{induction}} motors {{are found}} in various applications in which having correct value of the capacitor connected to the auxiliary winding enables the motor to function efficiently. This research aim is to investigate and obtain {{the value of the}} capacitor of a given input parameters of a specified permanent split capacitor (PSC) induction motor using MATLAB, which will in turn provide easy computation of the output parameters for the motor optimum efficiency. Electrical and mechanical characteristics of the PSC induction motor where obtained and analysed of which the study shows that the motor was reliable due to the absence of centrifugal switch. With the aid of MATLAB program the results were easily obtained, PSC induction motor capacitor value at optimum efficiency was also easily determined. The motor proved to have low starting torque, low starting current, higher efficiency, high <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>torque</b> and high power factor. The characteristic of PSC induction motor analysed was limited to where higher starting torque is required only...|$|E
40|$|Three phase {{reluctance}} motors {{have been}} receiving {{growing interest in}} recent years. This is attributed to their inherent advantages of robustness, low maintenance and suitability for constant speed applications. The success of manufacturing motors with extremely high reluctance ratios has contributed to such an interest. Such motors are characterized by considerably high <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>torques</b> and enjoy, accordingly, relative high steady state stability margins. In addition to their conventional balanced operation from a symmetrical three phase supply, these motors can operate satisfactorily when fed from a single phase supply {{with the help of}} a properly selected phase balancer. In this paper a rigorous mathematical model describing the transient behavior of three phase reluctance motors under the effect of torsional dynamics is developed. Provisions are made to allow the analysis of both the three phase balanced mode of operation and the single phase mode of operation of such motors. The resulting state space equations are then solved numerically in order to yield the required transient response curves. The outcome of this study will help in devising techniques to deal with the dangerous consequences of the electromechanical resonance phenomenon that may arise...|$|R
