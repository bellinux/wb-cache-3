2500|$|Since then, Land Rover have {{produced}} less extravagant special editions. The Defender Black was a 90 or 110 County 4x4 with metallic black paint, leather seats, air con, roll cage and dark-tinted rear windows. One {{of the most}} exciting off-road vehicles ever produced, Defender Silver is equipped with stylish and purposeful extras, inside and out, and was available in three distinct versions - TD5, 90 and 110 Station Wagon and 110 Double Cab Pickup. Designed to be tough. Very tough. It was designed to cope with the roughest off-road terrain. [...] That's why every Defender Silver was fitted with an A-frame protection bar which, while undoubtedly enhancing its rugged looks, offered additional protection {{to the front of the}} vehicle. [...] Lamp guards were fitted front and rear, and a tow pack incorporating an electrics kit not only to <b>power</b> <b>trailer</b> lights, but also additional equipment. The underside was further shielded from harm by the sump guard and air-con and ABS/TC were available as options. [...] The vehicles came of the production line and were then modified by SVO - Special Vehicle Operations. They are comparatively rare, especially the Double Cab Pick Up with its opinion splitting Fiberglass TruckMan Top..|$|E

5000|$|In 1955, Bruce’s {{invention}} of the double sprocket {{made it possible to}} drive wide tracks and also keep them in place while using a single row of wheels. The combination of the splice in the belt and the double sprocket allowed the use of any size or shape belt the vehicles needed. The “wide track” concept was born. They were now able to build a new and different type of machine. The first of these was a small 1-ton-capacity vehicle called the Scout Car. However, the oil industry need a larger capacity in order to transport the geophysical [...] "seismic" [...] drilling rigs. Bruce's next step was to build a tracked trailer, since a method of steering a large vehicle had yet to be located. The <b>powered</b> <b>trailer</b> had tracks 40 inches wide, its own engine, and could carry a five-ton load through muskeg. Although it had its own power, it was navigated by the smaller Scout Car, which was attached to its front hitch. Imperial Oil, responding to this breakthrough in muskeg vehicles, bought 30 <b>powered</b> tracked <b>trailers</b> and 30 Scout Cars.|$|R

50|$|The company, Bruce Nodwell Ltd., {{then began}} working on {{designing}} improvements to the <b>powered</b> <b>trailer</b> {{so that it would}} be a self-sufficient unit. The successful trailer was to be modified to include a cab and a steering differential device to make it into a self operating vehicle. Eventually, after a few unsuccessful attempts at finding or building a steering mechanism, the problem was solved by modifying an Oliver Tractor steering differential. The new vehicle was first called the Tracked Truck. However, everyone in the industry knew Bruce, because of his close contact with existing and potential customers, so they called the vehicle the “Nodwell”. Later, the vehicle became known as the Nodwell 110, indicating its payload in 100-pound units.|$|R

The mechanism allowed to engage the reverse gear, but the motocultivator was enabled to retreat only if the cutter was disengaged. A version with a third independent PTO for the Portuguese market was produced. The motocultivators were also painted with red color instead of the traditional green color.|$|R
25|$|The United States Federal Highway Administration has {{developed}} a classification scheme used for automatically calculating road use tolls. There are two broad categories {{depending on whether the}} vehicle carries passengers or commodities.

40|$|A stand alone, mobile {{photovoltaic}} {{power system}} along with a cable deployment system was designed and constructed {{to take part in}} the Desert Research And Technology Studies (RATS) lunar surface human interaction evaluation program at Cinder Lake, Arizona. The power system consisted of a photovoltaic array/battery system. It is capable of providing 1 kW of electrical power. The system outputs were 48 V DC, 110 V AC, and 220 V AC. A cable reel with 200 m of power cable was used to provide <b>power</b> from the <b>trailer</b> to a remote location. The cable reel was installed on a small trailer. The reel was powered to provide low to no tension deployment of the cable. The cable was connected to the 220 V AC output of the <b>power</b> system <b>trailer.</b> The <b>power</b> was then converted back to 110 V AC on the cable deployment trailer for use at the remote site. The Scout lunar rover demonstration vehicle was used to tow the cable trailer and deploy the power cable. This deployment was performed under a number of operational scenarios, manned operation, remote operation and tele-robotically. Once deployed, the cable was used to provide power, from the <b>power</b> system <b>trailer,</b> to run various operational tasks at the remote location...|$|R
50|$|The {{configuration}} of these cars was unsuccessful. The cars were fitted with AEI equipment, and the electrical equipment was {{split between the}} <b>power</b> and <b>trailer</b> car. The cables {{were not able to}} provide the power needed to operate the train as proposed. This resulted in many failures of the train to operate and also failures in the air-conditioning system.|$|R

2500|$|Moreover, {{the fact}} that CIÉ {{operated}} its railcars in four-car (two <b>power</b> cars, two <b>trailers)</b> or eight-car (four <b>power</b> cars, four <b>trailers)</b> sets, whereas the Great Northern—and, in general, its successor in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Transport Authority—used its near-identical vehicles in two-car (both power cars) or three-car (two <b>power</b> cars, one <b>trailer)</b> sets, meant that the 2600s had a poor power-to-weight ratio. One solution initially employed at busy times was to operate certain trains in a so-called [...] "6+2" [...] formation, comprising a power car, four intermediate trailers (usually including a dining car) and a second power car—thus giving passenger access throughout all six cars—followed by two extra power cars which were normally locked and inaccessible to passengers. From 1961, this arrangement was superseded {{by the use of}} powered intermediate cars, discussed below. By 1969, although suburban workings on [...] "the relatively flat sections around Dublin" [...] were formed of two power cars and two trailers, the remaining mainline workings used two-car sets.|$|R
