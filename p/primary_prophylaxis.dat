40|$|Background Posaconazole is {{effective}} as <b>primary</b> antifungal <b>prophylaxis</b> of invasive fungal diseases {{in patients with}} acute myeloid leukemia. Design and Methods The impact of <b>primary</b> antifungal <b>prophylaxis</b> administered during front-line chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia was evaluated by comparing 58 patients who received oral amphotericin B (control group) to 99 patients who received oral posaconazole (posaconazole group). The primary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable invasive fungal diseases. Secondary endpoints included incidence of invasive aspergillosis, survival at 4 and 12 months after the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia and costs. Results Proven/probable invasive fungal diseases were documented in 51. 7 % of patients {{in the control group}} and in 23. 2 % in the posaconazole group (P= 0. 0002). Invasive aspergillosis was documented in 43 % of patients in the control group and in 15 % in the posaconazole group (P= 0. 002). No survival difference was observed in patients aged over 60 years. In patients aged 60 years or less, a statistically significant survival advantage was observed at 4 months, but no longer at 12 months, in the posaconazole group (P= 0. 03).

The highest incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) and largest benefit of G-CSF during the first cycles of chemotherapy lead to questions about the effectiveness of continued use of G-CSF throughout later cycles of chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter study, patients with breast cancer who were considered fit enough to receive 3 -weekly polychemotherapy, but also had > 20 % risk for FN, were randomly assigned to <b>primary</b> G-CSF <b>prophylaxis</b> during the first two chemotherapy cycles only (experimental arm) or to <b>primary</b> G-CSF <b>prophylaxis</b> throughout all chemotherapy cycles (standard arm).

RESULTS: After inclusion of 167 eligible patients, the independent data monitoring committee advised premature study closure. Of 84 patients randomly assigned to G-CSF throughout all chemotherapy cycles, eight (10 %) experienced an episode of FN.

40|$|In {{recipients}} of {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplants (HSCTs), the mortality associated with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) remains high, despite the introduction of broad-spectrum antifungal agents over the past 2 decades. Preventing exposure to fungal pathogens in this population is impossible; therefore, clinicians have focused on prophylactic use of antifungal agents to prevent IFIs in high-risk HSCT recipients. It is important to target antifungal prophylaxis by type of HSCT (autologous or allogeneic), local epidemiology, and risk factors for IFIs so that patients can receive the most appropriate agent while balancing costs and the risks of toxicity, and minimizing the development of resistance. To assist clinicians in weighing {{the pros and cons}} of currently available antifungal agents when choosing a suitable prophylactic regimen, we provide a review of several key prospective randomized trials that evaluated various antifungal agents for <b>primary</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> in adult HSCT recipients.

Secondary prophylaxis cannot {{reduce the incidence of}} new cases of rheumatic fever and has not been shown to alter the natural history of rheumatic valvular disease.

The goal of this paper is to describe the current evidence behind the management of esophageal varices. We will discuss indications for <b>primary</b> <b>prophylaxis</b> and the different modes of therapy, pharmacological and interventional treatment in acute bleeding, and therapeutic options in preventing recurrent bleeding. The indications for TIPS will also be reviewed including its possible benefits in acute variceal hemorrhage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether delivering neo-adjuvant chemotherapy at a higher dose in a shorter period of time improves outcome of breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with newly diagnosed breast cancer were randomly assigned to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel (AC 60 / 600 - T 100 mg/m(2)) or six cycles of TAC (75 / 50 / 500 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, defined as no invasive tumour present in the breast. RESULTS: In total, 201 patients were included. Baseline characteristics were well balanced. AC-T resulted in pCR in 21 % and TAC in 16 % of patients (odds ratio 1. 44 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 67 - 3. 10). AC-T without primary granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis was associated with more febrile neutropenia compared to TAC with <b>primary</b> G-CSF <b>prophylaxis</b> (23 % versus 9 %), and with more grade 3 / 4 sensory neuropathy (5 % versus 0 %). CONCLUSIONS: With a higher cumulative dose for the concurrent arm, no differences were observed between the two treatment arms with respect to pCR rate. The differential toxicity profile could partly be explained by different use of <b>primary</b> G-CSF <b>prophylaxis.</b> Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|PURPOSE: Febrile {{neutropenia}} (FN) {{is a major}} {{complication of}} chemotherapy. Antibiotics as well as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are effective in preventing FN. This multicenter randomized phase III trial determines whether the addition of G-CSF to antibiotic prophylaxis can further {{reduce the incidence of}} FN in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) at the risk of FN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 175) were stratified for stage of disease, performance status, age, and prior chemotherapy treatment, and were randomly assigned for treatment with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (CDE), followed by prophylactic antibiotics alone (ciprofloxacin and roxithromycin) or by antibiotics in combination with G-CSF on days 4 to 13. RESULTS: In cycle 1, 20 patients (24 %) in the antibiotics group developed FN compared with nine patients (10 %) in the antibiotics plus G-CSF group (P =. 01). In cycles 2 to 5, the incidences of FN were practically the same in both groups (17 % v 11 %). Only the treatment parameters (odds ratio, 0. 33; 95 % CI, 0. 14 to 0. 78) and age (1. 067 per year; 95 % CI, 1. 013 to 1. 0124) were related to the probability of FN in cycle 1. CONCLUSION: <b>Primary</b> G-CSF <b>prophylaxis</b> added to <b>primary</b> antibiotic <b>prophylaxis</b> is effective in reducing FN and infections in SCLC patients at the risk of FN with the first cycle of CDE chemotherapy. For patients with similar risk of FN, the combined use of prophylactic antibiotics plus G-CSF can be considered, specifically in the first cycle of chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{infection}} in {{pregnant women and}} newborn babies is always challenging. Appropriate treatment is pivotal to curtail morbidity and mortality. TB diagnosis or exposure to active TB can be emotionally distressing to the mother. Circumstances can become more challenging for the physician if the mother’s TB status is unclear. Effective management of TB during pregnancy and the postpartum period requires a multidisciplinary approach including pulmonologist, obstetrician, neonatologist, infectious disease specialist, and TB public health department. Current guidelines recommend <b>primary</b> Isoniazid <b>prophylaxis</b> in TB exposed pregnant women who are immune-suppressed and have chronic medical conditions or obstetric risk factors and close and sustained contact with a patient with infectious TB. Treatment during pregnancy {{is the same as}} for the general adult population. Infants born to mothers with active TB at delivery should undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. <b>Primary</b> Isoniazid <b>prophylaxis</b> for at least twelve weeks is recommended for those with negative diagnostic tests and no evidence of disease. Repeated negative diagnostic tests are mandatory before interrupting prophylaxis. Separation of mother and infant is only necessary when the mother has received treatment for less than 2 weeks, is sputum smear-positive, or has drug-resistant TB. This case highlights important aspects for management of TB during the postpartum period which has a higher morbidity. We present a case of a young mother migrating from a developing nation to the USA, who was found to have a positive quantiFERON test associated with multiple cavitary lung lesions and gave birth to a healthy baby...|$|R
