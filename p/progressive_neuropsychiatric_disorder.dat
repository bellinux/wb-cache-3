40|$|Abstract Background: The risk {{of burnout}} among {{caregivers}} {{of people with}} dementia is on the increase. Dementia is a <b>progressive</b> <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> affecting the cognitive function resulting in confusion and disorientation leading to greater demands on the caregiver {{which can lead to}} depression, social isolation, stress, worsening personal health, anxiety, fatigue, financial losses, and potential for abuse. Methods: This project focused on creating a toolkit for nursing staff caring for patients with dementia followed by a presentation designed to provide options for caregiver support that can assist the caregiver in decreasing their feelings of stress and burnout. This included strategies for coping with dementia and some of the behaviors that go with it, as well as websites and phone resources. Results: Nine nurses attended the presentation and seven took both pre and post- test. The pre-test allowed for additional strategies to be suggested and the post-test indicated that most nurses had a good idea of strategies to present to caregivers. A toolkit was provided and a brochure to caregivers. Conclusion: The toolkit presentations and caregiver resource brochure were positively accepted by the nine of eleven nursing staff. The nursing staff indicated that this caregiver brochure was a resource that would be sustainable for future use. Nurses caring for persons with dementia are {{in the best position to}} educate the caregivers and provide the necessary resources that they may need.

40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{represents}} {{the most frequent}} <b>progressive</b> <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorder</b> worldwide leading to dementia. We systematically investigated the presence and extent of the AD-related cytoskeletal pathology in serial thick tissue sections through all subcortical brain nuclei that send efferent projections to the transentorhinal and entorhinal regions in three individuals with Braak and Braak AD stage 0 cortical cytoskeletal pathology and fourteen individuals with Braak and Braak AD stage I cortical cytoskeletal pathology by means of immunostainings with the anti-tau antibody AT 8. These investigations revealed consistent AT 8 immunoreactive tau cytoskeletal pathology in a subset of these subcortical nuclei in the Braak and Braak AD stage 0 individuals and {{in all of these}} subcortical nuclei in the Braak and Braak AD stage I individuals. The widespread affection of the subcortical nuclei in Braak and Braak AD stage I shows that the extent of the early subcortical tau cytoskeletal pathology has been considerably underestimated previously. In addition, our novel findings support the concept that subcortical nuclei become already affected during an early 'pre-cortical' evolutional phase before the first AD-related cytoskeletal changes occur in the mediobasal temporal lobe (i. e. allocortical transentorhinal and entorhinal regions). The very early involved subcortical brain regions may represent the origin of the AD-related tau cytoskeletal pathology, from where the neuronal cytoskeletal pathology takes an ascending course toward the secondarily affected allocortex and spreads transneuronally along anatomical pathways in predictable sequences...|$|E

In this syndrome, {{the most}} common neurologic abnormality is transient ischemic attack. This can be easily overlooked if a patient presents with <b>progressive</b> <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> such as depression or dementia. We report two cases of young women, aged 35 and 22 years, presenting with progressive depression and mental decline over a certain period. The neuropsychological diagnoses of the two patients were, respectively, dementia with disinhibition and borderline dementia with depression. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple old infarcts with encephalomalacia in the former case, and only one cortical hemorrhagic infarction, over the right temporoparietal lobe, observed in the latter case. The outcomes of the two cases were also very different. <b>Progressive</b> <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> are increasingly observed in the young; therefore, APS and other autoimmune diseases should be considered during the differential diagnosis. Brain imaging examinations may prevent a delay in the detection of a structural lesion and facilitate the early intervention with good prognosis.

40|$|Endocrine {{systems have}} long been {{suggested}} to be on of the important factors in <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> while the underlying mechanisms have not been well understood. Traditionally, <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> have been mainly considered the consequence of abnormal conditions in neural circuitry. Beyond the neuronal doctrine, microglia, one of the glial cells with inflammatory/immunological functions in the CNS, have recently been suggested to play important roles in <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, the crosstalk between neuroendocrine factors, <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> and microglia has been unsolved. Therefore, we herein introduce and discuss a missing and possible link between these three factors; especially highlighting the following hormones; (1) Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis-related hormones such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and glucocorticoids, (2) sex-related hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, and (3) oxytocin. A {{growing body of evidence}} has suggested that these hormones have a direct effect on microglia. We hypothesize that hormone-induced microglial activation and the following microglia-derived mediators may lead to maladaptive neuronal networks including synaptic dysfunctions, causing <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> Future investigations to clarify the correlation between neuroendocrine factors and microglia may contribute to a novel understanding of the pathophysiology of <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose of review: There are gender {{differences}} in cognitive function and in the prevalence of many <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> The biological basis for this is still poorly understood but {{may be related to}} the effects of oestrogen on brain maturation and subsequent modulation of brain function in regions that are implicated in <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> This review is timely and relevant, as recent studies have furthered our understanding into oestrogen's role in both maturation and functioning of brain areas and neurochemical systems involved in common <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> Recent findings: This review begins by analysing the effects of oestrogen on brain function at the macroscopic, microscopic, functional, metabolic and neurotransmitter levels. This is followed by a summary of current opinion on the effects of oestrogen on specific <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression. Summary: Basic research indicates that oestrogen may effect brain maturation and subsequent modulation of brain function in regions that are implicated in <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> The most robust effect of oestrogen on brain function is in the domain of cognitive function, especially verbal memory. Clinical research findings, however, do not at present suggest that oestrogen should be used as a first line treatment for <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> in clinical practice. © 2004 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins...|$|R

40|$|Public {{concern on}} mental health has noticeably {{increased}} given the high prevalence of <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> Cognition and emotionality are the most affected functions in <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> i. e. anxiety disorders, depression and schizophrenia. In this review, most relevant literature {{on the role of}} the endocannabinoid (eCB) system in <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> will be presented. Evidence from clinical and animal studies is provided for the participation of CB 1 and CB 2 receptors (CB 1 R and CB 2 R) in the above mentioned <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> CBRs are crucial in some of the emotional and cognitive impairments reported, although more research is required to understand the specific role of the eCB system in <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> Cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychotropic component of the Cannabis sativa plant, has shown therapeutic potential in several <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> Although further studies are needed, recent studies indicate that CBD therapeutic effects may partially depend on facilitation of eCB-mediated neurotransmission. Last but not least, this review includes recent findings {{on the role of the}} eCB system in eating disorders. A deregulation of the eCB system has been proposed to be in the bases of several <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> including eating disorders. Cannabis consumption has been related to the appearance of psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia. In contrast, the pharmacological manipulation of this eCB system has been proposed as a potential strategy for the treatment of anxiety disorders, depression, and anorexia nervosa. In conclusion, the eCB system plays a critical role in psychiatry; however, detrimental consequences of manipulating this endogenous system cannot be underestimated over the potential and promising perspectives of its therapeutic manipulation...|$|R

40|$|Learning from errors is {{fundamental}} to adaptive human behavior. It requires detecting errors, evaluating what went wrong, and adjusting behavior accordingly. These dynamic adjustments {{are at the heart}} of behavioral flexibility and accumulating evidence suggests that deficient error processing contributes to maladaptively rigid and repetitive behavior in a range of <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies reveal highly reliable neural markers of error processing. In this review, we evaluate the evidence that abnormalities in these neural markers can serve as sensitive endophenotypes of <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders.</b> We describe the behavioral and neural hallmarks of error processing, their mediation by common genetic polymorphisms, and impairments in schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. We conclude that neural markers of errors meet several important criteria as endophenotypes including heritability, established neuroanatomical and neurochemical substrates, association with <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders,</b> presence in syndromally-unaffected family members, and evidence of genetic mediation. Understanding the mechanisms of error processing deficits in <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> may provide novel neural and behavioral targets for treatment and sensitive surrogate markers of treatment response.

We report 13 Japanese adolescents or young adults with Down syndrome who developed acute <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorders</b> including withdrawal, depression, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and occasional delusions or hallucinations. Methods: The following information was collected from each patient: age at onset of acute <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorder,</b> complications, signs and symptoms, personality traits before the onset of the acute <b>neuropsychiatric</b> <b>disorder,</b> prescribed medications with their respective doses and the response to treatment, and senile changes observed on magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Results: The mean age at onset of these disorders was 21. 2 years. Brain imaging showed almost senile changes; patients responded well to low-dose psychotropic therapy.
