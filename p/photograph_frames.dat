60|$|Honora {{walked through}} the rooms. There was nothing {{intricate}} about the house; it was as simple as two times four, and really too large for her and Howard. Her presents were installed, the pictures and <b>photograph</b> <b>frames</b> and chairs, even Mr. Isham's dining-room table and Cousin Eleanor's piano. The sight of these, and of the engraving which Aunt Mary had sent on, and which all her childhood had hung over her bed in the little room at home, brought the tears once more to her eyes. But she forced them back bravely.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{her father}} had gone, Ida rose and {{suggested}} that if Colonel Quaritch had done his wine they should go into the drawing-room, which they accordingly did. This room was much more modern than either the vestibule or the dining-room, and had an air and flavour of nineteenth century young lady about it. There were the little tables, the draperies, the <b>photograph</b> <b>frames,</b> and all the hundred and one knick- knacks and odds and ends by means of which a lady of taste makes a chamber lovely {{in the eyes of}} brutal man. It was a very pleasant place to look upon, this drawing-room at Honham Castle, with its irregular recesses, its somewhat faded colours illuminated by the soft light of a shaded lamp, and its general air of feminine dominion. Harold Quaritch was a man who had seen much of the world, but who had not seen very much of drawing-rooms, or, indeed, of ladies at large. They had not come in his way, or if they did come in his way he had avoided them. Therefore, perhaps, he was the more susceptible to such influences when he was brought within their reach. Or perchance it was Ida's gracious presence which threw a charm upon the place that added to its natural attractiveness, as the china bowls of lavender and rose leaves added perfume to the air. Anyhow, it struck him that he had rarely before seen a room which conveyed to his mind such strong suggestions of refinement and gentle rest.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Pomfret, {{knowing the}} income, after an {{exhaustive}} search decided upon Leith {{as the place}} to build her villa. It must be credited to her foresight that, when she built, she saw the future possibilities of the place. The proper people had started it. And it must be credited to her genius that she added to these possibilities of Leith by bringing to it such families as she thought worthy {{to live in the}} neighbourhood--families which incidentally increased the value of the land. Her villa had a decided French look, and was so amazingly trim and neat and generally shipshape as to be fit--for only the daintiest and most discriminating feminine occupation. The house was small, and its metamorphosis from a plain wooden farm-house had been an achievement that excited general admiration. Porches had been added, and a coat of spotless white relieved by an orange striping so original that many envied, but none dared to copy it. The striping went around the white chimneys, along the cornice, under the windows and on the railings of the porch: there were window boxes gay with geraniums and abundant awnings striped white and red, to match the flowers: a high, formal hemlock hedge hid the house from the road, through which entered a blue-stone drive that cut the close-cropped lawn and made a circle to the doorway. Under the great maples on the lawn were a tea-table, rugs, and wicker chairs, and the house itself was furnished by a variety of things of a design not to be bought in the United States of America: desks, <b>photograph</b> <b>frames,</b> writing-sets, clocks, paperknives, flower baskets, magazine racks, cigarette boxes, and dozens of other articles for the duplicates of which one might have searched Fifth Avenue in vain.|$|E
60|$|He {{knew that}} he would not be able to come, since he was going to help Mildred with her moving, but he had not the courage to say so. He made up his mind that he would send a wire. Mildred saw the rooms in the morning, was {{satisfied}} with them, and after luncheon Philip went up with her to Highbury. She had a trunk for her clothes and another for the various odds and ends, cushions, lampshades, <b>photograph</b> <b>frames,</b> with which she had tried to give the apartments a home-like air; she had two or three large cardboard boxes besides, but in all there was no more than could be put on the roof of a four-wheeler. As they drove through Victoria Street Philip sat well back in the cab in case Norah should happen to be passing. He had not had an opportunity to telegraph and could not do so from the post office in the Vauxhall Bridge Road, since she would wonder what he was doing in that neighbourhood; and if he was there he could have no excuse for not going into the neighbouring square where she lived. He made up his mind that he had better go in and see her for half an hour; but the necessity irritated him: he was angry with Norah, because she forced him to vulgar and degrading shifts. But he was happy to be with Mildred. It amused him to help her with the unpacking; and he experienced a charming sense of possession in installing her in these lodgings which he had found and was paying for. He would not let her exert herself. It was a pleasure to do things for her, and she had no desire to do what somebody else seemed desirous to do for her. He unpacked her clothes and put them away. She was not proposing to go out again, so he got her slippers and took off her boots. It delighted him to perform menial offices.|$|E
6000|$|In December, {{when the}} {{hospitals}} were already full, her French friends first {{took her to}} the one which they attended. She went in, her face very calm, with that curious inward composure which never deserted it, carrying in front of her with both hands a black silk bag, wherein she had concealed an astonishing collection of treasures for the poor men! A bottle of acidulated drops, packets of cigarettes, two of her own mufflers, a pocket set of drafts, some English riddles translated by herself into French (very curious), some ancient copies of an illustrated paper, boxes of chocolate, a ball of string to make [...] "cat's cradles" [...] (such an amusing game), her own packs of Patience cards, some <b>photograph</b> <b>frames,</b> post-cards of Arles, and--most singular--a kettle-holder. At the head of each bed she would sit down and rummage in the bag, speaking in her slow but quite good French, to explain the use of the acidulated drops, or to give a lesson in cat's cradles. And the poilus would listen with their polite, ironic patience, and be left smiling, and curiously fascinated, {{as if they had been}} visited by a creature from another world. She would move on to other beds, quite unconscious of the effect she had produced on them and of their remarks: [...] "Cette vieille dame, comme elle est bonne!" [...] or [...] "Espèce d'ange aux cheveux gris." [...] "L'ange anglaise aux cheveux gris" [...] became in fact her name within those walls. And the habit of filling that black silk bag and going there to distribute its contents soon grew to be with her a ruling passion which neither weather nor her own aches and pains, not inconsiderable, must interfere with. The things she brought became more marvellous every week. But, however much she carried coals to Newcastle, or tobacco pouches to those who did not smoke, or homoeopathic globules to such as crunched up the whole bottleful for the sake of the sugar, as soon as her back was turned, no one ever smiled now with anything but real pleasure at sight of her calm and truly sweet smile, and the scent of soap on her pale hands. [...] "Cher fils, je croyais que ceci vous donnerait un peu de plaisir. Voyez-vous comme c'est commode, n'est ce pas?" [...] Each newcomer to the wards was warned by his comrades that the English angel with the grey hair was to be taken without a smile, exactly as if she were his grandmother.|$|E

In the mid- sixties the upstairs sections were gutted to provide ground floor open dormitory accommodation for prisoners deemed low risk. These prisoners wore suede shoes (work boots were the norm for prisoners) and could have personal items containing materials normally banned, such as glass in <b>photograph</b> <b>frames.</b> It also gave easier access to the industries which were in The Lane, like the Bakehouse and Laundry (which was directly below).|$|E
5000|$|Nowadays, special {{orders are}} to be placed at the store at 233, rue Saint-Honoré, {{as it was the}} case when the factory was located in Bezons. Special orders are entirely hand-made in the Goyard {{workshops}} in southern France, in the Aude department. The workshops are installed in converted wine warehouses. Whilst some trunk makers specialize in standardized goods, Goyard is equally at ease with both special orders and ready-made items.

30|$|The aerial {{photographs}} and SPOT images were imported into ERDAS Imagine 2014 ® software, and georeferenced to the UTM projection using ground control points (GCPs) that were well {{spread in the}} image scenes. The GCPs mainly consisted of road and power line junctions. During georeferencing low rectification error (expressed as Root Mean Square (RMS) error) was aimed at. Due to {{the large number of}} aerial photograph and satellite image scenes, the individual RMS error values were too many to individually report but all were less than one pixel. On the older photographs the search for GCPs was rather challenging due to the relatively fewer roads and power lines that existed in the KNP then. This limited the number of GCPs to 7 – 9 on the old aerial photographs, in particular the 1942 photographs of the Mooiplaas site. For this reason the 1942 aerial photographs of the north-eastern sector of the Mooiplaas site could not be georeferenced and were, therefore, not used. After the georeferencing, shapefiles of the study sites were used in subsetting the images to yield the images depicting the study sites on the respective dates shown in Fig.  2. The 1940 / 42, 1968 and 1977 scenes in Fig.  2 are aerial <b>photograph</b> <b>frames</b> of the respective study sites prior to further processing and the creation of mosaics.

40|$|The dessert banana is {{the most}} popular fruit {{worldwide}} in terms of export. And ACP countries have fought bitterly to retain their commercial advantage in the European market, since access is crucial to the economic development of their rural areas. Even so, exports only account for 13 % of the 70 million t of dessert bananas produced worldwide. The remaining 87 % are consumed locally. Sweet bananas aside, a further 30 million t of cooking bananas or plantains are produced each year for the domestic market. Bananas therefore {{play a key role in}} the economy and food security of producer countries. But other parts of the banana tree may also be used and the by-products sold on local or overseas markets. In ACP regions, countries are constantly researching, developing and inventing new uses, because nothing goes to waste in the banana tree. Drinking bananas with and without moderation Extending the banana s shelf-life Every last bit has its use, but not for long. The fruit is sensitive to heat and is highly perishable. More than one-quarter of total output is estimated to be lost in this way each year. In Ghana and Papua New Guinea for example, production rates exceed local demand, but the poor state of the roads makes it difficult to supply markets in the surrounding towns with sufficient speed. However, when the dessert bananas or plantains are processed into flour, dried fruit or chips, the shelf-life increases from 2 weeks to more than 6 months or even a year. Such products can replace wheat flour and potato chips, both of which are often imported. In the Pacific islands of Samoa, plantain varieties make excellent savoury chips. In South Africa, for the past 30 years a company in Mpumalanga, 400 km from Johannesburg, has been processing 10 % of its output into dried bananas (cubes and slices) for sale to local schools. As for the banana skins, these provide free fodder for pigs. In Uganda, a banana processing company specialises in using solar power to dry the fruit in 2 or 3 days. It makes the dryers and sells them on credit for US$ 200 (165) per unit to their producers, after first training them on how to use it. Realising that production and processing are inextricably linked, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain (INIBAP) worked between 2002 and 2004 to select the species of bananas that would be most amenable to these various processing techniques. Drinking bananas with and without moderation Overripe sweet bananas can be made into pulp or drinks. In Fiji, the fruit is squeezed and the pulp is then filtered and enriched with vitamin C to prevent it from darkening. The product is sent by container to manufacturers of infant foods, ice creams and confectionery. In West Africa and elsewhere, small firms are successfully marketing pure banana juice, selling it by the glass in the street or in 500 ml bottles in the shops. Banana wine is very popular throughout East Africa. In Tanzania, bananas are left to ferment between 15 and 60 days to produce a wine of 7 to 9 degrees proof. In Kenya, banana wine is considered a palatable substitute for the much stronger sugar cane-based alcohol. Using banana fibre Although both dessert and plantain bananas lend themselves to a range of processing techniques intended for human consumption, these only generate limited revenues. That is why other parts of the banana tree are also used. Women in Kenya s Maragua district make craft items from banana fibre and sell them on the market. They take the broad base of the leaves which more or less enclose the pseudostem of the banana tree and which conceal fibres roughly 90 cm long, these are then dried, treated and plaited. The women offer tablemats, <b>photograph</b> <b>frames,</b> earrings and boxes as souvenirs, for sale to intermediaries who sell them in the market or on order, mainly to tourists. Each week, the women themselves harvest the leaves to ensure the finest quality, and extract some 50 kg of fibre. In Gabon, Haiti and Uganda, banana fibre is also used to make paper. The fibre is cut into 1 to 2 cm long pieces, mixed with ash and boiled for 8 h. The paste is then spread out as desired and dried, before being pressed to make it more uniform. Sold as sheets of paper, greeting or visiting cards, this paper can be found in craft shops throughout Europe and elsewhere in the world. Finally, the European association for composite materials, the JEC Group, has awarded an innovation prize to a company in the Philippines which is using banana fibre (Musa textilis) as a replacement for glass fibre in the lower bodywork of a top-range European car. According to the manufacturer, using this new fibre in the automobile industry could cut energy costs in production by 60 %. The fibres from this banana tree are more commonly used to make fabric and rope. Products which make use of banana fibre, a part of the banana tree deemed useless in the context of food production, may in future offer quality, economical and ecological alternatives. Photographic credit: R. Faidutti © FAO / 19323 It would be a mistake to let the banana overshadow the banana tree. For while the fruit lends itself to a variety of uses, the pseudostem and leaves can often also be made into innovative products. In the South, a number of countries are doing just that...|$|E
