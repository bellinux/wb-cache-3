40|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} {{vulnerable}} to fisheries exploitation because of late maturation and low fecundity, highlighting the need for effective conservation strategies. Area closures have been proposed as an appropriate management option for thornback rays in the southern North Sea, where they appear to form local subpopulations between which there is limited mixing. To gain a fishery-independent estimation of stock distribution, 197 thornback rays Raja clavata tagged with electronic data storage tags (DST) were released in the Thames Estuary in 1999 and 2000. The tidal location method was used to estimate the positions of individual fish between time of release and recapture. The fishery-independent seasonal stock distributions were integrated with landings data and a simple model was developed to estimate monthly fishing effort per International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) rectangle by different fleets and gear types. The potential impacts of closed area management, in terms of reducing thornback ray mortality in the southern North Sea, were calculated. Spatial closures were applied either (i) as <b>permanent</b> <b>closures</b> of individual ICES rectangles or (ii) seasonally, {{at the level of}} the Thames Estuary. Catch reductions were calculated allowing for the redistribution of fishing effort. The results confirmed the importance of the Thames Estuary for thornback rays. However, 77 % of rays moved outside the estuary over winter, with seasonal migration into the Thames to spawn between March and August. The effects of closures varied between areas and gear types. <b>Permanent</b> <b>closures</b> of individual ICES rectangles were less effective at reducing fishing mortality on rays than a spring or summer closure of the Thames Estuary as a whole, which would have a major impact on the commercially more valuable sole fishery. Synthesis and applications. The results presented illustrate the potential impacts of a range of closure scenarios, prior to their implementation, as a basis for advice on sustainable exploitation of thornback rays. These models could be further refined by additional studies of juvenile behaviour and of other ray subpopulations in the southern North Sea...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade in Prekmurje, {{there has been a}} {{noticeable}} decline and physiologically weakening of the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) because ofdry climate, unfavourable precipitation patterns and human influence throughchanges in watercourses and the water table. The paper addresses the relationship between water stress of the common oak and indicators of water status in the Murska {uma forest complex (groundwater table, precipitation, water level of the rivers Mura and Ledava) using plant stress indicators such as water potential, electrical resistance of the cambial zone and crown defoliation. Ttwo permanent plots with varying levels in decline in pedunculate oak trees were chosen. Water potential, electrical resistance of cambial zone and defoliation were measured once a month.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{strengths}} and weaknesses of state-supported Customary Marine Tenure (CMT) systems in two independent Melanesian states (Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea) in the context of the management of rapidly intensifying commercial and subsistence fisheries. We focus particularly on the proposed use of permanent no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), which are at present strongly favoured by scientists and environmentalists around the world, as the most versatile marine fishery management tool, especially in poor developing countries. We argue that, with some exceptions, typical Melanesian CMT regimes make MPAs difficult to establish, primarily due to issues of scale. We look closely at the ecological rationale for no-take MPAs, for different coral-reef based species, and assess the likelihood that populations of these species are self-replacing on the same scale as CMT territories for most of coastal PNG and Solomon Islands. We argue that with some exceptions (mainly species with short-lived larvae), the dynamics and scale of population replacement processes for most fished species make no-take <b>permanent</b> <b>closures</b> largely incompatible with traditional CMT systems, and therefore unlikely to prove a successful management tool in this socio-political context...|$|R

5000|$|On December 16, 1918, {{the head}} of state issued a decree in which all assets of the Orthodox Church in Poland were put under the {{administration}} of the state.

The decree did not lose validity even when the population and Orthodox clergy returned to the occupied territories after the war, and after the March constitution guaranteed freedom of religion. Consent to re-open churches and their use for the purpose of worship was issued by the state administration and could not be granted without detailed justification. In 1919, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education (Ministerstwo Wyznań Religijnych i Oświecenia Publicznego - MWRiOP) ordered seals attached to inactive Orthodox churches, declaring they would take a more comprehensive decision on the Orthodox churches at a later time.

40|$|The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) manages New England’s {{northeast}} multispecies fishery {{with effort}} controls including gear restrictions, seasonal and <b>permanent</b> <b>closures,</b> trip and daily possession limits, and days-at-sea (DAS). The fishery operates on a soft or “target” {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) rather than a hard catch limit. Target TACs lack a closure provision, and do not require overages to be deducted from the following year’s recommended TAC. New England routinely exceeds target catch levels for multiple stocks, threatening rebuilding objectives and leading to more restrictive effort controls. Hard catch limits would provide greater control over total fishing mortality, ensuring that managers and fishermen are held accountable to objectives of the multispecies management plan and that rebuilding plans are successful. They would also eliminate the economic inefficiencies generated by input controls and provide fishermen with greater economic opportunities during the rebuilding process. Seven sub-programs within the northeast multispecies fishery are currently managed under hard catch limits including the Georges Bank hook and fixed gear sectors, the U. S. /Canada Resource Sharing Understanding, the Category B (regular) DAS program, and three Special Access Programs.

25|$|The Congregation for Clergy {{wrote that}} Lennon's March 12, 2009 {{letter to the}} pastor omitted any {{specific}} reference to the relegation {{of the church to}} secular but not unbecoming use, or to the canonical process required by Canon1222§2. The Congregation for Clergy reasoned that it is apparent from the acts that Lennon did in fact arrive at a decision to implement the effects of the process envisioned by Canon1222§2 without fulfilling its procedures. Lennon's March 12, 2009 letter to the pastor is quite specific, indicating that the Church would not be used after the suppression of the Parish. In doing so, an essential element for the validity of the relegation of a church to secular but not unbecoming use was omitted, i.e., the required consultation of the Presbyteral Council regarding the matter. Lennon, even after being advised as to these shortfalls, declined to clarify the matter either by allowing the Church to remain open for divine worship and the devotion of the faithful, or by following the procedure for relegation. By the law itself, such an omission renders invalid Lennon's decision to implement the effects of Canon1222§2, i.e., the <b>permanent</b> <b>closure</b> of St. Casimir and its concomitant relegation to secular but not unbecoming use.|$|E
