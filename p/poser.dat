However, the project was abandoned after producers disagreed with casting an Asian male in the film's lead role. Since {{the end of its}} first tour, Wong Fu has created music videos for rising artists and continued producing short films. The group's merchandise line, which included original T-shirt designs, was launched in conjunction with the 2007 film Just a Nice Guy. The short film The Spare was featured at the 2008 San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival, and two additional short films—At Musing's End and A Peace of Home—were shown at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival Short Films Corner.

Cena was introduced as Raw's newest member in Chris Jericho's segment, the Highlight Reel, but Christian interrupted and called Cena a <b>poser.</b> This built on their existing rivalry, as Cena and Christian had an encounter at the Royal Rumble, in which Christian claimed that he was a better rapper than Cena. At the time, Cena {{was a member of the}} SmackDown! brand and Christian was part of the Raw brand. Over the next months, Christian began cutting promos denouncing Cena as a 'poser'. Cena rebutted Christian's comments by performing a freestyle rap about Christian, which quickly led to the two brawling in the ring. The same evening, Cena entered a feud with Bischoff by refusing to participate in Bischoff's [...] "war" [...] against the upcoming Extreme Championship Wrestling reunion show. On the June 13 episode of Raw, Bischoff booked a WWE title match between Christian and Cena at Vengeance, although Jericho protested the idea of Christian being the contender to face Cena for the title. Later that night, Cena and Jericho were placed in a tag team match and faced off against Christian and Tyson Tomko. Cena and Jericho won the match after Cena got the pinfall. After the match, Jericho turned on Cena and attacked him. Bischoff then changed the original match between Cena and Christian to a Triple Threat match at Vengeance that also included Jericho.|$|E

Education, Pedagogical Faculty, Charles University in Prague Supervisor: doc. RNDr. Jaroslav Zhouf, Ph. D. Abstract: The aim of {{the thesis}} is to compare the problem posing process of problem <b>posers</b> on various {{experience}} levels: Novices have no experience, specialists pose problems {{but not more than}} their teachers profession requires, experts pose problems profesionally, e. g. for Mathematical competitions. There were two phases of the research - both of them consisting of the pilot phase and the main study. The participants posed difficult and original Mathematical problems for approximately 15 -year-old students. In the first phase methods derived from the grounded theory were used to analyze self-reflections, questionnaires and other written materials of problem <b>posers.</b> The second phase was based on qualitative analysis of videotyped problem posing process of respondents. The problem posing process of the three groups of respondents was different. With increasing level of experience the ratio of intentional ideas increased as well as the ratio of <b>posers</b> finding inspiration in the existing problem. Opinion to how a good problem should look like is also different for [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Power posing, the {{adoption}} of open and powerful postures, has effects that parallel those of actual social power. This study explored the social evaluation of adopting powerful versus powerless body postures in men and women regarding perceived warmth, competence, {{and the likelihood of}} eliciting admiration, envy, pity, and contempt. Previous findings suggest that the display of power by women may have side effects due to gender stereotyping, namely reduced warmth ratings and negative emotional reactions. An experiment (N = 2, 473) asked participants to rate pictures {{of men and women who}} adopted high-power or low-power body postures. High-power <b>posers</b> were rated higher on competence, admiration, envy, and contempt compared to low-power <b>posers,</b> whereas the opposite was true for pity. There was no impact of power posing on perceived warmth. Contrary to expectations, the <b>poser’s</b> gender did not moderate any of the effects. These findings suggest that nonverbal displays of power do influence fundamental dimensions of social perception and their accompanying emotional reactions but result in comparably positive and negative evaluations for both genders...|$|R

60|$|Besides the {{professional}} <b>posers</b> {{of the studio}} there are <b>posers</b> of the Row, the <b>posers</b> at afternoon teas, the <b>posers</b> in politics and the circus <b>posers.</b> All four classes are delightful, but only the last class is ever really decorative. Acrobats and gymnasts can give the young painter infinite suggestions, for they bring into their art an element of swiftness of motion and of constant change that the studio model necessarily lacks. What is interesting in these 'slaves of the ring' is that with them Beauty is an unconscious result not a conscious aim, the result in fact of the mathematical calculation of curves and distances, of absolute precision of eye, of the scientific knowledge of the equilibrium of forces, and of perfect physical training. A good acrobat is always graceful, though grace is never his object; he is graceful because he does {{what he has to}} do in the best way in which it can be done - graceful because he is natural. If an ancient Greek were to come to life now, which considering the probable severity of his criticisms would be rather trying to our conceit, he would be found far oftener at the circus than at the theatre. A good circus is an oasis of Hellenism in a world that reads too much to be wise, and thinks too much to be beautiful. If it were not for the running- ground at Eton, the towing-path at Oxford, the Thames swimming- baths, and the yearly circuses, humanity would forget the plastic perfection of its own form, and degenerate into a race of short- sighted professors and spectacled PRECIEUSES. Not that the circus proprietors are, as a rule, conscious of their high mission. Do they not bore us with the HAUTE ECOLE, and weary us with Shakespearean clowns? Still, at least, they give us acrobats, and the acrobat is an artist. The mere fact that he never speaks to the audience shows how well he appreciates the great truth that the aim of art is not to reveal personality but to please. The clown may be blatant, but the acrobat is always beautiful. He is an interesting combination of the spirit of Greek sculpture with the spangles of the modern costumier. He has even had his niche in the novels of our age, and if MANETTE SALOMON be the unmasking of the model, LES FRERES ZEMGANNO is the apotheosis of the acrobat.|$|R
