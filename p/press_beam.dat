40|$|Local Name: TekelilerLatitude: 37. 35. 21. 30 Longitude: 28. 41. 46. 08 Elevation: 877 mDimensions: {{approximately}} 90 m by 40 mDescription: This settlement, {{located just}} 1. 3 km up the Kara Dere stream northeast of Koca Ören, is poorly preserved. The large-scale limestone {{construction of the}} walls at the site {{is similar to that}} at Koca Ören and Tekeliler. The site measures approximately 90 m by 40 m, but unfortunately the greater part of this area has been disturbed by the creation of modern agricultural plots, with many of the walls plowed up and the blocks reused in field walls. Only one full room is preserved, and additional evidence suggests at least four others. Thickets of scrub oak reduce surface visibility to almost zero in parts of the site. The only press element found at the site is a single socket block (B 052). The one fully defined room is {{on the south side of}} the ** site. The room measures approximately 5. 90 m by 3. 50 m, with the door on the west side, and the in-situ socket block is built into the room's south wall. The socket block is at modern ground level, so any other surviving agricultural blocks are presumably buried. The walls are constructed partly out of marble petit appareil masonry, but the socket block and the blocks surrounding it are the local limestone. North of the socket block is a vertical limestone slab, 1. 19 m long and 0. 19 m wide, in the same relative location as the similar block at Yolüstü, perhaps to support the <b>press</b> <b>beam</b> when not in use. A robber's pit in the northwest corner of the room has exposed two large marble slabs at the same level as the socket block, which could be part of a podium connected to the pressing process, perhaps where the fiscinae were placed. The lack of visibility at this site made pottery collection impossible, and the only sherds found were pithos body fragments seen near the socket block. This makes it difficult to assess the chronological relationship between sites on the southwest plateau. The proximity of Koca Ören, Tekeliler, and Kara Dere and their similar construction and architectural characteristics imply a dense network of olive oil processing sites on the plateau, suggesting that this area was at least in certain periods an important local economic center. Finds: Finds were sparse and not helpful in determining the date of occupation of the site...|$|E
40|$|Local Name: YolüstüLocal Informant: Hidayet and HüseyinLocal Information: In field {{just west}} of YolüstüLatitude: 37. 36. 03. 159 Longitude: 28. 38. 55. 411 Elevation: 807 mDimensions: up to 500 m by 200 mDescription: The large ancient {{settlement}} is located near the modern village of Yolüstü on the plateau southwest of the Morsynus valley. The site measures approximately 500 m by 200 m, with traces of numerous walls {{for a variety of}} buildings. Unsuccessful modern field-clearing efforts have caused considerable damage to the site, and deep plowing in many areas has obscured the lines of walls. The limestone used for most of the buildings is itself badly weathered. Dense scrub oak covers the site. The settlement was well sited, located on a slight rise {{in the center of the}} plateau with a view of the entire surrounding area, including all the entry points onto the plateau. Press and mill elements found at the site (B 024) include a marble counterweight block, three limestone socket blocks (two of which are in situ), and a possible marble press bed or grinding bed [...] the counterweight block is unusual in that it is made out of marble, while local limestone was more widely used at this site and only a few other small fragments of marble are visible. ** In the west part of the settlement is a row of three rooms. In the south room, a socket block remains in situ, resting at modern ground level, which indicates that any remaining press equipment is buried beneath the surface. In the opposite wall is a second fragmentary socket block, which perhaps sat higher in the wall. Each of the three rooms measures approximately 6. 1 m by 9. 3 m; the outer walls are about 0. 9 – 1. 0 m thick, with the dividing walls between the rooms approximately 0. 75 m thick. The walls were built largely of small rough hewn limestone blocks, with larger blocks encasing the socket block. 3. 7 m north of the in-situ socket block, a narrow slab projects from the ground. This slab may have supported the <b>press</b> <b>beam</b> when not in use. Just east of this suite of rooms is a third socket block, also in situ, although only a very small part of the wall into which it is set survives, and the full outline of the room is not visible. ** No other architectural fragments were seen. The pottery from this site does not provide a precise date for the occupation. Very few sherds were observed, and the majority of these were of the largely un-datable local TMW. Finds: Finds were sparse and not helpful in determining the date of occupation of the site. ** Systematic pottery collection conducted 8 June 200...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} a bend is {{determined}} by the accuracy and consistency of the angle {{along the length of the}} part. This accuracy is directly related to the penetration of the tool in the die. Small variations in tool penetration can cause relatively large changes in bend angle. Such variations are caused by changes in the repeatability of the tool stopping point, by deflections of the <b>press</b> brake <b>beams</b> and by distortions of the tooling. Earlier studies [Int. J. Mech. Sci. 22 (1980) 583; J. Mater. Process.

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{piezoelectric}} actuator is described whose stator {{is composed of}} two cylindrical steel axes fitted at {{the surface of a}} thin piezoelectric membrane. The slider is a <b>beam</b> <b>pressed</b> in contact with two rotors. Each rotor consists of a cylindrical permanent magnet, pressed in contact with the top surface of each axis, by means of magnetic forces. A travelling wave, at the natural flexural vibration frequency of the thin piezoelectric membrane, is excited via piezoelectric effect. The flexural displacement of the membrane is geometrically amplified by the axes, obtaining a wide precessional motion of the axes. The transmission mechanism of the proposed actuator is based on this motion. The actuator is able to give large displacements with a relatively high linear speed (1. 21 m/s) and force (0. 51 N) by using a commercial piezoelectric membrane (diameter 32 mm, thickness 0. 2 mm), driven at relatively low voltage (± 18 V). The very small thickness of the overall structure makes this actuator suitable for microsystem applications.

40|$|AbstractThe contact {{problem of}} a {{straight}} orthotropic <b>beam</b> <b>pressed</b> onto a rigid circular surface is considered using beam theories that account for transverse shear and transverse normal deformations. The circular nature of the rigid surface emphasizes the difference between Euler Bernoulli theory behavior, where point loads develop {{at the edge of}} contact, and the higher order theories that predict non-singular pressure distributions. While Timoshenko beam theory is the simplest theory that addresses this behavior, the prediction of a maximum value of pressure at the edge of contact contradicts the elasticity theory result that contact pressure must drop to zero. Transverse normal strain is therefore introduced, both to study this fundamental discrepancy and to include an important effect in many contact problems. To investigate this effect, higher order beam theories that account for both constant and linear transverse normal strain through the beam thickness are derived using the principle of virtual work. The resulting orthotropic beam theories depend on the bending stiffness (EI), shear stiffness (GA), axial stiffness (EA 1) and transverse normal stiffness (EA 2), which are independent stiffness parameters that can differ by orders of magnitude. The above mentioned contact problem is then solved analytically for these theories, along with the Timoshenko beam model which assumes zero transverse normal strain. The results for different orthotropic materials show that inclusion of transverse normal deformation has a significant effect on the contact pressure solution. Furthermore, the solution using higher order beam theories encompasses the two extremes of a Hertz-like contact pressure when the half contact length is smaller than the thickness of the beam, and the Timoshenko beam theory case when the half contact length is much larger than the thickness. Concerning the behavior of the pressure at the edge of contact, adherence to the boundary conditions required by the principle of virtual work, shows that while the pressure does tend to zero, it does not become zero unless artificially enforced. In this regard the solution for the case of linear strain is better than that for constant strain. All beam solutions are validated with plane elasticity solutions obtained using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS...|$|R
40|$|The Sugar Industry, the Sugarcane Roller Mill and Sino-Portuguese Relations {{from the}} XVIth to XVIIIth Centuries. Many {{questions}} have been raised with respect to the origins of the rolling mill, type of sugarcane mill which by replacing the ancient technology of the edge runner and the <b>beam</b> <b>presses</b> in the xvnth century helped to speed up the process by which sugar cane is crushed and thus to favor the boom in the world sugar industry. This paper reexamines this question since it has come to light {{in the past few years}} that the promoters of this invention could be, in fact, the Chinese. A detailed comparison between the Chinese mill and the Brazilian mill shows, on the one hand, that the two machines are quite distinct and suggests, on the other hand, that problems with regard to technological innovation cannot be treated without taking into account the specific social context of each society. Thus for example in China, sugar, which has been produced long before it had in Europe, was not valued on the same basis as in Europe. Furthermore in China white sugar was not so much appreciated until the XVIth cen- tury. The evolution of its status seems linked to the pressures of the international market, after China had come into contact with her Asian neighbors via the Portuguese. At the end of the XVIth century, the Chinese sugar provinces of Guangdong and Fujian are going to produce very white sugar specially for exportation and if the clientele is rapidly satisfied it is because the Chinese possess technique for sugar whitening claying which the Portuguese will only introduce into the West later on. Between the xvith and xvnth century the Chinese sugar activity will experience an unprecedented development, but will rapidly lose energy, without resulting in more advanced stage of industrialisation. Traditional networks of production of artisanal and unrefined sugar meanwhile will continue to function. Sabban Françoise.

40|$|The Earth 2 ̆ 7 s upper mantle, mainly {{composed}} of olivine, is seismically anisotropic. Seismic anisotropy attenuation {{has been observed}} at 220 km depth. Karato et al. (1992) attributed this attenuation to a transition between two deformation mechanisms, from dislocation creep above 220 km to diffusion creep below 220 km, induced by a change in water content. Couvy (2005) and Mainprice et al. (2005) predicted a change in Lattice Preferred Orientation induced by pressure, which comes from a change of slip system, from [100] slip to [001] slip, and {{is responsible for the}} seismic anisotropy attenuation. Raterron et al. (2007) ran single crystal deformation experiments under anhydrous conditions and observed that the slip system transition occurs around 8 GPa, which corresponds to a depth of 260 Km. ^ Experiments were done to quantify the effects of water on olivine single crystals deformed using D-DIA <b>press</b> and synchrotron <b>beam.</b> Deformations were carried out in uniaxial compression along [110]c, [011]c, and [101]c, crystallographic directions, at pressure ranging from 4 to 8 GPa and temperature between 1373 and 1473 K. Talc sleeves about the annulus of the single crystals were used as source of water in the assembly. Stress and specimen strain rates were calculated by in-situ X-ray diffraction and time resolved imaging, respectively. ^ By direct comparison of single crystals strain rates, we observed that [110]c deforms faster than [011]c below 5 GPa. However above 6 GPa [011]c deforms faster than [110]c. This revealed that [100](010) is the dominant slip system below 5 GPa, and above 6 GPa [001](010) becomes dominant. According to our results, the slip system transition, which is induced by pressure, occurs at 6 GPa. Water influences the pressure where the switch over occurs, by lowering the transition pressure. The pressure effect on the slip systems activity has been quantified and the hydrolytic weakening has also been estimated for both orientations. Data also shows that temperature affects the slip system activity. The regional variation of the depth for the seismic anisotropy attenuation, which would depend on local hydroxyl content and temperature variations and explains the seismic anisotropy attenuation occurring at about 220 Km depth in the mantle, where the pressure is about 6 GPa. ^ Deformation of MgO single crystal oriented [100], [110] and [111] were also performed. The results predict a change in the slip system activity at 23 GPa, again induced by pressure. This explains the seismic anisotropy observed in the lower mantle. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete early strength ansite {{in the first}} six hours after application using a partial beam test standard, ASTM C 1 16 - 90. Determining the early-strength development of as-sprayed shotcrete can improve mine safety by identifying appropriate reentry times and providing a convenient means of quality control during application. A more thorough understanding of shotcrete early strength will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall accidents. Background: When shotcrete is used as part of a multi component ground support system, {{it is important to know}} when the material has developed enough strength to be self-supporting and allow for reentry and emplacement of the remaining support elements that require drilling of the shotcrete layer without degradation. Typical reported values for this threshold strength for North American mines range from 1 to 1. 6 MPa (145 to 233 psi) [O'Toole and Pope 2006], with a compressive strength equivalent to 1 MPa (145 psi) being the norm [Rispin et al. 2003; O'Toole and Pope 2006]. Typical ground control support includes a shotcrete flash coat 19 - to 25 -mm (3 / 4 - to 1 -in) thick, followed by screen, plates, bolts, and a second layer of shotcrete bringing the combined thickness to 75 to 100 mm (3 to 4 in). In areas requiring rehabilitation, the second layer of shotcrete is plated and bolted as well. While testing cored samples after 24 hours is standard, this is not practical for the one- to six-hour period following application when shotcrete unconfined compressive strengths are less than 10 MPa (1, 450 psi). Indirect methods are typically used to determine shotcrete strength during the early stages of curing because the partially cured or green material is difficult to sample and test. While problems with inconsistent test results have been reported with the penetrometer-type devices, beam molds have been used successfully for creating shotcrete test specimens in the United States and Canada. Operating the Partial Beam Test System: The test unit is a self-contained, servo-controlled, stiff-frame <b>press.</b> Partial <b>beam</b> test samples are obtained by spraying shotcrete into 102 - x 102 - x 152 -mm (4 - x 4 - x 6 -in) mold boxes. After the samples have been sprayed, tests are conducted at one-hour intervals over the next six hours (one- through six-hour tests). The shotcrete samples are carefully demolded by disassembling the mold fixtures and removing the enclosed sample. Next, a shotcrete sample is placed in a specialized testing fixture and centered under the loading head of the test machine. When the test sequence is initiated, a programmable-logic-controller- (PLC) driven press applies a fixed-rate load to the sample. The load profile is shown on a graphical output display, and the measured test parameters (time, displacement, and load) are stored on a thumb drive. Once the operator observes a well-defined peak in the load profile curve, the test is completed and the test machine's loading platen can be returned to its initial starting position. Peak load is typically reflected by the development of large vertically oriented cracks along the platen-to sample contact edges, which are indicative of the failure plane. There is a marked difference in early-strength gain between sprayed and cast shotcrete. The cast shotcrete samples have a similar strength gain profile to that of cast concrete samples.
