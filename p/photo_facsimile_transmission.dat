40|$|Facsimile {{continues}} to be communication bedrock for transmitting sensitive business critical documents with legal standing. Traditional facsimile uses PSTN network for communication. As the mobile technology advances, fixed wireless terminals {{are being used to}} connect landline devices such as telephone, fax machines etc and transmit using the mobile phone networks. Fixed wireless terminals are used in locations where traditional landline infrastructure is unavailable. This paper presents the performance analysis of <b>facsimile</b> <b>transmission</b> using GSM fixed wireless terminal under varying conditions to determine the margins of the network parameters that enable successful communication. The metrics Facsimile Satisfactory Rate parameter was used for the evaluation of the quality of <b>facsimile</b> <b>transmission</b> using GSM fixed wireless terminal. The analysis was carried out under varying traffic conditions to study the effect of congestion on the <b>facsimile</b> <b>transmission</b> using GSM fixed wireless terminal, at varying distances from the base station both in the rural and urban area.
