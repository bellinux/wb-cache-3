50|$|Eric Butcher {{was born}} in Singapore in 1970. He read {{philosophy}} at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating in 1994 and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has exhibited extensively in the UK and internationally with shows in Germany, Italy, Australia and the USA. He currently shows with Toomey Tourell gallery, San Francisco and Galerie Robert Drees in Hannover. He has received awards from the Arts Council, England and the Arts and Humanities Research Council. He has also held an Arts Institute at Bournemouth Research Fellowship (now the AUB) and was the Centre for Arts International Research/Liverpool School of Art & Design Multiple Perspectives Fellow 2007.Butcher’s earliest exhibited works were compositions of oil, resin and spray paint on large, tablet-like MDF supports. The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects - an ‘attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface {{as anything other than}} surface’. This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher’s works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher’s 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, ‘even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical’. Although characterised by their appearance - an abstract ‘accretion of <b>paint,</b> <b>resin</b> and various other fluids’ - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher’s creative process. Butcher has said of his practice that ‘the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials’, a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher’s creative output and his approach to the act of painting, ‘it may just be a flat piece of metal… But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections… the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface’.‘The application or subtraction of paint’ in Butcher’s practice is executed through the use of ‘a metal blade drawn across the painting’s surface’ pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, ‘this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'. The outcome of each painting is determined by ‘variations in colour modulation’ and largely ‘by the physical characteristics of the support’. Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands {{across the surface of the}} metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. Although Butcher has a uniform approach to each work, they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash. Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, ‘the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork’s true substance’. As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures, he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support’s original condition (before his intervention) - both make for an overall representation of that particular structure’s history.|$|E

Sixteen samples of solid and metallic bright and dark red paints taken from different cars were examined. Each sample was measured in the reflectance mode using a light beam falling perpendicular to the top surface of the sample and on a cross-section. In addition to the MSP measurements, the Raman spectra were produced in order to detect the pigment composition of the samples. On the basis of the obtained results it was stated that discrimination of car paints of the same color is conditioned not only by the kind, number, and amount of the pigments, but rather by the morphology of the paint layer, that is, by the size, shape, orientation, and distribution of the pigment grains in a <b>paint</b> <b>resin.</b> A criterion allowing two samples of the same chroma to be distinguished was established...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Phenol {{is one of}} {{priority}} pollutants produced through leather, <b>paint,</b> <b>resin,</b> and pharmaceutical industries and it can contaminate groundwater after entering to the environment. Hence, {{it is necessary to}} use a suitable method for its removal. The aim of this study was synthesize and efficiency evaluation of magnetic nanocomposite of activated carbon powder-zero valent iron/silver (PAC-Feo/Ag) in the removal of phenol from aqueous solution. Material & Methods: Reduction method was used for converting bivalent iron to zero valent iron and co-precipitation method for depositing of iron on activated carbon. For coating silver on nano zero valent iron, rapid mixing at high temperature was used. The adsorbent was characterized using SEM, TEM, and XRD techniques. Then, the impact of pH, contact time, agitation speed, temperature, adsorbent, and initial phenol concentration were evaluated and optimized by one factor at the time method. Reaction kinetics and isotherms were also determined. Results: It was found that PAC-Feo/Ag has cubic and intertwined structure and has a diameter in the range from 40 to 100 nm. The optimum conditions for phenol removal by PAC-Feo/Ag were as pH= 3, 90 min contact time, 200 rpm agitating speed and adsorbent concentration equal to 1 g/l. Isotherm and kinetic equations showed that the experimental data of phenol adsorption onto PAC-Feo/Ag are correlated to the Langmuir (R 2 > 0. 969) and pseudo-second order (R 2 < 0. 965) models, respectively. Conclusion: Under optimum conditions, modified adsorbent by zero valent iron and silver with maximum efficiency of 97 % has quickly and effectively ability in removal of phenol and it can be easily separated from the solution sample by magnet because of its magnetic properties...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, nanocoatings with {{exceptionally}} {{improved and}} new performance properties have found numerous {{applications in the}} automotive, aerospace, ship-making, chemical, electronics, steel, construction, and many other industries. Especially the formulations providing multiple functionalities to cured paint films are believed to dominate the coatings market in the near future. It has shifted the focus of research towards building sustainable coating recipes which can deliver multiple functionalities through applied films. The challenge to this exciting area of research arrives from the insufficient knowledge about structure-property correlations of nanocoating materials and their design complexity. Experimental efforts {{have been successful in}} developing certain types of nanopaints exhibiting improved properties. However, multifunctional nanopaint design optimality is extremely difficult to address if not impossible solely through experiments. In addition to this, the environmental implications and societal risks associated with this growing field of nanotechnology raise several questions related to its sustainable development. This research focuses on the study of a multiscale sustainable nanocoating design which can have the application from novel function envisioning and idea refinement point of view, to knowledge discovery and design solution derivation, and further to performance testing in industrial applications. The nanocoating design is studied using computational simulations of nano- to macro- scale models and sustainability assessment study over the life-cycle. Computational simulations aim at integrating top-down, goals/means, inductive systems engineering and bottom-up, cause and effect, deductive systems engineering approaches for material development. The in-silico <b>paint</b> <b>resin</b> system is a water-dispersible acrylic polymer with hydrophilic nanoparticles incorporated into it. The nano-scale atomistic and micro-scale coarse-grained (CG) level simulations are performed using molecular dynamics methodology to study several structural and morphological features such as effect of polymer molecular weight, polydispersity, rheology, nanoparticle volume fraction, size, shape and chemical nature on the bulk mechanical and self-cleaning properties of the coating film. At macro-scale, a paint spray system which is used for automotive coating application is studied by using CFD-based simulation methodology to generate crucial information about the effects of nanocoating technology on environmental emissions and coating film quality. The cradle-to-grave life-cycle based sustainability assessment study address all the critical issues related to economic benefits, environmental implications and societal effects of nanocoating technology through case studies of automotive coating systems. It is accomplished by identifying crucial correlations among measurable parameters at different stages and developing sustainability indicator matrices for analysis of each stage of life-cycle. The findings from the research can have great potential to draft useful conclusions in favor of future development of coating systems with novel functionalities and improved sustainability...|$|E
