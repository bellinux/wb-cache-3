40|$|A new Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is {{currently}} under {{development for the}} sPHENIX experiment at RHIC. The TPC will be read out using multistage GEM detectors on each end and will be divided into approximately 40 pad layers in radius. Each <b>pad</b> <b>layer</b> is required to provide a spatial resolution of ~ 250 microns, which must be achieved with a minimal channel count {{in order to minimize}} the overall cost of the detector. The current proposal is to make the pads into a zigzag shape in order to enhance charge sharing among neighboring pads. This will allow for the possibility to interpolate the hit position to high precision, resulting in a position resolution many times better than the 2 mm pitch of the readout pads. This paper discusses various simulation studies that were carried out to optimize {{the size and shape of}} the zigzag pads for the readout board for the TPC, along with the technical challenges in fabricating it.

Examples of these applications are machines for electrical power generation, oil extraction and for auxiliary devices. Oil-film tilting pad thrust bearings are generally used for supporting the high axial load of the turbine shaft in vertical hydroelectric units or the axial loads in turbo machines. In these applications, the pad coating material plays an important role. Usually the white metaln(Babbitt) is used as pad coating material. However, the present trend is to replace the Babbitt with a polymeric material layer such as PTFE or PEEK, improving the bearing performances and extending its operating conditions.

40|$|Next-generation {{high-temperature}} thermoelectric-power-generating devices {{will employ}} segmented architectures {{and will have}} to reliably withstand thermally induced mechanical stresses produced during component fabrication, device assembly, and operation. Thermoelectric materials have typically poor mechanical strength, exhibit brittle behavior, and possess a wide range of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) values. As a result, the direct bonding at elevated temperatures of these materials to each other to produce segmented leg components is difficult, and often results in localized microcracking at interfaces and mec hanical failure due to the stresses that arise from the CTE mismatch between the various materials. Even in the absence of full mechanical failure, degraded interfaces can lead to increased electrical and thermal resistances, which adversely impact conversion efficiency and power output. The proposed solution is the insertion of a mechanically compliant layer, with high electrical and thermal conductivity, between the low- and high-temperature segments to relieve thermomechanical stresses during device fabrication and operation. This composite material {{can be used as a}} stress-relieving layer between the thermoelectric segments and/or between a thermoelectric segment and a hot- or cold-side interconnect material. The material also can be used as a compliant hot shoe. Nickel-coated graphite powders were hot-pressed to form a nickel-graphite composite material. A freestanding thermoelectric segmented leg was fabricated by brazing the compliant <b>pad</b> <b>layer</b> between the high-temperature p- Zintl and low-temperature p-SKD TE segments using Cu-Ag braze foils. The segmented leg stack was heated in vacuum under a compressive load to achieve bonding. The novelty of the innovation is the use of composite material that re duces the thermomechanical stresses en - countered in the construction of high-efficiency, high-temperature therm - o-electric devices. The compliant pad enables the bonding of dissimilar thermoelectric materials while maintaining the desired electrical and thermal properties essential for efficient device operation. The modulus, CTE, electrical, and thermal conductances of the composite can be controlled by varying the ratio of nickel to graphite...|$|E
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} packaging (3 DP) {{is emerging}} as the solution for microelectronics development toward system in package (SIP). 3 D die stacking either with flip chip bonding or with wire bonding {{has a very good}} potential for the implementation of 3 D packaging. With the new interconnection materials Cu introduced in this advanced packaging, special attention should be paid to Cu-to-Si diffusion due to the fast diffusion of Cu in Si and impact of Cu on the silicon devices. In this study, the Cu-to-Si diffusion in through silicon vias (TSVs) and in wire bonding are investigated. The interlayers for TSVs with sidewall multilayer and for wire bonding with bonding pad layers are characterized. Firstly secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling is implemented for the Cu-to-Si diffusion analysis. The standard Cu/Si samples are prepared for SIMS depth profile verification. Compared with the finite element model (FEM) analysis results, the Cu diffusivity determined by SIMS analysis is in good agreement with FEM analysis. For the flip chip bonding, through silicon vias (TSVs) are adopted as vertical interconnection within the silicon die. The TSVs formation method, namely, deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), is evaluated. The experimental results and comparisons in terms of via uniformity, aspect ratio dependent etching, undercutting, and effects of various mask materials are discussed in detail for sub-micron silicon via. To prevent Cu diffusion, improve the Cu adhesion and provide electrical insulation, the interfacial multilayer is deposited on the TSVs sidewall. Regarding Cu-to-Si diffusion, the effects of Si surface roughness, insulation layer, barrier layer and the Cu source supply are investigated. The phase transition during thermal annealing is studied. Experimental results show that the SiO 2 layer not only serves for electrical insulation, but also helps to maintain the integrity of the Ti barrier layer and to prevent further diffusion of Cu into the silicon. From a surface roughness comparative study, the experimental results show that a rougher silicon surface may promote Cu diffusion depth and subsequently will impose a higher threat on the IC devices. Therefore, a smooth surface is preferred for the deposition of interfacial multilayers on the sidewall of TSVs. The Ti barrier layer in the interfacial multilayer structure on a smooth silicon substrate can effectively prevent Cu diffusion at an annealing temperature lower than 300 ℃. However, when the annealing temperature is raised to 300 ℃ or above, the barrier layer tends to breakdown and the Cu element will surpass the Ti layer. It is also identified that the Cu layer thickness may affect the Cu diffusion depth. In general, a thicker Cu layer will promote the Cu diffusion depth. This effect reveals that the Cu diffusion in TSVs for 3 D packaging should be different from that in the Cu damascene structure for on-chip interconnection. Furthermore, from X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results, Cu 3 Si is found when the barrier layer fails for the Cu/Ti/Si structure. Sheet resistance measurement and surface roughness measurement indicate the growth of the copper grains during thermal annealing and also the strong reaction and diffusion in the interfacial multilayer at high annealing temperatures. To effectively control the copper diffusion in TSVs, the thickness of different layers in the interfacial multilayer structure should be optimized. The influential rank of different layers is studied by design of experiment (DOE). The results indicate that Si roughness is the first important impact factor. Therefore, a smaller Si roughness is preferred. Because the Si roughness is smaller for smaller TSVs by DRIE, the TSVs size should be balanced between the Cu diffusion and TSVs fabrication feasibility. Secondly, SiO 2 is more important than TaN within their factor levels. Due to the low cost of SiO 2, a thick SiO 2 layer should be adopted rather than a thick TaN layer. Furthermore, thicker Cu film thickness will improve Cu diffusion depth and impose more threats to silicon devices. For Cu-to-Si diffusion in wire bonding, the effects of a TiW barrier layer, A 1 pad deformation, Cu source supply and different bonding wire materials are studied. Experimental results indicate that aluminum pad deformation will induce more Cu-to-Si diffusion and the amount of Cu supply may promote the diffusion of Cu into Si. With the addition of the TiW barrier layer, Cu and Au diffusion into Si have been decreased. Comparison between Cu and Au bonded samples shows that Cu diffuses more in Si than Au, which may impose more threat to silicon devices. With the optimization of the Cu bonding process and appropriate selection of <b>pad</b> <b>layer</b> structure, devices with Cu wire bonding should have a better performance and reliability than Au wire bonding...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{three studies}} investigating biomechanical responses {{to changes in}} shoe-surface combinations in soccer. In the first study, six male participants (21. 7 [S. D. 2. 2] yrs, 74. 0 [S. D. 6. 9] kg [March], 74. 6 [S. D. 6. 9] kg (May), footwear size 10 - 11) performed running and turning movements on natural and third generation artificial surfaces whilst wearing different soccer specific footwear. This was performed at two {{times of the year}} where contrasting weather conditions were experienced. It was observed that there were significant differences when the natural and third generation artificial turf surfaces were compared. These differences however, were dependent on the type of movement, time of year and biomechanical measurement used. Each surface was also compared between the two test occasions. The main finding was that for both running and turning peak pressures and peak pressure loading rates were significantly greater in May (when the surfaces were mechanically hard) compared with the same surface in March. It was concluded that comparisons of third generation surfaces with natural turf are dependent on the specific properties of the surfaces and cannot be generalized for all such surfaces. A critical design feature of third generation surfaces that will influence biomechanical comparisons with other playing surfaces is the shock <b>pad</b> <b>layer.</b> In the second experimental chapter, ten male participants (20. 9 yrs [S. D. 2. 5], 83. 2 kg [S. D. 7. 1], footwear size 10 - 11) were used to assess the effect of two different shock pad densities (55 g and 65 g) (Arpro® Expanded polypropylene BF 2455 W, 24 mm S. D. 0. 5 mm thick, Brock International) on the lower extremity loading. These participants were also used to assess the biomechanical adaptations that occur with the inclusion of a 10 mm Sorbothane® heel insert or a Sorbothane® cushioning insole (Sorbo products division, Lancashire, UK), which have been associated with reducing overuse injury including that to the Achilles tendon. The footwear was also assessed for the risk of sustaining lateral ankle ligament damage. It was shown that whilst turning, peak impact force (taken using in-shoe pressure system) was significantly lower on the more cushioned shock pad as was peak pressure at the first metatarsal. Likewise, the time to peak impact force was significantly longer with the heel insert. However, despite the association between the heel insert and reduced dorsi-flexion, no significant differences were observed for this measurement between the footwear conditions. Peak plantar flexion was significantly greater with the heel insert whilst turning suggesting an increased loading of the lateral ankle ligaments, although rearfoot inversion was not significantly different. This study demonstrated the potential role of shock pad cushioning in providing protection from impact related injury in soccer, whilst cushioning inserts were not found to provide a protective effect. For heel inserts, the possibility of a negative influence on rearfoot stability was highlighted. It was suggested that the estimation of internal loads may reveal more regarding the specific role of cushioning interfaces and heel inserts in protecting from injury. In the final research chapter, nine male soccer players (83. 4 kg [S. D. 5. 8], 23 yrs [S. D. 3. 7]) performed running and turning movements for the same conditions described in study two. The peak plantar flexion moment, Achilles tendon force and average loading rate of these measurements, were used to assess Achilles tendon loading. Likewise, peak dorsi-flexion and eversion moments were collected to assess the lateral ankle loading. Group analysis did not reveal any significant differences in these variables. Individual data showed that the response to heel insert intervention was specific to the participant. Some participants exhibited a reduced Achilles tendon force or average loading rate, suggesting a reduced risk of injury with the heel insert. However, it was observed that eversion and dorsi-flexion moment and average loading rates increased in some participants, suggesting that these participants were at an increased risk of lateral ankle ligament injury with the heel insert. Likewise, one participant experienced significantly greater peak Achilles tendon force, also indicating a greater risk of injury to this structure. The overall conclusions gained from these studies are that the design of the footwear and playing surfaces are worth considering in the quest to reduce injury risk. It was also highlighted that the choice of shock pad density for a third generation artificial surface can be influential in the protection of the athlete even when the surface is new, particularly when turning. Finally, although the use of heel inserts has proven successful in the reduction the Achilles tendon injury, the lack of significant differences for group comparisons suggests that the mechanisms behind the success is still unclear. However, although heel inserts may prove useful in the reduction of Achilles tendon injury, the observation that significant increases in the measurements associated with acute ankle ligament damage and chronic Achilles tendon injury, suggests that heel lift may not be suitable for some individuals.

40|$|International audienceCompression {{bandages}} are {{a common}} treatment for some lymphatics or venous pathologies. The treatment success directly depends on the pressure which is applied on the external surface of the leg and which is then transmitted to the internal tissues. This interface pressure (between the limb and the bandage) depends mainly on the following parameters:- the bandage components (<b>padding</b> <b>layers,</b> …) - their mechanical properties- the bandage stretch- the application technique (spiral, …) and number of layers (overlap) - patient’s leg morphology- other parameters such as friction between the different bandage layers. Though the efficacy of this treatment is admitted [1], its action mechanism and the pressure it applies on the leg remain poorly understood [2]. For now, the reference method for the computation of interface pressure applied by compression bandage is Laplace’s Law:P = n T / r (1) with P the local pressure, n the number of layers of the bandage, T the bandage tension (i. e. force to stretch the bandage), r the local radius of curvature of the limb. However, this law, which only considers the non-deformed state of the limb, is unable to accurately predict interface pressures [3].

40|$|International audienceElastic {{compression}} bandage is {{a common}} treatment for venous or lymphatic disorders. Even though the efficacy of this treatment is admitted, its mechanism remains poorly understood. The success of the treatment depends on the applied pressure, which depends on the bandage tension and the curvature of the limb (Laplace’s Law), the number of layers of the bandage, its components (<b>padding</b> <b>layer,</b> crepe …) and elastic properties, and the interactions between bandages and leg. To better understand the action of compression bandage, many interface pressure measurements have been done, but those measurements only give local information and for now, the whole pressure distribution on the leg is not known. Also, due to complex leg curvature and to bandage-leg and bandage-bandage interactions, the Laplace’s law {{is not sufficient to}} give a fine description of the pressure fields. Some simulations of the leg compression exist. Most of them are modeling the action of a compression sock on a leg [1][2], whose mechanical properties are more or less complex [3]. As far as we know, the simulation of bandage application on the leg has never been done yet.

In addition, the gas was capable of penetrating the mesh surface layer and killing bacteria in the underlying foam <b>pad</b> <b>layers.</b> Here, 7 × 10 3 to 4. 5 × 10 3 laboratory applied S. aureus colonies were recovered from underlying layers before treatment and 0 colonies were present after treatment. Both naturally occurring bacteria and S. aureus were susceptible to the treatment process. Conclusion Results of this study have shown that chlorine dioxide can easily and safely be used to eliminate bacteria contamination of protective pads used by football players. This could serve to reduce exposure to potential pathogens such as the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among this group of individuals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aim. This paper {{reports a}} study to compare the {{differences}} in compression produced on a limb using a spiral and a figure-of-eight bandaging technique. Background. Chronic leg ulcers are a major health problem in Western countries. Compression bandaging is the accepted treatment for venous leg ulcers. The spiral and the figure-of-eight techniques are traditional methods of applying compression bandages. but their performance in terms of pressure profiles is unknown. Despite a lack of evidence about technique, class- 3 c compression bandages are not currently recommended for application in a figure-of-eight as this is thought to produce dangerously high pressure. Methods. A cross-over experimental design was used {{with a sample of}} 26 nurse bandagers. Consistency of performance was tested. Bandage stretch and overlap were measured and analysed by standard deviation to ensure that the techniques were consistent and repeatable. Pressure probes were then applied to the medial, posterior and lateral aspects of the lower limb of a healthy volunteer. The class- 3 c compression bandage was applied using both techniques and the pressure profiles around the leg were measured under the bandage. The results of each technique were compared using independent sample t-tests. The data were collected in 1999. Results. The figure-of-eight technique provided statistically significantly higher compression at lower areas of the leg than the spiral technique. Mean pressure difference was 20 · 3 mmHg at the ankle, 22 · 2 mmHg at the gaiter, 9 · 4 mmHg at the calf. The pressure differences decrease towards the knee with both techniques and decrease more steeply with the figure-of-eight technique. Conclusion. The spiral technique was a safe and comfortable method of bandage application. The figure-of-eight also provided graduated compression but with some high areas of pressure, notably overlying the Achilles tendon. However, before firm practice recommendations are made, replication of the study using a <b>padding</b> <b>layer</b> and a larger sample is needed...|$|R
5000|$|Some [...] {{report that}} IFD {{is a poor}} way to measure {{softness}} of memory foam, and that foam density {{as a measure of}} quality is more important, but not always true. Foam density of 5 pounds per cubic foot (80 kg/m3) or greater is considered high quality, although most standard memory foam has a density of 1 to 5 lb/ft3 (16-80 kg/m3). Most bedding, such as topper <b>pads</b> and comfort <b>layers</b> in mattresses is 3 to 4.5 lb/ft3. Very high densities such as 5.3 lb/ft3 (85 kg/m3) are used infrequently in mattresses.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the effectiveness of}} a new character embedding designed for training CNNs and explores how neural network design may be impacted by its adoption. To the best of our knowledge, text classification using character-level representations and deep neural networks has been previously investigated by only one research group [1], and we are the first to propose a more compact character embedding and to investigate its implications on neural network design. We show that our character embedding greatly reduces computational costs and training time, and improves classification performance. Additionally, we also show that using <b>padded</b> convolutional <b>layers</b> allows our embedding to be used with networks of arbitrary depth and the use of padding does not negate the benefits of our character embedding. Thus, our proposed character embedding can be adapted to any big data domain where high-level understanding of text is required, such as sentiment analysis, webpage ontology and topic classification.|$|R
40|$|Most of robotic soft pads studied so far {{were made}} with {{a thick layer of}} {{homogeneous}} material shaped around a rigid core; their behavior has been widely investigated in the literature, mainly under compressive contact load, showing typical non-linear relationship between contact deformation and applied load (the so called power law). This paper proposes differentiated layer design, that is the adoption of a single elastic material, dividing the overall thickness of the <b>pad</b> into <b>layers</b> with different structural design (e. g. a continuous skin layer coupled with an internal layer with voids). The purpose is to modify the actual pad compliance and the resulting power law; in particular, given the material and the allowable pad thickness, to increase the compliance with respect to a non structured pad. Some possible internal layer structures are described, compatible with rapid prototyping manufacturing. Their compressive behaviors are tested and comparatively evaluated showing that the concept can work and be exploited for useful application...|$|R
