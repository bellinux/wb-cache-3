Although many information gaps remain, the emerging picture clearly shows the significant role of both injected cocaine and crack cocaine in the Brazilian epidemic, and the increasingly large role of injecting cocaine in the Southern Cone. The Caribbean and the Ande an regions are thus far spared from extensive diffusion of injecting drugs and its consequences. However, the se regions are now experiencing a significant transition, in terms of an increasing role of crack cocaine in the Caribbean HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the recent introduction of he roin and initiation of drug injection in the Ande an region.

40|$|Pothole {{formation}} and development {{may be influenced}} by joint sets and other heterogeneities within bedrock, as well as by hydraulics. Previous research indicates that most potholes found in rivers of the mountainous Spanish Central System exhibit preferred orientations associated with dominant joints and correlate more strongly with variations in substrate resistance than with hydraulics. Weathering and erosion weaken rock surfaces, which leads to decreased mechanical resistance. We start from the hypothesis that different mechanisms of pothole formation may create around the pothole a distinctive signature in terms of ultrasound pulse velocity and surface hardness. We develop a conceptual model and test it using potholes for which we know the mechanism of formation, demonstrating that the spatial and statistical distributions of dynamical mechanical properties and surface hardness of a pothole may provide insight into its genesis.

40|$|The {{appearance}} and main decay {{forms in the}} fair-faced brick façades on the University Campus of Madrid's Faculty of Medicine were taken {{as a starting point}} to analyse certain building's construction characteristics and the clay and technology used in brick manufacture. The raw materials consisted in a mix of Miocene marl and red Triassic clays from the Spanish province of Jaén. The exposed face of bricks was characterised by a yellowish tone and smooth, uniform texture that afforded perfect dimensioning and inter-brick alignment. In some bricks this texture was lost, with a concomitant colour change, surface roughness increase and loss of material. Laboratory studies through polarised optical microscope (POM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FESEM-EDS) revealed similar composition in all the bricks, firing temperatures ranging between 800 and 850 °C and, {{with the exception of the}} exposed surface, not particularly careful manufacture.

Hydrogen evolution rate in PEO-coated specimens was 35 times lower compared to the non-coated alloy during first 2 weeks of immersion (0. 04 – 0. 07  mL cm d) and reached a steady-state rate of 0. 3  mL cm d by week 6 of immersion. Studies of the tribocorrosion behaviour of the PEO-coated alloy disclosed that the coatings rapidly lose their tribocorrosion resistance due to hydration of the coating material and associated drastic decrease of microhardness but exhibit a better tirbocorrosion performance than the non-coated material.

With this experiment, it was possible to assess the effect of this bioproduct when interacting with the existing lithobiontic microbial community at the most real conditions. The application of the bioproduct was performed by directly spraying onto the rock surface of the quarry front with abundant lichen colonization during 8 weeks (one application per week). After the application, the structure of Verrucaria nigrescens lichen thalli and the ultrastructure of their algal and fungal cells components resulted to be affected. The upper cortex of the lichen thalli was particularly affected, with damage-like fungal cells, and even in some cases, disappeared, leaving unprotected and exposed algal cells to environmental conditions.

40|$|Fission yeast Ste 9 /Srw 1 is {{a family}} member of the Fizzy-related APC {{activators}} that promote the ubiquitination and degradation of mitotic cyclins and other substrates {{at the end of}} mitosis and G 1. These proteins are highly regulated during the cell cycle at the level of gene transcription and protein phosphorylation in order to guarantee the correct order of events during the cell cycle. Here we propose mRNA decay as a novel mechanism that regulates ste 9 + gene expression during the cell cycle. We have characterized the elements in the 3 ′UTR of the ste 9 mRNA responsible for this mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrate that the instability of ste 9 mRNA is important for downregulating Ste 9 levels in G 2, allowing appropriate cyclin B accumulation to promote timely entry into mitosis. © 2006 Landes Bioscience.

40|$|Many {{students}} are distanced from {{the realities of}} correctional facilities and never consider doing practical community engagement <b>programme</b> <b>s</b> in a correctional centre. Students of criminology usually deem practical community engagement work in corrections as a high-risk unnecessary endeavour. The authors explore how students’ sense of civic responsibility changes over time when they are tutored to do community engagement in correctional facilities. The perceptions of students were gauged before embarking on a community engagement project in a correctional facility and were then requested to write a phenomenological report about their experience {{after the completion of}} the seven-week project. Many students transformed dramatically and their perceptions changed significantly. In addition, this contribution also focuses on the position of tertiary institutions in community engagement. Although many consider corrections dangerous areas for community engagement, tertiary institutions {{have no choice but to}} engage in this frequently forgotten population. The White Paper for Post-School Education and Training (Department of Higher Education and Training, 2013) contextualises a range of issues and highlights compulsory curricular activities in disadvantaged often forgotten communities. The authors believe that tertiary institutions and especially student projects in corrections will improve the practical value of criminology as a discipline and contribute more to the restorative ethos that features strongly in the South African Criminal Justice machinery.

Orangutans produce alarm calls called kiss-squeaks, which they sometimes modify by putting a hand in front of their mouth. Through theoretical models and observational evidence, we show that using the hand when making a kiss-squeak alters the acoustics of the production {{in such a way that}} more formants per kilohertz are produced. Our theoretical models suggest that cylindrical wave propagation is created with the use of the hand and face as they act as a cylindrical extension of the lips. The use of cylindrical wave propagation in animal calls appears to be extremely rare, but is an effective way to lengthen the acoustic system; it causes the number of resonances per kilohertz to increase. This increase is associated with larger animals, and thus using the hand in kiss-squeak production may be effective in exaggerating the size of the producer. Using the hand appears to be a culturally learned behavior, and therefore orangutans may be able to associate the acoustic effect of using the hand with potentially more effective deterrence of predators.

40|$|Paper {{aging and}} {{protection}} are of crucial interest {{for improving the}} preservations of library collections and archives. Highly aging-resistant cellulose fiber sheets were obtained by treatment with magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles (Mg(OH) 2). The procedure was tested on the sheets made of bleached (B) and refined unbleached (UB) pine cellulose fibers {{as well as their}} 50 %/ 50 % mixture (M). The morphological and structural properties of the obtained sheets were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) methods. Stress-strain, smoothness and pH measurements were employed to determine the changes in physical-chemical characteristics of the sheets after mixing two types of the fibers and subsequent treatment with Mg(OH) 2. It has been shown that the sheets made of the fiber mixture show higher tensile index and smoothness. The modification with Mg(OH) 2 nanoparticles induces an increase in the pH of the sheets to slightly basic values (around pH 8), facilitates the inter-fiber bonding and additionally enhances the smoothness of the sheets. Finally, by exposing the sheets to the thermo-hygrometric accelerated artificial ageing, {{it was found that the}} physical properties of the treated sheets were not significantly dependent on the environmental factors.

40|$|The Old Bridge Elche’s showed {{abundant}} efflorescence {{and salt}} crusts that were eliminated in an intervention in 2005. We {{have followed the}} development of efflorescence after the intervention. And nine years later the efflorescence mineralogy was quite similar to the mineralogy of the pre-restoration efflorescence. The efflorescence on Elche’s Old Bridge (Puente Viejo) shows a wide mineralogical variation in the vertical profile, {{which is the result}} of a balance between two diffusive processes: the evaporation–condensation of atmospheric water vapor on/inside the wall, and the capillary flow of saline groundwater. Diurnal variations in atmospheric relative humidity (RH) and the low deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) values of some saline minerals (nitrate & chloride) play an important role in the vertical distribution of minerals. The mineral composition of efflorescence and saline crusts prior to cleaning the monument was similar to that identified nine years later. The chemical composition of groundwater, with a high sodium chloride component and much lower concentrations of sulfate and bicarbonate, explained the presence of halite, while the presence of demolition waste of a gypsiferous nature near the bridge explained the presence of sulfate salts, thenardite, konyaite, aphthitalite, and arcanite. The dissolution of airborne particles in condensation water probably contributed to the genesis of nitrate-rich minerals such as nitratine, darapskite, and especially humberstonite.

40|$|The E 3 -ubiquitin ligase APC/C-Cdh 1 is {{essential}} for endoreduplication but its relevance in the mammalian mitotic cell cycle is still unclear. Here we show that genetic ablation of Cdh 1 in the developing nervous system results in hypoplastic brain and hydrocephalus. These defects correlate with enhanced levels of Cdh 1 substrates and increased entry into the S phase in neural progenitors. However, cell division is prevented {{in the absence of}} Cdh 1 due to hyperactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases, replicative stress, induction of p 53, G 2 arrest and apoptotic death of these progenitor cells. Concomitant ablation of p 53 rescues apoptosis but not replicative stress, resulting in the presence of damaged neurons throughout the adult brain. These data indicate that the inactivation of Cdh 1 in vivo results in replicative stress, cell cycle arrest and cell death, supporting recent therapeutic proposals aimed to inhibit the APC/C in tumours.
