Presented in this paper is a new mechanism for the generation of high energy ions and a comparison with measured ion spectra. The source of high energy ions has been a puzzle because they not only have energies in excess of measured steady state potentials, but as reported by Goebel et. al. [1], their flux is independent of the amplitude of time dependent plasma fluctuations. The mechanism relies on the charge exchange neutralization of xenon ions accelerated radially into the <b>potential</b> <b>trough</b> {{in front of the}} discharge cathode.

Graphite, copper, and tungsten were selected as test materials. The filter was a bent copper coil biased via the voltage drop across a low-ohm, ''self-bias'' resistor. Ion transport is accomplished via a guiding electric field, whose potential forms a ''trough'' {{shaped by the}} magnetic guiding field of the filter coil. Evaluation was done by measuring the filtered ion current and determination of the particle system coefficient, which {{can be defined as}} the ratio of filter ion current, divided by the mean ion charge state, to the arc current.

40|$|Carbon {{sequestration}} and {{greenhouse gas}} fluxes in grassland. A review. Grassland carbon (C) sequestration {{can play an}} important role in mitigating total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of livestock production systems. An accurate inventory of livestock production system contribution to GHG emissions requires to think in terms of global budget, by considering both the GHG sources and the mitigation <b>potential</b> <b>trough</b> grassland soil carbon sequestration. There is a huge variability in C and GHG balances of grasslands that is mainly due to management practices and climatic conditions. The present article shows that, to reduce the uncertainties of the results, long term measurements at the field scale are necessary. Also, it shows the importance of taking into account the fluxes of the three main GHGs (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane) into account when calculating the GHG budget. This article also highlights the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms driving the fluxes, in relation to environmental factors and management practices, in order to propose mitigation strategies able to enhance soil carbon sequestration in soils and to reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIndustrially sourced dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) {{contaminated}} an alluvial aquifer in France decades ago. The location(s) {{and nature}} of the pollution source zone(s) were unknown, and the dissolved concentrations of volatile organic compounds in the monitoring wells varied greatly with time. The aquifer was in hydraulic equilibrium with an artificial canal whose water level was highly variable (up to 5 m). These variations propagated into the aquifer, causing changes in the groundwater flow direction; a transient numerical model of flow and solute transport showed that they correlate with the concentration variations because the changes in the flow direction resulted in the contaminant plume shifting. The transient hydrogeological numerical model was built, taking into account solvent biodegradation with first-order chain, since biodegradation has a significant influence on the pollutant concentration evolution. The model parameterization confirms the position of the source zones among the <b>potential</b> <b>troughs</b> in the bedrock where DNAPLs could have accumulated.

40|$|Curved {{magnetic}} {{filters are}} often used {{for the removal of}} macroparticles from cathodic arc plasmas. This study addresses the need to further reduce losses and improving plasma throughput. The central figure of merit is the system coefficient Kappa defined as filtered ion current normalized by the plasma-producing arc current. The coefficient Kappa is investigated as a function of DC and pulsed magnetic field operation, magnetic field strength, external electric bias, and arc amplitude. It increases with positive filter bias but saturates at about 15 V for relatively low magnetic field ({approx} 10 mT), whereas stronger magnetic fields lead to higher Kappa with saturation at about 25 V. Further increase of positive bias reduces Kappa. These findings are true for both pulsed and DC filters. Bias of pulsed filters has been realized using the voltage drop across a self-bias resistor, eliminating the need for a separate bias circuit. Almost 100 A of filtered copper ions have been obtained in pulse d mode, corresponding to Kappa approximately equal to 0. 04. The results are interpreted by a simplified <b>potential</b> <b>trough</b> model...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{mechanism}} of cluster formation in hierarchically collapsing molecular clouds. Recent evidence, both observational and numerical, suggests that molecular clouds (MCs) may be undergoing global, hierarchical gravitational collapse. The "hierarchical" regime consists of small-scale collapses within larger-scale ones. The latter implies that the star formation rate increases systematically {{during the early stages}} of evolution, and occurs via filamentary flows onto "hubs" of higher density, mass, and velocity dispersion, and culminates a few Myr after than the small-scale collapses have started to form stars. In turn, the small-scale collapses occur in clumps embedded in the filaments, and are themselves falling into the larger potential well of the still-ongoing large-scale collapse. The stars formed in the early, small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent clumps towards the larger <b>potential</b> <b>trough,</b> so that the filaments feed both gaseous and stellar material to the hubs. This leads to the presence of older stars in a region where new protostars are still forming, to a scale-free or fractal structure of the clusters, in which each unit is composed of smaller-scale ones, and to the eventual merging of the subunits, explaining the observed structural features of open clusters.

40|$|The {{ratio of}} {{effective}} drag coefficient to bubble diameter is {{of critical importance}} for CFD simulation of gas-liquid flow in bubble columns. In this study, a novel model is proposed to calculate the ratio {{on the basis of}} the Dual-Bubble-Size (DBS) model. The motivation of the study is that a stability condition reflecting the compromise between different dominant mechanisms can serve for a closure in addition to mass and momentum conservative constraints, and the interphase momentum transfer should be related to different paths of energy dissipation. With the DBS model, we can first offer a physical interpretation on macro-scale regime transition via the shift of global minimum point of micro-scale energy dissipation from one <b>potential</b> <b>trough</b> to the other. Then the proposed drag model is integrated into a CFD simulation. Prior to this integration, we investigate the respective effects of bubble diameter and correction factor and found that the effect of bubble diameter is limited, whereas the correction factor due to the bubble swarm effect is eminent and appropriate correction factor has to be selected for different correlations of standard drag efficient to be in accord with experiments. By contrast, the DBS drag model can well predict the radial gas holdup distribution, the total gas holdup as well as the two-phase flow field without the need to adjust model parameters, showing its great potential and advantage in understanding the complex nature of multi-scale structure of gas-liquid flow in bubble columns.

40|$|We {{investigate}} two-dimensional (2 d) melting in {{the presence}} of a one-dimensional (1 d) periodic potential as, for example, realized in recent experiments on 2 d colloids subjected to two interfering laser beams. The topology of the phase diagram is found to depend primarily on two factors: the relative orientation of the 2 d crystal and the periodic <b>potential</b> <b>troughs,</b> which select a set of Bragg planes running parallel to the troughs, and the commensurability ratio p= a'/d of the spacing a' between these Bragg planes to the period d of the periodic potential. The complexity of the phase diagram increases with the magnitude of the commensurabilty ratio p. Rich phase diagram, with ``modulated liquid'', ``floating'' and ``locked floating'' solid and smectic phases are found. Phase transitions between these phases fall into two broad universality classes, roughening and melting, driven by the proliferation of discommensuration walls and dislocations, respectively. We discuss correlation functions and the static structure factor in these phases and make detailed predictions of the universal features close to the phase boundaries. We predict that for charged systems with highly screened short-range interactions these melting transitions are generically reentrant as a function of the strength of the periodic potential, prediction that is in accord with recent 2 d colloid experiments. Implications of our results for future experiments are also discussed. Comment: 37 pages, 24 figure...|$|R

This system can be implemented in self-attractive Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), {{as well as in}} a nonlinear bulk optical waveguide. We demonstrate that the introduction of the transverse link changes the character of the symmetry-breaking bifurcation (SBB) in the system from subcritical to supercritical (in terms of the corresponding phase transition, it is a change {{between the first and second}} kinds). A noteworthy feature of the SBB in this setting is a non-monotonous dependence of the soliton's norm at the bifurcation point on the strength of the transverse link. In the full 2 D system, the results are obtained in a numerical form. An exact analytical solution is found for the bifurcation in the 1 D version of the model, with the transverse rung modeled by the local linear coupling between the parallel troughs with the Delta-functional longitudinal profile. Replacing the Delta-function by its finite-width Gaussian counterpart, similar results are obtained by means of the variational approximation (VA). The VA is also applied to the 1 D system with a mixed linear and nonlinear transverse localized coupling. Comparison of the results produced by the different varieties of the system clearly reveals basic features of the symmetry-breaking transition in it.

30|$|The ponderomotive {{influence}} of ion cyclotron waves on the field-aligned distribution and motion of ions in the equatorial {{zone of the}} magnetosphere is examined. The hydrodynamic, quasi-hydrodynamic and “test-particle” approaches are used {{for the study of}} ponderomotive wave-particle interaction. Particular attention has been given to the challenging questions encountered in applying the general theory to the magnetospheric physics. The closed system of quasi-linear equations describing the ponderomotive effects is derived. Analytical investigation of the basic equations has demonstrated the diverse manifestations of the ponderomotive impact of ion cyclotron waves on the ion population in the magnetosphere. It is found that the redistribution of ion density under the action of ponderomotive force with increase in the wave amplitude follows the pattern of phase transition of the second kind. The density distribution changes qualitatively as the point in plane of the governing parameters of system crosses a demarcation line. It has been found that the magnetic equator is an attractor for heavy ion. The period of the finite (oscillatory) motion of a heavy ion, which is trapped in the <b>potential</b> <b>trough</b> in the vicinity of magnetic equator, depends on the wave frequency, wave amplitude, together with the energy of motion. In addition, the diffusion equilibrium of ions in a multicomponent plasma is considered, and the ponderomotive separation of ions in a binary mixture is demonstrated. It is shown that the heavy ions collect near the magnetic equator provided the waves are comparatively strong. It suggests that the ponderomotive effects play a part in formation of structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Tropical plumes are a common synoptic scale feature over the Eastern Pacific associated with subtropical jet and ITCZ intensifications. Because of data sparseness, operational analysis has yielded little information of the details of the tropical plume formation process. Tropical plumes have been simulated in a global 200 mb shallow water model with a realistic basic state (Blackwell 1990). Diagnostic budgets were calculated based on model output for absolute vorticity, divergence, and kinetic energy. Also, the movement of the zero absolute vorticity isopleth during plume formation is examined. This information is compared for cases with plume formation, without plume formation, and the basic state. Budget results indicate the convergent forcing center, when located near a strong absolute vorticity gradient, creates an equatorial Rossby wave source. This source generates a large scale, quasi-stationary equatorial Rossby wave which, if located near the ambient eastern Pacific trough, strengthens this trough into the tropics. As the trough strengthens, it displaces the vorticity gradient equatorward into the cmvergence forcing region. This vorticity gradient encroaches upon the forcing region and creates a second Rossby wave source. This generates a second, smaller scale Rossby wave which propagates to the northeast along the axis of strong vorticity gradient. This Rossby wave is highly divergent in nature, due to the model's small Rossby radius of deformation. The accompanying train of convergence/divergence centers distorts the <b>potential</b> <b>trough</b> to create significant cross contour flow, which accelerates the subtropical jet to the east of the trough, resulting in a tropical plume. This study indicates the Rossby wave and accompanying cross contour and ageostrophic flow adequately explain the formation of all three key tropical plume features...|$|E
40|$|Using the CPC (Climate Prediction Center) Merged Analysis of Precipitation product {{along with}} the Goddard Earth Observing System reanalysis and the Climate Analysis Center sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) data, we conduct a diagnostic study of the interannual and decadal scale variability of summer rainfall over South America. Results show three leading modes of rainfall variation identified with interannual, decadal, and long-term trend variability. Together, these modes explain {{more than half the}} total variance. The first mode is highly correlated with El Nino/southern oscillation (ENSO), showing severe drought over Northeast Brazil and copious rainfall over the Ecuador coast and the area of Uruguay-Southern Brazil in El Nino years. This pattern is attributed to the large scale zonal shift of the Walker circulation and local Hadley cell anomaly induced by positive (negative) SST anomaly over the eastern (western) equatorial Pacific. In El Nino years, two convective belts indicated by upper tropospheric velocity <b>potential</b> <b>trough</b> and mid-tropospheric rising motion, which are somewhat symmetric about the equator, extend toward the northeast and the southeast into the tropical North and South Atlantic respectively. Sandwiched between the ascent is a region of descending motion over Northeast Brazil. The southern branch of the anomalous Hadley cell is dynamically linked to the increase of rainfall over Uruguay-Southern Brazil. The regional response of anomalous circulation shows a stronger South American summer monsoon and an enhanced (weakened) subtropical high over the South Atlantic (South Pacific) Ocean. The decadal variation displays a meridional shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which is tie to the anomalous cross-equatorial SST gradient over the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific. In conjunction with this mode is a large scale mass swing between the polar regions and midlatitudes in both hemispheres. Over the South Atlantic and the South Pacific, the changes of the strength of the subtropical high and the associated surface wind are dynamically consistent with the distribution of local SST anomalies, suggesting the importance of the atmospheric forcing in the decadal time scale. The decadal mode also presents a weak summer monsoon in its positive phase, which reduces the moisture supply from the equatorial Atlantic and the Amazon Basin and results in negative rainfall anomalies over the central Andes and Gran Chaco. The long-term trend shows decrease of rainfall from the northwest coast to the southeast subtropical region and a southward shift of Atlantic ITCZ that leads to increased rainfall over northern and eastern Brazil. Our result shows a close link of this mode to the observed SST warming trend over the subtropical South Atlantic and a remote connection to the interdecadal SST variation over the extratropical North Atlantic found in previous studies...|$|E

40|$|This paper reexamines the {{physical}} roles of trapped and passing electrons in electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) solitary waves, {{also called the}} BGK phase space electron holes (EH). It is shown that the charge density variation {{in the vicinity of}} the solitary potential is a net balance of the negative charge from trapped electrons and positive charge due to the decrease of the passing electron density. A BGK EH consists of electron density enhancements as well as a density depletion, instead of only the density depletion as previously thought. The shielding of the positive core is not a thermal screening by the ambient plasma, but achieved by trapped electrons oscillating inside the <b>potential</b> energy <b>trough.</b> The total charge of a BGK EH is therefore zero. Two separated EHs do not interact and the concept of negative mass is not needed. These features are independent of the strength of the nonlinearity. BGK EHs do not require thermal screening, and their size is thus not restricted to be greater than the Debye length λ_D. Our analysis predicts that BGK EHs smaller than λ_D can exist. A width(δ) -amplitude(ψ) relation of an inequality form is obtained for BGK EHs in general. For empty-centered EHs with potential amplitude ≫ 1, we show that the width-amplitude relation of the form δ∝√(ψ) is common to bell-shaped potentials.

40|$|A 3 D {{petroleum}} systems {{model of}} the northern Bonaparte Basin indicates that the <b>potential</b> Nancar <b>Trough</b> source kitchen could be currently expelling hydrocarbons from numerous Jurassic source rocks into traps on the Laminaria High. Based {{on a range of}} kinetic models defined for such source rocks within the Plover, Laminaria and Frigate formations, two phases of hydrocarbon generation are predicted. Source rocks within the Lower Cretaceous Echuca Shoals Formation are immature for hydrocarbon generation in this region. Hydrocarbon generation in the Laminaria High commenced during the mid to late Cenozoic, and in the Nancar Trough during the Early Cretaceous, in response to elevated heat flow during the syn-rift phase. The second and main phase of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion started in the mid-Eocene and is ongoing. This phase was controlled by deposition of the thick Cenozoic carbonate shelf, which resulted in deep burial and continued heating of the Mesozoic source rocks. This second phase of expulsion coincided with the reactivation of fault-bounded traps, the consequence of which is that either {{some or all of the}} initially trapped hydrocarbons have escaped out of the charged structures. Thus, the most plausible explanation for the occurrence of under-filled and dry structures within the study area is that the faults bounding these traps remained permeable from the late Miocene to the present-day. Secondary alteration processes including water washing and phase fractionation are necessary to explain the bulk composition of Laminaria High and neighbouring under-saturated light oil accumulations. 23 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Deep basin {{hydrocarbon}} accumulations {{have been}} widely recognised in North America and include the giant fields of Elmworth and Hoadley in the Western Canadian Basin. Deep basin accumulations are unconventional, being located downdip of water–saturated rocks, with no obvious impermeable barrier separating them. Gas accumulations in the Nappamerri Trough, Cooper Basin, exhibit several characteristics consistent with North American deep basin accumulations. Log evaluation suggests thick gas columns and tests have recovered only gas and no water. The resistivity of the entire rock section exceeds 20 Ωm over large intervals, and, as in known deep basin accumulations, the entire rock section may contain gas. Gas in the Nappamerri Trough is located within overpressured compartments which witness the hydraulic isolation necessary for gas saturation outside conventional closure. Furthermore, the Nappamerri Trough, like known deep basin accumulations, has extensive, coal–rich source rocks capable of generating enormous hydrocarbon volumes. The above evidence for a deep basin–type gas accumulation in the Nappamerri Trough is necessarily circumstantial, {{and the existence of}} a dee gas accumulation can only be proven unequivocally by drilling wells outside conventional closure.

40|$|The {{synoptic}} {{evolution of}} three tropical–extratropical (TE) interactions, each responsible for extreme rainfall events over southern Africa, {{is discussed in}} detail. Along with the consideration of previously studied events, common features of these heavy rainfall producing tropical temperate troughs (TTTs) over southern Africa are discussed. It is found that 2 days prior to an event, northeasterly moisture transports across Botswana, {{set up by the}} Angola low, are diverted farther south into the semiarid region of subtropical southern Africa. The TTTs reach full maturity as a TE cloud band, rooted in the central subcontinent, which is triggered by upper-level divergence along the leading edge of an upper-tropospheric westerly wave trough. Convection and rainfall within the cloud band is supported by poleward moisture transports with subtropical air rising as it leaves the continent and joins the midlatitude westerly flow. It is shown that these systems fit within a theoretical framework describing similar TE interactions found globally. Uplift forcing for the extreme rainfall of each event is investigated. Unsurprisingly, quasigeostrophic uplift is found to dominate in the midlatitudes with convective processes strongest in the subtropics. Rainfall in the semiarid interior of South Africa appears to be a result of quasigeostrophically triggered convection. Investigation of TTT formation in the context of planetary waves shows that early development is sometimes associated with previous anticyclonic wave breaking south of the subcontinent, with full maturity of TTTs occurring as a <b>potential</b> vorticity <b>trough</b> approaches the continent from the west.

We then construct azimuthally symmetric EH solutions under conditions where electrons are highly field-aligned and ions form a uniform background along the magnetic field. Our results indicate that, for a single humped electric potential, the parallel cut of the perpendicular component of the electric field (E ?) is unipolar {{and that of the}} parallel component (E ||) bipolar, reproducing the multi-dimensional features of the solitary waves observed by the FAST satellite. Our analytical solutions presented in this article capture the 3 D electric interaction and the observed features of (E ||) and E ?. The solutions predict a dependence of the parallel width-amplitude relation on the perpendicular size of EHs. This dependence can be used in conjunction with experimental data to yield an estimate of the typical perpendicular size of observed EHs; this provides important information on the perpendicular span of the source region as well as on how much electrostatic energy is transported by the solitary waves...|$|R

40|$|Using {{numerical}} simulations {{we examine}} colloids with a long-range Coulomb interaction confined in a two-dimensional <b>trough</b> <b>potential</b> undergoing dynamical compression. As {{the depth of}} the confining well is increased, the colloids move via elastic distortions interspersed with intermittent bursts or avalanches of plastic motion. In these avalanches, the colloids rearrange to minimize their colloid-colloid repulsive interaction energy by adopting an average lattice constant that is isotropic despite the anisotropic nature of the compression. The avalanches take the form of shear banding events that decrease or increase the structural order of the system. At larger compressions, the avalanches are associated with a reduction of the number of rows of colloids that fit within the confining potential, and between avalanches the colloids can exhibit partially crystalline or even smectic ordering. The colloid velocity distributions during the avalanches have a non-Gaussian form with power law tails and exponents that are consistent with those found for the velocity distributions of gliding dislocations. We observe similar behavior when we subsequently decompress the system, and find a partially hysteretic response reflecting the irreversibility of the plastic events.

40|$|Using {{numerical}} simulations, {{we study}} the dynamical evolution of particles interacting via competing long-range repulsion and short-range attraction in two dimensions. The particles are compressed using a time-dependent quasi-one dimensional <b>trough</b> <b>potential</b> {{that controls the}} local density, causing the system to undergo a series of structural phase transitions from a low density clump lattice to stripes, voids, and a high density uniform state. The compression proceeds via slow elastic motion that is interrupted with avalanche-like bursts of activity as the system collapses to progressively higher densities via plastic rearrangements. The plastic events vary in magnitude from small rearrangements of particles, including the formation of quadrupole-like defects, to large-scale vorticity and structural phase transitions. In the dense uniform phase, the system compresses through row reduction transitions mediated by a disorder-order process. We characterize the rearrangement events by measuring changes in the potential energy, the fraction of sixfold coordinated particles, the local density, and the velocity distribution. At high confinements, we find power law scaling of the velocity distribution during row reduction transitions. We observe hysteresis under {{a reversal of the}} compression when relatively few plastic rearrangements occur. The decompressing system exhibits distinct phase morphologies, and the phase transitions occur at lower compression forces as the system expands compared to when it is compressed...|$|R
