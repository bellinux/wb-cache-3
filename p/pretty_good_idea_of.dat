500|$|Executive {{producer}} David Alpert said in 2014 {{that the}} original comics have given them enough ideas for Rick Grimes and company {{over the next seven}} years. [...] "I happen to love working from source material, specifically because we have a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what Season 10 is gonna be", Alpert said. [...] "We know where seasons 11 and 12 ... we have benchmarks and milestones for those seasons if we're lucky enough to get there." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film {{one out of}} five stars saying, [...] "It's all bunk and has been for years. These are all no-win scenarios. Whatever moral lessons were {{presented}} in the earliest Saw films seem to have been dispensed with as the movies grow more and more gruesome, with filmmakers caught up in 'What would it look like if somebody's jaw was ripped out, or their skin was glued to a car seat?' Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise". [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times called the film the most [...] "straightforward" [...] of the series and the [...] "most consistently (though not inventively) violent". He ended his review saying, [...] "If you see the film in a theater equipped with RealD 3D and Dolby sound, you'll come away with a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what it would feel like to have flying body parts hit you in the face".|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1938, Tytla {{animated}} Yen Sid, the old magician in [...] "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," [...] {{which would}} eventually become a segment in Fantasia (1940). However the character from Fantasia which Tytla {{is better known}} for is Chernabog, {{his own version of}} Crnobog the Black God, from the [...] "Night on Bald Mountain" [...] sequence. It is often said that Chernabog was based on actor Bela Lugosi, and Walt did bring him in to do live action reference for the character. However, Bill already had a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{what he wanted to do}} and did not like Bela's interpretation of the character. Instead he had Wilfred Jackson (who is credited for the music of Steamboat Willie) act out the part for him, and that is what he used as live action reference.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, lad, it don't seem {{as though}} I ought to hang back back when I'm needed. If all we hear from the other provinces is true, you'll be old enough to take {{a hand in the}} {{scrimmage}} before the fightin's over, so here's a chance to serve an apprenticeship. If it so be you're of the mind I'll take you under my wing, an' {{by the time we get}} back you'll have a <b>pretty</b> decently <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a soldier's trade." ...|$|R
5000|$|Eschewing chronological plot {{development}} and straightforward resolution—a concern often mentioned in reviews—the novel supports {{a wide range}} of readings. At various times Wallace said that he intended for the novel's plot to resolve, but indirectly; responding to his editor's concerns about the lack of resolution, he said [...] "the answers all exist, but just past the last page". Long after publication Wallace maintained this position, stating that the novel [...] "does resolve, but it resolves... outside of the right frame of the picture. You can get a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> I think, <b>of</b> what happens". Critical reviews and a reader's guide have provided insight, though Burns notes that Wallace privately conceded to Jonathan Franzen that [...] "the story can't fully be made sense of".|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I had a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> that Mrs. Bunny {{would take}} a broom to the president, instead of {{listening}} to him, if he went to my home while Sonny Bunny was so sick and I told him as much, breaking it gently so he wouldn't get angry; but, bless you, he didn't seem to mind it. He's been around the world so much that he's got a mighty <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how things may be at a fellow's home {{when one of the}} children has been abused.|$|R
2500|$|Zombie was {{responsible}} for writing all of the album's songs, while he initially worked with Nine Inch Nails member Charlie Clouser to produce the album. Zombie and Clouser opted for a more [...] "electronic" [...] sound for the record, using various music software while working on the project. Clouser claimed [...] "It was me and him with a computer, {{trying to figure out}} a direction we wanted to go in. We had a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the kind of elements that would be included and an overall concept of the segues between songs and the musical interludes. We even started coming up with the core riffs for the album." [...] Early into the process of recording the album, Clouser became unable to work on the album due to other obligations; however, he recommended that Zombie worked with Scott Humphrey {{for the remainder of the}} album. Humphrey had previously worked with artists such as Metallica prior to producing the album. Due to his departure, the only song on the album produced by Clouser is [...] "Superbeast". Zombie stated that making the album was [...] "weird", and he didn't believe it would do well, as [...] "most debut solo records don't." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{haymaking}} is a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Little Chief's," [...] remarked Peter Rabbit, scratching a long {{ear with}} a long hind foot. [...] "I've a great mind to try it myself." ...|$|E

5000|$|In August 2005, Gabriel Dufault, {{leader of}} the Union {{nationale}} métisse Saint-Joseph, stated, [...] "I've heard it's in Winnipeg. I've heard it's in a garage in the North End... I have a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> who the people that know more ... are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless your heart, Joseph, I'm doing no {{more than}} if I was alone, except perhaps {{there may be more}} victuals on the table. My {{appetite}} isn't as hearty as it used to be; but I've got a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> how it is with growing boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All this is {{not exactly}} new to me, though Miss Hillyard, {{who seems to be}} a shrewd young lady, speaks {{strongly}} in Allinson's favor. From odd things he let fall, I'd formed a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the situation. Now that you have cleared the ground, you had better go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{can get a}} <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the {{character}} of the schools from an account given of the establishment of the first school in Newark, where the town authorities made a contract [...] "with Mr. John Catlin to instruct their children and servants in as much English, reading, writing, and arithmetic, as he could teach." ...|$|E
6000|$|When all {{had been}} embarked, {{two of the five}} boats still {{remained}} empty, but Yoosoof had a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the particular points along the coast where more [...] "cattle" [...] of a similar kind could be purchased. Therefore, after stationing some of his men, armed with muskets, to guard the boats, he returned with the remainder of them to the hut in which the Englishmen had been left.|$|E
60|$|Hah! That is felt on {{all hands}} to be {{a shot in}} the bull's eye. How CAN people do that! The Analytical Chemist going round with champagne, looks very much as if HE could give them a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> how people did that, if he had a mind.|$|R
60|$|They {{went off}} as though they'd left a load o' care be'ind 'em, and arter tying the dog up to a crane I {{went on with}} my work. They 'adn't told me wot the game was, but, from one or two things they'd let drop, I'd got a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eva Mae Brooks {{had gotten}} used to being a light sleeper, so the gentle tapping at her door at 2 am didn’t startle her. As {{she made her way}} down the stairs she had a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> what to expect. It was just another cold dark night in Baltimore and the police were looking for her.|$|R
60|$|If {{you have}} ever seen the ocean, you will {{understand}} what a grand thing it {{is to look for}} the first time upon its mighty waters, stretching away into the distance, and losing themselves in the clouds and sky. We know it is thousands of miles over to the other shore, but for all that we have a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> that shore. We know its name, and have read about the people who live there.|$|E
60|$|We have no very {{authentic}} {{details of}} the minutiae of the form or size of ancient ships, but antiquarians have collected {{a vast amount of}} desultory information, which, when put together, enables us to form a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the manner of working them, while ancient coins and sculptures have given us a notion of their general aspect. No doubt many of these records are grotesque enough, nevertheless they must be correct in the main particulars.|$|E
6000|$|Any one who {{has read}} Mark Twain's, [...] "A Connecticut Yankee in King [...] Arthur's Court," [...] has a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> his opinion of kings in [...] general, and tyrants in particular. Rule by [...] "divine right," [...] however [...] liberal, was distasteful to him; where it meant oppression it [...] stirred him to violence. In his article, [...] "The Czar's Soliloquy," [...] he [...] gave himself loose rein {{concerning}} atrocities charged to the master [...] of Russia, and in a letter which he wrote {{during the summer of}} 1890, [...] he offered a hint as to remedies. The letter was written by [...] editorial request, but was never mailed. Perhaps it seemed too [...] openly revolutionary at the moment.|$|E
60|$|Before {{half an hour}} {{had passed}} {{there was no longer}} any doubt in my mind but that they were in search of us, having a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> from the {{direction}} of our flight, that we were bent on gaining the water-front, and also, most like, that we could not pass Hudson's point without being seen by them.|$|R
25|$|You're {{sitting in}} the stands {{and you can see}} he's a big guy, but when I walked up to {{him for the first time}} face-to-face, I go, 'Wow, this is a big man.' He's big, but he has a really good swing. It's not like a big guy. It's short, compact. It's not just the home runs. The guy has a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> how to hit.|$|R
5000|$|Milius' first {{completed}} {{script was}} *Los Gringos (1968). [...] "It actually wasn't bad," [...] he later said. It {{was sort of}} like The Wild Bunch ... {{there was a lot of}} killing and shooting and riding and dust ... sombreros. ... It was a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> actually. It had everything, and it was certainly as original as The Wild Bunch, but it wasn't as skillfully written as later stuff." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Perkenpine grinned. [...] "That sort {{of thing}} was all very well a week ago," [...] said she, [...] "but it won't work now. I've been goin' to school to myself pretty steady, and I've kept myself in a good deal, too, for not knowin' my lessons, and I've drummed into me a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what I be, and I can tell you I'm not a woman as stays here when Phil Matlack's gone. I'm not a bit scary, but I never stayed in camp yet with all greenhorns but me. When I find myself {{in that sort of}} a mess, it's my nater to get out of it. Phil says he's goin' to start the fust thing this afternoon, and that's the time I'm goin', and so, {{if you would like to}} go, you can send word by that man in the cart to have you and your things sent for, and we can all clear out together." ...|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, the parlor-window {{has given}} us a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the {{nautical}} business of Liverpool; the constant objects being the little black steamers puffing unquietly along, sometimes to our own ferry, sometimes beyond it to Eastham, and sometimes towing a long string of boats from Runcorn or otherwhere up the river, laden with goods, and sometimes gallanting a tall ship in or out. Some of these ships lie for days together in the river, very majestic and stately objects, often with the flag of the stars and stripes waving over them. Now and then, after a gale at sea, a vessel comes in with her masts broken short off in the midst, and with marks of rough handling about the hull. Once a week comes a Cunard steamer, with its red funnel pipe whitened by the salt spray; and, firing off cannon to announce her arrival, she moors to a large iron buoy {{in the middle of the}} river, and a few hundred yards from the stone pier of our ferry. Immediately comes poring towards her a little mail-steamer, to take away her mail-bags and such of the passengers as choose to land; and for several hours afterwards the Cunard lies with the smoke and steam coming out of her, as if she were smoking her pipe after her toilsome passage across the Atlantic. Once a fortnight comes an American steamer of the Collins line; and then the Cunard salutes her with cannon, to which the Collins responds, and moors herself to another iron buoy, not far from the Cunard. When they go to sea, it is with similar salutes; the two vessels paying each other the more ceremonious respect, because they are inimical and jealous of each other.|$|E
5000|$|Certain mosaics, however, {{provide a}} <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "grand painting" [...] of the period: these are copies of frescoes.|$|E

"When these country jays {{begin to}} send their stuff home I'll have ours shipped, an' there's little danger it'll be overhauled, more {{especially}} since the old man couldn't get a warrant for {{the only one he}} suspects. It's a safe bet that Hazelton has a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> who did the job, an' if they make trouble for him he'll most likely tell what he thinks." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had a small}} scene {{this morning}} after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once {{heard the sound of}} voices raised, and I had a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> what the point was which was under discussion. After a time the baronet opened his door and called for me.|$|R
5000|$|That is {{the thing}} about the Emo Diaries, you always have a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> about what each new page will bring, but that doesn't make it any less {{exciting}} to read. There are a few spots that some might view as experimentation overtaking good sense (the sax solo in the Colour Blue's [...] "Of Our Disregard"), but overall, My Very Last Breath proves that the Emo Diaries series just keeps getting stronger.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that younger}} can never gain a pique because elder always scores one point for {{leading to the}} first trick (see below).

50|$|A typical Little Mountain Reunion afforded {{not only}} a time to renew friendships made at school but the time {{to catch up on}} {{political}} thinking and the state of politics in the Dutch Fork.

50|$|The edition is {{particularly}} aims {{at the international}} research community.

5000|$|Larry Harris commented: [...] "I am {{convinced}} that Allan Calhamer's masterpiece {{should be part of}} every high school curriculum. Don't tell the kids, but it teaches history, geography, the art of political negotiation, and something else — some healthy critical skepticism. By the time you get into high school, you have a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> that not everyone always tells the truth. But a good game of Diplomacy helps you to understand how skillful some people can be at fooling you!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Bella becomes {{concerned}} when her brother {{does not come}} home. She goes to Neeve. The two then consult Dermot's good friend, cobbler Jimmy Hannafin (Cyril Cusack).

Once they find and free Dermot, guarded only by youngster Quinn (Wilfred Downing), Jimmy arranges for a friend to give Dermot a ride to Belfast, where he can leave the country. Neeve goes with him.|$|R

Ryan just brought so many layers to it straight away...the first test he did was quite a short little piece but there was a sneakiness, there was this real belief in the character. He just was Griff." ...|$|R
