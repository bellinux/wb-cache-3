Here he picked up a working {{knowledge}} of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's <b>publishing</b> <b>activities.</b> He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and introduced him to the ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about the real nature of Gryce's retreat from jazz, as this period is {{characterized}} by a great deal of misunderstanding and rumor. Gryce revealed very little about his business hardships, but what is known is that his publishing business encountered financial troubles in the early 1960s, with many musicians withdrawing from Melotone and Totem. Many of his colleagues believe that powerful interests considered Gryce's <b>publishing</b> <b>activities</b> a threat, and were forcing him out of business. Rumors circulated about intimidation and threats to his family. While these rumors have not been confirmed, Gryce's behavior became extremely introverted and erratic during this time. He dissolved his publishing companies in 1963 and gave up his music career, thereafter adopting his Islamic name entirely, Basheer Quisim.|$|E
25|$|The old Tsarist Copyright law of 1911 was not {{immediately}} invalidated after the October Revolution. The old law, with its copyright term of 50 years after the author's death and its possibility of transferring copyrights in their entirety from an author to a publisher, continued to be valid initially. But the nationalizations {{in all areas of}} the economy soon considerably restricted the avenues through which an author could publish her or his work, even if her or his copyright remained initially untouched. All <b>publishing</b> <b>activities</b> were placed {{under the supervision of the}} State Publishing house by a decree of May 21, 1919. On July 29, 1919, the government declared a state monopoly on unpublished works of deceased authors; and on April 20, 1920, all books (including those in private possession) were nationalized, except those in public libraries. Theatres and film studios as well as the photographic industry were nationalized in August 1919. Private publishing houses were eventually liquidated as well. The right to translate foreign publications into Russian was also monopolized by the government.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} by artists to create art {{that can not}} be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is [...] "necessary to present something more than mere objects" [...] said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as performance art, video art, and conceptual art. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. [...] "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and <b>publishing</b> <b>activities</b> for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... endeavored to undermine the art object qua object." ...|$|E
