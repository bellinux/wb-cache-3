Some dismiss the <b>paradox,</b> while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons <b>paradox.</b> Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the <b>paradox,</b> and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E

5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti <b>paradox</b> (which was just mentioned), Cantor's <b>paradox,</b> and Russell's <b>paradox.</b> Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Paradoxes</b> {{create a}} special {{challenge}} to learners and the incoherence involved causes great {{problems in their}} mind. Students ‟ facing <b>paradoxes</b> provide an invaluable chance for the teachers to direct their attention towards the point and help them resolve the problem of concern. Therefore, because {{of the importance of}} <b>paradoxes,</b> the present paper aims at studying the effect of <b>paradoxes</b> in teaching and learning mathematics, specially, in cases in which students make frequent mistakes which are here referred as “common mistakes”. To do this, 150 students 14 - 15 years old, participated in the study to investigate the efficiency of <b>paradoxes</b> in two most frequent errors: “simplification in equations ” and “eliminating the radical from square expressions”. The study lasted about four months during which the researcher taught relevant concepts in relation to the problems through <b>paradoxes.</b> The analysis of the data collected from a pre-test and a post-test showed that employing <b>paradoxes</b> is quite efficient in teaching and learning mathematic...|$|R
