40|$|Objective: Oxytetracycline is an {{approved}} antibiotic and {{most frequently used}} drug in commercial aquaculture {{all over the world}} for treating bacterial diseases in fish. The intensive use of oxytetracycline has resulted development of bacterial resistance to oxytetracycline. It is reported that phytochemicals like quercetin, gallic acid, cinnamic acid and <b>p-anisic</b> <b>acid</b> have antibacterial properties. An attempt was made to observe the type of interaction upon incorporation of phytochemicals in combination with conventional antimicrobials like oxytetracycline with a view to decrease the antimicrobial load in aquaculture for minimizing resistance in bacterial pathogens in case combination of phytochemicals and oxytetracycline do possess synergy or additive effect. Combinations of oxytetracycline with polyphenolic compounds (quercetin, gallic acid, <b>p-anisic</b> <b>acid,</b> and cinnamic acid) against common gram negative bacterial pathogens of fish, such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, and Edwardsiella tarda were tested. Methods: Antibacterial activity of oxytetracycline, quercetin, gallic acid, <b>p-anisic</b> <b>acid</b> and cinnamic acid was determined in vitro against selected bacterial pathogens individually followed by combination of oxytetracycline with polyphenols using serial microplate dilution method measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices were calculated. Results: Oxytetracycline and other polyphenolic compounds exhibited antibacterial action against the selected fish pathogens with mean MIC ranging from 0. 5 to 2. 5 mg ml- 1. Based on FIC indices, synergistic interaction was observed for combination of oxytetracycline with quercetin or cinnamic acid against Aeromonas salmonicida, and with gallic acid against Edwardsiella tarda.

40|$|Spectral and {{catalytic}} {{properties of}} the flavoenzyme AAO (aryl-alcohol oxidase) from Pleurotus eryngii were investigated using recombinant enzyme. Unlike most flavoprotein oxidases, AAO does not thermodynamically stabilize a flavin semiquinone radical and forms no sulphite adduct. AAO catalyses the oxidative dehydrogenation {{of a wide range}} of unsaturated primary alcohols with hydrogen peroxide production. This differentiates the enzyme from VAO (vanillyl-alcohol oxidase), which is specific for phenolic compounds. Moreover, AAO is optimally active in the pH range of 5 - 6, whereas VAO has an optimum at pH 10. Kinetic studies showed that AAO is most active with p-anisyl alcohol and 2, 4 -hexadien- 1 -ol. AAO converts m- and p-chlorinated benzyl alcohols at a similar rate as it does benzyl alcohol, but introduction of a p-methoxy substituent in benzyl alcohol increases the reaction rate approx. 5 -fold. AAO also exhibits low activity on aromatic aldehydes. 19 F NMR analysis showed that fluorinated benzaldehydes are converted into the corresponding benzoic acids. Inhibition studies revealed that the AAO active site can bind a wide range of aromatic ligands, chavicol (4 -allylphenol) and <b>p-anisic</b> (4 -methoxybenzoic) <b>acid</b> being the best competitive inhibitors. Uncompetitive inhibition was observed with 4 -methoxybenzylamine. The properties described above render AAO a unique oxidase. The possible mechanism of AAO binding and oxidation of substrates is discussed in the light of the results of the inhibition and kinetic studies. © 2005 Biochemical Society.

40|$|Strain A 81 of Nocardia corallina hydroxylates or demethylates <b>p-anisic</b> <b>acid</b> to {{p-hydroxybenzoic}} acid and isovanillic acid. It demethylates veratric acid to {{a mixture of}} vanillic and isovanillic acids. These are both demethylated to protocatechuic acid, which undergoes ring cleavage to afford β-carboxy-cis-cis-muconic acid. The intermediacy of protocatechuic acid in the catabolic pathway of veratric acid was confirmed by blocking ring cleavage with an additional substituent in the ring: 5 -chlorovanillic acid was demethylated to 5 -chloro-protocatechuic acid, which accumulated. Chloro substituents in the ring of other methoxylated benzoic acids also arrested their normal metabolism by the Nocardia: an ortho-chloro substituent thwarted both demethylation and ring-opening. ortho-Hydroxylation of p-methoxybenzoic acid to isovanillic acid was unaffected by a chlorine ortho to the methoxyl group.

In contrast, carbamylation of VRV-PL-VIIIa in the presence of anisic acid could not neutralize the lung hemorrhage and edema inducing activities.

On the other hand, the copious phenolic content in Zostera species such as flavones and sulfated phenols was revealed by McMillan et al.

Quinic acid, benzoic acid, and <b>p-anisic</b> <b>acid</b> had no effect on radical formation. These results suggest that a phenol moiety is essential for these inhibitory effects. The fluorescence intensity of FMN decreased by 69 % ± 2 % after CA addition, suggesting that CA quenches the singlet excited state of FMN. When 1 mM CA was added to a standard reaction mixture containing 25 μM FMN, 140 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4), and 10 mM 4 -oxo- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine, the electron spin resonance signal of 4 -oxo- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidinooxy disappeared.

In this study the qualitative target was linked with future possible applications of received data for improving non-destructive methodology as well as for improving existing knowledge regarding antioxidant content in some plant species. Comparative analysis of total phenolics, flavonoid contents, phenolic acid composition, and antioxidant activity in known east central Europe medicinal and industrial crop plants of 26 species of families Asteraceae, Rosaceae and Lamiaceae was done. Among the investigated leaf extracts the highest total phenolic, total flavonoid contents and antioxidant activity have been seen for Stachys byzantine L. (Lamiaceae), Calendula officinalis L.

Results: Treatment of buckwheat seeds with 2 % of CCC has been increased content of total phenolics in the stems, leaves and inflorescences. On analyzing the different parts of buckwheat plants, 9 different phenolic acids – vanilic acid, ferulic acid, trans-ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, salycilic acid, cinamic acid, p-coumaric acid, <b>p-anisic</b> <b>acid,</b> methoxycinamic acid and catechins were identified. The levels of identified phenolic acids varied not only significantly among the plant organs but also between early stages of vegetation period.

The content of these phenolic acids has been significant increased under effect of 2 % CCC treatment at the phase I (formation of buds) in the stems and at the phase II (beginning of flowering) in the leaves and then inflorescences respectively. The content of catechins as potential buckwheat antioxidants has been increased at the early stages of vegetation period after treatment with 2 % CCC.

40|$|Cerebral venous {{thrombosis}} (CVT) often causes human depression, whereas depression-induced low immunity makes the patients susceptible to gastrointestinal infection. Blueberry possesses antidepressant properties which may improve autoimmunity and reduce gastrointestinal infection. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) performs antidepressant function {{and can be}} regulated by miR- 155, which may be affected by blueberry. To explore the possible molecular mechanism, blueberry compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Activity of compounds was tested by using HT 22 cells. The present study tested 124 patients with CVT-induced mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies—Depression Scale [CES-D] ≥ 16) and gastrointestinal infection. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} blueberry extract group (BG, received 10 mg blueberry extract daily) and placebo group (PG, received 10 mg placebo daily). After 3 months, depression, gastrointestinal infection and lipid profiles were investigated. Serum miR- 155 and BDNF were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and or Western Blot. Blueberry treatment improved depressive symptoms and lipid profiles, and also reduced gastrointestinal infection in the BG group (P < 0. 05) but those of the PG group (P = 1). These changes were paralleled by increase in serum levels of BDNF and miR- 155 (P < 0. 05). HPLC analysis showed that blueberry extracts were the main phenolic acids with 0. 18, 0. 85, 0. 26, 0. 72, 0. 66, 0. 4, 1, and 1. 92 mg/g of gentisic acid, chlorogenic acid, [2]-epicatechin, p-coumaric acid, benzoic acid, <b>p-anisic</b> <b>acid,</b> and quercetin in blueberry extracts, respectively.
