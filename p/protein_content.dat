5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool sheep {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, {{but there are a}} few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In the quality of their milk, the fat and <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.|$|E

30|$|Under {{heterotrophic}} conditions, the <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> of {{both the}} tested organisms were decreased gradually by increasing the concentrations of soluble product of treated wheat and glucose, but still more than the control; {{this means that the}} algal protein production depended on the concentration of the used carbon source and light. These findings are in accordance with those of [Ogbonna and Tanaka (2000]) who found that <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> of Chlorella decreased during the heterotrophic phase.|$|R
5|$|In some cultures, insects, {{especially}} deep-fried cicadas, {{are considered}} to be delicacies, whereas in other places they form part of the normal diet. Insects have a high <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> for their mass, and some authors suggest their potential as a major source of protein in human nutrition.

5|$|Warm air : Exposition {{of seeds}} to warm air (50 to 70°C, {{depending}} duration) kills B. rufimanus developing into the seeds {{at the same}} time it lowers water content. However, warmth can decrease germination rates of the seeds and degrade the visual aspect and the <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of the seeds, which would be problematic for the seed market.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the polar}} lipids, the outer layer of MFGM {{contains}} {{a number of}} glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins. Proteomic analysis has revealed at least 191 different known proteins in human MFGM, and comparable numbers in bovine milk protein concentrates. While quantitatively these only represent 1% to 2% of total milk <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> MFGM proteins are of significant interest because many {{are known to have}} bioactive and potentially beneficial properties; almost half of identified proteins have membrane/protein trafficking or cell signaling functions. The glycosylated proteins, including mucins (MUC-1, MUC-4, MUC-15), butyrophilin, lactadherin, and CD36, have been suggested to enhance triacylglyceride digestion efficiency. Furthermore, lactadherin and MUC-1, in addition to the non-glycosylated protein xanthine oxidase, have been shown or suggested in preclinical studies to possess antimicrobial properties.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores, the nilgai prefer {{grasses and}} herbs; woody plants are {{commonly}} eaten {{in the dry}} tropical forests of India. Studies suggest they may be browsers or mixed feeders in India, whereas they are primarily grazers in Texas. The nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer, possibly because they can reach high branches and do not depend on surface vegetation. The sambar deer and nilgai in Nepal have similar dietary preferences. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of the nilgai's {{should be at least}} seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and do not drink regularly even in summer. However, a nilgai died in Dwarka (India) allegedly due to the heat wave and acute shortage of water.|$|E
5|$|Lignin is {{a complex}} {{polymeric}} chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light. The species C.bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications {{not only in the}} pulp and paper industry, but also to increase the digestibility and <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C.bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C.pallidus can biodegrade the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions-contaminated soils.|$|E

5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Oxidative stress {{effects on}} growth, viability, pigment ({{chlorophyll}} a, chlorophyll b, β-carotene) and <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> in Antarctic microalga Choricystis minor were investigated.

25|$|Melamine is {{sometimes}} illegally added to food products {{in order to}} increase the apparent <b>protein</b> <b>content.</b> Standard tests, such as the Kjeldahl and Dumas tests, estimate protein levels by measuring the nitrogen content, so they can be misled by adding nitrogen-rich compounds such as melamine. An instrument (SPRINT) developed by the company CEM Corp allows the determination of <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> directly in some applications; the instrument cannot be fooled by adding melamine in the sample.|$|E
25|$|Melamine {{may have}} been added to fool {{government}} <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> tests after water was added to fraudulently dilute the milk. Because of melamine's high nitrogen content (66% by mass versus approx. 10–12% for typical protein), it can cause the <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of food to appear higher than the true value. Officials estimate that about 20 percent of the dairy companies tested in China sell products tainted with melamine. On January 22, 2009, three of those involved in the scandal (including one conditional sentence) were sentenced to death in a Chinese court.|$|E

40|$|For {{quantitative}} evaluation of nuclear DNA and <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> of spores, the flow cytometer (PAS) with staining DAPI SR 101 was employed. A total of 22 specimens of Pleurotus were studied.

The difference in genome size and chromosome number within P. ostreatus appears as heteroploidy (see Fungal Genome Size Database [URL] We presume that the divergence that arises from a spore print reflects the fate of a hybrid genome in meiosis. Our results seem to confirm that parental genomes of different sizes segregate in meiosis.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the nature of gene action determining the inheritance pattern of protein, lysine, gluten and flour yield in eight wheat varieties (Pak 81, Pothowar 93, Parwaz 94, Shahkar 95, Suleiman 96, Chakwal 97, Kohistan 97 and MH 97) {{selected on the basis}} of phenotypic diversity. In order to ascertain the gene action involved in the inheritance of these characters, the techniques like analysis of variance of Hayman model and genetic component analysis were employed. The estimates of components of genetic variation showed that additive genetic effects controlled the expression of traits like <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> and flour yield, however, non-additive gene effects were more important for lysine contents and gluten contents. Directional dominance was observed in case of <b>protein</b> <b>contents,</b> which indicated the possibility of further improvement in this particular trait. <b>Protein</b> <b>contents</b> and flour yield being controlled by additive genetic effects with partial dominance suggested that selection could be practiced in early segregating generations for improvement in these traits...|$|R
