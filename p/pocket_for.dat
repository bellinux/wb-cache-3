5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show {{a high level}} of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding <b>pocket.</b> <b>For</b> instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Uman Panzer-Regiment 2 {{was given}} a rest. On 8 September the attack resumed and the {{regiment}} crossed the Dnjepr {{on the night of}} 11/12 September. Together with the I. battalion of Schützen-Regiment 79 they started their attacked on Lubny and ambushed and destroyed a Soviet supply convoy. The attack on Lubny ended on 14 September. The Kiev pocket was sealed when panzers of the 3. Panzer-Division linked up with Panzer-Regiment 2 on 15 September 1941. The spearhead of Panzergruppe 2, under Guderian and Panzergruppe 1, under Von Kleist had captured 50 Soviet Divisions. Panzer-Regiment 2 was then dispatched to prevent Soviet troops from escaping the <b>pocket.</b> <b>For</b> Panzer-Regiment 2 the battle of Kiev continued until 4 October 1941.|$|E

The Germans, having evacuated what remained of their men and equipment, had destroyed the bridge over the Rhine at Breisach.

25|$|After the {{publication}} of the NIH-run antidepressant clinical trial, clinics began opening in which the medication is given. This practice is an off label use of ketamine in the United States. As of 2015 there were about 60 such clinics in the US, the procedure was not covered by insurance, and people paid between $400 and $1700 out of <b>pocket</b> <b>for</b> a treatment. A chain of such clinics in Australia run by Aura Medical Corporation was closed down by regulatory authorities in 2015, because the clinics' marketing was not supported by scientific research and because the clinic sent people home with ketamine and needles to administer infusions to themselves.|$|E
25|$|The binding of the N-acetyl {{group is}} more complex and less known. The {{important}} amino acids in the binding <b>pocket</b> <b>for</b> this group differ between the two receptors. Serines, Ser110 and Ser114, in the TM3 domain seem to be important for binding to the MT1 receptor. However, aspargine 175 (Asn) in the TM4 domain {{is likely to be}} important for the MT2 receptor. The aromatic ring system in melatonin and analogues most likely contributes some binding affinity by binding to aromatic rings of the amino acids phenylalanine (Phe) and tryptophan (Trp) in the receptor. The bonds that form are van der Waals interactions. The N-acetyl binding and binding pocket, binding of the ring system and important domains are somewhat known and need further investigation.|$|E

25|$|Some bands use small notebooks, {{also known}} as a dot book or drill book, which they hang about their necks, on the drum harness, or around the waist. These contain pages of drill charts, which often either give a picture or list {{coordinates}} that band members use to find 'pages' or 'sets' on the field. Coordinates are normally listed in 8-to-5 steps off the front sideline and front and back hashes, along with the number of 8-5 steps off of the yardline listed on each page. Some bands are even using small plastic pouches that hang about their neck on an adjustable strap, which has a zipper <b>pocket</b> <b>for</b> holding drill, flags to mark sets, and a pencil. There is also a clear plastic window in front to display the current part of drill being worked on at that point in time.|$|E
25|$|Braies {{were usually}} {{fitted with a}} front flap that was buttoned or tied closed. This codpiece allowed men to urinate without having to remove the braies completely. Codpieces were also worn with hose when very short {{doublets}} – vest- (UK: waistcoat-) like garments tied together {{in the front and}} worn under other clothing – were in fashion, as early forms of hose were open at the crotch. Henry VIII of England began padding his codpiece, which caused a spiralling trend of larger and larger codpieces that only ended {{by the end of the}} 16th century. It has been speculated that the King may have had the sexually transmitted disease syphilis, and his large codpiece may have included a bandage soaked in medication to relieve its symptoms. Henry VIII also wanted a healthy son and may have thought that projecting himself in this way would portray fertility. Codpieces were sometimes used as a <b>pocket</b> <b>for</b> holding small items.|$|E
25|$|In June 1941 the {{division}} joined Operation Barbarossa under Army Group North {{as an element}} of the 16th Army. It took part in Army Group North's capture of the Latvian city of Daugavpils ("Dvinsk", in Russian), sweeping north-eastward to Leningrad where it was finally stopped in its tracks during the siege effort. During the early months of 1942, the II Army Corps was subject to a Soviet counteroffensive to relieve Leningrad, resulting in five army divisions (the 12th, included) and the SS-Totenkopf division being encircled along with several other elements of the 16th Army in the Demyansk Pocket. With support from Hermann Göring, planes containing supplies were flown in to aid {{the division}}s while they were in the <b>pocket</b> <b>for</b> some 81 days between 8 February and 20 March.
