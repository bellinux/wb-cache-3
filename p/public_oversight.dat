5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the <b>Public</b> <b>Oversight</b> Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E

2500|$|On July 22, 2010, President Barack Obama signed Wall Street reform legislation, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which {{included}} a provision to exempt the SEC from FOIA requests by the public. Aguirre used FOIA requests to obtain records relating to why his SEC superiors had stymied his Pequot investigation, charges which prompted two U.S. Senate committees to investigate. The documents, released against {{the wishes of the}} SEC, led to the discovery of evidence that resulted in a large settlement. Aguirre was the first to speak out about the exemptions and a letter by Congressman Darrell Issa to Mary Schapiro, chairman of the SEC relied heavily on his article, [...] "The Dodd-Frank Act: A FOIA Exemption for SEC Misconduct?" [...] from Wall Street Lawyer. Congressional testimony by the Project on Government Oversight at a hearing on legislative proposals to address the problem referred to Aguirre's case {{as an example of the}} crucial need for <b>public</b> <b>oversight</b> of government agencies. Aguirre said the new bill would block public access to the SEC's records and hamper oversight. Other critics called the bill a [...] "backroom deal" [...] between the SEC and the U.S. Congress to cover up SEC failures.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008 {{there was}} {{implemented}} the Federal Law ‘On <b>Public</b> <b>Oversight</b> of Human Rights in Places of Detention and Assistance to Persons in Places of Detention’. In {{line with the}} Law the Civic Chamber coordinates the work on creation of public watchdog committees in the RF entities. Adoption of the Federal Law ‘On Basic Principles of <b>Public</b> <b>Oversight</b> in the Russian Federation’ in July 2014 became a significant milestone and recognition of the Civic Chamber performance efficiency.The Federal Law establishes the legal framework for organising and carrying out <b>public</b> <b>oversight,</b> its goals and objectives, principles and forms, as well as procedures and methods for determining and disclosing its results.The Law stipulates the right of citizens and public organisations to engage in carrying out <b>public</b> <b>oversight,</b> and sets forth subjects and objects of <b>public</b> <b>oversight,</b> their legal status, rights and responsibilities, and forms of cooperation. The Law enables Russian citizens to exercise their right to participate in managing state affairs, {{in accordance with the}} Constitution of the Russian Federation (Article 32). <b>Public</b> <b>oversight</b> is being increasingly approached as a platform for dialogue between civil society and public authorities. By encouraging search for solution to social problems <b>public</b> <b>oversight</b> provides rise of both civil activism and social responsibility. Public councils within ministries and agencies are permanent advisory and consultative bodies of <b>public</b> <b>oversight.</b> They are designed to ensure cooperation between citizens of Russia and bodies of federal, regional and local power {{to take into account the}} requirements and interests of citizens, to protect their rights and freedoms in developing and implementing state policy. Public councils are aimed at monitoring activities of federal executive authorities, including public procurement. Public councils have been established at 53 federal bodies of power (e.a. Federal Security Service, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Internal Affairs).In 2015 the Civic Chamber and Russian Governmental Expert Council introduced a new procedure for establishment of councils, with 75% of public councils members to be nominated by the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation and the rest 25% by the Russian Governmental Expert Council. Such proportion provides a reasonable balance between representatives of civic organisations and expert community. Public expert examination is considered to be one of the key instruments of <b>public</b> <b>oversight.</b> According to the law, public expert examination is an analysis and assessment of acts and decisions made by central and local authorities, inspection of documentation with regard to compliance with legislation, human and civil rights and freedoms, rights and legitimate interests of non-governmental, non-profit organizations (NGOs and NPOs). Over the past ten years the Civic Chamber examined more than 500 draft laws relating to various spheres - from state-building to family and childhood support. Most expert examinations contain proposals and additions to draft laws. As stated before, the Civic Chamber’s conclusions and proposals serve as recommendations.In 2014 the Civic Chamber tried a new approach to expert examination - the so called ‘zero readings’ of draft normative legal acts as a part of improvement of lawmaking process. In other words, ‘zero readings’ mean public participation not only in the assessment of prepared draft documents, but also contribution to the creation of draft documents, i.e. discussion of conceptual basis, formulation of basic ideas. ‘Zero readings’ encourage open dialogue between civil society and authorities. Accepted by society, ‘zero readings’ became a regular fixture of the Civic Chamber. In 2014 there were held over 20 ‘zero readings’, taking part in which were experts in economic and social spheres. In 2015 the number has doubled, which is evidence of a demand for this initiative.To conclude, the examination activities of the Civic Chamber aim at accommodation of socially important interests of the RF citizens, NGOs, public and local authorities.|$|E
