Some gave away pets, others just released them, many <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>down.</b> Some gave away furniture and belongings, some gave it to someone for safe storage, others simply walked away, leaving dirty {{dishes in the sink}} and food on the table. The withdrawal of cash from banks was limited to £20 per person. People could take just one suitcase.|$|E
25|$|The Forty Years' War (1385–1424) with Hanthawaddy left Ava exhausted, and {{its power}} plateaued. Its kings {{regularly}} faced rebellions in its vassal regions but {{were able to}} <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>down</b> until the 1480s. In the late 15th century, the Prome Kingdom and its Shan States successfully broke away, {{and in the early}} 16th century, Ava itself came under attacks from its former vassals. In 1510, Taungoo also broke away. In 1527, the Confederation of Shan States led by Mohnyin captured Ava. The Confederation's rule of Upper Burma, though lasted until 1555, was marred by internal fighting between Mohnyin and Thibaw houses. The kingdom was toppled by Taungoo forces in 1555.|$|E
25|$|John {{returned}} to Barcelona triumphant, {{but failed to}} raise the necessary funds. In the summer of 1474 the French conquered Roussillon and March 1475 Perpignan fell to them. The French raided the Empordà as far as Girona in 1476, and John, his allies tied up by their own wars, could not even oppose them. In October 1478 he ceded the two provinces to France until he could redeem them with cash. Revolts against his authority flared in Aragon and Valencia, which had {{stayed out of the}} civil war, and he failed to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>down.</b> He did succeed in quashing a revolt in Sardinia.|$|E

500|$|The {{speed and}} {{facility}} with which Dylan wrote topical songs {{attracted the attention}} of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as [...] "the most prolific songwriter on the scene" [...] and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, [...] "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End." [...] Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan said, [...] "The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just waiting for someone to write them down. I just <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>down</b> on paper. If I didn't do it, somebody else would." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Sonic Youth albums, Washing Machine {{was recorded}} at Easley Studios in Memphis, where indie rock bands like Pavement, Guided by Voices and Grifters previously recorded albums. Moore remarked that {{the atmosphere in}} Memphis [...] "lent itself to avoiding {{the reality of the}} record-buying public. In the past we were always very aware of who was out there checking us out. This was the first record where we've gotten this certain level of notoriety and we were just, like, 'fuck it. He also felt that Washing Machine was conceived and recorded like some of the band's earlier albums: [...] "It hearkens back to records like Sister where we'd write a bunch of songs, go into the studio for a month, <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>down,</b> then go on the road and play them for a year. By {{the end of the year}} they'd mutate into something much more excited". Gordon credited Memphis for its relaxed atmosphere and cited the album as one of her favorites.|$|E

Following the 200-meter freestyle race Spitz arrived to obtain his gold medal barefoot and carrying his shoes.

[...] After the anthem played, {{he picked up his}} shoes and waved to the crowd. [...] The Soviets saw this as product placement.

2500|$|In April 2008, {{the band}} Inhabited {{mentioned}} BarlowGirl in an [...] "uncensored" [...] remix of its [...] "Hush" [...] single.

The remix, {{which was a}} free download, included lyrics such as [...] "We're gonna beat that system in a round about way / Won't make sucky music so my records will play" [...] and [...] "Something more like BarlowGirl, do something right / Ain’t got nothing against ‘em but it just ain’t me", causing controversy in the Christian music community. Inhabited responded by saying: [...] "it wasn't to bash or <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>down,</b> it just says our art is a different style.

2500|$|Feral parrot flocks can {{be formed}} after mass escapes of newly imported, wild-caught parrots from {{airports}} or quarantine facilities. Large groups of escapees have {{the protection of}} a flock and possess the skills to survive and breed in the wild. Some feral parakeets may have descended from escaped zoo birds. Escaped or released pets rarely contribute to establishing feral populations. Escapes typically involve only {{one or a few}} birds at a time, so the birds do not have the protection of a flock and often do not have a mate. Most captive-born birds do not possess the necessary survival skills to find food or avoid predators and often do not survive long without human caretakers. However, in areas where there are existing feral parrot populations, escaped pets may sometimes successfully join these flocks. The most common era or years that feral parrots were released to non-native environments was from the 1890s to the 1940s, during the wild-caught parrot era. In the psittacosis [...] "parrot fever" [...] panic of 1930, a city health commissioner urged everyone who owned a parrot to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>down,</b> but owners abandoned their parrots on the streets.|$|E

Goto declares war against Bejo and Uco, and Reza too. When his son Keichi interjects, Goto responds [...] "They're not cops anymore. They're in my world now." [...] A bleeding and exhausted Eka tells Rama [...] "I know where you're from," [...] revealing he too was undercover. Voicing his disillusionment on the harsh realities of crime in Jakarta, [...] "There's no end to this [...] If you want out, you <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>down,</b> all of them." [...] Later at night, Rama calls Lt. Bunawar, who informs him the gang war had escalated, with even the police commissioner shot dead. Bunawar claims Eka [...] "went rogue" [...] and [...] "cost the lives of 10 honest cops when he fed us bad intel." [...] He informs him that Reza, the true objective, is meeting Bejo and Uco at the restaurant. Rama breaches the restaurant warehouse fighting his way through Bejo's men.|$|E
2500|$|Game Informer {{said that}} [...] "while {{most people will}} rave about Rage's technology, this game's most {{impressive}} component is its gunplay... the mutated hostiles of the wastes... crawl out of the woodwork, scamper along walls, and {{create a sense of}} absolute terror", and [...] "the challenge posed to the player is to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>down</b> quickly or pray that every close range shotgun blast takes a large chunk of flesh." [...] The soundtrack was described as [...] "appropriately moody", and the animation system {{as one of the most}} [...] "impressive" [...] ever made. However, the review also argued that [...] "the driving sections are no more than optional diversions" [...] and [...] "the lack of content in the overworld is disappointing". In conclusion, the story and overworld were described as [...] "dated", but the [...] "pulse-pounding gunplay" [...] was hailed as [...] "a nice change of pace" [...] that [...] "stands out in a crowded market". IGN praised the game's graphics, calling them some of the best ever, but criticized the game's story and forgettable characters. In Japan, where the game was ported on October 6, 2011 (the same release date as Australia's), Famitsu gave the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions a score of two nines, one eight, and one nine for a total of 35 out of 40.|$|E

2500|$|The boys run out {{to watch}} the {{carnival}} arrive {{at three in the}} morning. As the train pulls in, the smoke billows in circles and solidifies as the carnival. Mr. Holloway talks about this time of night as [...] "soul's midnight," [...] when men are closest to death, locked in the depths of despair. The boys go the next day to explore the carnival and they encounter their seventh grade teacher, Miss Foley, who is dazed after visiting the Mirror Maze. Jim insists on coming back that night and Will agrees, but when they bump into the lightning-rod salesman's bag, they realize that they must stay to learn what happens after dark. After investigating all of the rides, they go up to a carousel. Mr. Cooger suddenly grabs Will and Jim after they climb up on horses and he informs them the merry-go-round is broken. Another man arrives and tells him to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>down,</b> introducing himself as Mr. Dark and tells them the huge man's name is Mr. Cooger. Mr. Dark pays attention only to Jim, who is enthralled by what he sees. He then tells the boys to come back the next day and offers them passes to the carousel.
