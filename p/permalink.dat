If a website embedded a tweet onto one of their stories, the tweet will show the websites that mentioned the tweet. This feature was added onto Twitter so if the viewer doesn't understand what the tweet means, they can click on the sites to read more about what the person is talking about.|$|E

25|$|Permalinks {{frequently}} {{consist of}} a string of characters that represent the date and time of posting, and an identifier that denotes the author who initially authored the item or its subject. Crucially, if an item is changed, renamed, or moved within the internal database, its <b>permalink</b> remains unaltered, as it functions as a magic cookie that references an internal database identifier. If an item is deleted altogether, its <b>permalink</b> can frequently not be reused.|$|E

25|$|The main {{differences}} in the concepts are about domain name and time scale: PURL uses an independent (preserved) domain name, and is about decades; <b>permalink</b> is about years, and usually {{does not change the}} URL's domain.|$|E
25|$|An {{entry in}} a blog with many entries is {{accessible}} from the site's front page {{for only a}} short time. Visitors who store the URL for a particular entry often find upon their return that the desired content {{has been replaced by}} something new. Prominently posting permalinks is a method employed by bloggers to encourage visitors to store a more long-lived URL (the <b>permalink)</b> for reference.|$|E
25|$|A <b>permalink</b> or {{permanent}} link is a URL that {{is intended to}} remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding a hyperlink that is less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, {{so as to be}} easy for people to type and remember. Most modern blogging and content-syndication software systems support such links. Sometimes URL shortening is used to create them.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>permalink</b> {{is a type}} of {{persistent}} identifier and the word <b>permalink</b> is sometimes used as a synonym {{of persistent}} identifier. More often, though, <b>permalink</b> is applied to persistent identifiers which are generated by a content management system for pages served by that system. This usage is especially common in the blogosphere. Such links are not maintained by an outside authority, and their persistence is dependent on the durability of the content management system itself.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{blogging}} {{and content}} management systems {{do not support}} versioning of content, that is, if an entry is updated, a uniquely accessible version is not created. [...] Thus, {{in the context of}} these systems, a <b>permalink</b> may refer to different content over time. [...] In the context of systems that support versioning, such as most wikis, a <b>permalink</b> is commonly understood as a link to a specific version. Here, both the link itself and the resource it refers to should not change over time.|$|E

2500|$|One cited {{early use}} of the term <b>permalink</b> in its current sense was by Jason Kottke on March 5, 2000, in a post titled: [...] "Finally. Did you notice the". [...] Matt Haughey had {{discussed}} a <b>permalink</b> style feature with Blogger co-founders Evan Williams and Paul Bausch the previous weekend, and Bausch had pointed out that it was technically feasible to produce permanent links in Blogger, using a feature (written by him) that allowed the ID of a post to be placed in a Blogger template. [...] In response to Kottke's blog, on March 6, 2000, Matt Haughey posted the technical details on his own weblog, which helped open the way to widespread adoption.|$|E
2500|$|Permalinks {{are usually}} denoted by text link (i.e. [...] "Permalink" [...] or [...] "Link to this Entry"), but {{sometimes}} a symbol may be used.

50|$|The {{design of}} Blosxom is minimalist. It is {{distributed}} {{as a single}} Perl script, and all configuration is done by editing this script. All of the weblog entries are stored as plain text files consisting of a headline, optional headers or meta-information (if using certain plugins), and a blank line followed by the post body. New display styles can be added by creating template files called flavours. Blosxom can operate as a CGI script or produce static HTML files. By default, Blosxom supports showing recent posts, doing content categorization, content retrieval by date (and <b>permalinking</b> based on that), and RSS feeds. It can be extended with dozens of available plugins.|$|R
