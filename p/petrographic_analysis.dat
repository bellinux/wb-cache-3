However many of them can be complex and more expensive than <b>petrographic</b> image <b>analysis.</b> In the oil industry, it is a common practice to use the indirect methods such as well-logs and seismic to identify rock properties like porosity and permeability.

For that reason, the main objective of this project is to assess the efficiency and precision of <b>petrographic</b> image <b>analysis</b> to provide useful data for petrophysics studies.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the mineralogical {{composition}} and pore geometry of sediments on the distribution {{as well as the}} flow of immiscible fluids are of importance when evaluating petroleum reservoirs. Greensand containing the clay mineral glauconite is a complex reservoir rock type. Evaluation of greensand reservoirs can be problematic due to the ductile and micro-porous nature of glauconite. The objectives of this work are to evaluate the feasibility of neutron transmission methods to be used for core analysis and to evaluate to what extent composition and pore geometry affect fluid distribution and fluid flow. Greensand samples from different locations were investigated by means of core analysis, determining fluid saturations and flow properties. Neutron transmission methods were used to resolve the spatial distribution of variations in fluid saturations. The mineralogical composition and pore geometry were determined by petrographical studies and image analysis. This work shows that neutron transmission analyses utilising fast neutrons can be used for determining fluid saturations. Analyses utilising thermal neutrons can resolve the spatial distribution of fluids in two and three dimensions. The mineralogy and pore geometry clearly have an effect on fluid distribution and flow. Most of the irreducible bound water is found within the pores of glauconite and other clay minerals. The non-wetting oil is situated in the intergranular pore space and a weak link between residual saturation and clustering of large pores was found. The image porosity determined by <b>petrographic</b> image <b>analysis</b> represents the effective porosity. The absolute permeability can successfully be estimated using the Kozeny equation and data from <b>petrographic</b> image <b>analysis.</b> Relative permeability and immiscible fluid displacement characteristics were related to pore geometry determined by <b>petrographic</b> image <b>analysis.</b> To sum up the work, it shows that conventional core analyses (gas porosity and permeability) on glauconitic reservoir rocks should be complemented with petrographical studies and image analysis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was first to develop a method by which a {{detailed}} porosity classification system could be utilized to understand the relationship between pore/pore-throat geometry, genetic porosity type, and facies. Additionally, this study investigated the relationships between pore/pore-throat geometry, petrophysical parameters, and reservoir performance characteristics. This study focused on the Jurassic Smackover reservoir rocks of Grayson field, Columbia County, Arkansas. This three part study developed an adapted genetic carbonate pore type classification system, through which the Grayson reservoir rocks were uniquely categorized by a percent-factor, describing the effect of diagenetic events on the preservation of original depositional texture, and a second factor describing if the most significant diagenetic event resulted in porosity enhancement or reduction. The second part used <b>petrographic</b> image <b>analysis</b> and mercury-injection capillary pressure tests to calculate pore/pore-throat sizes. From these data sets pore/pore-throat sizes were compared to facies, pore type, and each other showing that pore-throat size is controlled by pore type and that pore size is controlled primarily by facies. When compared with each other, a pore size range can be estimated if the pore type and the median pore-throat aperture are known. Capillary pressure data was also used to understand the behavior of the dependent rock properties (porosity, permeability, and wettability), and it was determined that size-reduced samples, regardless of facies, tend to show similar dependent rock property behavior, but size-enhanced samples show dispersion. Finally, capillary pressure data was used to understand fluid flow behavior of pore types and facies. Oncolitic grainstone samples show unpredictable fluid flow behavior compared to oolitic grainstone samples, yet oncolitic grainstone samples will move a higher percentage of fluid. Size-enhanced samples showed heterogeneous fluid flow behavior while the size-reduced samples could be grouped by the number of modes of pore-throat sizes. Finally, this study utilized <b>petrographic</b> image <b>analysis</b> to determine if 2 - dimensional porosity values could be calculated and compared to porosity values from 3 -dimensional porosity techniques. The complex, heterogeneous pore network found in the Grayson reservoir rocks prevents the use of <b>petrographic</b> image <b>analysis</b> as a porosity calculation technique...|$|R
