Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. So far, the calculation of averages for different dose ranges has not been done for <b>plant</b> sterols and <b>stanols</b> separately. The objective of the present meta-analysis {{was to investigate the}} combined and separate effects of <b>plant</b> sterols and <b>stanols</b> when classified into different dose ranges. Studies were searched and selected based on predefined criteria. Relevant data were extracted. Average LDL-cholesterol effects were calculated when studies were categorised by dose, according to random-effects models while using the variance as weighing factor. This was done for <b>plant</b> sterols and <b>stanols</b> combined and separately. In total, 124 studies (201 strata) were included. <b>Plant</b> sterols and <b>stanols</b> were administered in 129 and fifty-nine strata, respect-ively; the remaining used a mix of both.

50|$|Increasing fiber {{consumption}} {{has been}} shown to reduce levels of LDL cholesterol. Each gram of increase in soluble fiber reduces LDL by an average of 2.2 mg/dL (0.057 mmol/L). Increasing consumption of whole grains reduces LDL cholesterol, with whole grain oats being particularly effective. The inclusion of 2 g per day of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> or sterol esters and 10 to 20 g per day of soluble fiber decrease dietary cholesterol absorption. A diet high in fructose can raise LDL cholesterol levels in the blood.|$|E
50|$|The {{equivalent}} {{ability and}} safety of plant sterols and plant stanols to lower cholesterol {{continues to be a}} hotly debated topic. Plant sterols and stanols, when compared head to head in clinical trials, have been shown to equally reduce cholesterol levels. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized, controlled trials comparing plant sterols to plant stanols directly at doses of 0.6 to 2.5 g/day showed no difference between the two forms on total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglyceride levels. Trials looking at high doses (> 4 g/day) of plant sterols or stanols are very limited, and none have yet to be completed comparing the same high dose of plant sterol to <b>plant</b> <b>stanol.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>stanols</b> {{are present}} in small amounts in human diet. Their main sources are whole-grain foods, mostly wheat and rye. The daily intake of stanols in the average western diet is about 60 mg/d, whereas the intake of plant sterols is about 150-300 mg/d and that of {{cholesterol}} is 500-800 mg/d. The relatively low natural levels of stanols in the diet are too low {{to have a significant}} effect on serum cholesterol levels.|$|R
50|$|The {{intake of}} {{naturally}} occurring phytosterols ranges between ~200-300 mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets {{have been produced}} yielding upwards of 700 mg/day. The most commonly occurring phytosterols in the human diet are β-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol, which account for about 65%, 30% and 3% of diet contents, respectively. The most common <b>plant</b> <b>stanols</b> in the human diet are sitostanol and campestanol, which combined make up about 5% of dietary phytosterol.|$|R
40|$|High serum LDL {{cholesterol}} {{concentration is}} a major risk factor for cardiovascular complications. This risk can be lowered by diet. In this respect foods containing <b>plant</b> sterol or <b>stanol</b> esters can be useful for mildly- and hypercholesteraemic subjects. <b>Plant</b> sterols and <b>stanols,</b> which are structurally related to cholesterol, decrease the incorporation of dietary and biliary cholesterol into micelles. This lowers cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, these components increase ABC-transporter expression, which may {{also contribute to the}} decreased cholesterol absorption. Consequently, cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor activity increase, which ultimately leads to decreased serum LDL cholesterol concentrations. Animal studies have further shown that these dietary components may also lower atherosclerotic lesion development. <b>Plant</b> sterols and <b>stanols</b> also lower plasma lipid-standardized concentrations of the hydrocarbon carotenoids, but not those of the oxygenated cartenoids and tocopherols. Also, vitamin A and D concentrations are not affected. Although absorption of <b>plant</b> sterols and <b>stanols</b> (0. 02 - 3. 5 %) is low compared to cholesterol (35 - 70 %), small amounts are found in the circulation and may influence other physiological functions. However, there is no consistent evidence that <b>plant</b> sterols or <b>stanols</b> can change the risk of colon or prostate cancer, or immune status. In conclusion, <b>plant</b> sterols and <b>stanols</b> effectively reduce serum LDL cholesterol and atherosclerotic risk. In addition potential effects of <b>plant</b> sterols and <b>stanols</b> on other metabolic processes remain to be elucidated. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester {{margarine}} Benecol ® is {{a functional}} food {{that has been}} shown to lower effectively serum total and LDL-cholesterol. The purpose of this post-marketing study is to characterize users of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine with and without cardiovascular disease. Methods A cohort of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine users was established based on a compilation of 15 surveys conducted by the National Public Health Institute in Finland between 1996 – 2000. There were 29 772 subjects aged 35 – 84 years in the cohort. The users of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine were identified by the type of bread spread used. Results The <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine was used as bread spread by 1332 (4. 5 %) subjects. Almost half (46 %) of the users reported a history of cardiovascular disease. Persons with cardiovascular disease were more likely to use <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine (8 %) than persons without cardiovascular disease (3 %). Users with and without cardiovascular disease seemed to share similar characteristics. In particular, they were elderly people with otherwise healthy life-styles and diet. They were less likely smokers, more likely physically active and less likely obese than nonusers. The users reported being in good or average health in general and having used cholesterol-lowering drugs.

40|$|Abstract Objective: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the consistency of use of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine and to characterise consistent and inconsistent users. Design: A cohort of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine users was established based on 14 national surveys conducted by the National Public Health Institute in Finland between 1996 and 1999. A follow-up study questionnaire was developed and sent to 1294 users in 2000. Setting: Subjects who reported using <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine in both the original survey and the follow-up study were classified as consistent users, and the rest as inconsistent users. Subjects: The study population consisted of 1094 subjects aged 18 - 87 years, 590 men and 504 women. Results: There were 357 (33 %) consistent and 737 (67 %) inconsistent users of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine in the study population. Consistent users {{were more likely to be}} men and to have a higher household income than inconsistent users. Both consistent and inconsistent users were predominantly middle-aged persons with a healthy lifestyle and diet as well as a history of cardiovascular disease. Healthfulness was the main factor affecting bread spread choice among 94 % of the consistent users and 59 % of the inconsistent users. Conclusions: The use of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine is more often inconsistent than consistent. There is nevertheless a relatively large subgroup of long-term users of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> ester margarine.

40|$|Plant sterols {{may induce}} a Th 1 shift in humans. However, whether <b>plant</b> <b>stanols</b> have similar effects {{as well as}} the {{underlying}} mechanism are unknown. We have now shown that (like sitosterol) sitostanol, both 4 -desmethylsterols, induces a Th 1 shift when added in vitro at physiological concentrations to human PBMCs. This conclusion was based on a higher IFNγ production, with no change in the production of IL- 4 and IL- 10. α-Amyrin, a 4. 4 -dimethylsterol, had comparable effects. Because 4. 4 -dimethylsterols cannot activate transcription factor LXR, this finding indicates that LXR activation was not involved. Sitosterol and sitostanol did not alter the production of IL- 12 and IL- 18 in PBMCs as well as in monocyte-derived U 937 cells, suggesting that plant sterols directly affect T-helper cells, without activating APCs. However, in PBMCs treated with a TLR 2 blocker (T 2. 5), IFNγ production was completely inhibited, whereas blocking TLR 4 with HTA 125 had no such effect. To confirm these findings, PBMCs from TLR 2 −/− mice were cultured in the presence of sitosterol and sitostanol. In these cells, no Th 1 shift was observed.

40|$|Abstract Phytosterols are {{bioactive}} compounds {{found in}} foods of plant origin, {{which can be}} divided into plant sterols and <b>plant</b> <b>stanols.</b> Clinical studies consistently indicate that the intake of phytosterols (2 g/day) is associated with a significant reduction (8 - 10 %) in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol). Thus, several guidelines recommend the intake of 2 g/day of <b>plant</b> sterols and/or <b>stanols</b> in order to reduce LDL-cholesterol levels. As the typical western diet contains only about 300 mg/day of phytosterols, foods enriched with phytosterols are usually used to achieve the recommended intake. Although phytosterols decrease LDL-cholesterol levels, {{there is no evidence that}} they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases; on the contrary, some studies suggest an increased risk of atherosclerosis with increasing serum levels of phytosterols.
