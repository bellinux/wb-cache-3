The People’s Party (PL) garnered 88.56% or 31,123 of the vote. The <b>Popular</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Movement</b> (PDM) earned about 10.89% or 3,828 of the vote. Independent candidates garnered only 194 votes, all from one district, which accounted for 0.55% of the vote. These percentages are calculated out {{of the total number of}} valid votes cast. There were 16,447 invalid votes cast out of 51,592 total votes cast. This means that only 68.12% of votes cast were valid. Voter turnout was 74.3% of 69,480 registered voters. The PL won in all 25 districts, giving them every directly elected seat. Because they won such a large percentage of the total vote, they also won all 6 proportionally allocated seats. After the 2011 election, the PL controlled all 31 seats in the National Assembly.|$|E
40|$|Jon Mee {{explores the}} <b>popular</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>movement</b> {{that emerged in}} the London of the 1790 s in {{response}} to the French Revolution. Central to the movement’s achievement was the creation of an idea of ‘the people’ brought into being through print and publicity.

They were sustained by a faith in the press as a form of ‘print magic,’ but confidence in the liberating potential of the printing press was interwoven with hard-headed deliberations over how best to animate and represent the people. Ideas of disinterested rational debate were thrown into the mix with coruscating satire, rousing songs, and republican toasts. Print personality became a vital interface between readers and print exploited by the cast of radicals returned to history in vivid detail by Print, Publicity, and Popular Radicalism. A revisionary account, by a leading scholar, of the turbulent decade of the 1790 s, during which radical ideas spread to Britain from revolutionary France and were circulated and popularised in new ways.

After a motion of censure voted by the parliament on 4 October 1962, de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and held new elections. Although the left progressed, the Gaullists won an increased majority—this despite opposition from the Christian <b>democratic</b> <b>Popular</b> Republican <b>Movement</b> (MRP) and the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP) who criticised de Gaulle's euroscepticism and presidentialism.|$|R

Following the war, a large majority of Popular Democrats joined the Christian <b>democratic</b> <b>Popular</b> Republican <b>Movement,</b> which had its roots in the resistance movement.

This alliance installed the main elements of the French welfare state and the French Fourth Republic, {{but it did not}} survive the Cold War. In May 1947, the Socialist Prime Minister Paul Ramadier dismissed the Communist ministers. Blum proposed the construction of a Third Force with the centre-left and the centre-right, against the Gaullists and the Communists.

50|$|Author of the L'Appel of 18 June 1940, {{and founder}} {{and leader of}} the Free French Forces, General Charles de Gaulle is the symbol of the French Resistance to the Nazi {{occupation}} and the Vichy government. Yet, based in London, then in Algiers, he was forced to compromise with the domestic Resistance movements dominated by various political forces (such as the Communists). In 1944, while France was liberated, De Gaulle presided over the provisional government composed of Communists, Socialists, and Christian Democrats. Because De Gaulle refused to create a great political party unifying the non-Communist Resistance, a lot of parties re-emerged. The Christian <b>democratic</b> <b>Popular</b> Republican <b>Movement</b> (MRP) seemed to be the closest to De Gaulle.|$|R

It advocated an economic policy inspired by the programme of the National Council of Resistance: the creation of a Welfare State, and the nationalization of banks and major industrial companies (such as Renault). The opposition was composed of the parties which had dominated the pre-war governments of the Third Republic: the Radical Party and the classical Right.|$|R

This alliance between the three political parties lasted until the May 1947 crisis during which Maurice Thorez, vice-premier, and four other Communist ministers were expelled from the government, both in France and in Italy.

As Mayor he relied on {{the support of the}} non-Gaullist center-right in the municipal assembly.

Before the 1965 presidential election, L'Express published an identikit of the best center-left candidate under the name of [...] "Mister X". It corresponded with Defferre's profile (L'Express co-founder Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber being a well known advocate of a Third Force alliance of socialists, Christian democrats and Radicals). But, failing to create an SFIO-MRP-Radical Party federation, he gave way to François Mitterrand, whose preferred strategy for the Socialists was the formation of a left-wing coalition including the PCF. His political career was strongly supported by members of the Corsican mafia; e.g. Guérini-clan.|$|R
