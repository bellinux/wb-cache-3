40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} interest on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its wild lifestyle {{is far from}} being completely understood, {{with one of the most}} resounding examples being its sexual attitude. We show that the intestine of social wasps favors the mating of Saccharomyces strains by providing a succession of environmental conditions prompting sporulation and germination. We also demonstrate that the insect intestine favors hybridization of S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus. Although S. paradoxus survives in wild environments and rarely mates with S. cerevisiae, we discover that two European S. paradoxus strains cannot survive the wasp's intestinal environment but can be rescued through interspecific hybridization with S. cerevisiae. These findings are introducing insects as environmental alcoves in which yeast cells can meet and mate.

40|$|Life-history theory {{predicts that}} {{nutrition}} influences lifespan owing to trade-offs between allocating resources to reproduction, growth and repair. Despite occasional reports that early diet has strong effects on lifespan, {{it is unclear}} whether this prediction is generally supported by empirical studies. We conducted a meta-analysis across experimental studies manipulating pre- or post-natal diet and measuring longevity. We found no overall effect of early diet on lifespan. We used meta-regression, considering moderator variables based on experimental and life-history traits, to test predictions regarding the strength and direction of effects that could lead to positive or negative effects. Pre-natal diet manipulations reduced lifespan, but there were no effects of later diet, manipulation type, development mode, or sex. The results are consistent with the prediction that early diet restriction disrupts growth and results in increased somatic damage, which incurs lifespan costs. Our findings raise a cautionary note, however, for placing too strong an emphasis on early diet effects on lifespan and highlight limitations of measuring these effects under laboratory conditions.

40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the main features of the automobile sector in Southern Italy, and particularly of the industries allied to car manufacturing linked to Fiat Auto. Historically, the dependence of Southern factories on those producing components within Turin allied industries has represented a strict limit to the growth of an auto-qualified allied sector and to the set-up of an automotive supply chain in the Mezzogiorno. Such limits, although nowadays vehicle production is mostly concentrated in the Mezzogiorno factories, still remain, while a large part of components production is concentrated in Northern regions, specifically the highest value added production and most export-oriented. In turn, components production enterprises in the South of Italy regions, besides substantially depending on national or foreign enterprises that have their decision making offices elsewhere, report a very low export-propensity, have single-client relationships with Fiat, and few feedbacks on R&D activities. If we consider that suppliers carry out the 70 % of a vehicle as for projecting and producing, and {{that they are going to}} play a more relevant role as for innovation, given the general relevance of car sector in the Mezzogiorno, we suggest that certain means of sustainability could be useful, within a wider context of industrial policies: for instance, these policies could consider these enterprises and local ones too, within the perspective of a new <b>programme</b> <b>agreement</b> able to really promote the set-up of an automotive supply chain in the Mezzogiorno...|$|E
30|$|These {{experiments}} mostly concern {{regional or}} provincial administrative centres, {{and are usually}} adopted as variations shortly after the approval of territorial, landscape or local general plans. At the same time, the settlement estimates of general planning, keep functioning on their own separate track, seldom reviewed or curtailed, as an unchallenged safeguard for the coincidence of land-ownership and building rights. This condition is increased by a widespread recourse to equalization, and upheld by open-ended terms of intended use—while those of public-service standard areas expire after 5  years. An instance can be observed by comparing the actual history {{of the city of}} Milan since the adoption of the Milano 2000 plan with a Territorial Zoning Plan that estimated a demographic growth equal to the whole population of Brescia, {{while at the same time}} reviving the urban plans for the junctions in the railway links. Also bound to affect the situation are the further building volumes envisaged by the <b>programme</b> <b>agreement</b> approved in July 2017, about the former railway yards. These areas will be added to the (slightly smaller) renovation and densification actions laid down in the current plan variation. Since the early 2000 s, several consecutive City authorities have negotiated this course of action, on a project-by-project basis, often restating some commendable objectives, such as that of allocating at least 50 % of the renewal areas as green areas. However, no stage of this process has provided an overall quantitative and qualitative assessment of the green areas that should allow for a greater soil permeability and uninterrupted green urban corridors.|$|E

40|$|Journal articleTERT-locus SNPs and {{leukocyte}} telomere {{measures are}} reportedly associated with risks of multiple cancers. Using the Illumina custom genotyping array iCOGs, we analyzed ~ 480 SNPs at the TERT locus in breast (n = 103, 991), ovarian (n = 39, 774) and BRCA 1 mutation carrier (n = 11, 705) cancer cases and controls. Leukocyte telomere measurements were also available for 53, 724 participants. Most associations cluster into three independent peaks. The minor allele {{at the peak}} 1 SNP rs 2736108 associates with longer telomeres (P = 5. 8 Ã 10 !- 7), lower risks for estrogen receptor (ER) -negative (P = 1. 0 Ã 10 !- 8) and BRCA 1 mutation carrier (P = 1. 1 Ã 10 !- 5) breast cancers and altered promoter assay signal. The minor allele at the peak 2 SNP rs 7705526 associates with longer telomeres (P = 2. 3 Ã 10 !- 14), higher risk of low-malignant-potential ovarian cancer (P = 1. 3 Ã 10 !- 15) and greater promoter activity. The minor alleles at the peak 3 SNPs rs 10069690 and rs 2242652 increase ER-negative (P = 1. 2 Ã 10 !- 12) and BRCA 1 mutation carrier (P = 1. 6 Ã 10 !- 14) breast and invasive ovarian (P = 1. 3 Ã 10 !- 11) cancer risks but not via altered telomere length.

40|$|Introduction: Public health research, at {{population}} and organizational level, {{needs to be}} identified independently within 'health' research from biomedicine and life sciences. In PHIRE (Public Health Innovation and Research in Europe), we investigated the extent and character of public health research calls and programmes in European countries. METHODS: Country respondents, identified through national member associations of the European Public Health Association completed a standardized recording instrument. Public health research was defined, and the call period limited to the latest full year (2010). Of the 30 countries included (EU 27 plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland), there were reports for 25 countries A simple classification of the calls was developed. RESULTS: There were 75 calls and programmes included. Of these, 41 (55 %) together were in France and the UK, and 34 in a further 14 countries, while 9 countries reported there were no calls or programmes opened in 2010. Calls were categorized across diseases, behaviours, determinants, services and methodologies. Some calls were broad, while others-particularly in the countries with several calls-were more detailed towards specific issues. Levels of funding varied markedly and were difficult to define. Where stated, in 32 responses, 19 calls were only open to national applicants and 13 from abroad. CONCLUSIONS: Most European countries have competitive programmes and calls relevant for public health research, but they are poorly identified. Only a minority of countries present {{a wide range of}} topics and specific fields. Effort is needed to develop classifications for public health programmes and calls for public health research, improve information (including financial) collection to enable systematic comparisons and build greater recognition of public health research within research communities, with national and European research funding organizations, and for practitioners and policymakers.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Springer Nature via the DOI in this record. Connectivity is an {{important}} component of metapopulation dynamics in marine systems and can influence population persistence, migration rates and conservation decisions associated with Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). In this study, we compared the genetic diversity, gene flow and population structure of two octocoral species, Eunicella verrucosa and Alcyonium digitatum, in the northeast Atlantic (ranging from the northwest of Ireland and the southern North Sea, to southern Portugal), using two panels of thirteen and eight microsatellite loci, respectively. Our results identified regional genetic structure in E. verrucosa partitioned between populations from southern Portugal, northwest Ireland, and Britain/France; subsequent hierarchical analysis of population structure also indicated reduced gene flow between southwest Britain and northwest France. However, over a similar geographical area, A. digitatum showed little evidence of population structure, suggesting high gene flow and/or a large effective population size; indeed, the only significant genetic differentiation detected in A. digitatum occurred between North Sea samples and those from the English Channel/northeast Atlantic. In both species the vast majority of gene flow originated from sample sites within regions, with populations in southwest Britain being the predominant source of contemporary exogenous genetic variants for the populations studied. Unsurprisingly, historical patterns of gene flow appeared more complex, though again southwest Britain appeared an important source of genetic variation for both species. Our findings have major conservation implications, particularly for E. verrucosa, a protected species in UK waters and listed by the IUCN as ‘Vulnerable’, and for the designation and management of European MPAs.

40|$|Abstract Background Glaucoma is {{a leading}} cause of blindness. Early {{detection}} is advocated but there is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to inform health policy on population screening. Primarily, there is no agreed screening intervention. For a screening <b>programme,</b> <b>agreement</b> is required on the screening tests to be used, either individually or in combination, the person to deliver the test and the location where testing should take place. This study aimed to use ophthalmologists (who were experienced glaucoma subspecialists), optometrists, ophthalmic nurses and patients to develop a reduced set of potential screening tests and testing arrangements that could then be explored in depth in a further study of their feasibility for evaluation in a glaucoma screening RCT. Methods A two-round Delphi survey involving 38 participants was conducted. Materials were developed from a prior evidence synthesis. For round one, after some initial priming questions in four domains, specialists were asked to nominate three screening interventions, the intervention being a combination of the four domains; target population, (age and higher risk groups), site, screening test and test operator (provider). More than 250 screening interventions were identified. For round two, responses were condensed into 72 interventions and each was rated by participants on a 0 - 10 scale in terms of feasibility. Results Using a cut-off of a median rating of feasibility of ≥ 5. 5 as evidence of agreement of intervention feasibility, six interventions were identified from round 2. These were initiating screening at age 50, with a combination of two or three screening tests (varying combinations of tonometry/measures of visual function/optic nerve damage) organized in a community setting with an ophthalmic trained technical assistant delivering the tests. An alternative intervention was a ‘glaucoma risk score’ ascertained by questionnaire. The advisory panel recommended that further exploration of the feasibility of screening higher risk populations and detailed specification of the screening tests was required. Conclusions With systematic use of expert opinions, a shortlist of potential screening interventions was identified. Views of users, service providers and cost-effectiveness modeling are now required to identify a feasible intervention to evaluate in a future glaucoma screening trial. </p...|$|E
