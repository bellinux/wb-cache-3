40|$|The {{ability to}} link {{events that are}} {{separated}} in time is important for extracting meaning from experiences and guiding behavior in the future. This ability likely requires the brain to continue representing events even after they have passed, a process that may involve the prefrontal cortex and {{takes the form of}} sustained, event-specific neuron activity. Here, we show that experimentally increasing the activity of excitatory neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) enables rats to associate two stimuli separated by a 750 -ms long temporal gap. Learning is accompanied by ramping increases in prefrontal theta and beta rhythms during the interval between stimuli. This ramping activity predicts memory-related behavioral responses on a trial-by-trial basis but is not correlated with the same muscular activity during non-memory conditions. Thus, the enhancement of <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neuron</b> excitability extends the time course of evoked prefrontal network activation and facilitates the formation of associations of temporally disparate, but correlated, events...|$|E
40|$|Prefrontal {{cortical}} {{activity in}} primate brain plays {{a critical role}} in cognitive processes involving working memory and the executive control of behavior. Groups of prefrontal cortical neurons within specified cortical layers along cortical minicolumns differentially generate inter- and intra-laminar firing to process relevant information for goal oriented behavior. However, it is not yet understood how cocaine modulates such differential firing in prefrontal cortical layers. Rhesus macaque nonhuman primates (NHPs) were trained in a visual delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task while the activity of prefrontal cortical neurons (areas 46, 8 and 6) was recorded simultaneously with a custom multielectrode array in cell layers 2 / 3 and 5. Animals were reinforced with juice for correct responses. The first half of the recording session (control) was conducted following saline injection and {{in the second half of}} the same session cocaine was administered. <b>Prefrontal</b> <b>neuron</b> activity with respect to inter- and intra-laminar firing in layers 2 / 3 and 5 was assessed in the DMS task before and after the injection of cocaine. Results showed that firing rates of both pyramidal cells and interneurons increased on Match phase presentation and the Match response in both control and cocaine halves of the session. Differential firing under cocaine vs. control in the Match phase was increased for interneurons but decreased for pyramidal cells. In addition, functional` interactions between prefrontal pyramidal cells in layer 2 / 3 and 5 decreased while intra-laminar cross-correlations in both layers increased. These neural recordings demonstrate that prefrontal neurons differentially encode and process information within and between cortical cell layers via cortical columns which is disrupted in a differential manner by cocaine administration...|$|E
40|$|An operant is a {{behavioral}} act {{that has an}} impact on the environment to produce an outcome, constituting an important component of voluntary behavior. Because the environment can be volatile, the same action may cause different consequences. Thus to obtain an optimal outcome, it is crucial to detect action–outcome relationships and adapt the behavior accordingly. Although <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> are known to change activity depending on expected reward, it remains unknown whether prefrontal activity contributes to obtaining reward. We investigated this issue by setting variable relationships between levels of single-neuron activity and rewarding outcomes. Lateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> changed their spiking activity according to the specific requirements for gaining reward, without the animals making a motor response. Thus spiking activity constituted an operant response. Data from a control task suggested that these changes were unlikely to reflect simple reward predictions.

50|$|To explore {{alternative}} {{interpretations of}} delay-period {{activity in the}} prefrontal cortex, Lebedev et al.

Both locations served as potential targets of a saccadic eye movement. Although the task made intensive demands on short-term memory, the largest proportion of <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> represented attended locations, not remembered ones. These findings showed that short-term memory functions cannot account for all, or even most, delay-period activity {{in the part of}} the prefrontal cortex explored.

40|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} working memory functions of the cerebral cortex and is also the site of dysfunction in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. <b>Prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> are distinguished by their capacity for sustained activity during the time a stimulus is held in memory, and this mnemonic response is considered a substrate for a variety of cognitive functions. The neuronal basis for sustained activity in <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> is unknown but is thought to involve recurrent excitation among pyramidal neurons. Recent studies in awake behaving monkeys have demonstrated that the persistent activity in <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> is modulated by dopamine. To examine the mechanisms by which dopamine might modulate transmission in local excitatory circuits, we have performed dual whole-cell recordings in connected pyramidal cell pairs with and without dopamine application. We find that dopamine reduces the efficacy of unitary excitatory neurotransmission in layer V pyramidal cells by decreasing its reliability. These effects, which are reproduced by a selective D 1 agonist and blocked by a D 1 antagonist, are independent of voltage changes and are not attenuated by blockade of sodium and potassium channels in the postsynaptic neurons. We conclude that attenuation of local horizontal excitatory synaptic transmission in layer V pyramidal neurons by dopamine is through D 1 actions at a presynaptic site...|$|R

40|$|Development of prefrontal {{and other}} higher-order {{association}} cortices {{is associated with}} widespread changes in the cortical transcriptome, particularly during the transitions from prenatal to postnatal development, and from early infancy to later stages of childhood and early adulthood. However, the timing and longitudinal trajectories of neuronal gene expression programs during these periods remain unclear {{in part because of}} confounding effects of concomitantly occurring shifts in neuron-to-glia ratios. Here, we used cell type-specific chromatin sorting techniques for genome-wide profiling of a histone mark associated with transcriptional regulation [...] H 3 with trimethylated lysine 4 (H 3 K 4 me 3) [...] in neuronal chromatin from 31 subjects from the late gestational period to 80 years of age. H 3 K 4 me 3 landscapes of <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> were developmentally regulated at 1, 157 loci, including 768 loci that were proximal to transcription start sites. Multiple algorithms consistently revealed that the overwhelming majority and perhaps all of developmentally regulated H 3 K 4 me 3 peaks were on a unidirectional trajectory defined by either rapid gain or loss of histone methylation during the late prenatal period and the first year after birth, followed by similar changes but with progressively slower kinetics during early and later childhood and only minimal changes later in life. Developmentally downregulated H 3 K 4 me 3 peaks in <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> were enriched for Paired box (Pax) and multiple Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) motifs, which are known to promote glial differentiation.

Here we investigate the timing relationships between neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex of freely behaving rats and the hippocampal theta rhythm. We demonstrate that {{a significant portion of}} <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> are phase-locked to the hippocampal theta rhythm and we compare the phase-locking properties of prefrontal and hippocampal cells. We also show that <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> phase-lock best to theta oscillations delayed by approximately 50 ms and confirm this hippocampo-prefrontal directionality and timing at the level of correlations between single cells. Finally we demonstrate that phase-locking of prefrontal cells is predicted by the presence of significant correlations with hippocampal cells at positive delays up to 150 ms, suggesting that direct hippocampal input has an important contribution to the observed prefrontal phase-locking. The theta entrained activity across cortico-hippocampal circuits described here may be important for gating information flow and guiding the plastic changes that are believed to underlie the storage of information across these networks. by Evgueniy V.

This effect was mimicked by the selective mGluR 2 agonist LY 395756 and was blocked by mGluR 2 / 3 antagonist LY 341495. Moreover, we found that both GluA 1 and GluA 2 subunits were colocalized with PSD 95 but not synapsin I, suggesting a postsynaptic localization. Consistently, treatment with LY 37 significantly increased the amplitude, but not frequency, of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Further, actinomycin-D blocked LY 37 ’s effects, suggesting a transcriptional regulation. In addition, application of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 beta (GSK- 3 b) inhibitor completely blocked LY 37 ’s effect on GluA 2 surface expression, whereas GSK- 3 b inhibitor itself induced decreases in the surface and total protein levels of GluA 1, but not GluA 2 subunits.

We recorded the activity of <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> while monkeys performed a blocked pro/antisaccade task in which they were required to look either toward or away from a peripheral visual stimulus.

40|$|Neurons in {{the lateral}} prefrontal cortex show {{sustained}} activity during {{the maintenance of}} visual memory. Previous studies have also indicated that <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> show predictive activity in anticipation of upcoming visual stimuli. Because these retrospective and prospective coding of visual stimuli have been examined in separate experiments, how these processes interact in individual neurons remains unknown. To examine this, we recorded from single <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> while monkeys performed two behavioural tasks. In one task, the animals passively viewed a moving object during fixation, whereas in the other, they remembered {{the location of a}} briefly presented visual cue for subsequent saccades. We found that many neurons were reactive and responded only after the visual stimulus appeared in their receptive field, while some neurons were predictive and increased their activity even before the moving stimulus entered the receptive field. In the memory-guided saccade trials, the reactive neurons exhibited sustained activity during the delay period, whereas the predictive neurons did not. Delays of visual response to a moving stimulus did not correlate with visual latency for a stationary stimulus. Instead, it correlated with the magnitude of sustained activity during the delay period in the memory-guided saccade task. Our data show that retrospective and prospective coding of visual information are represented by distinct neuronal populations, and that their temporal preferences are stable across different task conditions. Reactive signals may reflect the amount of temporal integration in short-term memory, whereas predictive signals may solely represent future events in isolation from the maintenance of past information...|$|R

We found neurons with responses related to preparation, movement, lever press responses, reinforcement, and memory delays. Combined event-related and video tracking analyses revealed variability in spatial tuning of neurons with similar event-related activity.

40|$|<b>Prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> exhibit saccade-related {{activity}} and pre-saccadic memory-related activity often encodes the directions of forthcoming eye movements, {{in line with}} demonstrated prefrontal contribution to flexible control of voluntary eye movements. However, many <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> exhibit post-saccadic activity that is initiated well after the initiation of eye movement. Although post-saccadic activity has been observed in the frontal eye field, this activity {{is thought to be}} a corollary discharge from oculomotor centers, because this activity shows no directional tuning and is observed whenever the monkeys perform eye movements regardless of goal-directed or not. However, prefrontal post-saccadic activities exhibit directional tunings similar as pre-saccadic activities and show context dependency, such that post-saccadic activity is observed only when monkeys perform goal-directed saccades. Context-dependency of prefrontal post-saccadic activity suggests that this activity is not a result of corollary signals from oculomotor centers, but contributes to other functions of the prefrontal cortex. One function might be the termination of memory-related activity after a behavioral response is done. This is supported by the observation that the termination of memory-related activity coincides with the initiation of post-saccadic activity in population analyses of prefrontal activities. The termination of memory-related activity {{at the end of the}} trial ensures that the subjects can prepare to receive new and updated information. Another function might be the monitoring of behavioral performance, since the termination of memory-related activity by post-saccadic activity could be associated with informing the correctness of the response and the termination of the trial. However, further studies are needed to examine the characteristics of saccade-related activities in the prefrontal cortex and their functions in eye movement control and a variety of cognitive functions...|$|R

40|$|Sleep {{spindles}} and K-complexes (KCs) define stage 2 NREM sleep (N 2) in humans. We recently {{showed that}} KCs are isolated downstates characterized by widespread cortical silence. We demonstrate here that KCs can be quasi-synchronous across scalp EEG and {{across much of}} the cortex using electrocorticography (ECOG) and localized transcortical recordings (bipolar SEEG). We examine the mechanism of synchronous KC production by creating the first conductance based thalamocortical network model of N 2 sleep to generate both spontaneous spindles and KCs. Spontaneous KCs are only observed when the model includes diffuse projections from restricted prefrontal areas to the thalamic reticular nucleus (RE), consistent with recent anatomical findings in rhesus monkeys. Modeled KCs begin with a spontaneous focal depolarization of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons,</b> followed by depolarization of the RE. Surprisingly, the RE depolarization leads to decreased firing due to disrupted spindling, which in turn is due to depolarization-induced inactivation of the low-threshold Ca 2 + current (IT). Further, although the RE inhibits thalamocortical (TC) neurons, decreased RE firing causes decreased TC cell firing, again because of disrupted spindling. The resulting abrupt removal of excitatory input to cortical pyramidal neurons then leads to the downstate. Empirically, KCs may also be evoked by sensory stimuli while maintaining sleep. We reproduce this phenomenon in the model by depolarization of either the RE or the widely-projecting <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons.</b> Again, disruption of thalamic spindling plays a key role. Higher levels of RE stimulation also cause downstates, but by directly inhibiting the TC neurons. SEEG recordings from the thalamus and cortex in a single patient demonstrated the model prediction that thalamic spindling significantly decreases before KC onset. In conclusion, we show empirically that KCs can be widespread quasi-synchronous cortical downstates, and demonstrate with the first model of stage 2 NREM sleep a possible mechanism whereby this widespread synchrony may arise...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To characterize epigenetic signatures of autism in <b>prefrontal</b> cortex <b>neurons.</b> DESIGN: We performed fluorescence-activated sorting and separation of neuronal and nonneuronal nuclei from postmortem prefrontal cortex, digested the chromatin with micrococcal nuclease, and deeply sequenced the DNA from the mononucleosomes with trimethylated H 3 K 4 (H 3 K 4 me 3), a histone mark associated with transcriptional regulation. Approximately 15 billion base pairs of H 3 K 4 me 3 -enriched sequences were collected from 32 brains. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16 subjects diagnosed as having autism and 16 control subjects {{ranging in age from}} 0. 5 to 70 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of genomic loci showing autism-associated H 3 K 4 me 3 changes in <b>prefrontal</b> cortex <b>neurons.</b> RESULTS: Subjects with autism showed no evidence for generalized disruption of the developmentally regulated remodeling of the H 3 K 4 me 3 landscape that defines normal <b>prefrontal</b> cortex <b>neurons</b> in early infancy. However, excess spreading of H 3 K 4 me 3 from the transcription start sites into downstream gene bodies and upstream promoters was observed specifically in neuronal chromatin from 4 of 16 autism cases but not in controls. Variable subsets of autism cases exhibit altered H 3 K 4 me 3 peaks at numerous genes regulating neuronal connectivity, social behaviors, and cognition, often in conjunction with altered expression of the corresponding transcripts. Autism-associated H 3 K 4 me 3 peaks were significantly enriched in genes and loci implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases.

Moreover, we show that hippocampal theta bursts drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations by phase-locking the neuronal firing via axonal pathways. Consequently, functional impairment of the hippocampus reduces the prefrontal activity. With ongoing maturation continuous theta-gamma oscillations emerge and mutually entrain the prejuvenile prefrontal-hippocampal networks. Thus, theta-modulated communication within developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks may be relevant for circuitry refinement and maturation of functional units underlying information storage at adulthood...|$|R

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the frontopolar cortex interacted with posterior areas differently depending on whether subjects were going to perform a phonological or semantic task. Moreover, we found that the sustained "set" activity in this region predicted the activity that could be recorded in the posterior areas during the performance, as well as the speed of that performance. We argue that the prefrontal set activity does not reflect simple maintenance of the task rules but the process of implementing the rule for subsequent cognitive performance and that this is done through rule-selective interactions with areas involved in execution of the tasks...|$|R
40|$|Dopamine exerts {{two classes}} of effect on the {{sustained}} neural activity in prefrontal cortex that underlies working memory. Direct release in the cortex increases the contrast of <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons,</b> enhancing the robustness of storage. Release of dopamine in the striatum is associated with salient stimuli and makes medium spiny neurons bistable; this modulation of the output of spiny <b>neurons</b> affects <b>prefrontal</b> cortex so as to indirectly gate access to working memory and additionally damp sensitivity to noise. Existing models have treated dopamine in one or other structure, or have addressed basal ganglia gating of working memory exclusive of dopamine effects. In this paper we combine these mechanisms and explore their joint effect. We model a memory-guided saccade task to illustrate how dopamine's actions lead to working memory that is selective for salient input and has increased robustness to distraction...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{interactions}} between cortical and hippocampal circuits {{are critical for}} memory formation, yet their basic organization at the neuronal network level is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that {{a significant portion of}} neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of freely behaving rats are phase locked to the hippocampal theta rhythm. In addition, we show that <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons</b> phase lock best to theta oscillations delayed by approximately 50 ms and confirm this hippocampo-prefrontal directionality and timing at the level of correlations between single cells. Finally, we find that phase locking of prefrontal cells is predicted by the presence of significant correlations with hippocampal cells at positive delays up to 150 ms. The theta-entrained activity across cortico-hippocampal circuits described here may be important for gating information flow and guiding the plastic changes that are believed to underlie the storage of information across these networks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} {{bell-shaped}} persistent neural activity represents {{a cornerstone of}} the theory for the internal representation of analog quantities, such as spatial location or head direction. Previous models, however, relied on the unrealistic assumption of network homogeneity. We investigate this issue in a network model where fine tuning of parameters is destroyed by heterogeneities in cellular and synaptic properties. Heterogeneities result {{in the loss of}} stored spatial information in a few seconds. Accurate encoding is recovered when a homeostatic mechanism scales the excitatory synapses to each cell to compensate for the heterogeneity in cellular excitability and synaptic inputs. Moreover, the more realistic model produces a wide diversity of tuning curves, as commonly observed in recordings from <b>prefrontal</b> <b>neurons.</b> We conclude that recurrent attractor networks in conjunction with appropriate homeostatic mechanisms provide a robust, biologically plausible theoretical framework for understanding the neural circuit basis of spatial working memory...|$|R
