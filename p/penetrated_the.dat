5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the ship}} five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four {{propellant}} charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E

50|$|The Wa Pruef report {{estimated}} that the Tiger's 88 mm gun {{would be capable of}} <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> differential case of an American M4 Sherman from 2100 m and the turret front from 1800 m, but the Tiger's 88 mm gun would not <b>penetrate</b> <b>the</b> upper glacis plate at any range. The M4 Sherman's 75 mm gun would not <b>penetrate</b> <b>the</b> Tiger frontally at any range, and needed to be within 100 m to achieve a side penetration against the 80 mm upper hull superstructure. The Sherman's upgraded 76 mm gun would have <b>the</b> possibility to <b>penetrate</b> <b>the</b> Tiger's driver's front plate from 600 m, the nose from 400 m and the turret front from 700 m. The M3 90 mm cannon used as a towed anti-aircraft and anti-tank gun, and later mounted in the M36 tank destroyer and finally the late-war M26 Pershing, could <b>penetrate</b> <b>the</b> Tiger's front plate at a range of 1,000 m using standard ammunition, and from beyond 2,000 m when using HVAP.|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{effective}} anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs from the first nine Vals missed Enterprise. However, at 16:44, an armor-piercing, delayed-action bomb <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> flight deck near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. Incoming sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list, {{but it was not}} a major breach of hull integrity.|$|E
5|$|Because of the hilly terrain, {{the station}} was built in a deep cutting {{excavated}} from Highgate Hill adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> hillside {{at each end of}} the station, leading towards East Finchley to the north and Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side platforms, with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two platforms.|$|E

He penetrated eastward to the Comayagua valley and brought an extensive region under nominal Spanish control.|$|E

40|$|A {{new model}} of {{economic}} growth introduces the knowledge filter between new generic knowledge and economically-useful knowledge. It identifies both the formation of new ventures and the absorptive capacity of incumbent firms as <b>the</b> mechanisms that <b>penetrate</b> <b>the</b> knowledge filter. Recent empirical work has shown that new firms are more proficient at <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> knowledge filter than are incumbent firms; however, the analysis has only examined expanding economies and has relied on purely cross-sectional regression methodologies. This study explores the role of new and incumbent firms in <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> knowledge filter utilizing recent developments in spatial panel estimation techniques {{to provide a more}} robust set of findings. The results suggest that new firms are more proficient at <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> knowledge filter in declining and growing regions alike.

5|$|In {{dealing with}} Stalin, Truman {{decided to give}} the Soviet leader vague hints about the {{existence}} of a powerful new weapon without going into details. However, the other Allies were unaware that Soviet intelligence had <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project in its early stages, so Stalin already knew of the existence of the atomic bomb but did not appear impressed by its potential.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{recovered}} the punt at their 14-yard line. The Hokies gained one first down with three rushes, then another on a pass from Cox, advancing {{the ball to}} their 35-yard line. A facemask penalty against Air Force aided Tech as the Hokies drove inside Air Force territory. Time remaining in the half quickly became a factor for Virginia Tech, as the Hokies <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> Falcons' 45-yard line with just 1:10 remaining in the half. As the Hokies rushed the ball, {{they were forced to}} call timeouts in order to stop the clock—which counts down following rushing plays that do not gain a first down or end out of bounds. Cox threw occasional passes, gaining short yardage, but most of the Hokies' work during the drive was done on the ground. Tech <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> Air Force red zone, driving to the Falcons' 12-yard line with 25seconds remaining. As Cox attempted to throw a pass into the end zone {{in an effort to get}} a touchdown before time expired, Air Force's Mike Chandler intercepted the ball, denying the Hokies a scoring chance.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} also charged with {{gathering}} intelligence on the German nuclear weapon project. Through Operation Alsos, Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German scientists.

5|$|According to Luttwak, {{the forward}} defence system was always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous borders {{to deal with}} such threats. In addition, the lack of any reserves {{to the rear of the}} border entailed that a barbarian force that successfully <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage deep into the empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E
5|$|After his victory, Zabdas marched {{south along}} the Jordan Valley and {{apparently}} met little opposition. There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many milestones bearing Vaballathus' name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly in Antioch, Syria's traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her grip on Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus' name.|$|E
5|$|Because the big {{gap between}} the ROK Capital and ROK 8th Divisions made it {{impossible}} for ROK I Corps at Kyongju to direct the action of the 8th Division, the ROK Army transferred that division to the control of the ROK II Corps on September 7, and attached to it the ROK 5th Regiment of the ROK 7th Division. This shift of command came just as the NK 15th Division <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> ROK 8th Division lines to enter Yongch'on in the Taegu-P'ohang-dong corridor. From west of An'gang-ni the ROK 3rd Regiment drove toward Yongch'on, attempting to close the gap.|$|E

5|$|General Manteuffel {{had been}} injured in {{the attack on the}} position. Wedel ordered a full cavalry assault through the woods and against the Russian right flank. When the {{superior}} Russian force countered, Prussian momentum faltered with the lack of a second column of timely reinforcement. Repeated assaults on the Russians entrenched in the heights resulted in massive losses for the Prussians. In the last of these assaults, Moritz Franz Kasimir von Wobersnow led eight battalions and six squadrons from Züllichau against the Russian right wing. At the same time his cavalry <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> enemy's infantry line, but the Russian cavalry, supported by gun-fire, drove them and the infantry back into the low ground.|$|E
5|$|In late April, the Chinese {{launched}} a major counterattack. Though the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions {{were able to}} hold their ground against the Chinese 9th Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) Army Corps, the South Korean 6th Infantry Division, to the east, was destroyed by the 13th CPV Army Corps, which <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> line and threatened to encircle the American divisions. The 1st Marine Division and 27th British Commonwealth Brigade were able to drive the 13th Army Corps back while the 24th and 25th Divisions withdrew on 25 April. The line was pushed back to Seoul but managed to hold.|$|E
5|$|In the stalemate, the Belgians {{studied the}} Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and {{artillery}} spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue {{up to an}} hour after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> Belgians' left and right flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the brunt of the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.|$|E

5|$|Nos. 607 and 609 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Germans {{south-west}} of The Needles. The British reported 30–40 Bf 110s with 15 Do 17s in support. The tonnage of bombs dropped suggested {{there were fewer}} bombers than claimed. The RAF fighters claimed four Do 17s. The fact remains that the Germans <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> airspace without interception and {{came very close to}} inflicting critical damage to the Spitfire factory. The radar had done its job and alerted No. 11 and 10 Group 20 minutes before the bombs started to fall. The fault lay either with the No. 10 or 11 Group controllers who were late in ordering their Squadrons to scramble.|$|E
5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had <b>penetrated</b> <b>the</b> surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E
