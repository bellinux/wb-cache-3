40|$|This {{research}} studied on {{characteristics of}} the conventional <b>paint</b> <b>spray</b> compared to the High Volume Low Pressure (HVLP) type of <b>paint</b> <b>spray</b> used in the automotive painting industries in terms of cost and air quality in the spray booths. Characterization of conventional and HVLP of <b>paint</b> <b>spray</b> gathered through experimental methods. Results recorded from the experiments are air pressure, air volume, paint viscosity, transfer efficiency, and overspray. The analysed results are used as parameters in the Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS CFX V. 15. The simulated <b>paint</b> <b>spray</b> patterns of the conventional <b>paint</b> <b>spray</b> compared to the High Volume Low Pressure (HVLP), concurred with {{the findings from the}} experiments. At the end of this research, it concluded that HVLP has a more stable flow rate compared to the conventional spray gun. HVLP produces smaller droplet size of paint thus reducing overspray impact on hygiene and surrounding environment. HVLP recorded 77. 39 % transfer efficiency which was 20 % more than the conventional spray gun. The spray patternation of HVLP nozzle using ANSYS CFX Version 15 simulated a full cone and symmetry spray right after the paint discharge from the nozzle. In terms of practicality, the HVLP spray gun is more suitable for coating of a car’s part in the SME compared to the conventional <b>spray</b> <b>paint...</b>|$|R

40|$|Spray {{painters}} {{are potentially}} exposed to aerosols containing hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI) ] via inhalation of chromate-based <b>paint</b> <b>sprays.</b> Evaluating the {{particle size distribution}} of a <b>paint</b> <b>spray</b> aerosol, and the variables that may affect this distribution, is necessary to determine the site and degree of respiratory deposition and the damage that may result from inhaled Cr(VI) -containing paint particles. This study examined the effect of spray gun atomization pressure, aerosol generation source and aerosol aging on the size distribution of chromate-based paint overspray aerosols generated in a bench-scale <b>paint</b> <b>spray</b> booth. The study also determined the effect of particle bounce inside a Marple personal cascade impactor on measured size distribu-tions of <b>paint</b> <b>spray</b> aerosols. Marple personal cascade impactors with a modified inlet were used for sample collection. The data indicated that paint particle bounce did not occur inside the cascade impactors sufficiently to affect size distribution when using uncoated stainless steel or PVC substrate sampling media. A decrease in paint aerosol mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) from 8. 2 to 7. 0 mm was observed as gun atomization pressure increased from 6 to 10 psi.

50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the {{investigation}} into the murders encountered a major breakthrough when a sample of paint which perfectly matched that recovered from several victims' bodies was found beneath a concealed transformer at the rear of a building on the Heron Factory Estate in Acton.

Shortly thereafter, Du Rose held a news conference in which he falsely announced that the police had narrowed the suspect pool down to 20 men and that, by a process of elimination, these suspects were being eliminated from the investigation.

50|$|Spraying {{paint with}} {{compressed}} air {{can be traced}} back to its use on the Southern Pacific Railway in the early 1880s In 1887 Joseph Binks, the maintenance supervisor at Chicago's Marshall Field's Wholesale Store developed a hand pumped cold-water <b>paint</b> <b>spraying</b> machine to apply whitewash to the subbasement walls of the store. Francis Davis Millet, the decorations director for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, used Binks and his spray painting system to apply whitewash consisting of a mix of oil and white lead to the buildings at the Exposition, taking considerably less time than traditional brush painting and tuning it into what has been called the White City. In 1949, Edward Seymour developed a type of spray painting, aerosol paint, that could be delivered via a compressed aerosol in a can.|$|E

Prior to the completion of Boeing Plant 2, Boeing Plant 1 airplanes were produced and assembled onsite, taken apart, reassembled, taken apart again, barged to Boeing Airfield, flight tested, disassembled, and shipped to the buyer. This cumbersome process was simplified by the completion of Boeing Plant 2, which could also accommodate the larger airframes being produced in the 1930s.

5000|$|Scenically the production, {{designed}} by Harry Horner, was extremely involved with velour covered hard wall sets instead of typical muslin flats. The raised stage platform floor concealed tracks {{for the various}} platform wagon sets to be winched on and off stage. The village set, included left and right store facades with false perspective awnings, were stored, hanging in the off stage loft areas, allowing wing storage for the hard wall throne room (painted deep maroon color); a pink boudoir set; a garden set; and a Cathedral Rose stained glass window-wall with a central enlarged double Gothic arched doorway mounted on a six foot deep by thirty foot wide wagon platform. Staging the wedding scene, the couple began their walk {{at the rear of}} the stage on the Cathedral steps into the set. As the couple proceeded walking forward down to the foot-light apron, this massive Cathedral wall followed, moving with the couple to the middle of the stage. Interesting is fact the audience never realized that the set was moving downstage with the performers. When the couple turned around, returning upstage, the cathedral wall slowly returned to the back wall position ending the wedding scene. This set wagon wall flew out and was stored against the Curran's stage back wall; a spectacular visual transition, which was never seen by the audience! In Los Angeles, this set piece was replaced with a painted velour framed backing. Harry Horner matched Miles White's costume color, for Princess Flavia's dressing gown robe, spraying the velour boudoir walls the identical costume's pink color. During rehearsals, Miles was jump'n mad with Harry because all you could see was the actress' head bobbing in the identical pink background! The production required a large staff of stage technicians, flymen, and property crew for the major set changes. During the construction of the stage sets, the shop's minimum construction floor space limited and hindered by space for constructing all the wagon sets. The Light Opera rented film stages at the nearby (closed) Allied Artist Studios, located off Sunset Boulevard (KCET TV purchased the property afterwards). Only six blocks travel, carpenters and scenic artists assembled the scenery in two stages at the old film lot. Preparing the dry tint powder base paint for the throne room set, the Scenic charge man did not calculate the correct amount of [...] "horse glue" [...] binder for the dark maroon <b>paint.</b> <b>Spraying</b> the cream velour covered flats, after drying, the paint did not properly adhere to the velour flats. The result, the paint flaked and stained the stage technicians' hands. Each piece of scenery had to have a muslin case for shipping, keeping the finish from marking and affecting the other pieces of scenery. When this set was handled, each stage technician had to wear gloves when the set was moved into place, or shifted off stage for storage. This set remained a problem throughout the tour. Another folding deminsional scenic arch unit, which had been intended to fold open, and collapse when flown into grid storage position returning into the loft storage areas, became an engineering nightmare. The scenic element, abandoned after two weeks, was replaced by a flat profile garden arch. Harry Horner's scenery and Miles White's costumes provided an intricate, beautiful, handsome detailed production. Film sets and costumes as a stage musical! ...|$|E
40|$|Air-fed visors are {{commonly}} used for protection against exposure to airborne isocyanates during <b>paint</b> <b>spraying.</b> Protection levels for this class of equipment are theoretically adequate, yet isocyanate sensitization in this occupation still occurs. The work reported here set out to establish the level of respiratory protection that is achieved during real <b>paint</b> <b>spraying</b> activities when air-fed visors are used. Thework also {{examined the effects of}} reduced air supply flow rates on this type of respiratory protection. The workplace study highlighted common problems that occur when attempting to measure protection factors, and process and interpret the collected data. Many of the environments included in this study did not exhibit challenge concentrations high enough to reliably measure the workplace protection factor of this class of device. When detection limits are taken into consideration, the remaining field data suggest that an assigned protection factor in the region of 40 may be appropriate. When well maintained and used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, air-fed visors are capable of providing a good level of respiratory protection. The protection given by air-fed visors is strongly dependent on the air flow supplied to them. Laboratorymeasurements demonstrate that protection falls as the air supply falls. This is a gradual process and does not suddenly occur at any particular air supply flow. Observations made during the field tests indicate that there may be other activities associated with the spraying process that need to be taken into consideration when looking for sources of respiratory sensitization...|$|E
40|$|The {{homogeneous}} {{deposition of}} material on complex surfaces, e. g., powder coating, <b>paint</b> <b>spraying,</b> fiber lay-down etc., {{is a well-known}} task in industrial production. This thesis introduces a mathematical modeling for a typical process class of such uniform coverage problems motivated by the spunbond process. Three different models are described. In the asymptotic model, a simplified uniform coverage problem is solved analytically in terms of Abel solutions. In the semi-asymptotic model, one of the simplifications is revoked and it is proven that the Abel solutions perform very well. Finally, in the complete finite model, convergence to the first model is proven, which implies that the Abel solutions show a desirable approximative behaviour. In the numerical part, the uniform coverage problem is solved {{in terms of a}} modified Remez-Algorithm. The Abel solutions are compared to the Remez solutions and their usage is justified...|$|E

In this study, renal screening was performed in a group of paint sprayers with exposure to hydrocarbon-based paints, recruited from a car manufacturing plant where personal protective equipment was widely used. The hydrocarbon exposure scores and various markers of renal injury were compared between these subjects and a group of paint sprayers from a previous study who did not use personal protective equipment regularly. Cumulative hydrocarbon exposure scores were calculated from a validated questionnaire. Serum creatinine, urinary total protein, albumin, transferrin, retinol-binding protein, and N-acetylglucosaminidase were evaluated, Both groups experienced heavy hydrocarbon exposure but sprayers who regularly used personal protective equipment had significantly reduced exposure scores due to improved skin and respiratory protection. A significant number of sprayers from both groups had elevated levels of serum creatinine. Interestingly, urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, a marker of proximal tubular damage, was abnormal in a significant proportion of sprayers in the unprotected group but normal in those with improved protection. Our results are in keeping with the hypothesis that hydrocarbon exposure through <b>paint</b> <b>spraying</b> may result in active proximal tubular damage which may be reduced by improvement of protection at the worksite. However, renal impairment independent of tubular injury may result from chronic paint exposure, even with improved protection...|$|E
