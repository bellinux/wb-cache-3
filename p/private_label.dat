40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the market shares of <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> in the European Union and on the global market, and to compare the results of the {{analysis}} with the level of presence of <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> on the Croatian market. Moreover, through the application of macro and microeconomic tools, the author tried to estimate the future trends of <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> in Croatia. For the purpose of the paper secondary and primary data was used in the research. Relevant scientific and professional literature of local and foreign authors was analyzed. In addition, a few recent research studies were analyzed and their results compared. Field research has been conducted by the survey method, with 225 respondents included in the intentional sample. The main hypothesis of the paper based on research is that, in total sales, <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> are gaining a growing share in all markets, regardless of the development level of those markets. Alongside the main hypothesis of the work, three supporting hypotheses were tested to see which <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> are a good alternative to other brands on the world market. <b>Private</b> <b>labels</b> are generally developed on generic products. The third supporting hypothesis starts from the assumption that the investments in the promotion of <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> are negligible, resulting in lower prices of thoseproducts. The results of research and analyses in the work indicate that the position of <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> will strengthen internationally, as part of the process of liberalization and globalization of trade flows. In the process of purchase of <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> the positioning of the point of sale and price have an increasing contribution. With the concentration of commerce in chain stores, the share of <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> grows, approaching a half of the total sales in some countries. Considering the Croatian market, according to the international product life cycle theory, the share of <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> in the total sales will grow in the future with the expansion of the national chain stores...|$|R

40|$|<b>Private</b> <b>labels,</b> {{also known}} as store brands, are an {{important}} component of competitive strategy among multi-product retailers, as they can increase retailers’ power over suppliers in the vertical channel or facilitate horizontal differentiation among retailers. This paper seeks to identify the relative importance of each role, conditional on the location of both <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> and national brands of ice cream in attribute space. We find that retailers’ share of the total margin (retail price less production cost) is higher for <b>private</b> <b>labels</b> than national brands when retailers choose to imitate national brands with their own offerings. multi-product oligopoly, nested logit, <b>private</b> <b>labels,</b> retailing, spatial modeling, Industrial Organization,...|$|R
