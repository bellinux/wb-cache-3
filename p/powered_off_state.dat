This {{is because of}} a change in the OS behavior which causes network adapters to be explicitly not armed for WOL when shutdown to these states occurs.

40|$|Non-volatile memory (NVM) {{is a form}} of {{computer}} memory in which the logical value (1 or 0) of a bit is retained when the computer is in its’ <b>powered</b> <b>off</b> <b>state.</b> Flash memory is a major form of NVM found in many computer-based technologies today, from portable solid state drives to numerous types of electronic devices. The popularity of flash memory {{is due in part to}} the successful development and commercialization of the floating gate transistor. However, as the floating gate transistor reaches its’ limits of performance and scalability, viable alternatives are being aggressively researched and developed. One such alternative is a memristor-based memory application often referred to as ReRAM or RRAM (Resistive Random Access Memory). A memristor (memory resistor) is a passive circuit element that exhibits programmable resistance when subjected to appropriate current levels. A high resistance state in the memristor corresponds to a logical ‘ 0 ’, while the low resistance state corresponds to a logical ‘ 1 ’. One memristive system currently being actively investigated is the metal/metal oxide/metal material stack in which the metal layers serve as contact electrodes for the memristor with the metal oxide providing the variable resistance functionality. Application of an appropriate potential difference across the electrodes creates oxygen vacancies throughout the thickness of the metal oxide layer, resulting in the formation of filaments of metal ions which span the metal oxide, allowing for electronic conduction through the stack. Creation and disruption of the filaments correspond to low and high resistance states in the memristor, respectively. For some time now, HfO 2 has been researched and developed to serve as a high-k material for use in high performance CMOS MOSFETs. As it happens, HfO 2 -based RRAM devices have proven themselves as viable candidates for NVM as well, demonstrating high switching speed (100), good endurance (> 106 cycles), long lifetime, and multi-bit storage capabilities. HfO 2 -based RRAM is also highly scalable, having been fabricated in cells as small as 10 x 10 nm 2 while still maintaining good performance. Previous work examining switching properties of micron scale HfO 2 -based RRAM has been performed by the Vogel group. However, a viable process for fabrication of nano-scale RRAM is required in order to continue these studies. In this work, a fabrication process for nano-scale cross-point TiN/ HfO 2 /TiN RRAM devices will be developed and described. Materials processing challenges will be addressed. The switching performance of devices fabricated by this process will be compared to the performance of similar devices from the literature in order to confirm process viability. M. S...|$|E

For full support of a device's WoL capabilities (such as the ability to wake from an ACPI S5 <b>power</b> <b>off</b> <b>state),</b> installation of the full driver suite from the network device manufacturer may be necessary, rather than the bare driver provided by Microsoft or the computer manufacturer. In most cases correct BIOS configuration is also required for WoL to function.|$|R

30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) demand {{low power}} and energy efficient hardware and software. Dynamic Power Management (DPM) technique reduces the maximum possible active states of a wireless sensor node by controlling the switching of the low power manageable components in <b>power</b> down or <b>off</b> <b>states.</b> During DPM, it is also required that the deadline of task execution and performance are not compromised. It is seen that operational level change can improve the energy efficiency of a system drastically (up to 90 %). Hence, DPM policies have drawn considerable attention. This review paper classifies different dynamic power management techniques and focuses on stochastic modeling scheme which dynamically manage wireless sensor node operations {{in order to minimize}} its power consumption. This survey paper is expected to trigger ideas for future research projects in power aware wireless sensor network arenas.|$|R

The majority of the debt is held by the PA and Jerusalem District Electricity Company (JDECO) which is a Palestinian electricity firm which buys its power from IEC and serves east Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Jericho areas. The IEC stated that they are losing NIS 85 million per month on power being supplied to Nablus and Jenin that they are not being paid for, causing the majority of their quarterly loss. The Palestinians accused IEC of collective punishment, however the IEC stated that they must operate independently and are treating this as they would any customer who does not pay their debts.|$|R

40|$|Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a {{group of}} mobile nodes that {{communicates}} with each other without any supporting infrastructure. These networks have some unique features such as dynamic mobility, open nature, lack of infrastructure, limited physical security and they are vulnerable to several security threats. Malicious node can drop all or partial received packets instead of forwarding them to the next hop through the path. In order to find the malicious nodes, an initial transmission is made between the source and destination nodes. Using fuzzy rules, the trust value of each node is computed and it varies from 0 to 1. A common threshold value is set for each node and by using this threshold value, every node in the network can be identified as either a malicious node or a regular node. After identifying the malicious nodes, these nodes are eliminated by muting the <b>power</b> to <b>off</b> <b>state.</b> As the malicious nodes are eliminated between source and destination nodes, source node can select another trusted path to its destination node. For security and authentication of routing information, hybrid cryptography is employed, using advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) algorithms. AES algorithm is used as symmetric algorithm to encrypt the routing information and ECC algorithm is used as asymmetric algorithm to encrypt the public key. During encryption, the original plain text is converted into cipher text with encrypted public key and similarly during decryption cipher text is converted into original plain text with decrypted private keys. So the proposed method involves both AES and ECC algorithms which provides security mechanism as efficient and sufficient one. The experimental simulations are carried for the proposed model using network simulator 2 (NS- 2) for Throughput, Delay, Packet delivery ratio, Packet overhead and Packet drop...|$|R
