40|$|Consumersatisfaction is {{fundamental}} to organisational success. It is well recognised that <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> is important in achieving consumer satisfaction. However, the application of self-service technology (SST) is widcning and is attennuating traditional exchanges between consumers and service employees. The effect of this reduction of <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> on consumer satisfaction judgements is not well understood. This study addresses this gap by investigating the relative effects of SST and <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> attributes on overall consumer satisfaction. Thc study highlights important service attributes applicable to SST and <b>personal</b> <b>service.</b> The conceptual framework is tested using data collected from 241 leisure and business travellers drawn from premium hotels in a regional area. Structural equation modelling techniques support the conceptual framework. As expected, the attributes of <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> and SST contribute to consumer satisfaction. However, thc impact of <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> attributes 011 consumer satisfaction is much stronger than the effects of SST attributes. Though SST is an important determinant of consumer satisfaction, interactions with staff are critical. These results have applications for the {{theory and practice of}} services marketing, and high light avenues for further investigation...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{empirical}} model of households' choices among local telephone <b>service</b> <b>options</b> (for example, between flat-rate and measured service) and the interrelation of these choices {{with the number}} and average duration of local calls households make at each time of day to each geographical zone. Using a nested logit model with estimation performed on a randomly selected subset of the households' calling patterns, we calculate elasticities of demand for each local <b>service</b> <b>option,</b> number of calls, average duration, and revenues {{with respect to the}} fixed monthly charges and the usage charges for calling under each option. We find moderate price elasticities of number of calls with respect to usage charges for households subscribing to measured service. Nevertheless, raising usage charges has a negligible effect on revenues, since a sufficient number of households either originally subscribe to flat-rate service or convert to flat-rate service in response to higher usage charges. We find a high elasticity of demand for each <b>service</b> <b>option</b> with respect to its fixed monthly fee. This indicates high substitutability among <b>service</b> <b>options.</b> The shift among <b>service</b> <b>options</b> induces new calling patterns, which we find to be a small but not negligible indirect effect. ...|$|R
