25|$|Around 1770, a {{small group}} {{consisting}} of Spanish explorers decided that the Cosumnes River Preserve and other places within the Central Valley was a perfect pasture for grazing animals. Trappers came into {{the area around the}} preserve in the early 1800s but found that there was no place to settle and the fur trapping was not worth it. The Mexican government started issuing land grants in 1844 and John Sutter who was a European immigrant {{was one of the first}} to colonize the Cosumnes River area. John Sutter founded the colony New Helvetia and soon some of his assistants moved out to the Cosumnes River Preserve area. Once the California gold rush started in 1848, many miners settled in along the Cosumnes River hoping to find gold and get rich. Once realizing that there wasn't very much gold in the region, they dammed the river and changed the landscape to grow hay, wheat, and various types of fruit. The Miwok people lost sources of food that they relied on and soon after villages and burial grounds were destroyed. Shortly after, the Miwok moved out of the region where the Cosumnes River Preserve is and in 1999, the last person to spoke <b>Plains</b> Miwuk <b>died.</b>|$|R
25|$|Yang Yi had {{disagreements}} with Wei Yan, a senior Shu general, and frequently quarrelled with him.

40|$|Nineteen dead wild turkeys were necropsied and 573 live wild turkeys were {{physically}} examined for pathological agents in Arkansas between 1992 and 1997 {{to determine the}} proximate role disease may play in declining wild populations in Arkansas. Necropsy of the dead wild turkeys identified avian pox and histomoniasis as the most common diseases (16 % and 11 % of necropsies, respectively). Avian pox was recorded from three major physiographic regions in the state (Ozark Highlands, Ouachita Mountains, Gulf Coastal <b>Plain).</b> One hen <b>died</b> of non-accidental crop impaction, the fifth occurrence observed in the southeastern United States. Another hen died after developing severe, focal necrotic dermatitis caused by a Penicillium sp. fungus, the first occurrence observed in wild turkeys. All live wild turkeys appeared free of gross signs of disease. We found diseases in wild turkeys in Arkansas are not uncommon and are more diverse than previously reported. Continued monitoring of disease in wild turkeys is therefore encouraged...|$|R

He took Holy Orders, and was domestic chaplain to Earl Spencer for some years.

Knopwood was also appointed magistrate at the Derwent settlement, and Collins looked upon him as one of his valued civil officers; but after Collins's death, Governor Macquarie was rather critical of Knopwood's unconventional methods.
