40|$|Dopamine (DA) neurones of the ventral {{mesencephalon}} {{are involved}} in the control of reward related behaviour, cognitive functions and motor performances, and provide a critical site of action for major categories of neuropsychiatric drugs, such as antipsychotic agents, dependence producing drugs and anti-Parkinson medication. The midbrain DA neurones are mainly located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Their activity is regulated by the intrinsic properties of the DA neurones {{as well as by the}} activity of the afferent inputs. The aim of the present work was to study the function and modulatory role of the glutamatergic and cholinergic afferent inputs in regulating the midbrain DAergic neuronal activity. The slice preparation of the rat ventral mesencephalon in vitro was used and intracellular or whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed from the DA neurones. Repetitive stimulation of the afferents in the slice preparation was shown to elicit a slow excitatory <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>event</b> that was blocked by application of the NMDA antagonist AP 5. Moreover, the amplitude of the slow <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>event</b> was markedly reduced by L-type Ca 2 + channel blockers such as nifedipine. Specific agonists to group I, II and III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) were all shown to reduce the amplitude of both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic inputs to the DA neurones. A presynaptic site of action was indicated by a paired-pulse protocol. Also muscarine depressed both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission to the DA neurones. These effects were completely blocked by the M 3 /M 1 receptor antagonist 4 -DAMP, but not significantly affected by the M, receptor antagonist pirenzepine. Moreover, the postsynaptic responses to glutamate or GABA were not changed by muscarine. The nicotine-induced excitation of DA neurones was reduced in the presence of AP 5 or the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX. However, neither glutamate- nor GABA-mediated spontaneous synaptic transmission was affected by nicotine application. The results demonstrate that NMDA-mediated glutamatergic synaptic transmission to midbrain DA neurones involves activation of presynaptic L-type Ca 2 + channels. Moreover, mGluRs and muscarinic receptors mediate presynaptic inhibition of both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic inputs to the midbrain DA neurones. Finally, the nicotine-induced excitation of the DA neurones in the slice preparation seems essentially to be mediated through postsynaptically located nicotinic receptors...|$|E

A comparative evaluation of the refractory period of each component of the cervical responses under investigation has been performed to differentiate presynaptic from <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>events.</b> Additional information has been obtained by cervical activity recorded by longitudinal and transverse bipolar derivations upon stimulation of the lower limb.

In this article, we present a biophysical model of STDP based on a differential Hebbian learning rule (ISO learning). This rule correlates presynaptically the NMDA channel conductance with the derivative of the membrane potential at the synapse as the postsynaptic signal. The model is able to reproduce the generic STDP weight change characteristic. We �nd that (1) The actual shape of the weight change curve strongly depends on the NMDA channel characteristics and on {{the shape of the}} membrane potential at the synapse. (2) The typical antisymmetrical STDP curve (LTD and LTP) can become similar to a standard Hebbian characteristic (LTP only) without having to change the learning rule.

(3) It is known that the membrane potential varies along the dendrite {{as a result of the}} active or passive backpropagation of somatic spikes or because of local dendritic processes.

This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|R

40|$|A {{central theme}} in {{neurobiology}} is {{the search for}} the mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Since the seminal work, first of Cajal and later of Hebb, the synapse is thought to be the basic "storing unit. " Hebb proposed that information is stored by correlation: synapses between neurons, which are often coactive, are enhanced. Several recent findings suggest that such a mechanism is indeed operative in the central nervous system. Pairing of activity on presynaptic fibers with strong postsynaptic depolarization results in synaptic enhancement. While there is substantial evidence in favor of a postsynaptic locus for detection of the synchronous pre- and <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>event</b> and subsequent initiation of synaptic enhancement, the locus of this enhancement and its ensuing persistence is still disputed: both pre- and postsynaptic contributions have been suggested. In all previous studies, the enhancement was presumed to be specific to the synapses where synchronous pre- and postsynaptic stimulation was applied. We report here that two recording techniques [...] optical recording, using voltage-sensitive dyes, and double intracellular recordings [...] reveal that synaptic enhancement is not restricted to the stimulated cell. Although we paired single afferent volleys with intracellular stimulation confined to one postsynaptic cell, we found that strengthening also occurred on synapses between the stimulated presynaptic fibers and neighboring cells. This suggests that synaptic enhancement by the "paired-stimulation paradigm" is not local on the presynaptic axons and that, in fact, the synapses of many neighboring postsynaptic cells are enhanced...|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{the central}} nervous system a {{dominant}} form of inhibition of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals is mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).

However, electrophysiological recordings of spontaneous, AP-independent (so-called ‘miniature’) <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>events</b> reveal an additional, important form of GPCR-mediated presynaptic inhibition, distinct from effects on ionic conductances and consistent with a direct action on the vesicle release machinery.

Records from a minority of subicular pyramidal cells revealed depolarizing GABA(A) receptor-mediated <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>events,</b> indicating a perturbed Cl- homeostasis. We assessed possible contributions of changes in expression of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC 2. Double in situ hybridization showed that mRNA for KCC 2 was absent from approximately 30 % of CaMKIIalpha (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha) -positive subicular pyramidal cells. Combining intracellular recordings with biocytin-filled electrodes and KCC 2 immunochemistry, we observed that all cells that were hyperpolarized during interictal events were immunopositive for KCC 2, whereas the majority of depolarized cells were immunonegative. Bumetanide, at doses that selectively block the chloride-importing potassium-sodium-chloride cotransporter NKCC 1, produced a hyperpolarizing shift in GABA(A) reversal potentials and suppressed interictal activity.

Intracellular recording showed that EC stimulation evoked a complex synaptic response, in which the greater proportion of neurons exhibited excitatory <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>events</b> and/or a short lasting and a prolonged inhibitory postsynaptic response. Furthermore, stimulation of EC selectively produced an augmentation of the bistable up [...] down state only in the type 2 regular spiking neurons and in a subclass of nonintrinsic bursting neurons. Taken together, these data suggest that the potent inhibition observed following EC stimulation may mask a direct excitatory response within the mPFC which markedly potentiates the bistable states in a select subpopulation of mPFC pyramidal neurons...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model for {{plasticity}} induction in reinforcement learning {{which is based on}} a cascade of synaptic memory traces. In the cascade of these so called eligibility traces presynaptic input is first corre lated with <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>events,</b> next with the behavioral decisions and finally with the external reinforcement. A population of leaky integrate and fire neurons endowed with this plasticity scheme is studied by simulation on different tasks. For operant co nditioning with delayed reinforcement, learning succeeds even when the delay is so large that the delivered reward reflects the appropriateness, not of the immediately preceeding response, but of a decision made earlier on in the stimulus - decision sequence. So the proposed model does not rely on the temporal contiguity between decision and pertinent reward and thus provides a viable means of addressing the temporal credit assignment problem. In the same task, learning speeds up with increasing population si ze, showing that the plasticity cascade simultaneously addresses the spatial problem of assigning credit to the different population neurons. Simulations on other task such as sequential decision making serve to highlight the robustness of the proposed sch eme and, further, contrast its performance to that of temporal difference based approaches to reinforcement learning...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the pattern of isochromosome pairing allows one to distinguish factors affecting presynaptic alignment of homologous chromosomes from those affecting synapsis and crossing-over. Because the two homologous arms in an isochromosome are invariably associated by a common centromere, the suppression of pairing between these arms (intrachromosome pairing) would indicate that synaptic or <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>events</b> were impaired. In contrast, the suppression of pairing between an isochromosome and its homologous chromosome (interchromosome pairing), without affecting intrachromosome pairing, would suggest that homologous presynaptic alignment was impaired. We used such an isochromosome system to determine which of the processes associated with chromosome pairing was affected by the Ph 1 gene of common wheat-the main gene that restricts pairing to homologues. Ph 1 reduced the frequency of interchromosome pairing without affecting intrachromosome pairing. In contrast, intrachromosome pairing was strongly reduced {{in the absence of}} the synaptic gene Syn-B 1. Premeiotic colchicine treatment, which drastically decreased pairing of conventional chromosomes, reduced interchromosome but not intrachromosome pairing. The results support the hypothesis that premeiotic alignment is a necessary stage for the regularity of meiotic pairing and that Ph 1 relaxes this alignment. We suggest that Ph 1 acts on premeiotic alignment of homologues and homeologues as a means of ensuring diploid-like meiotic behavior in polyploid wheat...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{findings}} indicate that synaptic facilitation, a cellular mechanism underlying sensitization of the siphon withdrawal response (SWR) in Aplysia, depends on a cascade of <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>events,</b> including activation of inositol triphosphate (IP 3) receptors and release of Ca 2 + from postsynaptic intracellular stores. These findings suggest that phospholipase C (PLC), the enzyme that catalyzes IP 3 formation, may {{play an important role}} in postsynaptic signaling during facilitation and learning in Aplysia. Using the PLC inhibitor U 73122, we found that PLC activity is required for synaptic facilitation following a 10 -min treatment with 5 -HT, as measured at 20 min after 5 -HT washout. Prior work has indicated that facilitation at this time is supported primarily by postsynaptic processes. To determine whether postsynaptic PLC activity is involved in 5 -HT–mediated facilitatory actions, we examined the effect of U 73122 on enhancement of the response of motor neurons isolated in cell culture to glutamate, the sensory neuron transmitter. A 10 -min application of 5 -HT induced persistent (> 40 min) enhancement of glutamate-evoked potentials (Glu-EPs) recorded from isolated motor neurons, and this enhancement was blocked by U 73122. Finally, we showed that injecting U 73122 into intact animals before behavioral training impaired intermediate-term sensitization, indicating that PLC activity contributes to this form of nonassociative learning...|$|R

The activation of these receptors triggers <b>postsynaptic</b> internal signaling <b>events</b> through protein kinase A which ultimately phosphorylate cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), inducing CREB-mediated changes in gene expression.|$|R
