40|$|Rice supply {{has become}} a major problem in Indonesia {{particularly}} {{in the last two decades}} when self-sufficiency is unable to be maintained. All available policy options to induce farmers to grow more rice are severely constrained. Hence, there is no choice for the Indonesian government except importing rice. Yet, government sometimes temporarily banned imported rice when rice supply is abundant to keep the paddy price at farmer level well above the procurement price. This policy is actually divergent to free trade agreements where all of trade barrier must be embedded on tariff. This study is conducted to analyze the impact of free trade and it consequences to the Indonesian Rice Economy. Data utilized in this study were secondary time-series data concerning Rice Economy in Indonesia from 1970 to 2002.

40|$|AbstractThe red ginger (Zingiber officinale. Rosc.) is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} plant of high economic value, with a harvest of 10 - 12 months. The export demand of red ginger rhizome has increased up to 20 - 22 % {{for the last}} five years and it has not been able to be sufficed by the red ginger <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Indonesia.</b> This situation happens because of the very limited amount of red ginger production area, a still very conventional method of red ginger cultivation and the low quantity of organic substances in the soil. Other than that the use of expensive inorganic fertilizers often increases the production cost of red ginger, besides from being unsafe to both the environment and also the health of humans. Various technological breakthrough innovations have been done in order to meet the needs of red ginger export, one of which is the use of the polybag cultivation system which utilizes the organic waste as a media composition. The combination of organic substances with the application of liquid organic fertilizers was expected to increase and improve the growth and yield of red ginger rhizome. The research was conducted at Agrotechnopark experimental field Jember University from January 2013 until June 2014. The aim of field experiment was to find out the effect of media compositions and organic fertilizer concentrations on growth and yield of red ginger rhizome (Zingiber officinale. Rosc.). The field experiment factorials (3 x 4) used in randomized block designs with three replications. The first factor is the media compositions (bokashi: charcoal husk: coco peat) consisting of three levels: M 1 (40 %: 30 %: 30 %), M 2 (50 %: 25 %: 25 %), and M 3 (60 %: 20 %: 20 %) and the second factor being the organic fertilizer concentration consisting of four levels: P 1 (0 cc/l), P 2 (1. 5 cc/l), P 3 (3 cc/l), and P 3 (4. 5 cc/l). The results of this study concluded that a single factor of various composition media (M) was not significantly influence on all the parameters of growth and yield of red ginger rhizome. The single factor of concentrations of liquid organic fertilizer (P) and the interaction of two factors treatments (MP) was significantly influence on all parameters of the growth and yield of red ginger rhizome. The combination of treatments (M 3 P 3) gave the best response to all parameters: plant height (58. 8 cm), number of leaves (25. 2), number of buds (35. 6), rhizome fresh weight per plant (2329. 64 g), total biomass (258. 14 g), zingeron level (1. 88 %) and oleoresin level (1. 57 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{has been}} seen as the manifestation of {{corporate}} citizenship or the contribution of corporations as part of society. As such, the initiatives and activities within the scope of CSR are often aimed at contributing to the society’s greater good. However, little has been discussed on the significance and implications of CSR activities in the context of plural, often conflicting, legal orders. This paper discusses a particular case when a CSR initiative overlaps with global private and national public regulations on sustainability. One of the most controversial issues in public and political debates on sustainability is the expansion of palm oil as a global commodity at the expense of forests in Indonesia. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and its standard launched in 2007 is a private multi-stakeholder regulation and was the only regulatory authority at both the global and national level to set rules for sustainable palm oil in palm oil producing countries. This changed when Indonesia, being the largest producer and exporter of palm oil, launched the mandatory Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) standard in 2011. Palm oil buyers generally demand compliance with the RSPO standard, while Indonesia insists that ISPO is the mandatory standard for palm oil <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Indonesia.</b> As a result, the regulatory system to govern sustainable palm oil in Indonesia has changed from a singular to a plural system. This plural legal order has become more diversified and complicated when in 2014 four very large palm oil companies committing themselves to zero deforestation production of palm oil through self-regulation and establishing the platform of the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP). Self-regulation is seen as one of the ‘new’ forms of CSR (Auld et al. 2008). The companies’ self-regulation may overlap with the requirements of the RSPO and ISPO. At the same time, their self-regulation may also conflict with the national regulation on plantations, which stipulate that concession holders cannot leave their entitlements idle and must clear the land to plant the oil palm. We analyze the process through which the large palm oil companies promote zero-deforestation and navigate across different regulatory authorities and systems. For this purpose, we use the concept of interlegality (de Sousa-Santos 1987), that refers to interactions between different standards, norms, principles among different legal orders. We also use the concept of governance interactions (Eberlein et al. 2014) to explore whether and how interactions at the actor level can be characterized in terms of competition, cooperation, cooptation or chaos. The paper contributes to policy debate on CSR in plural legal order by reflecting on the inception of the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) and the interactions of IPOP with Indonesian public authorities, leading to the termination of IPOP. The paper concludes that good intentions of zero-deforestation and sustainability standards of private companies that are stricter than those of public authorities, are not necessarily well accepted by these authorities. On the contrary, collective organization of CSR may be considered a threat to public authorities, certainly when these authorities perceive the standards as influenced by foreign powers and not beneficial for smallholders...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 The {{tropical}} {{food industry}} in Indonesia, {{as in many}} other developing countries, operates in an increasingly competitive and uncertain market environment, both domestically and internationally. At one level, the majority of tropical fruit <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Indonesia</b> are small producers, who face challenges in relation to product quality such as grading, standardisation, labelling, certification and branding. At another level, they are also subject to the impacts of international market forces. Given this, the Indonesian tropical fruit industry needs to develop its adaptive capacity to prosper and compete effectively with other countries in domestic and international markets. The recent political changes in Indonesia toward democratization have further exposed small tropical fruit producers to the effects of these competitive and uncertain market environments. However, {{in the face of these}} challenges, there are also opportunities. Emerging domestic markets for high quality produce in Indonesia have the potential to act as attractors and to contribute to restructuring and reshaping the conditions that will make tropical fruit industries more responsive. Thus strengthening their capacity to respond to such conditions is essential. Promoting the adoption of supply chain management practices has been acknowledged as one business strategy that could address these issues and thereby reduce poverty in rural communities. As a result, the Indonesian Government has shown their support for supply chain management as one of six key strategies to address horticulture business development. Changes in the government’s approach to agricultural marketing has seen the Indonesian Government facilitate partnerships aimed at helping small farmers to capitalise on the potential benefits and opportunities that are available under a more open market regime. In 2005, the Indonesian Government facilitated one fruit exporter to work closely with mango grower groups in supply chain building initiatives in Majalengka in West Java Province and Situbondo in East Java Province. This thesis was initially devoted to an examination of how these newly formed supply chains could be sustained, but in the course of the study it became apparent that both supply chains had largely failed. Thus, the research problem and the research questions for this thesis developed as events unfolded. Little is known about the conditions and processes that drive supply chain building activities in the context of developing countries, and even less is known about the reasons for failure and how these failures might be used to provide lessons for any future attempts by government to become involved in supply chain facilitation. As a result, this thesis focuses on understanding the complex processes that led to the failure of the supply chains in these two cases, and the lessons that can be drawn from them. Thus the research questions addressed in this thesis are: (1) In the cases studied, why did each mango supply chain fail shortly after it was formed? 1. 1 What were the dynamics of the interactions among actors, functions, rules and the system environment? 1. 2 How did the dynamics of these interactions lead to the termination of supply chain relationships? (2) What are the implications of the system behaviours in (1) above for practical management of mango supply chains in Indonesia? (3) What recommendations arise from (1) and (2) above for improving the process of supply chain alliance formation in Indonesian mango supply chains? Chapter 2 As a business strategy, supply chain management aims to develop the capacity of a chain to function as a learning organisation and to demonstrate properties such as competitiveness, agility and resilience. However, the literature suggests that alliance or supply chain formation is fraught with difficulties. Many studies of supply chain alliances have found that the major causes of termination relate to the fact that alliances are complex human systems. Surprisingly, very little research has attempted to use a body of theory known as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) to study alliance behaviour in the context of supply chains. The phenomenon of intervening in the process of supply chain formation and the subsequent collapse of the supply chains thus formed, can be viewed as an inability to build an adaptive system. CAS theories, along with the principles of supply chain management (Collins et al. 2004) are relevant to the study of such a phenomenon. CAS form a class of complex systems characterised by interactions among adaptive and interdependent agents and their environment, and producing emergent properties through mechanisms that are self organizing and transforming. CAS principles are rooted in complexity theories of natural science but they have been adopted and developed to understand the behaviours of human organisations. The behaviours of CAS are generated from interactions among agents in the systems who share schemata, or rules, and also from interactions between those agents and other actors and forces beyond the system. Two properties of CAS that are useful in the study of human alliances are self organisation and co-evolution. Therefore, CAS theories are relevant to the study of human systems because human systems are purposeful and follow rules which have been developed by the actors in those systems based on their experiences, their current knowledge and their expectations. CAS theories are also able to accommodate the fact that human systems may change in unpredictable ways as their behaviour is influenced by, and responds to, changes in the external environment. At the same time, SCM has been described as an adaptive strategy for responding to an increasingly competitive, complex and uncertain market environment. The formation and operation of alliances is central to effective SCM. Alliances have been studied intensively and theories have been developed to explain alliance behaviour that range from highly deterministic theories to those that are based on emergent processes such as co-evolution. Literature on SCM also indicates that in a volatile and uncertain environment, efficiency, value adding and competitiveness may not be enough to sustain supply chains. In such an environment, properties such as inter-organisational learning, agility and resilience are also necessary. These properties demonstrate that the supply chain as a system has the capacity to respond to and influence its environment. Therefore, this thesis develops a framework based on CAS theories and SCM principles, using it to understand the complex processes of formation and collapse of supply chains. CAS contributes to this framework by offering an explanation of the way in which complex systems behave and change as a result of dynamic interactions among their actors, functions, rules and environment. SCM principles provide a set of guidelines and a method of performance evaluation The six key principles of SCM are getting the product right, having a customer and consumer orientation, ensuring effective distribution and logistics, having a free flow of information and communication, building trust based relationships, and value creation and sharing among supply chain participants (Collins et al. 2004). These principles can be viewed as schemata for the supply chain as a CAS, so long as the principles are shared along the whole chain. Thus the combination of CAS and SCM not only helps in understanding the complex adaptive processes of supply chain formation and collapse, but it also highlights the importance of boundaries in building and sustaining supply chains. A few studies have acknowledged supply chain networks as CAS in terms of their management, but there is still a gap in the literature as to how supply chains as CAS behave during the critical supply chain formation stages. This research is devoted to understanding this phenomenon. Chapter 3 Through the lens of the complexity paradigm and informed by CAS characteristics, the formation and collapse of two supply chains were studied qualitatively, following retrospective cross-case study approach. Three periods of fieldwork were conducted across two case studies of newly formed mango supply chain relationships which collapsed soon after their formation. The case studies were located in two different regions in West Java and East Java, Indonesia. The data collected from this fieldwork was restructured into critical event series and incorporated into matrices based on the research framework, and causal loop models. Data analysis was undertaken using within-case and cross-case study methods. These methods were used to understand why and how the supply chains collapsed shortly after they formed. Learning from the failed supply chains, this research proposes some possibilities to improve the failed systems. A modified SAFE method has been used to evaluate the proposed system improvements. Chapter 4 The dynamics of supply chain environments play a substantial role in influencing the performance of the Indonesian mango industry. This industry operates in an environment of international competition and domestic uncertainty, particularly over the last decade. The situation has challenged agricultural development in Indonesia, particularly in the mango industry, and highlighted the need to pay more attention to the labour market and land utilization in rural areas. Meanwhile, domestic markets still consume most Indonesian mango production. Indonesia has an opportunity to serve international markets where mango availability is limited, but more effort is needed to address the requirements of these markets in terms of mango quality, safety issues and customer preferences. Government financial support is limited and cannot be relied upon as the sole source of energy for supply chain formation. Building supply chains requires ongoing energy to ensure sustainability and it is logical to expect that this energy will come from commercial transactions. Chapter 5 In West Java, through government intervention, a new relationship between an exporter, the government and mango growers and their associations was formed. Many actors in the village did not wish to be involved in this new relationship and local traders fought or competed with this ‘newcomer’. Only a few farmers joined the Mango Farmer Association and local traders and the existing exporters felt ‘threatened’ in this new environment. In addition, the high level of government intervention contributed to the system becoming quite exclusive and powerful. It is likely that the local traders’ perceptions of ‘unfair treatment’ by government officials triggered the negative feedback from the environment to the new system. This feedback was expressed in the form of direct objections made to the actors in the system, which influenced those actors to follow the traders’ rules rather than the new system’s rules. Although the exporter provided higher rewards for the farmers who followed the new rules, resistance of farmers still occurred in this relationship. As a result, the supply of mangoes to the exporter was limited and uncertain. Misunderstanding between the exporter and the mango farmers occurred as a result of incorrect information being shared among the mango farmers. In order to encourage more mango farmers to join the system and in responding to the lack of learning capacity of farmers, group leaders modified the rule relating to quality. The modification of this rule can be viewed as an adaptive compromise strategy, which weakened the feedback to farmers about market requirements. Due to this kind of adaptive compromise and inconsistent application of the rules, the farmers’ capacity to learn from the new system was diminished. Because of a lack of attention to the rule relating to quality, larger problems subsequently occurred, resulting in system failures. The supply chain members failed to respond quickly to these small system failures or to investigate their causes. This unpredictable response was never part of the original supply chain design. Rather it emerged as a property of the supply chain relationship between the Mango Farmer Association and one exporter that was facilitated by government officials. The collapse of the mango supply chain occurred largely due to its low performance in meeting consumer requirements in terms of both mango quantity and quality. Chapter 6 The same design of supply chain formation in West Java was applied in East Java. The formation of the mango supply chain in Situbondo, East Java, which was limited to the exporter and the leaders of the Union of Farmer Groups, showed greater learning capacity than the West Java export chain in meeting consumer requirements. However, this learning capacity alone was not able to sustain the system due to conditions of low trust, which were evident from the inception of the partnership. This study found that features such as trust, commitment, supply control and learning are critical in shaping interpersonal relationships. Initial low trust among the partners was one of the significant factors that led to the collapse of the new mango supply chain in Situbondo, East Java. The low trust was intensified because of the farmers’ experience with a previous partner. Under these conditions, some of the supply chain members were reluctant to join the partnership and were slow in responding to the new partner’s requirements. In response to this, the group leaders and local government tried to control the relationships between the farmers and the traders through an unwritten regulation. However, this mechanism failed to encourage the farmers to commit to the new relationship. Hence, the farmer group leaders tried to secure mango supply from the farmers by copying the strategies of the middlemen. Unlike the experience in West Java, the exporter in East Java was willing to take risks to improve the learning process with the mango farmers. For example, the exporter still paid for mangoes that were not suitable for export, as this was a part of the trial and error process in pursuing value for consumers. Such a learning process requires stakeholders to take responsibility for their learning and there was little resistance to learning from feedback due to the open communication among the supply chain members. Under these conditions the number of farmers grew due to high levels of interaction among the supply chain members and increased awareness of the expected benefits of the partnership. However, the supply chain arrangements eventually collapsed as the exporter withdrew from the arrangement because international customers showed insufficient interest in the mango variety marketed from Situbondo. Chapter 7 The supply chain systems were set up with high expectations, production levels well under target, ineffective rewards and with the marginalization of the intermediaries’ roles that were previously critical to the operation of the traditional system for the marketing of mangoes. Setting up the systems in this manner increased the resistance of other players in the traditional supply chains. The process of establishing the new supply chains was more concerned with addressing market goals, technical issues and applying reward strategies and thus, neglected to focus on building trust and effective relationships among the stakeholders, which made it difficult to ensure commitment to the relationships. The interventions in the systems and the decision to manage the supply chains in a mechanistic way to meet predetermined goals reduced the capacity of the supply chains to be adaptive. The evolution of the systems reflected a vicious cycle, as today’s problems were created from yesterday’s solutions. The combination of these processes contributed to low system performance and discouraged the actors from sustaining their relationships. The cross case study reveals that the low performance of the supply chains in both cases resulted from two processes. Firstly, the supply chains were involved in dynamic interactions with their environments. Secondly, adaptation by individuals was influenced by the ability to learn and the presence or absence of resistance to change. The initial state or condition of the two systems was similar but the systems tended to diverge over time and as each system entered new states. The initial conditions of the mango supply chains in the two cases involved long and segmented chains. The intervention in these systems by applying a similar design to the two cases resulted in the first changed system state. The second condition of the systems showed evidence of divergence, as the competing rules that emerged between the systems and their environments generated different responses in each case. In West Java, the resistance within the system was lower than in East Java, but the resistance of the environment was higher in West Java than in East Java. Under either condition, the systems became unstable. The third condition of the systems was characterised by strong market competition from their outside environment. This resulted in low commitment of the actors, particularly in relation to following the rules of the exporter in West Java as compared to East Java. The fourth state of the systems was characterised by higher resistance, conflict and low trust in the partner, particularly in West Java. In its fifth condition the system was close to collapse, even though it appeared more stable in East Java than in West Java due to the adoption of compromise behaviour by participants. The end state of both systems was collapse, marked by the main actor moving out of the system. To summarise, the system conditions in West Java were quite unstable and subject to external resistance, while in East Java the system tended to be more stable toward the end, but nevertheless resulted in collapse of the export supply chain arrangement. The systems displayed resistance which emerged from: the clumsy intervention, particularly in setting up the system or improper processes for formulating rules leading to rejection of the system by the environment; incompatible functions; and failure to consider the uncertain supply chain environment due to high competition and low trust. The practical management of these new mango supply chains faced significant challenges, as the systems were designed based on clumsy and misguided interventions. The systems’ learning process of supply chain formation was found to be a spontaneous process that had the potential to hinder or foster development. In the context of the supply chain relationships in the two case studies, the adjustment behaviours of chain members and their changing functions and rules, likely increased the risks to the performance of the supply chains. Further to this, these behaviours also increased delays and misperceptions amongst the supply chain members in applying the key principles of supply chain management. Chapter 8 Given the implications for supply chain formation and management, it is necessary to consider improvement of the systems in three areas: designing the system, measuring the system performance, and the processes of supply chain formation. The initiatives proposed in this thesis aim to improve the system based on learning from the cases of supply chain failure. The improvements focus on increasing learning capacity, establishing commitment of all supply chain stakeholders, and reducing the resistance of the environment to the existence of the supply chains by considering the system boundaries. Six major lessons from system failure have been identified: lack of participation; clumsy intervention; customers’ dissatisfaction; low capability to learn from mistakes; the dangers of excluding intermediaries; and building supply chains concerned with sustainability. Various strategies for system improvement are proposed and these meet the major evaluation requirements for sustainability, acceptability, feasibility and efficiency, except for the proposals relating to selecting partners and organizational arrangements. In conditions of low trust between supply chain members, there is a great challenge in selecting partners and establishing an effective organization among producers. Capacity building could be the most acceptable strategy for improving supply chain performance. The most feasible and efficient strategies in supply chain formation for the Indonesian context illustrated by the case studies is by eliminating the government role as controllers working within the supply chain systems. Chapter 9 There are four ways in which this research is significant. First, it reveals that supply chain formation involves a series of complex adaptive processes which can be understood in terms of CAS theory. Second, this thesis makes a theoretical contribution with regard to understanding the dynamics of supply chain formation and collapse and also what occurs in these systems after collapse. Third, it demonstrated the application of the SAFE method as an evaluation tool for the proposed system improvements, with certain modifications. Finally, through the combined lens of CAS/SCM, the research also found that this approach is effective for understanding the processes of supply chain formation and collapse. A limitation of this research relates to its focus on the study of failure in supply chains, which can be quite different from studying success stories, particularly with regard to the feelings of stakeholders and participants when discussing failure. It is also important to consider the international actors involved as customers in those supply chains. This research was limited by the inability to incorporate direct feedback from international customers in...|$|E
