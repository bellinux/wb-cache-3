25|$|This {{speculation}} {{also involves}} theories concerning whether Mallory and Irvine could {{have managed to}} climb the Second Step. Òscar Cadiach {{was the first to}} climb it in 1985 free and rated it V+. Conrad Anker led an experiment to free climb this section without using the “Chinese ladder” for assistance, since that equipment was not installed in 1924. In 1999, he did not manage a complete free climb as he <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> briefly on the ladder when it blocked the only available foothold. At that time he rated the difficulty of the Second Step as 5.10—well outside of Mallory's capability. In June 2007, Anker returned {{as a member of the}} Altitude Everest Expedition 2007, and with Leo Houlding successfully free-climbed the Second Step, after removing the “Chinese ladder” (which was later replaced). Houlding rated the climb at 5.9, just within Mallory's estimated capabilities. Theo Fritsche climbed the step free solo on-sight in 2001 and rated it V+.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on Australia's {{involvement}} in the Vietnam War, Wilton considered that it was justified, and that the West's intervention helped delay the takeover of South Vietnam, {{and the spread of}} communism to Laos and Cambodia, by almost a decade. [...] "Whether that was worthwhile", he added, [...] "is a matter for the historian to judge". The key lesson, he felt, was not to intervene in a conflict [...] "unless you are prepared to win", because it was [...] "not something that you can just <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> in and feel the temperature".|$|E
500|$|Rix {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth between her two ailing family members until, on 2 September 1914, Elsie died. For three months Rix withheld the news from her mother, fearing it would harm her already fragile condition. Elizabeth survived the news, but as the war continued, Rix's artistic output dwindled almost to nothing. Then in March 1916, Elizabeth died. Rix was just over thirty years old, and all her immediate relatives were now dead. Recalling the experience, she later wrote: [...] "I could scarcely <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> {{in front of the other}} and walked like an old thing".|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{hold that}} Ludwig {{was murdered by}} his enemies while {{attempting}} to escape from Berg. One account suggests that the king was shot. The King's personal fisherman, Jakob Lidl (1864–1933), stated, [...] "Three years after the king's death I was made {{to swear an oath}} that I would never say certain things — not to my wife, not on my deathbed, and not to any priest … The state has undertaken to look after my family if anything should happen to me in either peacetime or war." [...] Lidl kept his oath, at least orally, but left behind notes which were found after his death. According to Lidl, he had hidden behind bushes with his boat, waiting to meet the king, in order to row him out into the lake, where loyalists were waiting to help him escape. [...] "As the king stepped up to his boat and <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> in it, a shot rang out from the bank, apparently killing him on the spot, for the king fell across the bow of the boat." [...] However, the autopsy report indicates no scars or wounds found on the body of the dead king; on the other hand, many years later Countess Josephine von Wrba-Kaunitz would show her afternoon tea guests a grey Loden coat with two bullet holes in the back, asserting it was the one Ludwig was wearing. Another theory suggests that Ludwig died of natural causes (such as a heart attack or stroke) brought on by the cool water (12°C) of the lake during an escape attempt.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of stance-direction used by snowboarders. A [...] "regular" [...] stance places the rider's left foot {{at the front of the}} snowboard. [...] "Goofy", the {{opposite}} stance direction, places the rider's right foot at the front, as in skateboarding. Regular is the most common. There are different ways to determine whether a rider is [...] "regular" [...] or [...] "goofy". One method used for first time riders is to observe the first step forward when walking or climbing up stairs. The first foot forward would be the foot set up at the front of the snowboard. Another method used for first time riders is to use the same foot that you kick a football with as your back foot (though this can be an inaccurate sign for some, as there are people who prefer goofy though are right handed, and therefore naturally kick a football with their right foot). This is a good method for setting up the snowboard stance for a new snowboarder. However having a surfing or skateboarding background will also help a person determine their preferred stance, although not all riders will have the same stance skateboarding and snowboarding. Another way to determine a rider's stance is to get the rider to run and slide on a tiled or wooden floor, wearing only socks, and observe which foot the person puts forward during the slide. This simulates the motion of riding a snowboard and exposes that persons natural tendency to put a particular foot forward. Another method is to stand behind the first-timer and give them a shove, enough for them to <b>put</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> forward to stop themselves from falling. Other good ways of determining which way you ride are rushing a door (leading shoulder equals leading foot) or going into a defensive boxing stance (see which foot goes forward).|$|E

50|$|In a {{competitive}} or disciplinary context especially, {{it is not}} rare to use more difficult or unpleasant variations, e.g., in mud, gravel, snow or dirt, hot ground, divested, and/or to make it physically harder, as by <b>putting</b> <b>one's</b> <b>foot</b> or a weight on the performer's back (possibly with sanctions if equilibrium is lost, such as spilling a glass) or to do the exercise resting on the knuckles or not use all fingers (not counting the thumb).|$|R

5000|$|In Adam Hochschild's 1998 book King Leopold's Ghost, Hochschild characterizes Afonso as a [...] "selective modernizer" [...] {{because he}} welcomed European {{scientific}} innovation {{and the church}} but refused to adopt Portugal's legal code and sell land to prospectors.

60|$|The indecency of {{the whole}} place struck Mrs. Chailey forcibly. There were no blinds to shut out the sun, nor was there any {{furniture}} to speak of for the sun to spoil.

As for hot water--at this point her investigations left her speechless.|$|R
