40|$|At the {{transition}} from the Permian to the Triassic, Eurasia was the site of voluminous flood-basalt extrusion and rifting. Major flood-basalt provinces occur in the Tunguska, Taymyr, Kuznetsk, Verkhoyansk - Vilyuy and Pechora areas, {{as well as in the}} South Chinese Emeishen area. Contemporaneous rift systems developed in the West Siberian, South Kara Sea and Pyasina Khatanga areas, on the Scythian platform and in the West European and Arctic-North Atlantic domain. At the <b>Permo</b> Triassic transition, major extensional stresses affected apparently Eurasia, and possibly also Pangea, as evidenced by the development of new rift systems. Contemporaneous flood-basalt activity, inducing a global environmental crisis, is interpreted as related to the impingement of major mantle plumes on the base of the Eurasian lithosphere. Moreover, the Permo-Triassic transition coincided with a period of regional uplift and erosion and a low-stand in sea level. <b>Permo</b> Triassic rifting and mantle plume activity occurred together with a major reorganization of plate boundaries and plate kinematics that marked {{the transition}} from the assembly of Pangea to its break-up. This plate reorganization was possibly associated with a reorganization of the global mantle convection system. On the base of the geological record, we recognize short-lived and long-lived plumes with a duration of magmatic activity of some 10 - 20 million years and 100 - 150 million years, respectively. The Permo-Triassic Siberian and Emeishan flood-basalt provinces are good examples of "short-lived" plumes, which contrast with such "long lived" plumes as those of Iceland and Hawaii. The global record indicates that mantle plume activity occurred episodically. Purely empirical considerations indicate that times of major mantle plume activity are associated with periods of global mantle convection reorganization during which thermally driven mantle convection is not fully able to facilitate the necessary heat transfer from the core of the Earth to its surface. In this respect, we distinguish between two geodynamically different scenarios for major plume activity. The major <b>Permo</b> Triassic plume event followed the assembly Pangea and the detachment of deep-seated subduction slabs from the lithosphere. The Early-Middle Cretaceous major plume event, as well as the terminal-Cretaceous Paleocene plume event, followed a sharp acceleration of global sea-floor spreading rates and the insertion of new subduction zone slabs deep into the mantle. We conclude that global plate kinematics, driven by mantle convection, have a bearing on the development of major mantle plumes and, to a degree, also on the pattern of related flood-basalt magmatism. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} {{configuration of}} SW Japan mainly reflects a late Jurassic-early Cretaceous orogeny. The region {{is divided into}} an inner belt and an outer belt, on the Japan sea and Pacific ocean sides respectively, by a strike-slip fault, the Median Tectonic Line (MTL). Both consist {{of a series of}} stacked nappes. The inner belt is divided into a Jurassic olistostrome known as the Tanba zone and a hinterland area comprising continental Triassic-Jurassic sediments. The Tanba zone is sliced into two units: a lower one with late Jurassic matrix and Triassic-early Jurassic radiolarite olistoliths, tectonically overthrust by an upper unit comprising an olistostrome with middle Jurassic matrix and blocks which include late Paleozoic limestone, basic lava, and radiolarite. The Tanba zone is overthrust by a Paleozoic nappe complex derived from the hinterland. The basal sole of the nappe corresponds to a peculiar unit called the ultra-Tanba zone.

The composition of carbonate rocks rich in Mn and Ba and low in Sr {{is consistent with a}} marine tidal depositional environment of lagoonal type where high-Mg calcite deposition predominates and mildly evaporitic conditions favoured the formation of anorganic micritic limestones, sometimes containing minor amounts of evaporitic elements (Ba). The low Sr levels suggest post-depositional diagenetic processes in which fresh water acts as diagenizing solution.

A paleogeographic reconstruction of the Early- Middle Triassic environment of southern Tuscany is presented. The Verrucano sedimentary sequence was deposited in continental basins (graben) developed during a distensive phase after the Hercynian orogeny not far from the coast, under semi-arid conditions. The continental sedimentation was interrupted by limited marine ingressions during which coastal lagoons were established that were suitable for limited carbonate sedimentation...|$|E

40|$|The Cheshin meta-calcareous rocks (<b>Permo</b> Triassic) in {{southeast}} Hamedan outcrop {{in association with}} a variety of pelitic schists and hornfels rocks. The intrusion of the Alvand Batholith (Jurassic age) into pelitic and calcareous host rocks has produced metamorphic rocks in the Hamedan area (Cheshin village). On the basis of the dominance of calcite/dolomite, silicate and ore minerals, the calcareous rocks can be divided into two groups: a) marbles and calc-silicates; b) skarn rocks. The ore bodies occur in a contact zone between sillimanite-hornfels and calc-silicate rocks and formed the skarn rocks. Based on mineralogy, skarn rocks in the studied area consist mainly of diopside, garnet, tremolite, vesuvianite, epidote and ore minerals (magnetite and hematite). The skarnification processes occurred at two stages: (1) prograde metamorphism; and (2) retrograde metamorphism. The first stage involved prograde metasomatism and anhydrous minerals such as garnet and pyroxene formed. Second stage of retrograde skarn development is also recognized. In addition to Fe, Si and Mg, substantial amounts of Fe, along with volatile components were added to the skarn system. Consequently, considerable amounts of hydrous minerals, oxides and carbonates replaced the anhydrous minerals in the host rocks and hydrous minerals such as epidote+chlorite+amphibole formed. Using multiple equilibria by THERMOCALC® program, temperature (630 ºC), pressure (4 kbar), and fluid composition (XCO 2 as low as 0. 17) have been calculated for the formation of the calc-silicate rocks. Skarn mineralogy shows good agreement with these calculations. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMany {{large-scale}} dynamic processes, from continental rifting {{to plate}} subduction, are intimately linked to metamorphicreactions. This close relation between geodynamic processes and metamorphic reactions is, in spite ofappearances, yet poorly understood. For example, during extension processes, rocks {{will be exposed}} to importanttemperature, pressures and stress changes. Meanwhile less {{attention has been paid}} to other important aspects ofthe metamorphic processes. When reacting rocks expand and contract, density and volume changes will set up inthe surrounding material. While several tectonic models are proposed to explain the formation of extensive basins and passive margins (simple shear detachment mantle exhumation [...] ) a single thermal model (McKenzie, 1978), as a dogma, is usedto understanding and modeling the formation and evolution of sedimentary basins. This model is based on theassumption that the extension is only by pure shear and it is instantaneous. Under this approach, the sedimentarydeposits occur in two stages. i) A short step, 1 to 10 Ma, controlled by tectonics. ii) A longer step, at least 50 Maas a result of the thermal evolution of the lithosphere. However, most stratigraphic data indicate that less thermal model can account for documented vertical movements. The study of the thermal evolution, coupled with other tectonic models, and its consequences have never beenstudied in detail, although the differences may be significant and it is clear that the petrological changes associatedwith changes in temperature conditions, influence changes reliefs. In addition, it seems that the relationship between basin formation and thermal evolution is not always the same:- Sometimes the temperature rise above 50 to 100 Ma tectonic extension. In the Alps, a significant rise in geothermalgradient <b>Permo</b> -Triassic followed by a "cold" extension, leading to the opening of the Ligurian- Piedmontocean, from the Middle Jurassic. - Other examples show that temperature changes are synchronous with basin formation.

40|$|The Greater Caucasus (GC) fold-and-thrust belt {{lies on the}} {{southern}} deformed edge of the Scythian Platform (SP) and results from the Cenoozoic structural inversion of a deep marine Mesozoic basin {{in response to the}} northward displacement of the Transcaucasus (lying south of the GC subsequent to the Arabia-Eurasia collision. A review of existing and newly acquired data has allowed a reconstruction of the GC history through the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. In <b>Permo(?)</b> -Triassic times, rifting developed along at least {{the northern part of the}} belt. Structural inversion of the basin occurred during the Late Triassic corresponding to the Eo-Cimmerian orogeny, documented SE of the GC and probably linked to the accretion of what are now Iranian terranes along the continental margin. Renewed development of extensional basin formation in the area of the present-day GC began in Sinemurian-Pliensbachian times with rift activity encompassing the Mid-Jurassic. Rifting led to extreme thinning of the underlying continental crust by the Aalenian and concomitant extrusion of mid-ocean ridge basalt lavas. A Bathonian unconformity is observed on both sides of the basin and may either correspond to the end of active rifting and the onset of post-rift basin development or be the record of collision further south along the former Mesozoic active margin. The post-rift phase began with deposition of Late Jurassic platform-type sediments onto the margins and a flysch-like unit in its deeper part, which has transgressed the basin during the Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic. An initial phase of shortening occurred in the Late Eocene under a NE-SW compressional stress regime. A second shortening event that began in the Mid-Miocene (Sarmatian), accompanied by significant uplift of the belt, continues at present. It is related to the final collision of Arabia with Eurasia and led to the development of the present-day south-vergent GC fold-and-thrust belt. Some north-vergent retrothrusts are present in the western GC and a few more in the eastern GC, where a fan-shaped belt can be observed. The mechanisms responsible for the large-scale structure of the belt remain a matter of debate because the deep crustal structure of the GC is not well known. Some (mainly Russian) geoscientists have argued that the GC is an inverted basin squeezed between deep (near) -vertical faults representing the boundaries between the GC and the SP to the north and the GC and the Transcaucasus to the south. Another model, supported in part by the distribution of earthquake hypocentres, proposes the existence of south-vergent thrusts flattening at depth, along which the Transcaucasus plunges beneath the GC and the SP. In this model, a thick-skinned mode of deformation prevailed in the central part of the GC whereas the western and eastern parts display the attributes of thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belts, although, in general, the two styles of deformation coexist along the belt. The present-day high elevation observed only in the central part of the belt would have resulted from the delamination of a lithospheric root. © The Geological Society of London 2006...|$|E
40|$|This {{geological}} {{study on}} the Vicentinian Alps is mainly {{an analysis of the}} tectonic and paleomagnetic data, collected by the author in the years 1959, 1960, and 1961. The stratigraphy is based for the greater part on data published in the first decenniums of this century. In the westtern part of the region the exposed basement consists of quartz -phyllites. The age of the strata overlying the basement ranges from Permian, to Miocene. During the Permian and the Mesozoic, sedimentation was mainly the result of a slow subsidence and a supply of clastic material from a land in the south (northern Adria and Po-block). Facieschanges are due to WNW-ESE trending uplifts, accompanied by magmatic (volcanic) activity (the Schio-Recoaro horst). In the late Cretaceous the southern land area subsided and the Alpine geanticline began to rise. The sedimentation in the Tertiary was mainly controlled by the presence of this source area in the north. In this period changes in facies took place also,which were mainly controlled by NNW-SSE trending uplifts (e. g. EuganeiBerici- Lessini horst). Volcanic activity is known to have taken place in the Vicentinian Alps in various periods. Next to basaltic dikes of either devonian or early permian age, two major volcanic periods can be distinguished; the Permo-Triassic and the Tertiary. During the Permo-Triassic mostly acid magmas intruded and effusive rocks were formed in either marine or terrestrial environment. During the Tertiary mostly basic magmas ascended, forming thick tuff- and lava deposits. It is noteworthy that the centres of maximal volcanic activity moved from southwest to northeast in the early Tertiary The tectonics are rather complex and may be ass igned to three tectogenetic periods. The first comprises the Hercynic orogenesis, in which two phases can be distinguished, one of subvertical movements (primary tectonics) and another of subhorizontal movements (secondary tectonics). During the first the region was elevated and heavily eroded; the second caused WNW-dipping overthrust and NNE-SSW striking folds (originally, Le. prior to the permotriassic rotation as determined by paleomagnetic data, the overthrust planes were dipping WSW and the fold axes were E-W. The second tectogenetic period is of permo-triassic age. At this time, a horst-like doming-up was caused in het Valli-Becoaro area by ascending basic magmas in an ENE-WSW striking zone of weakness. Originally, this zone had a WNW-ESE direction (see paleo-mag-. netism). Normal faults were formed,striking ENE-WSW (dipping north or south) and NNW-SSE (dipping east or west). The thi I'd tectogenetic period coincided with the alpine orogenesis. The Vicentinian region was located on the intersection of two hinge zones. One is ENEWSW and lies between the rising Alpine geanticline and the subsiding Adria mass; the other is NW-SE and forms the northern flank of the subsiding Po area. In both hinge belts the basement and the sedimentary cover reacted differently to differential vertical movements. In the basement, the older, <b>permo</b> - triassic zones of weakness were reactivated;ENEWSW striking step faults, dipping south, were formed as reaction to the subsidence of the Adria mass and NNW-SSE faults dipping east originated on the NE-side of the Po geosyncline. This second set of faults is closely related to the doming-up along the northeastern margin of the subsiding Po region, which can be interpreted as a correction of the isostatic equilibrium. The updoming was accompanied by volcank acti vity. The centra of volcanic acti viiy shifted northeastward (each time over about 30 km) between upper Cretaceous and Oligocene. The sedimentary cover slided off the south flank of the alpine geanticline to the south ("decollement "); this caused approximately E-W (Tauern-decollement) and NNE -SSW trending fold axes (Oetzdecollement). Only the former have been of importance in the Vicentinian Alps. These southward movements of the sedimentary cover were locally obstructed by the permo-triassic horst ("bufferzone"), causing the fold axes there to be striking NE-SW. In the younger Tertiary, NNE -SSW sinistral wrench faults caused anti -clockwise rotations of minor blocks. From paleomagnetic data of permotriassic and tertiary rocks may be concluded that NE-Italy has been subjected to majol' translations and rotations since the Permian. Three relatively fixed points are known. Firstly, the present position of the region (450 45 ' N. L., 110 30 ' E. L.). Secondly, the position in the Eocene (NE-Italy must have been located on the + 500 isocline of the Eocene, which runs across the present position of southern Italy). Thirdly, the position during the Permian (NE-Italy was probably on the intersection of the permian - 300 isocline and the Tethys zone; this point is at the present location of the western Himalayas). Two major movements may be distinguished: awestdrift of the region during the Permian and Mesozoic (over maxima 14800 km) and a northdrift during the Tertiary (over 800 km). During the westdrift, the Vicentinian region rotated about 600 anti-clockwise in the late Triass ic. This rotation corresponds with right lateral shear movements along {{the north side of the}} Tethys zone. The northward movement of the region during the Tertiary may have been caused by a NW drift of Africa...|$|E
