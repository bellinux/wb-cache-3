40|$|Frothers are {{surface-active}} agents used in flotation {{to decrease}} bubble size and promote froth stability. The common frothers are alcohols and <b>polyglycols.</b> One means to classify frothers {{is by the}} extent of bubble size reduction. Bubble size measurement is labour-intensive and this thesis explores the use of gas holdup as a surrogate for bubble size. Nine frothers with different chemical structures were tested in a bubble column equipped with instrumentation to measure bubble size and gas holdup. A correlation between frother structure and gas holdup is observed: for alcohols, gas holdup increases with hydrocarbon chain length and whether branched or straight chain {{does not seem to}} matter; and for <b>polyglycols,</b> gas holdup increases with number of propoxy groups. The ranking of the frother on the basis of gas holdup is the same as that given by other methods. The assumed unique relationship between gas holdup and bubble size is examined. For a given frother the relationship appears to hold. Evidence is presented that the continued increase in gas holdup at high frother concentration is correlated with a continued decrease in bubble size. When comparing frothers, however, it is shown that for equal gas holdup bubble size can be quite different. The effect is discussed in terms of bubble velocity in the swarm...|$|R

40|$|Concentrators {{processing}} platinum group mineral (PGM) bearing ores use polysaccharide depressants {{to reduce}} {{the recovery of the}} naturally floatable gangue minerals (mainly silicates) present in the ores. Recent work has shown that high depressant dosage can completely depress the naturally floatable gangue from reporting to the concentrate. Unfortunately, this high dosage of depressant can {{have a negative effect on}} the recovery of valuable minerals present in the ore by reducing the stability of the froth. In order to counterbalance the negative effects of depressant addition, frothers are normally added. The optimum frother provides a balance between the pulp kinetics and the froth recovery (through the effect of the frother on the bubble size and froth stability, respectively) over the range of frother addition. Usually one frother is added to accomplish this but using only one frother gives only one unique hydrodynamic relationship. It would be preferable to have independent control over the bubble size and froth stability, but unfortunately this cannot be achieved because changing the concentration of the frother changes both responses. An alternative strategy for gaining more independent control over the froth characteristics and bubble size would be to use a blend of frothers, such as a weak and a stronger frother. Such a system would give an additional degree of freedom so that changing the ratio of the two frothers would provide more independent control of bubble Sauter mean diameter and froth stability. Little research work has been conducted on frother blends and none suggests the mechanism of blended frother action. This study investigates through the use of batch flotation tests how blending low molecular weight alcohols with commercially available high molecular weight frothers impacts the solids and water recovery, as well as the valuable mineral recovery and concentrate grade, in different PGM ores. The results are compared with laboratory batch flotation tests using single frothers only. Two ores from the Merensky Reef in the Bushveld Igneous Complex, South Africa, were used.

Using the same method but lowering the initial column temperature to 50 ~ we were able to obtain a significantly better separation ofthese glycols na similar column (HP- 5 MS-ultra low bleed, 5 % diphenyl- 95 % dimethylpolysiloxane).
