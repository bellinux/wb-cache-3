5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large <b>part,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> living conditions of England's working poor. Some {{have embraced the}} Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no better {{now than it was}} at the time of Orwell's writing.|$|E
5|$|In the Faris Nyannyan Ending, Okabe {{decides to}} not send the D-Mail {{that results in}} the death of Faris' father to try to stop the loss of the IBN 5100 computer. He instead sends a {{different}} D-Mail in an attempt to convince Faris' father to not <b>part</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> IBN computer. Beyond 1% divergence is achieved, but the divergence meter gives a strange output and none of Okabe's friends have any memories of him. In this worldline, Okabe and Faris are a couple and live together, participating in Rainet Access Battlers card game tournaments. Although disappointed that none of his friends remember him, Okabe is still satisfied {{that he was able to}} prevent Mayuri's death. He decides to build a new life with Faris at his side.|$|E
5|$|Often, castles {{constructed}} {{before the}} age of gunpowder were incapable of using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower <b>part</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.|$|E

5|$|The Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez circuit {{underwent}} substantial reconfiguration in the build-up to the event. The first corner complex was tightened on entry, {{while the}} middle {{part of the}} track was completely re-profiled, retaining much of the original design whilst reducing the reliance on aerodynamic grip. The most significant changes {{were made in the}} final <b>part,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Peraltada corner cut in half and the circuit redirected through the Foro Sol stadium complex in the circuit infield beginning with turn 12, following a similar layout to the one used by Champ Car between 2002 and 2007. The track layout featured two drag reduction system (DRS) zones, one on the main straight and another between turns three and four.|$|E
5|$|The Iowa {{class has}} become {{culturally}} symbolic in the United States {{in many different}} ways, {{to the point where}} certain elements of the American public—such as the United States Naval Fire Support Association—are unwilling to <b>part</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> battleships despite their apparent obsolescence in the face of modern naval combat doctrine that places great emphasis on air supremacy and missile firepower. Although all have been officially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register they have been spared scrapping and were donated for use as museum ships.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of the {{execution}} reached Elizabeth, she became indignant and asserted that Davison had disobeyed her instructions not to <b>part</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> warrant and that the Privy Council had acted without her authority. Elizabeth's vacillation and deliberately vague instructions gave her plausible deniability, to attempt to avoid the direct stain of Mary's blood. Davison was arrested, thrown into the Tower of London, and found guilty of misprision. He was released 19 months later after Cecil and Walsingham interceded on his behalf.|$|E

5|$|Four middle-aged {{friends who}} {{have known each other}} since sixth form, Baxter (John Simm), Quinn (Philip Glenister), Rick (Marc Warren) and Woody (Max Beesley), get {{together}} for a holiday in Majorca at the villa of Alvo (Ben Chaplin), a mutual friend who became wealthy in the property business. Over time Alvo's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and he is later killed by a man in a Tony Blair mask for taking a drug boat the group used earlier. The four clean the boat to remove evidence of their presence, when they are mistaken for drug dealers and paid three million euros. Afterwards, the four learn from María (María Botto), a local detective, that they are caught up in a Serbian mafia drug smuggling operation. Using video camera footage of their holiday, Baxter learns the real perpetrators are corrupt police officers, including María and her superior Dominic (Tim Woodward). Alvo is revealed {{to be a part of}} the operation, and was murdered when he no longer wanted to take part in it. María later attempts to kill the four when employing scare tactics to make them <b>part</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cash fails to work, but is shot to death by Quinn. The other three run over Dominic to save Quinn. They leave with the money and accidentally board a ferry to Ibiza (their intention is to go to Barcelona).|$|E
5|$|The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment complemented the {{existing}} garrison at Fort Pitt: the 8th Pennsylvania and 9th (formerly 13th) Virginia Regiments. The men of these Pennsylvania and Virginia line infantry units had been {{recruited from the}} central and western frontier counties of the two states and {{were assigned to the}} army's Western Department while at Valley Forge, reflecting a clear logic on Washington's <b>part.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Rawlings' regiment, Western Department commander Col. Daniel Brodhead now led a force of largely frontier raised men experienced in Indian-style woodlands warfare. In his most notable tactical achievement, Brodhead headed a campaign of about 600 of his Continental regulars, which included the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, local militia, and volunteers to the upper waters of the Allegheny River in August and September 1779, where they destroyed the villages and crops of hostile Mingo and Munsee Indians. Brodhead's expedition was part of Washington's wide-ranging, coordinated offensive of the summer of 1779 that also included the larger, concurrent Sullivan Campaign led by Maj. Gen. John Sullivan and Brig. Gen. James Clinton against enemy Iroquois and Loyalist units in southern and western New York State. From mid-1779 until late 1780, however, the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was primarily deployed in detachments to support line infantry contingents at several of the frontier outposts in the general vicinity of Fort Pitt, including Fort Laurens, Fort McIntosh, and Fort Henry (Wheeling) in what is now eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and northernmost West Virginia, respectively.|$|E
