To generate a 2 -state PWM digital wave each p-bit noise shaped and oversampled sample is compared to a digital sawtooth waveform. The 3 -state PWM modulator is realized using two 2 -state PWM modulators, one for positive input samples and the other for negative samples: after controlling the sign of each sample only one of the two 2 -state modulators is enabled. Although 3 -state PWM modulation doubles the cost of the 2 -state one the complexity of the whole system is comparable. Indeed, as shown in Section 4, the overall digital circuitry complexity is dominated by the noise shaping and oversampling filters which are common to 3 - and 2 -state PWM.

40|$|LED lighting, as the {{fourth-generation}} lighting technology, {{is developing}} rapidly {{over the past}} years due to its high energy efficiency, longer life span and sustainability compared to incandescent light bulbs and CFLs. Today’s stand-alone LED drivers for professional lighting systems contain two cascaded power converters: an input and an <b>output</b> <b>power</b> <b>stage.</b> The <b>output</b> <b>power</b> <b>stage</b> drives the LED load with constant average current to achieve a uniform light output without visible light flicker and stroboscopic effects. The input power stage is a boost converter which acts as a power factor corrector (PFC), providing to the mains a power factor (PF) of at least 0. 9 and a constant average supply voltage to the <b>output</b> <b>power</b> <b>stage.</b> In high-end LED drivers, both the boost PFC converter as well as the converter in the <b>output</b> <b>power</b> <b>stage</b> are digitally controlled by a PI controller. The PFC controller currently being used has a low bandwidth as to not interfere with the power factor correction function. Because of this low bandwidth, disturbance from mains and load will be transferred to the boost PFC output capacitor, which, on its turn, can lead to undesired visible light effects if these disturbances are too large. The thesis aims at improving the dynamic response of the boost PFC converter without sacrificing PF/THD performance. Three solutions: 1. Digital notch/comb filter 2. Input voltage feedforward 3.

40|$|This Paper {{presents}} a methodology {{for the design}} of analog circuits. Under this methodology, the ports of all circuit blocks are bidirectional. The stability of circuits designed following this methodology can be determined by local, rather than global,analysis. If the circuit blocks follow a certain design discipline, they can be connected in nearly arbitrary configurations while maintaining stability. This methodology may be applied to designing circuits that solve several classes of problems. In particular, it is applied to designing a small circuit that can build a model of a memory less nonlinear system, and to predistort to linearize this system. First, this document shows how this methodology can be used to solve basic con-strained optimization problems in analog circuits. Given a set of constraint equations, it shows how to build a circuit that will solve that set of equations. This circuit is sufficiently small that it can be used for simple analog processing in basic analog circuits; for instance, it may be used to set optimal bias currents for another circuit.

40|$|Most {{monolithic}} amplifiers cannot supply {{more than}} a few hundred milliwatts of <b>output</b> <b>power.</b> Standard IC processing techniques set device supply levels at 36 V, limiting available output swing. Additionally, supplying currents beyond tens of milliamperes requires large output transistors and causes undesirable IC power dissipation. Many applications, however, require greater <b>output</b> <b>power</b> than most monolithic amplifiers will deliver. When voltage or current gain (or both) is needed, a separate <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> is necessary. The power gain stage, sometimes called a “booster”, is usually placed within the monolithic amplifier’s feedback loop, preserving the IC’s low drift and stable gain characteristics. Because the <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> resides in the amplifier’s feedback path, loop stability is a concern. The <b>output</b> <b>stage’s</b> gain and AC characteristics must be considered if good dynamic performance is to be achieved. Overall circuit phase shift, frequency response and dynamic load handling capabilities are issues that cannot be ignored when designing a power gain stage for a monolithic amplifier.
