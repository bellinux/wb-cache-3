40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> {{represents}} {{the most feared}} stroke subtype. AIM: To evaluate the burden of <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> in Tuscany hospitals with special reference to Livorno district. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of patients discharged in 2009 from Tuscan and Livorno hospitals with codes ICD- 9 -CM related to any type of spontaneous <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> were selected and analyzed. RESULTS: 3, 472 patients were discharged from Tuscan hospitals with these diagnoses. Overall mortality was 24. 3 %. 50 % of patients were admitted in Internal Medicine wards. Incidence of <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> and intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) in population of Livorno district was 64 and 45 / 100, 000 inhabitants/year with related mortality of 36. 5 % and 39. 4 %respectively. Intra-hospital mortality of patients admitted in Livorno hospitals for <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> were 36. 7 %. 40 % of deaths occurred in the first 48 hours. 69. 6 % of <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> were ICHs, 16. 8 % subaracnoideal. Intra-hospital mortality, admissions for <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> in respect of total admissions and mortality for <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> in respect to total mortality increased in the last decade. 23 % of patients with <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> and 16 % of patients with ICH underwent to surgical procedures. ICHs related to antithrombotic treatment significantly increased in the last years. Mortality in patients on antithrombotic drugs was three times over compared to that in patients not undergone these drugs (43. 7 % vs 12. 8 %, p < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: There is an increasing trend in frequency, mortality and hospital burden of <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> and ICH. Efforts aimed at reducing the burden and consequences of this devasting disease are warranted. </p...|$|R

We systematically reviewed all published trials comparing any antithrombotic agent with control among patients with {{any form of}} <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage.</b> We extracted data on deaths, recurrent <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> and functional outcome. There were 9 randomised trials of 5 different antithrombotic agents versus control in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (6 trials, n = 1, 224) or with acute intracerebral haemorrhage (3 trials, n = 819). The overall odds ratio (OR) for death among patients with any <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> given an antiplatelet agent (8 trials, 1, 997 patients) was 0. 85 (95 % confidence interval, CI, 0. 63 - 1. 15), and for recurrent <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> it was 1. 00 (95 % CI 0. 73 - 1. 37). The corresponding ORs for patients with intraparenchymal cerebral haemorrhage were 0. 96 (0. 62 - 1. 5) and 1. 02 (0. 5 - 1. 8), respectively, but 65 % of these patients received only a few doses of antithrombotic treatment. The overall OR for death in patients with any intraparenchymal cerebral haemorrhage given heparin compared with control (3 trials, 819 patients, subcutaneous heparin) was 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 38 - 2. 40), and for recurrent <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> it was 2. 00 (95 % CI 0. 86 - 4. 70).

In addition, we studied outcome in all patients with DAVF who had presented with <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> at two university centers in the Netherlands, between January 2007 and April 2012. We calculated case fatality and proportions of patients with poor outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale >/= 3 or Glasgow Outcome Scale </= 3) during follow-up. We investigated mean age, sex, mid-year of study and percentage of patients with parenchymal haemorrhage as determinants of case fatality and poor outcome. The literature search yielded 16 studies, all but two retrospective and all hospital-based. Combined with our cohort of 29 patients the total number of patients with DAVF-related <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> was 326 (58 % intracerebral haemorrhage). At a median follow-up of 12 months case fatality was 4. 7 % (95 % CI 2. 5 - 7. 5; 17 cohorts) and the proportion of patients with poor outcome 8. 3 % (95 % CI 3. 1 - 15. 7; nine cohorts). We found no effect of mean age, sex, mid-year of the cohorts and percentage of patients with parenchymal haemorrhage on either outcome.

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of computed tomography (CT) was assessed in 325 consecutive {{patients with a}} "clinically definite first stroke" from a community stroke register. CT detected five "non-stroke" lesions (two cerebral gliomas, one cerebral metastasis, and two subdural haematomas), a frequency of 1. 5 %. Five patients were identified with cerebellar haemorrhage, but only one survived {{long enough to have}} a CT scan. CT was useful in excluding <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> as the cause of the stroke in four patients receiving anticoagulants and seven receiving antiplatelet treatment; it showed <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> in one patient taking aspirin.

Nineteen patients with presumed ischaemic minor stroke were considered suitable for carotid endarterectomy; CT showed small haemorrhages in two. The CT scan provides very useful information in a minority (up to 28 %) of patients with first stroke, who can be selected on quite simple criteria: (a) doubt (usually because of an inadequate history) whether the patient has stroke or a treatable intracranial lesion; (b) the possibility of cerebellar haemorrhage or infarction; (c) the exclusion of <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> in patients who either are already taking or likely to need antihaemostatic drugs or are being considered for carotid endarterectomy; (d) if the patient deteriorates in a fashion atypical of stroke...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSES: <b>Intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> (ICH) {{is a rare}} but {{potentially}} devastating complication of oral anticoagulants (OAC). This raises the difficult clinical choice between either permanent cessation of OAC, or continuing OAC and if so, when to restart. To make this choice, one needs to balance the thrombo-embolic risk after cessation of OAC against the risk of recurrent <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> when OAC are restarted. There are few published data to base this difficult clinical decision on. METHODS: We present an observational study of a consecutive series of 108 patients, collected prospectively and admitted to our department, with an OAC-related <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage,</b> in whom we assessed the thrombotic event rate and the recurrent intracranial bleeding rate during follow-up. RESULTS: In the 25 patients in whom OAC were reinstituted no new thrombo-embolic events occurred (0 / 506 unprotected patient-days). In the group of patients in whom OAC were not restarted (n = 81), the thrombo-embolic event rate was 8 / 11590 unprotected patient-days, of which only 2 were cerebrovascular thrombo-embolisms. The overall risk of a thrombo-embolic complication can be estimated to be 0. 66 events/ 1000 patient-days at risk (95 % exact confidence limits of 0. 3 to 1. 3 events/ 1000 patient-days at risk). In three patients the thrombo-embolic event was fatal. We saw recurrent intracranial bleeding in eight patients, 2 of which were fatal. Seven of these occurred before the restarting of the OAC. CONCLUSIONS: In OAC-related <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhages,</b> OAC can be stopped safely for a considerable period, with a very low overall thrombotic event rate. The recurrent bleeding risk after restarting OAC is low. Recurrent bleeding mostly occurred before restarting OAC and is probably caused by insufficient or unsustained correction of the initial coagulation deficit. Immediate reversal of anticoagulation provides the patient with the best possible treatment options including surgery. OAC-related <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> can therefore be actively treated. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} little {{research}} on bathroom accidents. It is unknown whether the shower or bathtub are connected with special dangers in different age groups or whether there are specific risk factors for adverse outcomes. This cross-sectional analysis included all direct admissions to the Emergency Department at the Inselspital Bern, Switzerland from 1 January 2000 to 28 February 2014 after accidents associated with the bathtub or shower. Time, age, location, mechanism and diagnosis were assessed and special risk factors were examined. Patient groups with and without intracranial bleeding were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. The association of risk factors with intracranial bleeding was investigated using univariate analysis with Fisher's exact test or logistic regression. The effects of different variables on cerebral bleeding were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Two hundred and eighty (280) patients with accidents associated with the bathtub or shower were included in our study. Two hundred and thirty-five (235) patients suffered direct trauma by hitting an object (83. 9 %) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) was detected in 28 patients (10 %). Eight (8) of the 27 patients with mild traumatic brain injuries (GCS 13 - 15), (29. 6 %) exhibited <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage.</b> All patients with <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> were older than 48 years and needed in-hospital treatment.

Material and method: This prospective cohort included patients older than 16 years with antithrombotic-related major haemorrhage identified by monthly diagnostic codes computerised requests. Major haemorrhage was defined {{by at least one}} the following criteria: unstable hemodynamic, haemorrhagic shock, uncontrollable bleeding, need for transfusion or haemostatic procedure, or a life threatening location. Results: between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012, 913 patients met the inclusion criteria (1. 2 patients per day), median age 82. Oral anticoagulants alone or in combination were used by 429 patients, antiplatelet agents (alone or dual therapy) by 420 patients, and parenteral anticoagulants by 64 patients. Major haemorrhages were: gastrointestinal bleeding (37. 5 %), <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> (34. 4 %), muscular hematoma (9. 4 %), external haemorrhage (16. 9 %) and internal haemorrhage (1. 9 %). At 1 month, 179 patients (19. 8 %) died, mostly patients with <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> (64. 2 %).

SETTING [...] Necropsies performed {{in the south of}} England. SUBJECTS [...] 11 Haemophiliacs (mean age 41, range 15 - 69) and 31 non-haemophiliacs, 29 of whom were homosexual men (mean age 40, range 21 - 60).

METHODS: 973 patients aged 75 years or over (mean age 81. 5 years, SD 4. 2) with atrial fibrillation were recruited from primary care and randomly assigned to warfarin (target international normalised ratio 2 - 3) or aspirin (75 mg per day). Follow-up was for a mean of 2. 7 years (SD 1. 2). The primary endpoint was fatal or disabling stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic), <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage,</b> or clinically significant arterial embolism. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN 89345269. FINDINGS: There were 24 primary events (21 strokes, two other <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhages,</b> and one systemic embolus) in people assigned to warfarin and 48 primary events (44 strokes, one other <b>intracranial</b> <b>haemorrhage,</b> and three systemic emboli) in people assigned to aspirin (yearly risk 1. 8 %vs 3. 8 %, relative risk 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 28 - 0. 80, p= 0. 003; absolute yearly risk reduction 2 %, 95 % CI 0. 7 - 3. 2).
