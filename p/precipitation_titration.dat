This system was characterized on the basis of: (1) the immunoelectrophoretic demonstration of antibodies to human IgG in anti-globulins; (2) titration of the antiglobulins and labelled globulins; and (3) determination of molar fluorescein to protein (F:P) ratios. Titration of anti-globulins (rabbit anti-human IgG) by gel precipitation afforded an assay of `units' of antibody activity.

A reference method (potentiometric <b>precipitation</b> <b>titration)</b> and a newly developed ion-selective chloride electrode (ISE) were applied. Both methods determine the sodium chloride content through the quantification of chloride. To evaluate the accuracy of the ISE, bread and respective dough samples were analyzed by both methods. Statistical analysis (0. 05 significance level) indicated that the results of these methods did not differ significantly. Therefore the ISE is an adequate alternative for the determination of chloride in the analyzed samples. To compare the results of these chloride-based methods with a sodium-based method, sodium was quantified in the same samples by a reference method (atomic absorption spectrometry). Significant differences between the results were verified. In several cases the sodium chloride content exceeded the legal limit when the chloride-based methods were used, but when the sodium-based method was applied this was not the case.

The main reasons are; the need of environmental monitoring, quality of food and water control, human health, quality of industrial production control, nanotechnologies and material science. Together with Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry and Physical Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry is a fundamental chemical course. The education of Analytical Chemists is carried out in 52 Polish universities introduced already in the Bolonia Process, ECTS points and three steps of education: Bachelor's degree (at universities of technology – Engineer's degree), Master's degree and Doctoral Studies. The first level, Bachelor's degree, contains the basic knowledge: gravimetric analysis, electrogravimetry, acid-base titration, oxidation-reduction titration, <b>precipitation</b> <b>titration,</b> complexometric titration and quality assurance and quality control of results.

5000|$|Thermometric titrimetry: Thermometric titrimetry is an {{extraordinarily}} versatile technique. This is differentiated from calorimetric titrimetry {{by the fact}} that the heat of the reaction (as indicated by temperature rise or fall) is not used to determine the amount of analyte in the sample solution. Instead, the equivalence point is determined by the rate of temperature change. Because thermometric titrimetry is a relative technique, it is not necessary to conduct the titration under isothermal conditions, and titrations can be conducted in plastic or even glass vessels, although these vessels are generally enclosed to prevent stray draughts from causing [...] "noise" [...] and disturbing the endpoint. Because thermometric titrations can be conducted under ambient conditions, they are especially well-suited to routine process and quality control in industry. Depending on whether the reaction between the titrant and analyte is exothermic or endothermic, the temperature will either rise or fall during the titration. When all analyte has been consumed by reaction with the titrant, a change in the rate of temperature increase or decrease reveals the equivalence point and an inflection in the temperature curve can be observed. The equivalence point can be located precisely by employing the second derivative of the temperature curve. The software used in modern automated thermometric titration systems employ sophisticated digital smoothing algorithms so that [...] "noise" [...] resulting from the highly sensitive temperature probes does not interfere with the generation of a smooth, symmetrical second derivative [...] "peak" [...] which defines the endpoint. The technique is capable of very high precision, and coefficients of variance (CV's) of less than 0.1 are common. Modern thermometric titration temperature probes consist of a thermistor which forms one arm of a Wheatstone bridge. Coupled to high resolution electronics, the best thermometric titration systems can resolve temperatures to 10−5K. Sharp equivalence points have been obtained in titrations where the temperature change during the titration has been as little as 0.001K. The technique can be applied to essentially any chemical reaction in a fluid where there is an enthalpy change, although reaction kinetics can play a role in determining the sharpness of the endpoint. Thermometric titrimetry has been successfully applied to acid-base, redox, EDTA, and <b>precipitation</b> <b>titrations.</b> Examples of successful <b>precipitation</b> <b>titrations</b> are sulfate by titration with barium ions, phosphate by titration with magnesium in ammoniacal solution, chloride by titration with silver nitrate, nickel by titration with dimethylglyoxime and fluoride by titration with aluminium (as K2NaAlF6) Because the temperature probe does not need to be electrically connected to the solution (as in potentiometric titrations), non-aqueous titrations can be carried out as easily as aqueous titrations. Solutions which are highly colored or turbid can be analyzed by thermometric without further sample treatment. The probe is essentially maintenance-free. Using modern, high precision stepper motor driven burettes, automated thermometric titrations are usually complete in a few minutes, making the technique an ideal choice where high laboratory productivity is required.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} kinds of surfactants in various concentrations incorporated in an inert matrix, on the release of procainamide hydrochloride, as a cationic model compound, was investigated in this study. Sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium stearate as anionic surfactants, cetyl pyridinium chloride and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide as cationic and span 60 and tween 80 as non-ionic surfactants were selected. Hydrophobic matrices were prepared using procainamide HCl, ethyl cellulose, dicalcium phosphate and different percentages of each surfactant and the dissolution rate of drug from various matrices was determined in pH values 1. 2 (for 2 h) and 7. 2 (up to 10 h). The results showed that incorporation of anionic surfactants in matrix preparations resulted in a remarkable decrease in the release rate of procainamide HCl (P < 0. 05), which was attributed to the formation of a poorly soluble complex between the cationic drug and the anionic surfactant. The formation of complex was confirmed by the <b>precipitation</b> <b>titration</b> test. On the other hand, presence of cationic surfactants considerably increased the drug release rate and it was noted that by raising the percentage of surfactant, a faster drug release rate release was achieved. With span 60 there was no change in drug release rate, probably due to its lower wetting capability. While in the case of tween 80, as a hydrophilic non-ionic surfactant, the drug release rate was increased, although statistically not significant. In general, it seems that the influence of cationic and non-ionic surfactants on drug release rate was in accordance with the ability of each surfactant in wetting the matrices and producing a greater number of channels for the dissolution fluid to leach out the drug.

The pro-cedure shows excellent precision and accuracy in comparison with standard chemical procedures and in the analysis of control sera. FLAIE PHOTOMETRY is the most sensitive and convenient method of de-termining sodium and potassium in serum and urine, but it has not been broadly applied to the routine determination of calcium. Instead, many clinical laboratories employ <b>precipitation</b> and <b>titration</b> of cal-cium oxalate (1), while others utilize titration of calcium with chelat-ing agents (2 - 4).

30|$|As seen in Table  2, {{the volume}} of {{precipitant}} needed to induce asphaltene precipitation was obtained greater using optical microscopy method compared to those obtained using viscometry method. The origin of the difference is attributed to the detection mechanisms by which asphaltene precipitation in the mixture was identified. For the viscometry method, the viscosity of mixture changes suddenly {{as soon as the}} precipitation occurs. This of course depends on the precision of the viscosity measurement. However, for the optical microscopy method, there might be a delay in detecting the precipitation onset {{due to the fact that}} the first precipitated particles need to grow in size through the agglomeration process to be visible by microscope. This, of course, would be dependent on the accuracy and magnification ratio of the employed microscope. Therefore, slightly more precipitant volumes appeared to be needed to induce asphaltene precipitation when optical microscopy was used. Overall, the viscometry method seems to be a more accurate method compared to optical microscopy for asphaltene onset <b>precipitation</b> measurements during <b>titration</b> experiments.|$|R
30|$|Intelligence {{systems have}} been {{recently}} used as mathematical predictive tools to quantitatively formulate the amount of asphaltene <b>precipitation</b> using <b>titration</b> data (Ashoori et al. 2010; Naimi et al. 2014; Ahmadi 2011, 2012; Asoodeh et al. 2014 a, b; Abedini et al. 2010; Zahedi et al. 2009; Chamkalani et al. 2013; Gholami et al. 2013; Gholami et al. 2014 a, b; Fatahi et al. 2014). Although these predictive models are valuable, the quest for greater accuracy has been always remained an issue. In this paper, ACE was firstly used as a potent model to estimate the amount of asphaltene precipitation based {{on a series of}} titration experiments using stock tank oils. This non-parametric statistical regression method enhances the fitting by suggesting the optimal transformations for predictor variables (i.e., titration data including temperature, solvent molar weight, and dilution ratio in our case study) and response variable (i.e., the amount of asphaltene precipitation for the case under study in this paper) (Malallah et al. 2006). Secondly, the SVR method was used as a supervised learning method for predicting the amount of asphaltene precipitation. The SVR method is based on the employment of the structural risk minimization principle; hence, it provides better generalization performance in comparison to the conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in which the empirical risk minimization principle is implemented. In the end, PLCM method was proposed to combine the outputs associated with SVR and ACE models. To assign appropriate weight factors to each of these two models, GA tool was employed as the combiner. The weight factor associated with each individual model demonstrates the contribution of that model in the final quantitative estimation of asphaltene precipitation. The predicted asphaltene precipitation results using these three models were compared with the experimental data to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.|$|R

This structure consists of a flexible metallic tape (Ni- 5 at%W) coated with multiple buffer layers (CeO 2, La 2 Zr 2 O 7) and a superconducting layer (YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7). In contrast to the production of many coated conductors in the international research community, a cheaper non-vacuum technique, namely the sol-gel method is used in this work. Every layer is produced starting from an aqueous precursor solution containing the corresponding metal acetates and an organic complexing agent, such as triethanolamine. The acidity of the solution was adjusted by adding ammonium hydroxide order to obtain a clear and stable gel without <b>precipitation.</b> Potentiometric <b>titrations</b> allowed us to determine the complexation behaviour of the metalions in the gel. Using the SUPERQUAD and EQUIL software, pH-distribution curves could be generated. Through dip-coating, thin films were deposited on the substrate. At low temperatures (60 °C) the solution is transformed into an amorphous gel. The crystalline and biaxially textured buffer layers are formed during a heat treatment at elevated temperatures (1000 °C) under inert atmosphere (Ar- 5 %H 2). The superconducting film was deposited on a cleaned SrTiO 3 substrate and heat treated at temperatures of 815 °C under nitrogen with 200 ppm oxygen. Characterisation of the morphology and microstructure of the thin films were carried out using XRD, pole figures, SEM, AFM and TEM. The buffer layers show good in an out-of-plane alignment and a smooth surface with little impurities. The superconducting film has a critical temperature of 89 K and shows a sharp transition from normal to superconducting phase...|$|R
30|$|The {{authors also}} {{conducted}} asphaltene precipitation tests on Sohio oil sample which contained 4.2  wt% of asphaltenes using both n-pentane and n-heptane as precipitant. It {{was found that}} IFT was approximately constant {{up to a certain}} concentration for each precipitant after which it was suddenly increased (Fig.  17). This point of sudden change on IFT versus precipitant concentration plot was defined as the asphaltene onset precipitation point in terms of the minimum volume (or concentration) of precipitant needed to attain <b>precipitation</b> in the <b>titration</b> experiments. The authors concluded that the precipitated polar molecules of asphaltenes moved to the interface between water and the oil–precipitant mixture. These precipitated asphaltenes then formed a film at the interface which resulted in an increase in the IFT values. The authors’ justification for additional instabilities in the IFT values at higher concentrations of precipitants is the adhesion or deposition of precipitated asphaltenes at the interface. No evidence was provided by the authors to support this claim. Some other researchers observed different behaviors for asphaltene at the interfacial region. The presence of polyaromatic and heterocyclic molecules in the structure of asphaltenes and their adsorption at the interface causes different interfacial behaviors (Rane et al. 2012; Darjani et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Using a {{combination}} of experimental techniques, we show that Cu(II) reduction by sulfide to Cu(I) occurs in solution prior to precipitation. EPR and 63 Cu NMR data show that reduction to Cu(I) occurs during the reaction of equimolar amounts of Cu(II) with sulfide. 63 Cu solution NMR data show that Cu(I) is soluble when bound to sulfide and is in a site of high symmetry. EPR data confirm that Cu(I) forms in solution and that the mineral covellite, CuS, contains only Cu(I). Mass spectrometry data from covellite as well as laboratory prepared solid and solution CuS materials indicate that Cu 3 S 3 six-membered rings form in solution. These trinuclear Cu rings are the basic building blocks for aqueous CuS molecular clusters, which lead to CuS <b>precipitation.</b> In controlled <b>titration</b> experiments where sulfide is slowly added to Cu(II), Cu 3 S 3 rings and tetranuclear Cu molecular clusters (Cu 4 S 5, and Cu 4 S 6) form; the rings are composed primarily of Cu(II). During cluster formation from Cu 3 S 3 condensation, some Cu(II) is released back into solution, indicating that Cu(II) reduction does not occur until after Cu−S bond and higher order cluster formation. Analysis of the frontier molecular orbitals for Cu(II) and sulfide indicate that an outer-sphere electron transfer is symmetry forbidden. These {{results are consistent with}} the formation of CuS bonds prior to electron transfer, which occurs via an inner-sphere process...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} work the optimization of the electrochemical system of LDHs as catalytic precursors on FeCrAlY foams was carried out. Preliminary sintheses {{were performed on}} flat surfaces in order to easily characterize the deposited material. From the study of pH evolution vs time at different cathodic potentials applied to a Pt electrode, the theoretical best working conditions for the synthesis of single hydroxides and LDH compounds was achieved. In order to define the optimal potential for the synthesis of a particular LDH compound, the collected data were compared with the interval of <b>precipitation</b> determined by <b>titration</b> with NaOH. However, the characterization of the deposited material on Pt surfaces did not confirm the deposition of a pure and homogeneous LDH phase during the synthesis. Instead a sequential deposition linked to the pH of precipitation of the involved elements is observed. The same behavior was observed during the synthesis of the RhMgAl LDH on FeCrAlY foam as catalytic precursor. Several parameters were considered in order to optimize the synthesis [...] The development of electrochemical cells with different feature, such as the counter electrode dimensions or the contact between the foam and the potentiostat, had been carried out {{in order to obtain}} a better coating of the foam. The influence of the initial pH of the electrolyte solution, of the applied potential, of the composition of the electrolytic solution were investigated in order to improve a better coating of the catalyst support. Catalytic tests were performed after the calcination of the deposited foam for the CPO and SR reactions, showing an improve of performances along with optimization of the precursors synthesis conditions. ...|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{studies show}} that {{asphaltenes}} in crude oil have a colloidal nature (Kawanaka et al. 1989; Wen et al. 1978; Lichaa and Herrera 1975; Ray et al. 1957; Leontaritis 1988). In this approach, asphaltenes are considered as dispersed particles in crude oil which are stabilized by a resin layer on their surfaces. This condition of stabilization may be disturbed by adding a precipitant. The precipitant causes desorption of resins preserver layer from the asphaltene surfaces. In {{the absence of the}} resin layers, the asphaltene particles may interact with each other and aggregation will occur. This aggregation of suspended particles in a suspension will increase the viscosity. Thus, measurement of crude oil viscosity at different percentages of added precipitant can be a method for detecting the onset of asphaltene <b>precipitation</b> during a <b>titration</b> test for stock tank oils. This method was presented originally by Escobedo and Mansoori in 1995. Reverse or opaque Cannon–Fenske viscometer was the type of glass viscometer used in this study. Since each Cannon–Fenske viscometer tube size is only useful for a specific range of viscosity values, various tube sizes of this viscometer should be used to cover the entire viscosity range. One of the advantages of this method is its applicability for the light and heavy, opaque and transparent, and dead and live oil samples. However, if capillary tubes are used for viscometry, they may be plugged by deposited asphaltenes during the measurements. This method has been widely used in the literature. For instance, Shadman et al. (2012) and Firoozinia et al. (2016) used it to study the effect of inhibitors and dispersants on asphaltene precipitation from dead oil samples. Turta et al. (1997) used this method to determine onset of asphaltene precipitation in live oil samples at reservoir conditions during gas flooding process.|$|R
40|$|Titration {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} methods among the quantitative analysis in the pharmaceutical area. The difficult task within this field has always been the determination of equivalent points of the chemical reactions. The long history of the titration encompasses the use of colorful plats extracts, synthetic chemical compounds such as phenolphthalein and the use of instrumental and electrochemical based methods such as potentiometry. The latest research filed concerning titration concentrates on the development of new indication methods. One of them constitutes thermometric titration. This thesis gives the summary of theoretical laws on thermometric titration and presents the results of experiments examining the influence of extraneous factors, such as the heat difference between the solution and the surroundings or the amount of heat generated by the thermistor itself, on the measurements. Moreover, it depicts the results of selected determinations performed using new available hard- and software. Based on the performed determinations the successful use of thermometric titration as an universal method independent from the type of the reaction indication method in the pharmaceutical analysis could not be confirmed. The low concentrated solutions and the insufficient grade of the sensitivity of the sensor along with the lack of the possibility of differentiation between the heat provided by the reaction and the whole measuring process lead to the following conclusion: although thermometric titration is nowadays considerably simpler, especially compared to older methods, which used temperate glasses and solutions, and despite of the fact that some results have indicated the superiority of the thermometric titration over potentiometric sensors, the widespread use of the first method in the routine pharmaceutical analysis cannot be recommended. Nevertheless, the thermometric titration presents the most adequate analysis method for reactions under extreme conditions, which involve lipophilic solutions or emulsions and suspensions. This makes the thermometric titration a perfect addition to well know methods. The second indication method – acid-base-biamperometry – has been newly developed by the author of this thesis. The third Chapter depicts its development, the assumptions concerning the functioning of this method and the experimental verification of them. This method has been further experimentally checked in a variety of determinations. The acid-base-biamperometry uses copper electrodes of a different size as sensors. The anode is 100 times bigger than the cathode. This enables a non-inhibited, independent oxidation of copper and makes the reduction on the cathode to an electric current limiting reaction. Hence the measured electric current is proportional to the acid concentration. During titrations with acids, which achieve a low pH (7) during titrations with bases causes the shift of the oxidation potential of copper to more negative values, which enables the reduction of solution molecules itself due to the fixed potential difference. These theories have been verified in a series of experiments. The developed method has been used in many pharmaceutical relevant determinations in non-aqueous solutions. In order to properly verify the results every titration has been simultaneously indicated with the potentiometric electrode. The acid-base-biamperometry has proven itself as equivalent to the results of the standard method i. e. potentiometry whereas in some cases it has been even a more adequate method. The acid-base-biamperometry incorporates the use of a well-known electrochemical rule “the faraday law” in a new, so far not explored way. The third method presented in the thesis is the biamperometry operated with alternating voltage. This technique has been used for redox titrations and can be seen as a solution for the perennial problem of slowly advancing contaminations on the surface of an electrode during electrochemical reactions. The alternating voltage does not allow electrodes to get polarized for a long period of time. This prevents electrode surface from changing. For a better understanding of this method the thesis gives an overview of the electrochemical conditions in the solutions. By use of some models of the electrochemical double layer an electrode circuit diagram has been developed and described. Therewith theoretical titrations curves could be simulated. This made it possible to identify weak points and influence parameter of the method. The alternating-voltage-biamperometry has been used for indication of many redox titration using examples from the Ph. Eur. The received results had a very good accuracy and were similar to simultaneously performed potentiometric titrations. The experiments determined the optimum conditions for the method: the voltage between 200 - 600 mV and the frequency smaller than 5000 Hz. The developed method shows an equivalence in the results with standard indication methods and can been seen as a perfect alternative for indication of redox titrations. The goal of the last indication method was to perform a titration without a galvanic contact of the electrodes with the solution. In order to achieve it a measurement setup has been built. It allows an exact positioning of the titration vessels between two parallel situated copper electrodes. To enable the measurement a high frequency alternating voltage has been used. The occurred differences in the electrical properties of the solution during acid-base and <b>precipitation</b> <b>titrations</b> were measured and the titration curves could be successfully evaluated. The measured curves were similar to the conductometric titration curves. The determined equivalent points deviated circa 5 % from theoretical values. The used hardware enabled only indication of titration of strong electrolytes which are subject to distinctive changes in both dielectric constant and solution resistance during a titration. If more sensitive measuring equipment was used, the indication of other titrations and the use of lower concentrated solutions would presumably be possible. This thesis presents new developments in the area of indication methods along with the use of the old method with new hard- and software. It also proves that the field of indication methods is not fully explored and has a considerable expansion potential...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{reactions}} at solid/liquid and solid/gas interfaces {{is of great}} importance {{in the study of}} all adsorption phenomena. Techniques that enable a study of molecules (liquid or gaseous) adsorbed onto a surface may be divided into two categories: (a) those that upset the equilibrium between molecules in the gaseous (or liquid) phase above the solid surface and molecules actually adsorbed onto it, and (b) those that do not. Those techniques that do not disturb this equilibrium will give results that would be expected to have greater reliability than those obtained from techniques that upset this equilibrium (for example by heating or by affecting one component of the equilibrium by <b>titration,</b> <b>precipitation</b> etc.) In an endeavour to study the properties of water adsorbed onto various substances such as clay, wool and textile fibres without affecting the equilibrium the technique of isotopic exchange has been developed. Essentially the procedure is to take a closed adsorber system in equilibrium with a gas (or liquid), part of which is in the sensitive region of a geiger counter, and to add a very small amount of radioactively labelled gas (or liquid) to the system. The adsorber is placed {{in the bottom of a}} geiger counter out of the sensitive volume and a known fraction of gas (or liquid) is in the sensitive volume. As the system is at equilibrium there is continuous exchange between the adsorbed molecules on the sample and the molecules in the gaseous (or liquid) state. Thus, when a very small amount, by weight, of the radioactively labelled gas (or liquid) is added to the system, exchange will take place with the non-radioactive molecules adsorbed on the surface of the material under study. Thus radioactivity will be removed from the sensitive volume of the geiger counter and adsorbed onto the surface of the material, and so the specific activity (count rate), as measured with the geiger counter, will drop. The advantage of this technique is that the equilibrium between the adsorbed molecules and the free gas (or liquid) is not disturbed. The actual amount of radioactive material added is so minute that there is no effective change in the concentration of the free gas (or liquid) ...|$|R
