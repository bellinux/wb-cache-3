25|$|For Schweitzer, mankind had {{to accept}} that {{objective}} reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism, by giving priority to volition or ethical will as the <b>primary</b> <b>meaning</b> of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization: the world-view must derive from the life-view, not vice versa. Respect for life, overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines, leads the individual {{to live in the}} service of other people and of every living creature. In contemplation of the will-to-life, respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.|$|E
500|$|The Germania {{manuscript}} corpus {{contains two}} primary variant {{readings of the}} name.

The most common design provides an area for exercise and is often situated near the stables. Larger paddocks may have grass maintained in them, but many are dirt or a similar natural surface. In those cases drainage and a top layer of sand are often used to keep a suitable surface in the paddock.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} control for various {{variables}} on the experimental materials, a series of pretests were conducted. For the auditory prime words, an initial list of 140 monosyllabic ambiguous verbs was first selected as candidates. To determine the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>meanings</b> of each verb, meanings associated with each ambiguous word were listed in a meaning ranking questionnaire, which recruited 238 participants (109 males and 129 females, native speakers of Mandarin Chinese aged between 20 – 26, mean age[*]=[*] 23, SD[*]=[*] 1.93) to provide meaning rankings associated with each word. Sixty-one words, whose <b>primary</b> <b>meanings</b> were rated as the first meanings by over 70  % of the participants (mean dominance[*]=[*] 81.07  %, SD[*]=[*] 8.55  %), were selected as the candidate stimuli. The <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>meanings</b> of these 61 words were further paired in a semantic relatedness questionnaire, for which 62 participants (17 males and 45 females, aged between 19 – 26 years old, mean age[*]=[*] 22.19, SD[*]=[*] 2.54) rated relatedness of meaning using a 7 -point scale (1 [*]=[*]not related, 7 [*]=[*]closely related). Based on the semantic relatedness scores, experimental items were classified into those that have high ROMs (i.e., 24 words with an ROM over 4.5) and those that have low ROMs (i.e., 21 words with an ROM below 3.5).|$|R
40|$|Background: Illness is {{experienced}} in social contexts; its meaning {{is rooted in}} local beliefs and values as well as one’s personal and family situation. Health professionals are steeped in knowledge of disease but know much less about illness. Objectives: The objective {{of the study was}} to learn more about the social construction of illness by comparing the meanings of fatigue in Thai and Canadian individuals with cancer. Methods: Using an ethnoscience design, 10 Thai adults receiving chemotherapy for advanced lung cancer or colorectal cancer were interviewed twice. They were asked to sort words and phrases about fatigue from their first interview using Q-sort, triadic, and dyadic approaches; to name each pile; and to describe the similarities and differences between the piles. The card sorts were used to understand the relationships among key ideas in each interview. A table summarizing the card sorts was constructed, and patterns in the data were identified. Results: Two segregates in the Thai data were identified: essential/constant and intermittent, with essential/constant including 2 segregates (feeble and altered cognition), and intermittent including 2 segregates (loss of mental strength and difficulty sleeping). The <b>primary</b> <b>meanings</b> of fatigue in the Thai data were related to temporality, whereas the <b>primary</b> <b>meanings</b> of fatigue in the Canadian data were related to the location of the fatigue (mind/body). Conclusion: These findings help us understand the social construction of fatigue, a common symptom in cancer. Implications for Practice: Further research in relation to links between fatigue and other related-symptoms is needed with the goal of developing cross-cultural interventions for managing fatigue in the future...|$|R

[...] But according to prescriptivism, the statement [...] "Suicide is wrong" [...] means something more like [...] "Do not commit suicide."
