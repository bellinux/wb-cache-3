40|$|Phoma {{stem canker}} {{is a disease}} of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) caused by closely related plant {{pathogens}} Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa. It is an economically important disease, causing annual yield losses of approximately ?? 770 million worldwide. When colonising oilseed rape, L. maculans and L. biglobosa exist in close proximity on the leaf, competing for resources as they move through the main leaf vein and into the stem. Fungicides are commonly used to decrease severity of phoma stem canker on oilseed rape. However, the efficacy and longevity of active chemicals is under threat from evolution of resistance in pathogen populations and government legalisation. Moreover, {{it has been suggested}} that both L. maculans and L. biglobosa differ in their sensitivity to azoles, and important class of fungicides that are used to control the disease through the inhibition of lanosterol 14 -?? demethylase (erg 11, CYP 51). This project aims to further understand the role that fungicides have in controlling phoma stem canker by investigating their efficacy against L. maculans and L. biglobosa in crops, in vitro and in planta. In field experiments, established in Cambridgeshire across four cropping seasons, the fungicide mixture penthiopyrad (SDHI) plus <b>picoxystrobin</b> (QoI) was as effective at controlling phoma leaf spotting and phoma stem canker in winter oilseed rape as prothioconazole (DMI), suggesting that both fungicides could be used to reduce phoma stem canker symptoms. The two pathogens differed in their growth rates in vitro, with L. biglobosa growing faster than L. maculans when untreated or treated with lower fungicide concentrations. Fungicide sensitivity assays suggest that L. maculans and L. biglobosa are both sensitive to DMI, SDHI and QoI fungicides and that differences between the species are minor. Prothioconazole and penthiopyrad + <b>picoxystrobin</b> had a similar efficacy on oilseed rape cotyledons colonised with either L. maculans or L. biglobosa. There was no difference between species on prothioconazole treated plants, although there was a difference between L. maculans and L. biglobosa when treated with 20 ??g/ml penthiopyrad + <b>picoxystrobin.</b> Heterologous yeast expression of LmCYP 51 B and LbCYP 51 B with fungicide sensitivity testing of the yeast transformants suggests that LmCYP 51 B and LbCYP 51 B are similarly sensitive to azole fungicides flusilazole, prothioconazole-desthio and tebuconazole. These findings are supported by homology protein modelling, which predicts that LmCYP 51 B and LbCYP 51 B are structurally very similar, specifically at the azole-binding site. In conclusion, fungicides are still an effective control method for reducing phoma stem canker symptoms caused by Leptosphaeria species in the UK, and a useful tool to in the sustainable production of oilseed rape...|$|E

Crop Protection, 22 (7), 975 - 987. The effect of adding strobilurins to a triazole (epoxiconazole) fungicide programme {{on the quality}} of a range of wheat cultivars was assessed in field experiments in three successive years. Strobilurin was applied at just flag leaf emergence (azoxystrobin) or at the start of stem extension (azoxystrobin or <b>picoxystrobin)</b> and again at flag leaf emergence or at flag leaf emergence and again at ear emergence (azoxystrobin). All strobilurin treatments reduced disease levels, delayed senescence of the flag leaf and consistently increased yields, thousand grain weight and specific weight. Reductions in Hagberg falling number were observed, even by fungicide applications at the start of stem extension, but effects were small compared to the variation among cultivars. Application of fungicide (triazole or strobilurin) before ear emergence increased the amount of blackpoint, but this was partly countered by applying azoxystrobin at ear emergence. The effect of fungicide on protein concentration differed over seasons and cultivar. Where they occurred, small reductions in protein concentration could be compensated for by extra application of nitrogen as foliar urea at anthesis. Foliar urea (40 kg N ha? 1) applied at anthesis also improved Hagberg falling number and reduced blackpoint in one of the growing seasons. In one season, the effect of foliar urea at anthesis was compared with applications of granular fertiliser at flag leaf emergence.

Two field trials of the Brazilian network for ASR chemical control were conducted in Goiania and Senador Canedo at Goias State in order to compare the efficacy of 17 fungicides on ASR control. The treatments were composed by two triazols, one strobilurine, one carboxanilide, and 13 premix formulations of strobilurine + triazol.

40|$|Poster abstractPhoma stem canker, {{a disease}} of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) caused by sibling {{pathogens}} Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa. Both pathogens follow a monocylic disease cycle that causes leaf spotting in autumn/winter and stem cankers in spring/summer. Most severe cankers decrease transportation of water and nutrients. Fungicides are important for phoma stem canker control. Triazole fungicides currently dominate the market, although reduced sensitivity in some plant pathogen species is a concern. Moreover, L. maculans and L. biglobosa have shown differing level of sensitivity to triazole fungicides. Therefore, increased knowledge on controlling phoma stem canker using non-triazole based fungicides is essential. Field trials were established for 2013 / 2014 cropping season. Four fungicides were applied: penthiopyrad, <b>picoxystrobin,</b> prothioconazole and a novel fungicide. Spray timings were divided into three sprays T 1 (phoma leaf spotting incidence ??? 10 %), T 2 (3 / 4 weeks post T 1) and T 3 (Sclerotinia). Phoma leaf spotting incidence and stem canker severity were recorded. In vitro sensitivity testing was done on one L. maculans (ME 24) and one L. biglobosa (68) isolate. Prothioconazole showed no noteworthy advantage over the novel fungicide in canker severity scoring. No significant difference in growth inhibition was observed between L. biglobosa and L. maculans (P ??? 0. 05) when treated with novel fungicide. Canker severity indicates that the novel fungicide has a similar efficacy to triazole fungicides. Fungicide sensitivity testing shows that L. biglobosa {{does not have an}} increased sensitivity to non-triazole fungicides.

This report details {{the findings of}} our annual powdery mildew fungicide trials on grapevine cultivar Chardonnay (Vitis vinifera). The trials were conducted at Herzog Ranch, near Courtland, California in 2009. Treatments were placed in five adjacent trials in the vineyard. Spraying commenced in mid April, shortly after a heavy rainfall event that likely promoted the release of powdery mildew (Uncinula necator) ascospores from overwintering chasmothecia. Spraying was completed in mid July and treatments were evaluated for disease incidence and severity on 21 July 2009, at about the beginning of veraison. Trial I consisted of IR- 4 -funded biofungicide research that focused on two products: caprylic acid (a novel control agent in current development) and Actinovate (a registered product containing the bacterium Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 106). Trials II-V included various fungicide products (either currently registered or {{in various stages of}} product development) including strobilurins, demethylase inhibitors, oils, and other materials. Spray frequencies varied from weekly applications to 21 day intervals. Temperatures were mild during much of the 2009 growing season, providing optimal conditions for the asexual reproduction and dispersal of powdery mildew. Risk index data was high from about mid-May {{through the rest of the}} evaluation period and the pathogen quickly colonized leaves. Disease pressure was higher than in similar trials conducted in 2007 or 2008. By mid-June, heavy to severe mildew was evident on untreated clusters. Treatment performances varied widely. Biological fungicides generally reduced disease severity, but were more effective when used in a combination program with synthetic materials. As a stand-alone product, caprylic acid was most effective when applied weekly at a concentration of 0. 3 % (v/v). At a concentration of 0. 5 % it consistently showed phytotoxic effects on berries. A few organic materials performed well, lowering disease severity to < 10 %: paraffinic oil + Foliar Supreme (sulfur + nutrient cocktail) and two types of fertilizers alternated with trifloxystrobin.

40|$|Barley {{net blotch}} (BNB) caused by Pyrenophora teres, and Septoria tritici blotch (STB) caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola, are {{destructive}} cereal diseases worldwide on barley and wheat respectively. Due {{to the lack}} of highly resistant cultivars, both diseases are widely controlled using fungicides. Systemic, site-specific modern fungicides have played an essential role in disease management in cereals. Triazole-based fungicides, which inhibit the C 14 demethylation step in fungal ergosterol biosynthesis, known as demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) and strobilurins, known as quinine outside inhibitors (QoIs), which interfere with energy production in the fungal cell, by blocking electron transfer at site of quinone oxidation in the cytochrome bc 1 complex, are two major site-specific systemic groups of fungicides, currently used to control cereal diseases. Multiple, consecutive and extensive use of these fungicides has led to the emergence of fungicide resistance in these plant pathogens. The existence of G 143 A and F 129 L mutations {{has been found to be}} associated with resistance of many plant pathogens to QoIs. However, in P. teres only F 129 L was found to confer insensitivity. The presence of an intron in several fungi (including rusts and P. teres) determines that it is impossible for the G 143 A mutation to survive and thus be selected for. Alterations in CYP 51 gene in plant pathogens has also been found to be one of the major mechanisms resulting in reduced sensitivity towards DMIs. The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of the F 129 L mutation in isolates of P. teres, and mutations in the CYP 51 gene in M. graminicola isolates on the activity of QoI and DMI fungicides respectively. Results revealed a high frequency of the F 129 L mutation within recent UK P. teres isolates. Furthermore, the common change (G 143 A) in cytochrome b was not found in P. teres strains. The results also showed a lack of any fitness penalty associated with the mutation. Bioassay tests indicated that inhibition of net blotch by QoIs was variable. Single QoI fungicides such as pyraclostrobin and <b>picoxystrobin</b> were found to be highly inhibitory whilst the efficacy of other QoIs was less pronounced. It has been found that efficacy of QoI fungicides varied amongst a population of isolates with the F 129 L mutation. This might suggest that some QoIs were compromised by the F 129 L mutation to some degree. However, the results obtained were in agreement with previous reports that the F 129 L mutation in the cytochrome b gene generates lower levels of resistance and was not as serious as that posed by the G 143 A mutation in other plant pathogens. In addition, fungicide mixtures, comprising QoIs and DMIs or the novel SDHI formulations, were found to have great efficacy in net blotch disease management. Sequence results of CYP 51 gene fragment indicated existence of 15 alterations in recent UK and German isolates of M. graminicola. Some of these mutations, such as Y 137 F, were found to be rare whilst the I 381 V mutation was found to be increasing with time. However, investigations indicated a lack of phenotypic fitness penalties associated with these alterations. Apical germ tube growth measurement was found an effective method to assess in vitro activity of DMI fungicides against M. graminicola isolates. Based on bioassay studies, six categories within M. graminicola isolates were detected, showing different sensitivities to azole fungicides. In general, genotypes characterised S, R 3 + and R 4 were sensitive to most azole fungicides. The R 3 + variant, however, showed less sensitivity to tebuconazole and prochloraz. In in vitro studies, the R 5 variants, exhibited sensitivity to many DMIs but were less sensitive to prochloraz. This supporting the results obtained from in planta assays, where this genotype was found to be sensitive to tebuconazole but less sensitive to prochloraz. On the other hand, genotypes characterised R 6 a, R 7 and R 8, containing I 381 V mutation, were resistant to tebuconazole but sensitive to prochloraz. The latter variant, however, were more sensitive to prochloraz. It can be suggested from results obtained in this study that CYP 51 alterations were differentially selected by different members of the azole class of fungicides. Q-PCR was also used to evaluate in planta fungicide activity on both diseases. The method indicated similar pattern to that observed in visual assessments. Detection of medium to high correlation values between both assessments confirmed the validity of q-PCR assessment. This suggests that q-PCR assays may serve as an alternative method for accurate assessment of the fungicide effects on cereal diseases. The method can be a valuable tool to evaluate disease occurrence in pathogens with a long latent period, such as M. graminicola, as q-PCR could readily detect the pathogen during the asymptomatic latent period.

40|$|The {{chemical}} control {{is the main}} strategy for controlling the soybean asian rust. Thus, information about the efficiency of fungicides {{as well as the}} residual effect on seeds are needed to guide its correct use in the field. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of different active ingredients to control the asian rust, as well as their influence on the physiological and sanitary quality of soybean seeds. The experiment was conducted in Mafra, SC, in the 2010 / 2011 growing season, using the cultivars Syngenta 3358 RR and Nidera 6411 RR. The experimental design was randomized blocks with four replications of 14 treatments for the Syngenta cultivar and 15 treatments for the Nidera cultivar. The evaluated active ingredients were: tebuconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1), cyproconazole (0, 3 L p. c. ha- 1), azoxystrobin + cyproconazole (0, 3 L p. c. ha- 1) + Nimbus 0, 5 %v/v, pyraclostrobin + epoxiconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1) + Assist 0, 5 L. ha- 1, trifloxystrobin + tebuconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1) + Aureate 0, 5 L. ha- 1, <b>picoxystrobin</b> + cyproconazole (0, 3 L p. c. ha- 1) + Nimbus 0, 45 L. ha- 1, trifloxystrobin + cyproconazole (0, 15 L p. c. ha- 1) + Aureate 0, 5 L. ha- 1, azoxystrobin + tetraconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1) + Nimbus 0, 5 L. ha- 1, trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole (0, 4 L p. c. ha- 1) + Aureate 0, 4 L. ha- 1, pyraclostrobin + metconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1) + Assist 0, 5 L. ha- 1, pyraclostrobin + epoxiconazole (0, 6 L p. c. ha- 1) + Lanzar 0, 3 %v/v, azoxystrobin (0, 35 L p. c. ha- 1) + Assist 0, 5 %v/v, azoxystrobin + tebuconazole (0, 5 L p. c. ha- 1) + Assist 0, 5 %v/v, oxicarboxim (1, 2 L p. c. ha- 1) + Silwett 0, 05 %. The fungicides were applied at flowering (R 2 stage) and {{at the beginning of the}} grain formation (R 5. 2 stage). It was evaluated: rust severity at seven and 14 days after the second fungicide application; yield (kg ha- 1), thousand seed weight (g), germination (%), electrical conductivity (µS. cm- 1. g- 1), accelerated aging (%), and seed health, through the Blotter Test. The results indicate that the triazole fungicides combined with strobilurins are more effective in controlling the asian rust. Fungicides do not affect in the physiological and sanitary quality of seeds of both cultivars.
