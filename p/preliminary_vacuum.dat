40|$|Tuning forks {{are very}} popular {{experimental}} tools widely applied in low and ultra low temperature physics as mechanical resonators and cantilevers {{in the study}} of quantum liquids, STM and AFM techniques, etc. As an added benefit, these forks being cooled, have very high Q-value, typically 10 ^ 6 and their properties seems to be magnetic field independent. We present <b>preliminary</b> <b>vacuum</b> measurements of a commercial tuning fork oscillating at frequency 32 kHz conducted in magnetic fields up to 8 T and at temperature ∼ 10 mK.

40|$|The SOLEIL {{accelerator}} complex {{includes a}} 100 MeV LINAC pre-injector, a full energy booster synchrotron and a 2. 75 GeV electron storage ring with a 354 m circumference, which provides synchrotron light to 24 photon beam lines. SOLEIL {{is the first}} synchrotron facility specifically designed to make extensive use of Non Evaporable Getter (NEG) coating technology to improve the vacuum, reduce bremsstrahlung radiation and boost beam performances. In fact, NEG coating of the straight parts of the vacuum system covers more than 50 % of the overall storage ring surface and includes 100 q-pole and sextupole chambers {{as well as several}} conductance limited narrow insertion devices vacuum vessels. Use of such a large amount of NEG coated chambers has posed several challenges in term of coating technology, chamber testing, installation and machine commissioning. We report in the present paper main technological issues related to the chambers preparation, film deposition, quality control and characterization.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this work}} is to explore the low-frequency {{spectrum}} of 5 N pure copper in a sub-resonant pendulum which allows "in situ " cycled torsion deformation and recovery. Samples {{were taken from the}} same single crystals used for ultrasonic attenuation studies in order to compare both results in an Arrhenius plot. In one sample prepared by electro-erosion, polished with nitric acid, recovered 4 hours at 650 °C in <b>preliminary</b> <b>vacuum</b> and 1, 4 and 9 % deformed at room temperature, the spectra show a main Bordoni peak whose height increases with deformation, and additional peaks in the 40 - 65 K range, as important as the Bordoni peak, which are due to impurities generated during the preparation of the sample. In an uncontaminated sample cut by diamond disk, polished with a mixture of nitric, phosphoric and glacial acetic acids, and water, recovered in 5. 10. ~ mmHg vacuum, deformed 3 and 5 %, the internal friction spectra show the main Bordoni peak as the principal effect, accompanied by a defect modulus. The study of the influence of different parameters such as the amount of deformation, the amplitude and frequency of oscillation, the temperature rate and the recoveries may be an interesting contribution to the characterization of the Bordoni peak. 1...|$|E

40|$|Experimental and kinetic {{modeling}} {{studies were}} carried out on the conversion a wood-oil obtained from high pressure liquefaction of aspen poplar wood to liquid hydrocarbon fuels and useful chemicals in a fixed bed micro-reactor using HZSM- 5 catalyst. Similar experiments were conducted using silicalite, H-mordenite, H-Y and amorphous silica-alumina catalysts. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>vacuum</b> distillation studies showed that the wood-oil was made up of volatile and non-volatile fractions. A maximum yield of 62 wt% volatiles at 200 °C, 172 Pa was obtained. The volatile fraction consisted of over 80 compounds. These compounds were comprised of acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, furans, phenols and some hydrocarbons. The characteristics of the oil showed that it was unstable with time, i. e., its physical properties and chemical composition changed with time probably due to the reaction of free radicals or the oxidative coupling of some of the wood-oil components. However, when the oil was mixed with tetralin, the stability improved. Upgrading studies were first conducted over inert berl saddles in the presence and absence of steam (i. e. non-catalytic treatment/blank runs). Yields of hydrocarbons were between 16 and 25 wt% of the wood-oil. High residue fractions of between 32 to 56 wt% were obtained after processing. Some portions of wood-oil formed a carbonaceous material (char or coke) when exposed to the experimental temperatures. The chars (coke) fraction increased with temperature from 4. 7 to 12. 5 wt% when processing with steam and 8. 0 to 20. 4 wt% when processing without steam. Catalytic upgrading studies were first carried out using HZSM- 5 catalyst in the presence and absence of steam. The results showed that approximately 40 to 65 wt% of the oil could be converted to a hydrocarbon-rich product (i. e. desired organic liquid product (distillate). This contained about 45 to 70 wt% hydrocarbons with selectivities ranging between 0. 47 to 0. 88. This fraction was highly aromatic in nature and consisted mainly of benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX compounds) and other alkylated benzenes within the gasoline boiling point range. The yield and selectivities were strong functions of the process time and temperature. A comparison between the two processes, i. e. upgrading in the presence and absence of steam, showed that about 30 to 45 % reduction in coke formation and 5 to 18 wt% increase in organic distillate could be achieved when processing in the presence of steam. These changes were probably due to changes in the rates of cracking, deoxygenation, aromatization and polymerization reactions resulting from the competitive adsorption processes between steam and wood-oil molecules in addition to changes in contact time of molecules. However, the selectivity for hyqrocarbons decreased in the presence of steam. Yields of organic distillate fractions of between 72 to 93 wt% and hydrocarbon yields and selectivities of 44 to 51 wt% and 0. 93 to 1. 13, respectively, were obtained when wood-oil volatile fraction was upgraded over HZSM- 5 after separation from the non-volatile fraction by vacuum distillation. The spent HZSM- 5 catalyst could be easily regenerated and reused with little change in its performance. The yields and selectivities for hydrocarbons when upgrading with the other catalysts were between 9 and 22 wt%, and 0. 12 and 0. 29, respectively for silicalite, 16 and 28 wt%, and 0. 22 and 0. 28, respectively for H-mordenite, 15. 5 and 21 wt%, and 0. 17 and 0. 21, respectively for H-Y and S. 5 and 26. 2, and 0. 13 and 0. 36, resrectively for silica-alumina. Compared to HZSM- 5 (yield between 34 and 43 wt%, selectivity of 0. 66 to O. SS) these yields and selectivities were much lower. These experiments also showed that the pore size, acidity and shape selectivity of the catalyst influenced the distribution of hydrocarbons in terms of the carbon number. The yield and selectivity of H-mordenite and H-Y (large pore zeolites) were mostly for kerosene range hydrocarbons (C 9 to C 15) and for silicalite and HZSM- 5 (medium pore zeolites) for gasoline range hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon fraction from amorphous silica-alumina did not show any defined distribution. The performance followed the order: HZSM- 5 > H-mordenite> H-Y> Silicalite, Silica-alumina. With the aid of model compound reactions involving acetic acid methyl ester, propanoic acid, 4 -methylcyclohexanol, methylcyclopentanone, 2 -methylcyclopentanone, methoxybenzene, ethoxybenzene, phenol, 2 -methoxy- 4 -(2 -propenyl) phenol, a synthetic and wood-oil volatile, two reaction pathways were proposed to explain the chemical steps through which the final products of upgrading were obtained. Also, reaction pathways were proposed for each chemical group. These experiments showed that the final products were formed probably through cracking, deoxygenation, olefin formation, oligomerization, hydrogen and hydride transfer, cyclization, isomerization, alkylation and polymerization reactions. Rate models were derived based upon the two reaction pathways and the power law rate model. The rates of formation of products followed the general order: Organic distillate> Hydrocarbons> Residue> Coke> Gas >Aqueous Fraction. Estimates of the values of the kinetic parameters showed that the rate constants ranged between 10 - 6 (aqueous fraction) and 1. 81 (volatile fraction), activation energies between 6. 7 - 76. 0 x 10 3 KJ/Kmol and reaction orders from 0. 7 (gas formation) to 2. 5 (residue formation). Two mathematical models were derived based on the integral reactor design equation and on the two reaction pathways. This was used to estimate the yield of products. The models predicted the experimental results fairly accurately. Model discrimination showed that the model based on coke and residue formation from both volatile and non­-volatile fractions of the wood-oil best predicted the experimental results. Hydrocarbon selectivity relations which were based on coke, residue and combined coke and residue as undesired products were also derived. Application of these relations showed that lower temperatures and concentrations were most appropriate for higher hydrocarbon selectivity. However, this was at the expense of higher conversions...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the production of metal-coated optical fibres, the fibres being drawn within a vacuum. Most common methods for producing optical fibres employ an oxy-gas ring burner or an inert gas resistance furnace to reach the high temperatures necessary to melt silica. These methods have the disadvantage of exposing the molten or hot silica fibre to the atmosphere before a protective coating is applied, thereby increasing the possibility of contaminants being present at the fibre surface. A novel though more elaborate method of producing fibres is described, with <b>preliminary</b> experimental results. <b>Vacuum</b> production allows the fibre to be metal-coated, using a magnetron sputtering technique, before exposure to the atmosphere, and the methods by which this is achieved are described.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new "floppy wire" device for studying the motion through quantum fluids and solids at very low temperatures. The device is particularly well suited for producing large amplitudes of motion, for measuring drag forces at low frequency, and for studying "zero" frequency dynamics by measuring transient behavior. The device is very versatile and allows motion to be studied over {{a broad range of}} velocities and amplitudes. It generates negligible heat leaks and so is ideally suited for ultra low temperature experiments. The device has many potential applications in quantum fluids and solids research, including the study of drag forces at low frequencies in both the laminar and turbulent flow regimes, and the investigation of motion in (super) solid (4) He. We discuss the principles and modes of operation of the device and present some <b>preliminary</b> measurements in <b>vacuum,</b> in normal liquid (3) He and in superfluid (4) He.

40|$|The redox {{and optical}} {{properties}} of porphyrins make them particularly interesting and useful as potential chemical sensors for electron-accepting gases such as chlorine. Our <b>preliminary</b> investigations using <b>vacuum</b> sublimed films of 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetraphenylporphin (H 2 TPP) {{have shown that}} a fluorescence decrease can be observed when the films are exposed to chlorine gas at low concentrations (ppm). Unfortunately vacuum sublimed films of H 2 TPP produce only a weak fluorescence emission. H 2 TPP dissolved in silicone rubber films exhibits a strong fluorescence emission which makes the films more suitable for optical measurement. In addition, the non-polar environment favours a protonation reaction in which H 2 TPP is converted to the diacid dication, H 4 TPP 2 +. This is the sensing interaction used to detect and measure chlorine gas which can be followed either by monitoring the fluorescence decrease from H 2 TPP or the fluorescence increase from H 4 TPP 2 +. Equilibration of the films does not occur, however, the interaction is suited to a kineto-optical method of measurement. The films respond quickly, reversibly and reproducibly with the kineto-optical method requiring only a short exposure period. Â© 1995...|$|R
