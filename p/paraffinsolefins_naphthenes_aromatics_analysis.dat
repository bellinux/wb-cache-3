40|$|Fundamental {{understanding}} of micro-mechanical behaviors in bitumen, including phase separation, micro-friction, micro-abrasion, etc., {{can help the}} pavement engineers better understand the bitumen mechanical performances at macroscale. Recent researches show that the microstructure evolution in bitumen will directly affect its surface structure and micro-mechanical performance. In this study, the bitumen microstructure and micro-mechanical behaviors are studied using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) experiments, Phase Dynamics Theory and Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation. The AFM experiment results show that different phase-structure will occur at {{the surface of the}} bitumen samples under certain thermodynamic conditions at microscale.

40|$|International audienceDevelopment {{of models}} for {{industrial}} hydrocrackers {{has received a}} great amount of attention by the scientific community over the past decades. Two fundamentally different modelling approaches are compared in this paper: a continuous lumping model with three families (paraffins, <b>naphthenes,</b> and <b>aromatics)</b> and a single events microkinetic model. The aim is to demonstrate the differences in the capabilities of the two modelling frameworks. Both models are capable of simulating experimental data from hydrocracking of a pre-treated Vacuum Gas Oil in a pilot plant at industrial conditions. The continuous lumping model provides better results of the macroscopic effluent characteristics, such as yield structure and PNA (Paraffin, <b>Naphthene,</b> <b>Aromatic)</b> distribution in the middle distillate cut. It requires only the feed SIMDIS (Simulated Distillation) and PNA composition to be known. The single events model, on the other hand, provides information which is not available in a simple continuous lumping model. An analysis of the reaction kinetics of paraffins and mono-naphthenes is performed to demonstrate this aspect. The single events model is far more complex and computationally expensive than the continuous lumping model. In conclusion, the two approaches should be considered complementary rather than competitive. In conjunction, they can be used to balance the drawbacks of each individual modelling approac...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{rheology}} {{of mineral}} oils and their unstable water emulsion were investigated. The oil samples were domestic crude oil UA, its fractions UA 1, UA 4 and blend semi-product UP 1, while {{the concentration of}} oil in water emulsions was {{in the range from}} 1 up to 30 %. The results were analyzed based on shear stress. The oil samples UA, UA 1 and UP 1 are Newtonian fluids, while UA 4 is pseudoplastic fluid. The samples UA and UA 4 show higher value of shear stress (83. 75 Pa, 297 Pa), then other two samples UA 1 and UP 1 (18. 41 Pa, 17. 52 Pa). Rheology of investigated oils due to its complex chemical composition should be analyzed as a simultaneous effect of all their components. Therefore, structural composition of the oils was determined, namely content of paraffins, <b>naphthenes,</b> <b>aromatics</b> and asphaltenes. All samples contain paraffins, <b>naphthenes</b> and <b>aromatics</b> but only oils UA and UA 4 contain asphaltenes as well. All investigated emulsions except 30 % EUA 4 are Newtonian fluids. The EUA 4 30 % emulsion shows pseudoplastic behaviour, and it is the only 30 % emulsion among investigated ones that achieves lower shear stress then its oil. The characteristics of oil samples that could have an influence on their properties and their emulsion rheology, were determined. These characteristics are: neutralization number, interfacial tension, dielectric constant, and emulsivity. Oil samples UA and UA 4 have significantly higher values of neutralization number, dielectric constants, and emulsivity. The sample UA has the lowest value of interface tension and the greatest emulsivity, indicating that this oil, among all investigated, has the highest preference for building emulsion. This could be the reason why 20 % and 30 % emulsions of the oil UA achieve the highest shear stress among all investigated emulsions...|$|R
30|$|The {{biodegradation}} {{and water}} washing {{of crude oil}} are common in reservoirs located in areas invaded by surfaced derived meteoric formation waters, {{such as in the}} Niger Delta of Nigeria. Wherever meteoric waters penetrate deeply into a basin, any petroleum accumulations that they contact are altered. Paraffins, <b>naphthenes</b> and <b>aromatics,</b> including gases, liquids and solids, are all susceptible to microbial decomposition. The order in which the hydrocarbon compounds are oxidized depends on a variety of factors, but in general small molecules up to C 20 are consumed before large ones, and within the same molecular weight range the order is usually n-paraffins first, followed by iso-paraffins, naphthenes and aromatics; single-ring <b>naphthenes</b> and <b>aromatics</b> are attacked before iso-prenoids, steranes and triterpenes. Preferential consumption of the low molecular weight components causes the high density (low API gravity) of the unconsumed residue (Wenger et al. 2002). Empirically, it has been noted that biodegraded oil accumulations occur in reservoirs that are at temperatures less than 80  °C (Connan 1984; Barnard and Bastow 1991). At higher temperatures, it appears that many of the microorganisms involved in subsurface oil biodegradation cannot exist. However, not all oil accumulations at temperatures less than 80  °C are biodegraded.|$|R

40|$|Pre-ignition and {{auto-ignition}} are uncontrolled ignition of combustible {{mixture in}} an engine by a hot surface. Pre-ignition {{is distinct from}} “knock ” or “detonation ” which {{is caused by the}} Apid com-bustion of {{the last part of the}} mixture following the initiation of flame by a spark. More work has been carried out on knock than pre-ignition because knock sets the primary limit to the possible power-output and fuel economy of an engine. Owing to increases in engine power in recent years, however, interest in pre-ignition has been revived, and this paper describes an investigation which was primarily directed to finding the pre-ignition ratings of various fuels. Two methods of obtaining pre-ignition ratings have been developed; with one a 500 C. C. single-cylinder water-cooled unit is used, having an electrically heated hot-spot to induce pre-ignition, and with the other a single-cylinder air-cooled air & engine with an air-cooled pre-igniter is used. A rating scale has been constructed in which iso-octane has been given the value of 100, and cumene zero. A large number of pure fuels from the paraffin, <b>naphthene,</b> <b>aromatic,</b> and alcohol groups have been rated for pre-ignition tendency using these methods. In addition, typical commercial motor-fuels, motor-racing fuels, and water-alcohol injection fluids have been tested. The relationship between pre-ignition tendency and the temperature of the hot-spot with normal running and with pre-ignition conditions has been established. The effects of engine variables, for example, mixture strength, speed, ignition advance, and air and cylinder temperatures, on pre-ignition, have been studied, in addition to the effects of important fuel additives such as tetraethyl lead and the aromatic amines.

To study this relationship in a multicomponent system, relaxation times based on rotation autocorrelation functions in molecular dynamics simulations were analyzed for molecules in two sets of unmodified and polymer-modified model asphalt/bitumen systems over 298 – 473 K. The model asphalt systems were proposed previously to approximate the chemical and mechanical properties of real asphalts. Relaxations were modeled using a modified Kaulrausch–Williams–Watts function and {{were based on the}} third Legendre polynomial of normal vector time correlation functions for aromatic species asphaltene, polar <b>aromatic,</b> <b>naphthene</b> <b>aromatic.</b> Both the end-to-end vector and the longest axis eigenvector of the radius of gyration matrix were used for time correlation functions of chain molecules C 22, polystyrene. Decreases in temperature induced large increases in relaxation time consistent with the Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann equation. The presence of a polymer slowed the decay of each correlation function to some extent. The product of relaxation time and diffusion coefficient revealed qualitative differences between larger and smaller molecules in the same system. These relaxation mechanisms remained coupled for small molecules, while the larger asphaltene and polymer molecules revealed significant slowdowns in rotation compared to translational diffusion at lower temperatures. Smaller values of the stretched exponential parameter for asphaltenes compared to smaller molecules suggested a broader range of relaxation times and were consistent with this distinction. Difficulties in converging polymer chain relaxation times are discussed in terms of fluctuations in the magnitude and orientation of the end-to-end vector and chain axis eigenvector.

Two bitumen fractionation method, Rostler and Corbett methods were used to extract each chemical fraction of bitumen. A number of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of each chemical fraction on bitumen rheology such as the effect of asphaltenes, polar <b>aromatics,</b> <b>naphthene</b> <b>aromatics,</b> nitrogen bases, first acidaffins, second acidaffins and paraffins on elastic modulus (G’), viscous modulus (G”) or fatigue factor (G*sin[δ]), and rutting fator (G*/sin[δ]).

New chemicalrheological models were formulated to estimate the bitumen rheology in corporating parameters which are G’, G” or (G*sin[δ]), and (G*/sin[δ]) based on the chemical properties. Furthermore, new chemical durability indices that may indicate the ageing rate of bitumen during short-term and long-term ageing were also formulated. Based on statistical analyses, the models and the indices, which were developed by using chemical properties according to Rostler method were found to be invalid because the real and the predicted rheology were significantly different. While according to Corbett method the models and the indices were valid because the differences is not significant since t-score of the models and the indices were maximum 2. 679 and 2. 119 or less than t-critical 2. 797 and 2. 861 respectively).
