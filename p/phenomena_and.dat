Basal skin temperature measurements (Tpre) were significantly lower in patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis than in the controls. Temperatures immediately after cold challenge (T 0) were significantly lower in patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis than in controls. The lag phase {{before the start of}} temperature recovery (Tlag) was significantly greater in patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis than in control subjects. The maximum recovery index (R%) was significantly less in patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis than in controls. The maximum rate of change of temperature during the rapid phase of rewarming (Gmax) was significantly greater in controls than in patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> associated with systemic sclerosis. Discriminant analysis showed that the dynamic parameters of rewarming (Tlag, Gmax, and R%) showed greater variation between the patients with primary Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> those with Raynaud's phenomenon associated with systemic sclerosis than did Tpre or T 0. This method of analysis of cold challenge will be used in studies of the effects of treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{described}} a large Dutch family with hereditary vascular retinopathy (HVR), Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> migraine. A locus for HVR was mapped on chromosome 3 p 21. 1 -p 21. 3, but the gene {{has not yet}} been identified. The fact that all three disorders share a vascular aetiology prompted us to study whether the HVR haplotype also contributed to Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> migraine in this family. Whereas the parent-child transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) did not reach significance, the sibling TDT revealed that the HVR haplotype harbours a susceptibility factor for Raynaud's <b>phenomenon</b> <b>and</b> migraine.

However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt.

After {{the founding of the}} Egyptian state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.|$|E
5|$|He {{also sought}} the {{opinions}} {{of many of the}} astronomers to whom he had sent Mysterium, among them Reimarus Ursus (Nicolaus Reimers Bär)—the imperial mathematician to Rudolph II and a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe. Ursus did not reply directly, but republished Kepler's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over (what is now called) the Tychonic system with Tycho. Despite this black mark, Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler, starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler's system; among a host of objections, Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus. Through their letters, Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems, dwelling on lunar <b>phenomena</b> <b>and</b> Copernican theory (particularly its theological viability). But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho's observatory, Kepler had no way to address many of these issues.|$|E
