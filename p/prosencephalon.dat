5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the <b>prosencephalon,</b> mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E
5|$|As {{the brain}} develops, {{by the fourth}} week of embryological {{development}} three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the <b>prosencephalon,</b> mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day. At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.|$|E
25|$|Disruption of {{hedgehog}} signaling during embryonic development, through either deleterious mutation or {{consumption of}} teratogens by the gestating mother, {{can lead to}} severe developmental abnormalities. Holoprosencephaly, {{the failure of the}} embryonic <b>prosencephalon</b> to divide to form cerebral hemispheres, occurs with a frequency of about 1 in 8,000 live births and about 1 in 200 spontaneous abortions in humans and is commonly linked to mutations in genes involved in the hedgehog pathway, including SHH and PTCH. Cyclopia, one of the most severe defects of holoprosencephaly, results if the pathway inhibitor cyclopamine is consumed by gestating mammals.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} development, the human {{central nervous system}} is often {{classified}} based on the original three primitive vesicles from which it develops: These primary vesicles form in the normal development of the neural tube of the embryo and initially include the <b>prosencephalon,</b> mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, in rostral to caudal (from head to tail) orientation. Later in development {{of the nervous system}} each section itself turns into smaller components. During development, the cells that migrate tangentially to form the basal ganglia are directed by the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences. The following table demonstrates this developmental classification and traces it to the anatomic structures found in the basal ganglia. The structures relevant to the basal ganglia are shown in bold.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>prosencephalon</b> divides {{into the}} telencephalon, which forms the cortex of the {{developed}} brain, and the diencephalon. The ventricles contained within the telencephalon become the lateral ventricles, and the ventricles within the diencephalon become the third ventricle.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the brain}} develops, {{by the fourth}} week of embryological {{development}} several swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system, and are three in number: the <b>prosencephalon,</b> mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. These in turn divide into five sections. As these sections develop around the neural canal, the inner neural canal becomes known as primitive ventricles. These form the ventricular system of the brain: [...] The neural stem cells of the developing brain, principally radial glial cells, line the developing ventricular system in a transient zone called the ventricular zone.|$|E

60|$|This I don't deny. It gets, {{they tell}} me, into the brain. I don't dispute it. It turns the <b>prosencephalon</b> into mere punk. I know it. I've felt it doing it. They tell me--and I believe it--that after even one glass of alcohol, or {{shall we say}} Scotch whisky and soda, a man's working power is lowered by twenty per cent. This is a dreadful thing. After three glasses, so it is held, his {{capacity}} for sustained rigid thought is cut in two. And after about six glasses the man's working power is reduced by {{at least a hundred}} per cent. He merely sits there--in his arm-chair, at his club let us say--with all power, even all desire to work gone out of him, not thinking rigidly, not sustaining his thought, a mere shapeless chunk of geniality, half hidden in the blue smoke of his cigar.|$|E
60|$|Section 120. Figure 1 is a {{corresponding}} {{figure of the}} actual state of affairs in the adult. The brain is seen in median vertical section. (ch.) is the right cerebral hemisphere, an inflated vesicle, which, in the mammal-- but not in our lower types-- reaches back {{over the rest of}} the fore-brain, and also over the mid-brain, and hides these and the pineal gland in the dorsal view of the brain (Figure 2). The hollow of the hemisphere on either side communicates with the third ventricle, the original cavity of the fore-brain (1 in Figure 5), by an aperture (the foramen of Monro), indicated by a black arrow (f.M.). Besides their original communication through the intermediation of the fore-brain, the hemispheres are also united above its roof by a broad bridge of fibre, the corpus callosum (c.c.), which is distinctive of the mammalian animals. The original fore-brain vesicle has its lateral walls thickened to form the optic thalami (o.th.), between which a middle commissure, (m.c.), absent in lower types, stretches like a great beam across the third ventricle. The original fore-brain is often called the thalamencephalon, the hemisphere, the <b>prosencephalon,</b> the olfactory lobes, the rhinencephalon.|$|E
50|$|The optical vesicle (which {{eventually}} become the optic nerve, retina and iris) forms at the basal plate of the <b>prosencephalon.</b> The alar plate of the <b>prosencephalon</b> expands {{to form the}} cerebral hemispheres (the telencephalon) whilst its basal plate becomes the diencephalon.

50|$|The neural tube {{gives rise}} to both brain and spinal cord. The {{anterior}} (or 'rostral') portion of the neural tube initially differentiates into three brain vesicles (pockets): the <b>prosencephalon</b> at the front, the mesencephalon, and, between the mesencephalon and the spinal cord, the rhombencephalon. (By six weeks in the human embryo) the <b>prosencephalon</b> then divides further into the telencephalon and diencephalon; and the rhombencephalon divides into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The spinal cord {{is derived from the}} posterior or 'caudal' portion of the neural tube.|$|E

50|$|Four neural tube subdivisions each {{eventually}} {{develop into}} distinct {{regions of the}} central nervous system by the division of neuroepithelial cells: the forebrain (<b>prosencephalon),</b> the midbrain (mesencephalon), the hindbrain (rhombencephalon) and the spinal cord.|$|E

50|$|The third ventricle, {{like other}} parts of the {{ventricular}} system of the brain, develops from the central neural canal of the neural tube. Specifically, it originates from the portion of the tube that is present in the developing <b>prosencephalon,</b> and subsequently in the developing diencephalon.|$|E
50|$|Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a cephalic {{disorder}} {{in which the}} <b>prosencephalon</b> (the forebrain of the embryo) fails to develop into two hemispheres. Normally, the forebrain is formed and the face begins to develop in the fifth and sixth weeks of human pregnancy. The condition also occurs in other species.|$|E
50|$|Cyclopia (also {{cyclocephaly}} or synophthalmia) {{is a rare}} form of holoprosencephaly and is a congenital disorder (birth defect) {{characterized by}} the failure of the embryonic <b>prosencephalon</b> to properly divide the orbits of the eye into two cavities. Its incidence is 1 in 16,000 in born animals and 1 in 200 in miscarried fetuses.|$|E
50|$|In the {{developing}} vertebrate embryo, the neural tube is subdivided into four unseparated sections which then develop further into distinct {{regions of the}} central nervous system; these are the <b>prosencephalon</b> (forebrain), the mesencephalon (midbrain) the rhombencephalon (hindbrain) and the spinal cord. The <b>prosencephalon</b> develops further into the telencephalon and the diencephalon. The dorsal telencephalon {{gives rise to the}} pallium (cerebral cortex in mammals and reptiles) and the ventral telencephalon generates the basal ganglia. The diencephalon develops into the thalamus and hypothalamus, including the optic vesicles (future retina). The dorsal telencephalon then forms two lateral telencephalic vesicles, separated by the midline, which develop into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Birds and fish have a dorsal telencephalon, like all vertebrates, but it is generally unlayered and therefore not considered a cerebral cortex. Only a layered cytoarchitecture can be considered a cortex.|$|E
50|$|In {{the anatomy}} of the brain of vertebrates, the {{forebrain}} or <b>prosencephalon</b> is the rostral-most (forward-most) portion of the brain. The forebrain, the midbrain (mesencephalon), and hindbrain (rhombencephalon) are the three primary portions of the brain during early development of the central nervous system. It controls body temperature, reproductive functions, eating, sleeping, and any display of emotions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{vertebrate}} organisms, brain vesicles are transient, bulge-like {{features of}} the early neural tube during embryonic brain development. Vesicle formation begins shortly after anterior (rostral) neural tube closure at about embryonic day (E) 9.0 in the mouse and {{the fourth and fifth}} gestational week in human development. [...] In zebrafish and chicken embryos, brain vesicles form by about 24 hours and 48 hours post-conception, respectively. [...] Initially there are three primary brain vesicles: <b>prosencephalon,</b> mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. Soon, however, as the early brain grows the <b>prosencephalon</b> is subdivided into the telencephalon and diencephalon, and the rhombencephalon into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. During these early vesicle stages, the walls of the neural tube contain neural stem cells in a region called the neuroepithelium or ventricular zone. These neural stem cells divide rapidly, driving growth of the early brain, but later, these stem cells begin to generate neurons through the process of neurogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Not only a boundary, the ZLI {{is also a}} {{compartment}} {{with separate}} cell lineage restriction boundaries both anterior and posterior of a section of shh expression. The importance of the ZLI was once more confirmed by ectopic expression of shh in {{other regions of the}} forebrain, known as the <b>prosencephalon</b> during development (both the telencephalon and diencephalon), inducing a ZLI-like region that induces thalamic fate.|$|E
50|$|The {{diencephalon}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} vesicles of the brain formed during embryogenesis. During the third week of development a neural tube is created from the ectoderm - one of the three primary germ layers. The tube forms three main vesicles during the third week of development - the <b>prosencephalon,</b> the mesencephalon and the rhombencephlaon. The prosencephlon gradually divides into the telencephalon and the diencephalon.|$|E
50|$|Head {{pressing}} is a veterinary condition {{characterized by}} standing {{close to a}} wall or corner face-first without moving. This condition is seen in pets such as dogs and cats, and also other animals such as cows, horses, and goats. Head pressing is usually {{a sign of a}} neurological disorder, especially of the forebrain (e.g., <b>prosencephalon</b> disease), or of toxicity due to liver damage, such as Portosystemic shunt and hepatic encephalopathy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{anterior}} {{portion of}} the neural tube forms the three main parts of the brain: the forebrain (<b>prosencephalon),</b> midbrain (mesencephalon), and the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). These structures initially appear just after neural tube closure as bulges called brain vesicles in a pattern specified by anterior-posterior patterning genes, including Hox genes, other transcription factors such as Emx, Otx, and Pax genes, and secreted signaling factors such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and Wnts. [...] These brain vesicles further divide into subregions. The <b>prosencephalon</b> {{gives rise to the}} telencephalon and diencephalon, and the rhombencephalon generates the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The hindbrain, which is the evolutionarily most ancient part of the chordate brain, also divides into different segments called rhombomeres. The rhombomeres generate many of the most essential neural circuits needed for life, including those that control respiration and heart rate, and produce most of the cranial nerves. [...] Neural crest cells form ganglia above each rhombomere. The early neural tube is primarily composed of the germinal neuroepithelium, later called the ventricular zone, which contains primary neural stem cells called radial glial cells and serves as the main source of neurons produced during brain development through the process of neurogenesis.|$|E

At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.|$|E
50|$|The cephalic end of {{the neural}} groove {{exhibits}} several dilatations, which, when the tube is closed, assume the form of three vesicles; these constitute the three primary cerebral vesicles, and correspond respectively to the future fore-brain (<b>prosencephalon),</b> mid-brain (mesencephalon), and hind-brain (rhombencephalon). The walls of the vesicles are developed into the nervous tissue and neuroglia of the brain, and their cavities are modified to form its ventricles. The remainder of the tube forms the medulla spinalis or spinal cord; from its ectodermal wall the nervous and neuroglial elements of the medulla spinalis are developed while the cavity persists as the central canal.|$|E
50|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development.

50|$|The ontogenic {{development}} of the cerebral cortex is a complex and finely tuned process influenced by the interplay between genes and environment. The cerebral cortex develops from the most anterior part of the neural plate, a specialized part of the embryonic ectoderm. The neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube. From the cavity inside the neural tube develops the ventricular system, and, from the epithelial cells of its walls, the neurons and glia of the nervous system. The most anterior (front, or cranial) part of the neural plate, the <b>prosencephalon,</b> which is evident before neurulation begins, {{gives rise to the}} cerebral hemispheres and its later cortex.|$|E
