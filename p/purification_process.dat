5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical <b>purification</b> <b>process.</b> Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E

25|$|For human consumption, sucrose is extracted, and refined, {{from either}} sugar cane or sugar beet. The modern sugar {{refinement}} processes involves bleaching, to remove residual color, and crystallization. Crystallization is a <b>purification</b> <b>process</b> which removes other substances, and which produces crystals of pure sucrose. These crystals are clear, odorless, {{and have a}} sweet taste.

25|$|The {{natural gas}} {{fed into the}} LNG plant will be treated to remove water, {{hydrogen}} sulfide, {{carbon dioxide and other}} components that will freeze (e.g., benzene) under the low temperatures needed for storage or be destructive to the liquefaction facility. LNG typically contains more than 90 percentmethane. It also contains small amounts of ethane, propane, butane, some heavier alkanes, and nitrogen. The <b>purification</b> <b>process</b> can be designed to give almost 100 percentmethane. One of the risks of LNG is a rapid phase transition explosion (RPT), which occurs when cold LNG comes into contact with water.|$|E
25|$|If {{the protein}} of {{interest}} is not secreted by the organism into the surrounding solution, {{the first step of}} each <b>purification</b> <b>process</b> is the disruption of the cells containing the protein. Depending on how fragile the protein is and how stable the cells are, one could, for instance, use one of the following methods: i) repeated freezing and thawing, ii) sonication, iii) homogenization by high pressure (French press), iv) homogenization by grinding (bead mill), and v) permeabilization by detergents (e.g. Triton X-100) and/or enzymes (e.g. lysozyme). Finally, the cell debris can be removed by centrifugation so that the proteins and other soluble compounds remain in the supernatant.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Fleming's {{accidental}} {{discovery of}} the antibiotic penicillin involved a Penicillium mold called Penicillium notatum (although the species identity is disputed as possibly being Penicillium chrysogenum or Penicillium rubens). Fleming continued to investigate Penicillin, showing that it could inhibit various types of bacteria found in infections and other ailments, but {{he was unable to}} produce the compound in large enough amounts necessary for production of a medicine. His work was expanded by a team at Oxford University; Clutterbuck, Lovell, and Raistrick, who began to work on the problem in 1931. This team was also unable to produce the pure compound in any large amount, and found that the <b>purification</b> <b>process</b> diminished its effectiveness and negated the anti-bacterial properties it had.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known complete <b>purification</b> <b>process</b> for {{potassium nitrate}} was outlined in 1270 by the chemist and engineer Hasan al-Rammah of Syria {{in his book}} al-Furusiyya wa al-Manasib al-Harbiyya (The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices). In this book, al-Rammah describes first the purification of barud (crude saltpeter mineral) by boiling it with minimal water and using only the hot solution, then the use of potassium carbonate (in the form of wood ashes) to remove calcium and magnesium by precipitation of their carbonates from this solution, leaving a solution of purified potassium nitrate, which could then be dried. This {{was used for the}} manufacture of gunpowder and explosive devices. The terminology used by al-Rammah indicated a Chinese origin for the gunpowder weapons about which he wrote.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, Wheeler {{accepted}} {{a request from}} Arthur Compton to join the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. He moved there in January 1942, joining Eugene Wigner's group, which was studying nuclear reactor design. He co-wrote a paper with Robert F. Christy on [...] "Chain Reaction of Pure Fissionable Materials in Solution", which was important in the plutonium <b>purification</b> <b>process.</b> It would not be declassified until December 1955. He gave the neutron moderator its name, replacing the term [...] "slower downer" [...] used by Enrico Fermi.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to this eternal punishment due to mortal sin, every sin, including venial sin, is a turning away from God through what the Catechism of the Catholic Church calls an unhealthy attachment to creatures, an attachment that must be purified either here on earth, or after death in the state called purgatory. [...] "The process of sanctification and interior renewal requires not only forgiveness from the guilt (culpa) of sin, but also purification from the harmful effects or wounds of sin." [...] This <b>purification</b> <b>process</b> gives rise to [...] "temporal punishment", because, not involving a total rejection of God, it is not eternal and can be expiated.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the process of multistep purification, {{the amount of the}} specific protein has to be compared to the amount of total protein. The latter can be determined by the Bradford total protein assay or by absorbance of light at 280 nm, however some reagents used during the <b>purification</b> <b>process</b> may interfere with the quantification. [...] For example, imidazole (commonly used for purification of polyhistidine-tagged recombinant proteins) is an amino acid analogue and at low concentrations will interfere with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay for total protein quantification. [...] Impurities in low-grade imidazole will also absorb at 280nm, resulting in an inaccurate reading of protein concentration from UV absorbance.|$|E
2500|$|Protein {{purification}} is {{a series}} of processes intended to isolate one or a few proteins from a complex mixture, usually cells, tissues or whole organisms. [...] Protein purification is vital for the characterization of the function, structure and interactions of the protein of interest. The <b>purification</b> <b>process</b> may separate the protein and non-protein parts of the mixture, and finally separate the desired protein from all other proteins. Separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification. Separation steps usually exploit differences in protein size, physico-chemical properties, binding affinity and biological activity. [...] The pure result may be termed protein isolate.|$|E
2500|$|Choice of a {{starting}} material {{is key to}} the design of a <b>purification</b> <b>process.</b> [...] In a plant or animal, a particular protein usually isn't distributed homogeneously throughout the body; different organs or tissues have higher or lower concentrations of the protein. [...] Use of only the tissues or organs with the highest concentration decreases the volumes needed to produce a given amount of purified protein. [...] If the protein is present in low abundance, or if it has a high value, scientists may use recombinant DNA technology to develop cells that will produce large quantities of the desired protein (this is known as an expression system). Recombinant expression allows the protein to be tagged, e.g. by a His-tag or Strep-tag, to facilitate purification, which means that the purification can be done in fewer steps. In addition, recombinant expression usually starts with a higher fraction of the desired protein than is present in a natural source.|$|E

40|$|Antibodies {{and related}} {{proteins}} comprise {{one of the}} largest and fastest-growing classes of protein pharmaceuticals. A majority of such molecules are monoclonal antibodies; however, many new entities are antibody fragments. Due to their structural, physiological, and pharmacological properties, antibody fragments offer new biopharmaceutical opportunities. In the case of recombinant full-length antibodies with suitable Fc regions, two or three column <b>purification</b> <b>processes</b> centered around Protein A affinity chromatography have proven to be fast, efficient, robust, cost-effective, and scalable. Most antibody fragments lack Fc and suitable affinity for Protein A. Adapting proven antibody <b>purification</b> <b>processes</b> to antibody fragments demands different affinity chromatography. Such technology must offer the unit operation advantages noted above, and be suitable for most of the many different types of antibody fragments. Protein L affinity chromatography appears to fulfill these criteria—suggesting its consideration as a key unit operation in antibody fragment processing...|$|R
