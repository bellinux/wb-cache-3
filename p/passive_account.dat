In contrast to al-Baladhuri's <b>passive</b> <b>account</b> of Iyad's capture of Dara, 10th-century historian Agapius of Hierapolis wrote that many were slain on both sides, particularly among the Muslims, but the city ultimately fell after a negotiated surrender. Iyad continued toward Arzanene, then to Bitlis and finally to Khilat; all cities surrendered after negotiations with their patricians. Shortly after, Iyad entrusted the leader of Bitlis with collecting the land tax from Khilat, and left for Raqqa. On the way there, one medieval Muslim report holds that Iyad dispatched a force to capture Sinjar, after which he settled it with Arabs.|$|E
40|$|Most {{prominent}} {{accounts of}} autonomy are active accounts, {{which means they}} hold that an agent can be autonomous {{with respect to a}} given action only if that agent has appropriately sanctioned that action. Active accounts, however, are vulnerable to the regress problem, since it seems that the required sanctioning actions are themselves just actions that must be sanctioned. Passive accounts hope to avoid the regress problem by eschewing the notion that autonomous action requires agential sanction, but face in its place what I call the incompleteness problem for passive accounts. Here, I evaluate one <b>passive</b> <b>account,</b> recently defended by Sarah Buss, and argue that it can avoid the incompleteness problem only if it is supplemented by a satisfactory account of the development of autonomy. I then suggest that one development account, offered by Ishtiyaque Haji and Stefaan Cuypers, is an especially good supplement. My conclusion is that Buss’s account, supplemented in the way I suggest, can avoid the incompleteness problem...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} deindustrialisation and the subsequent move to a post-industrial 'new economy' on skilled working class men and their sons and grandsons. The decline in manufacturing and growth of service-based jobs has prompted many social theorists to argue working-class men’s ability to construct meaningful careers and identities is becoming ever more limited. This thesis explores 27 career history interviews collected in South-East England from 13 former Royal Dockyard tradesmen and 14 of these men’s sons and grandsons. Closed in 1984, Chatham’s naval shipbuilding and repair yard had been the major employer for generations of men and their families for over 400 years. To explore this generational significance and consider the long-term, residual effect of deindustrialisation on male work identities a mutigenerational sample was used. In {{the process of doing}} thematic analysis, it became clear that cross-generational themes were being continued and reinterpreted by these men. Three intergenerational themes were central to the men’s explanations of how they tackled transition in their working lives. The first theme ‘getting on’ reflects evidence that the men’s career motivations and attitudes were primarily focused on upward career mobility and better job security. The second theme ‘personal adaptability’ was the men strategy of adapting skills and embodying new work identities to actualize their desire to ‘get on’. However in the transition to post-industrial employment, men did not lose their engagement with their trade learning and hands on work. The third theme ‘a craft outlook’ illustrates that men developed unpaid craft projects, to retain a ‘linear life narrative’ (Sennett, 1998), which gave meaning to their evolving careers and lives. These craft projects also created channels through which fathers, sons and grandsons talked about their growing and changing relationships with each other. In light of these themes, this study generates four main findings. First although men had to deal with change in their careers this did not cause a rupture in their working identities. Instead they used powerful life themes (Savickas, 1997), to take ownership of their own working lives. So they navigated deindustrialisation and employment change in a manner that left many now viewing these transitions as positive in either personal and/or economic terms. Second, class and occupation were still fundamental to men’s identity. But, unlike career writers who suggest that a self-driven career is a middle class, professional notion this study found these men did construct sophisticated career narratives. That incorporated both their private and paid work, akin to Mirvis and Hall’s (1994) notion of a ‘protean career’. Third, the PhD finds that neither sample experienced a working class male crisis due to feeling they could not satisfy traditional gendered identities and masculine practices. Instead, intergenerational transmission was based on each generation making something of what had been passed to them, a process Bertaux and Bertaux-Wiame (1997 : 93) term the ‘transmission of equivalents’. The replication of occupations was not the desire of any generation in this study. Finally, this study finds that craft had a continued and evolving meaning for the majority of men. Craft gave men practices on which to structure a linear life narrative, produce familial solidarity and create a powerful labour ethic of performing quality work. Overall findings from this research challenge the idea that most men were/are passive victims of industrial change. By contrast, the majority of men in this study managed to carefully adapt to and navigate the transition from industrial to post-industrial work. Whereas this study only speaks for a section of the skilled working class, these findings suggest that the current literature needs to be modified in three ways. First, the manual working classes should not be considered a homogeneous or static group when responding to deindustrialisation. The skilled men in this study demonstrate a distinct experience of work transitions. Second, the experiences of the men were mediated by the regional employment context of the south-east, whereas the current literature is largely based on relatively isolated communities in the North of England or Celtic fringes. This studies results therefore questions the validity of generalising the impacts of this process at a national or international level. Third, unlike static studies of geographically located collective community experience, this research has followed generations of families. These individuals’ career stories reflect the important accounts of men who strategically moved away or commute to work outside these former industrial areas. Overall the omission of these factors has led to an over <b>passive</b> <b>account</b> of deindustrialisation and the move to the new economy, which robs many working-class men of their individuality and active agency...|$|E

Axial motion was measured at the anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the diaphragm, and the mean of these measurements was used. The volume displacement was calculated in two ways: first, from respiratory inductive plethysmograph-(Respitrace) derived cross-sectional area changes of rib cage and abdomen (Vdi,RIP) {{by means of a}} theoretical analysis described by Mead and Loring (J. Appl. Physiol. 53 : 750 - 755, 1982) and, second, from fluoroscopically measured changes in position and anteroposterior surface of the diaphragm (Vdi,F). A very good linear relationship was found between Vdi,RIP and Vdi,F during inspiration as well as expiration (r greater than 0. 95), indicating that the analysis of Mead and Loring was valid in the conditions of the present study. The diaphragmatic volume displacement (active or <b>passive)</b> <b>accounted</b> for 50 - 60 % of VC. A very good linear relationship was also found between mean axial motion and volume displacement of the diaphragm measured with both methods during inspiration and expiration (r greater than 0. 98).

Each child completed one of four conditions crossing cue highlighting (hidden placement of the cue vs. visible placement of the cue and additional cue reminders) with delay period (responses allowed immediately versus responses allowed only after a delay).

Specifically, the bei construction is analyzed, within the Lexical-Functional Grammar, as the passive counterpart of the active ba construction.

In this paper, the design of a high-performance frontend for passive RFID transponders under the international standard ISO/IEC 18000 - 4 / 6 is presented. Its physical implementation has been carried out on a commercial RF-CMOS 0. 35 ?m technology. Special structures such as Schottky diodes and MIM capacitors are not necessary. The frontend provides a regulated supply voltage of 1 V at a nominal current consumption of 2 ?A for the transponder back-end (the digital core and additional analog circuits such as an on-chip temperature sensor). The chip is matched to a specially designed resonant antenna. Measurement results coincide largely with those obtained though simulation, thus confirming the effectiveness of the design procedure.

Active waste entails utility for the public decision maker (as in the case of bribery) whereas passive waste does not (as in the case of ineffciency due to red tape). To assess the empirical relevance of both forms of waste, we analyze purchases of standardized goods by Italian public bodies and exploit a policy experiment associated with a national procurement agency. A revealed preference argument implies that if public bodies with higher costs are more likely to buy from the procurement agency rather than from traditional suppliers, cost differences {{are more likely to be}} due to passive waste.

40|$|We study a {{class of}} two-player {{continuous}} time stochastic games in which agents can make (costly) discrete or discontinuous changes in the variables that affect their payoffs. It is shown that in these games there are Markov perfect equilibria of the two-sided (s,S) rule type. In such equilibria at a critical low state (resp. high state) player 1 (resp. 2) effects a discrete change in the environment. In some of these equilbria either or both players may be <b>passive.</b> On <b>account</b> {{of the presence of}} fixed costs (to discrete changes) the payoffs are non-convex and hence standard existence arguments fail. We prove that the best response map satisfies a surprisingly strong monotonicity condition and use this to establish the existence of Markov perfect equilibria. The first-best solution is also a two-sided (s,S) rule but the symmetric first-best solution has a wider s-S band than the symmetric Markovian equilibria. A further contribution of this paper is the development of a framework for continuous time games, which allows players to react instantaneously to their opponent's moves.

40|$|PURPOSE: Smoking is {{the leading}} {{controllable}} risk factor for heart disease. Only about 69 % of U. S. indoor workers are currently covered by a smoke-free workplace policy. This analysis projects the cardiovascular health and economic effects of making all U. S. workplaces smoke free after 1 year and at steady state. METHODS: We estimated the number of U. S. indoor workers not covered by smoke-free workplace policies, {{and the effects of}} making all workplaces smoke free on smoking behavior and on the relative risks of acute myocardial infarctions and strokes. One-year and steady-state results were calculated using an exponential decline model. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed for a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The first-year effect of making all workplaces smoke free would produce about 1. 3 million new quitters and prevent over 950 million cigarette packs from being smoked annually, worth about $ 2. 3 billion in pretax sales to the tobacco industry. In 1 year, making all workplaces smoke free would prevent about 1500 myocardial infarctions and 350 strokes, and result in nearly $ 49 million in savings in direct medical costs. At steady state, 6250 myocardial infarctions and 1270 strokes would be prevented, and $ 224 million would be saved in direct medical costs annually. Reductions in <b>passive</b> smoking would <b>account</b> for 60 % of effects among acute myocardial infarctions. CONCLUSION: Making all U. S. workplaces smoke free would result in considerable health and economic benefits within 1 year. Reductions in <b>passive</b> smoking would <b>account</b> for a majority of these savings.

This paper {{documents}} the main risk factors that determine children's exposure to passive smoke, and then uses econometric techniques to provide a new economic quantification {{of the impact of}} this exposure on child health. Such information is valuable to policy-makers when deciding upon the amount of resources to direct towards the problem of passive smoking. One of our main contributions is the use of a large nationally representative sample of children drawn from the Health Survey for England, for whom we match parental and household smoking and demographic characteristics. We also utilise an objective measure of children's exposure, namely, the level of cotinine - a metabolite of nicotine - in their saliva. We find that both parental and child carer smoking behaviour, as well as area deprivation, are major risk factors in determining children's exposure to <b>passive</b> smoke. <b>Accounting</b> for the potential measurement error in cotinine in our estimations, we have calculated that for a child who is exposed to a high number of passive smoking risk factors, the shadow price or income-equivalence of such exposure is 316, 000 (US 30, 000) per year. A further policy-related result is that comprehensively controlling for child passive smoking does not explain the observed gradient between household income and child health...|$|R

Methods 294 AS patients meeting modified New York Criteria completed psychological measures evaluating depression, resilience, active and passive coping, internality and helplessness at the baseline visit. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic data were also collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were completed to determine the strength of correlation of psychological variables with functional limitation, as measured by the Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI). Results In the multivariate regression analysis, the psychological variables contributed significantly to the variance in BASFI scores, adding an additional 24 % to the overall R-square beyond that accounted by demographic and medical variables (R-square 32 %), resulting in a final R-square of 56 %.

40|$|Much of {{the current}} debate {{surrounding}} social accounting focuses upon the diversity of views among interested stakeholders but {{is concerned with the}} synthesis of these views into a single truth that can be accounted for. Given this, the issue becomes one of deciding how to come closest to the truth, what should be accounted for, and what should not. This approach is grounded in Cartesian (and related) dualisms. A central feature of this dualism is the separation of an entity (e. g., organization) from its environment – also viewable as a divorce of Self from Other. In this “entitative” construction (Hosking and Morley, 1991) organisations are implicitly assumed to act as selfish entities concerned only with the effects of their actions upon their own Self. Relatedly, accounting methods are assumed to produce a repository of knowledge concerning the organisation, its actions and the results of those actions. Accounting practices only need to record actions and effects that are internal to the organisation (Self). Other – other organisations, communities, or „environment‟ – is constructed as external, as an exclusive, binary opposite; Other becomes largely irrelevant to accounting discourses. By constructing Other as a separate and <b>passive</b> Object, <b>accounting</b> practices eliminate the sacred (or moral) dimensions of relations.

40|$|The kinetic {{parameters}} of auxin transport in suspension-cultured soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) root cells were investigated. The same {{processes that are}} responsible for polar indoleacetic acid (IAA) transport in other plant tissues were found to occur in soybean root cells. These include (a) passive diffusion of the undissociated auxin molecule across the plasma membrane, (b) uptake via a specific, saturable carrier, and (c) phytotropin-sensitive efflux. Metabolism of exogenously added IAA was rapid; {{at the end of a}} 15 -minute uptake period > 80 % of the IAA taken up had been converted to other compounds. The time course of [14 C]IAA uptake in the first 90 seconds revealed two phases, the first corresponding to a rate of uptake approximately twice as large as the second phase. The transition to the second phase was delayed in the presence of the phytotropins triiodobenzoic acid or naphthylphthalamic acid, suggesting that an increase in the efflux of label as IAA accumulates in the cytoplasm is responsible for the transition. Carrier-mediated uptake contributes between 50 and 60 % to the total rate of auxin uptake from a 0. 28 micromolar IAA solution, with <b>passive</b> diffusion <b>accounting</b> for the remainder. Kinetic analysis of carrier-mediated uptake revealed a pH optimum of 5. 0 and a Michaelis-Menten constant of 0. 4 micromolar at pH 5. 5.

40|$|This book {{presents}} {{extensive and}} careful {{documentation of the}} history of those English constructions featuring the notorious impersonal verbs and <b>passives.</b> " The <b>account</b> is embedded in a discussion of the Old English (OE) system of case and its subsequent breakdown; the analysis relies on Lexical Mapping theory, in which the mapping between thematic role, grammatical function and case is central. In the introduction, the aims of the book are laid out: a reexamination, based on newly collected facts, of the evidence for the hypothesis that the changes in constructions featuring impersonals and passives are due to the loss of the morphological case system. Chapter 2 contains an overview of those parts of OE syntax most relevant to the book: case marking with particular verb classes, agreement, constituent order, formal subjects, and coordinate subject deletion. The latter may not immediately seem central, but since it is the only workable test for establishing the grammatical function SUBJECT relevant later in th...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{diffusion}} through a viscoelastic biodegradable material is studied. The phenomenon {{is described by}} a set of three coupled partial differential equations that take into <b>account</b> <b>passive</b> diffusion, stress driven diffusion and the degradation of the material. The stability properties of the model are studied. Erodible viscoelastic materials, as biodegradable polymers, have a huge range of applications in medicine to make drug eluting implants. Using the mathematical model the behavior of a particular ocular drug eluting implant which describes drug delivery into the vitreous chamber of the eye is presented. The model consists of coupled systems of partial differential equations linked by interface conditions. The chemical structure, the viscoelastic properties and the diffusion in the implant as well as the transport in the vitreous are taken into account to simulate the evolution in vivo of released drug. The dependence of the delivery profile on the properties of the material is addressed. Numerical simulations that illustrate the interplay between these phenomena are included...|$|R
40|$|Background: Asthma is {{a common}} {{respiratory}} disease caused by the interaction of genetic susceptibility and exposure to various environmental factors. Passive smoke exposure, characterized by parental smoking, {{has been shown to}} be a risk factor for the development of atopy and asthma. Objective: We sought to perform a genome-wide linkage screen for asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and to determine the influence of passive tobacco smoke exposure during childhood on the results of genetic linkage studies to investigate gene-environment interactions. Methods: A genome-wide linkage screen for asthma and BHR was performed in 200 families ascertained through a parent with asthma. Analyses were performed separately for the entire sample and for the smoking-exposed and nonexposed families. Results: For asthma and BHR, the strongest evidence for linkage was observed for chromosomes 3 p and 5 q. The families in which the children were exposed to <b>passive</b> smoking <b>accounted</b> for the evidence for linkage of BHR to 5 q (P <. 001), but evidence for linkage to 3 p was found in both sets of families. Similar results were observed for asthma. However, there was no observed difference in the frequency of asthma or BHR in the offspring from the smoke-exposed compared with the nonexposed families. Conclusion: The results from this study demonstrate that the influence of susceptibility genes for a common disease such as asthma might not be apparent unless there is the appropriate exposure to environmental stimuli, such as passive exposure to cigarette smoke. This approach should be useful for identification of asthma susceptibility genes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Costs of tobacco-related {{disease can}} be useful {{evidence}} to support tobacco control. In Hong Kong we now have locally derived data on the risks of smoking, including passive smoking. Aim: To estimate the health-related costs of tobacco from both active and passive smoking. Methods: Using local data, we estimated active and passive smoking-attributable mortality, hospital admissions, outpatient, emergency and general practitioner visits for adults and children, use of nursing homes and domestic help, time lost from work due to illness and premature mortality in the productive years. Morbidity risk data were used where possible but otherwise estimates based on mortality risks were used. Utilisation was valued at unit costs or from survey data. Work time lost was valued at the median wage and an additional costing included a value of US$ 1. 3 million for a life lost. Results: In the Hong Kong population of 6. 5 million in 1998, the annual value of direct medical costs, long term care and productivity loss was US$ 532 million for active smoking and US$ 156 million for passive smoking; <b>passive</b> smoking <b>accounted</b> for 23 % of the total costs. Adding the value of attributable lives lost brought the annual cost to US$ 9. 4 billion. Conclusion: The health costs of tobacco use are high and represent a net loss to society. Passive smoking increases these costs by at least a quarter. This quantification {{of the costs of}} tobacco provides strong motivation for legislative action on smoke-free areas in the Asia Pacific Region and elsewhere. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
