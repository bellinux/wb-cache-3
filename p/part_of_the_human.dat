These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages (<b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> immune system). They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces {{and the formation of}} biofilms.|$|E

5|$|Body piercing, {{a form of}} body modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn.

5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> microbiota, found in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation is {{a normal}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in {{the walls of the}} bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> brain. It {{is divided into two}} cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions. Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right. The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum.|$|E

5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{anatomical}} study, {{the penis}} {{can be described}} as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra. With regard to nerve endings, the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 or more (for its glans or clitoral body as a whole) is commonly cited as being twice as many as the nerve endings found in the human penis (for its glans or body as a whole), and as more than any other <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> body. These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on clitoral anatomy or those concerning the nerve endings in the human penis. For example, while some sources estimate that the human penis has 4,000 nerve endings, other sources state that the glans or the entire penile structure have the same amount of nerve endings as the clitoral glans, or discuss whether the uncircumcised penis has thousands more than the circumcised penis or is generally more sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables {{have been}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> diet from time immemorial.

Some vegetables are perennials but most are annuals and biennials, usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation of the soil by loosening it, removing or burying weeds, and adding organic manures or fertilisers; sowing seeds or planting young plants; tending the crop while it grows to reduce weed competition, control pests, and provide sufficient water; harvesting the crop when it is ready; sorting, storing, and marketing the crop or eating it fresh from the ground.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to prevent poisoning, often a bittering agent called denatonium benzoate, known by the trade name Bitrex, is added to {{ethylene}} glycol preparations as an adversant to prevent accidental or intentional ingestion. The bittering agent is thought to stop ingestion as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> defense against ingestion of harmful substances is rejection of bitter tasting substances. In the United States, eight states (Oregon, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Arizona, Maine, Tennessee, Washington) have made the addition of bittering agents to antifreeze compulsory. Three follow up studies targeting limited populations or suicidal persons to assess the efficacy of bittering agents in preventing toxicity or death have, however, shown limited benefit of bittering ethylene glycol preparations in these two populations. Specifically, Mullins finds that bittering of antifreeze does not reduce reported cases of poisoning of preschoolers in the US state of Oregon. Similarly, White found that adding bittering agents did not decrease the frequency or severity of antifreeze poisonings in {{children under the age}} of 5. Additionally, another study by White found that suicidal persons are not deterred by the bittered taste of antifreeze in their attempts to kill themselves. These studies did not focus on poisoning of domestic pets or livestock, for example, or inadvertent exposure to bittered antifreeze among a large population (of non-preschool age children).|$|E
