40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: The dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (DLPFC) is a {{cortical}} area involved in higher cognitive functions, and {{at the center of}} the pathophysiology of mental disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Considering these major roles and the development of deep brain stimulation, the object of this study was to assess the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>connectivity</b> <b>of</b> the DLPFC with its main subcortical relay, the thalamus, with the help of probabilistic tractography. METHODS: We used T 1 -weighted imaging and diffusion data from 18 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The DLPFC and the thalamic nuclear groups were defined using the combination of atlases, sulcogyral anatomy and cytoarchitectonic data. Probabilistic tractography was performed from the DLPFC to the thalamus. The <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>connectivity</b> were assessed using two indexes: (1) a connectivity index (CI) which evaluate the strength of connection (2) an asymmetry index (AI) which explores the inter-hemispheric variability. RESULTS: The analysis of CI showed significant connections between the DLPFC and the dorsomedial nuclei (p   0. 05), the anterior nuclear groups (p   0. 05) and the right centromedian nucleus (p   0. 05). No link was found between handedness and AI (p   0. 05). Most of subjects (15 / 18) had a right predominance of the thalamo cortical connections of the DLPFC. CONCLUSIONS: Probabilistic tractography appears as a valuable non-invasive tool for the exploration of the thalamocortical connections between the {{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} and thalamic nuclei. It allowed to show different inter-hemispheric <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>connectivity,</b> and highlighted the centromedian nucleus as a key subcortical relay of executive functions...|$|R

40|$|These authors contributed equally. To {{understand}} a neural circuit requires knowing the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>connectivity</b> between its inputs and outputs. For example, {{the role of}} the retina in color vision depends on the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>connectivity</b> between the lattice of (L) ong, (M) iddle and (S) hort-wavelength sensitive cones and multiple types of retinal ganglion cells, each of which samples the visual field uniformly. In the vertebrate nervous system, this kind of comprehensive circuit information has generally been out of reach. Here we report the first measurements detailing functional connectivity between the input and output layers of the primate retina, and we use this information to probe the neural circuitry for color vision. We employed a unique multi-electrode technology to record simultaneously from complete populations of the ganglion cell types that mediate high-resolution vision in primates (midget, parasol, small bistratified). We then used fine-grained visual stimulation to separately identify the location and spectral type of each cone photoreceptor providing input to each ganglion cell.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Because of {{the motor}} {{function}} of the precentral area, the connections of the primary motor cortex by white matter fiber bundles have been widely studied in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nevertheless, the connections within the primary motor cortex {{have yet to be}} explored. We have studied the connectivity between the different regions of the precentral gyrus in a population of subjects. METHODS: Based on T 1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and on individual sulco-gyral anatomy, we defined a parcellation of {{the right and the left}} precentral gyri in 20 healthy subjects (10 right-handers; 10 left-handers). This parcellation gave us the opportunity to study MRI tracks reconstructed by tractography within the precentral gyrus and to compare these connections across subjects. We also performed a classical dissection of post-mortem brain tissue to isolate this <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>connectivity.</b> RESULTS: We showed MRI tracks connecting the different parts of the same precentral gyrus. This result was reproducible and was found in the left and right hemispheres of the 20 subjects. A quantitative description of the bilateral distribution of the MRI tracks was performed, based on statistical analysis and asymmetry indices, to compare asymmetry and handedness.

40|$|Population {{genetic data}} of marine genetic {{resources}} {{add up to}} establish their <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>connectivity.</b> Such pattern determines {{the choice of a}} suitable management strategy to those resources in space and time. This study addresses the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>connectivity</b> among European hake grounds upon the largest sampling effort so far developed in this species. Bayesian inference made on multilocus genotypic data provides evidence that a large genetic connectivity exists among Atlantic grounds and is mediated by significant migration rates stepping up from the Celtic Sea towards its adjacent Atlantic grounds. Therefore, the spawning biomass of the northern hake population could play a crucial role at ensuring the sustainability of southern hake fish grounds. The deepest restriction to gene flow was observed at the easternmost side of the Alboran Sea what suggests that the Almeria–Oran Oceanographic Front is an effective barrier keeping apart the two major gene pools so far shown in this species. A molecular clock calibrated for cytochrome b sequences of fishes and applied to the divergence between hake pools (0. 3 %) suggests that the Atlantic–Mediterranean population split might date back to the Middle Pleistocene (150, 000 years BP). Complementarily, Bayesian treatments of multilocus genotypes indicate that such barrier to gene flow remains active nowadays. This study shows the upmost interest of future integrative efforts to incorporate population genetic data into current assessment practices, in order to better manage European hake populations and make its exploitation sustainable...|$|E

40|$|Background In {{the absence}} of {{validated}} biomarkers, the early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD), {{the second most common}} neurodegenerative disorder worldwide [1], is challenging and is prone to low accuracy [2]. Recent evidence suggests that the average pattern of functional connectivity (FC) between the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex assessed in the resting state using functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) might discriminate between mild PD and healthy controls with 85 % overall accuracy [3]. Goal We will test if this finding can be replicated in our population. We will also compare the diagnosis accuracy of this approach, which depicts an average <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>connectivity</b> during the whole scanning period, with that of dynamic FC that investigates the spontaneous fluctuations of the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>connectivity</b> over the scanning period [4]. Methods We are currently processing and analyzing rs-fMRI data prospectively acquired on a 3 T MRI in 39 patients with PD (mean disease duration 5. 4 years; mean Hoehn and Yahr stage 1. 5) and 39 healthy controls matched for age, gender and levels of education. For dynamic FC we will compare two different methods [4], one that use slice-time windows to capture brain dynamics with another that captures spatial co-activation patters (CAPs) at specific time points. Conclusion The selected methods will be further validated in a new cohort of de novo drug-naïve PD patients. [1] Tessitore, A., et al.
