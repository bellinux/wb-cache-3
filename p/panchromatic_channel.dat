40|$|Satellite {{stereo imagery}} is {{becoming}} a popular data source for derivation of height information. Many new Digital Surface Model (DSM) generation and evaluation methods have been proposed based on these data. A novel Digital Terrain Model (DTM) extraction method based on the DSM from satellite stereo imagery is proposed in this paper. Instead of directly filtering the DSM, firstly a single channel based classification method is proposed. In this step, no multi-spectral information is used, because for some stereo sensors, like Cartosat- 1, only <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channels</b> are available. The proposed classification method adopts the random forests method to get initial probability maps of the four main classes in forest regions (high-forest, low-forest, ground, and buildings). To cover the pepper and salt effect of this pixel based classification method, the probability maps are further filtered based on the adaptive Wiener filtering. Then a cube-based greedy strategy is applied in generating the final classification map from these refined probability maps. Secondly, the height distances between neighboring regions are calculated along the boundary regions. These height distances {{can be used to}} estimate the relative region heights. Thirdly, the DTM is extracted by subtracting these relative region heights from the DSM in the order of: buildings – low forest – high forest. In the end, the extracted DTM is further smoothed using median filter. The proposed DTM extraction method is finally tested on satellite stereo imagery captured by Cartosat- 1. Quality evaluation is performed by comparing the extracted DTMs to a reference DTM, which is generated from the last return airborne laser scanning point cloud...|$|R

LH Systems developed the ADS 40, a pushbroom sensor system, which offers on a single camera system the possibility to acquire 3 panchromatic and 4 multispectral images, broadening thus the possible application areas of the sensor. The radiometric characteristics of ADS 40 imagery at raw and rectified level are investigated for various data sets. New algorithms of pre-processing of images that sharpen edge definition, enhance contrast and optimally reduce image data to 8 bit are applied prior to matching. The development of an adaptive multi-image matching algorithm for ADS 40 data, is the main subject of the work presented in this paper. In the current investigations, only the 3 <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channels</b> have been used and matching is based on cross-correlation or similar measures to provide pixelaccurate positions, which are to be subsequently refined, using sub-pixel matching techniques. The geometry of the sensor is used to apply constraints for matching and the concept of epipolar lines is modified for the ADS 40, since each line has its own position and attitude, and the geometry is perspective only on the CCD line direction. Edge pixels are selected for matching, since they can better model discontinuities and have sufficient texture. A modified image pyramid approach, using doublets, is used for derivation of approximations. Quality criteria that are computed during runtime are combined to eliminate errors.

40|$|The Martian {{atmosphere}} often shows horizontal {{layers of}} haze up to altitudes of about 80 km. The High Resolution Stereo Camera, HRSC (Neukum et al. 2004; Jaumann et al. 2007) {{has been used}} to sample the planetary limb. HRSC is a push broom scanner with nine line sensors pointing in different directions to facilitate stereoscopic imaging. Four of the sensors have colour filters at 440 nm, 530 nm, 750 nm and 970 nm, respectively. The five other sensors all have filters centred at 650 nm. These panchromatic filters have a much wider bandpass than the four colour filters. It is not possible to obtain and compare profiles at the same location {{and at the same time}} with different sensors, but still, averages of profiles over place and season can provide us with information about typical atmospheric conditions. We examine the HRSC planetary limb data and analyse the seasonal and latitudinal variations of the maximum altitude of the haze layer and of the occurrence of high altitude detached hazes. Most observations were made with the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channels.</b> There are also many observations with the blue and green sensors and only a few were made in the red and infra red channels. We find the best data coverage in northern spring in the northern most latitudes. For obvious reasons, we do not have any data during polar nights. The colour observations show on average variations of aerosol composition with latitude and altitude. We make some comparisons with earlier work, i. e. from the Viking Orbiter and Mars Express SPICAM experiments. In contrast to the SPICAM instrument, which is used for night time stellar occultation measurements by Montmessin et al., HRSC observes the atmosphere during daytime, which makes it possible to compare night and daytime observations. The seasonal variations of maximum altitude of the aerosols is in good agreement with Jaquin et al. (1986) and with Montmessin et al. (2006). The similarity between Montmessin’s results and ours is likely to be due to the large annual variation of atmospheric dust load compared to the diurnal cycle...|$|R

40|$|While {{many studies}} {{in the field of}} image fusion of {{remotely}} sensed data aim towards deriving new algorithms for visual enhancement, there is little research on the influence of image fusion on other applications. One major application in earth science is land cover mapping. The concept of sensors with multiple spatial resolutions provides a potential for image fusion. It minimises errors of geometric alignment and atmospheric or temporal changes. This study focuses on the influence of image fusion on spectral classification algorithms and their accuracy. A Landsat 7 ETM+ image was used, where six multispectral bands (30 m) were fused with the corresponding 15 m <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channel.</b> The fusion methods comprise rather common techniques like Brovey, hue-saturation-value transform, and principal component analysis, and more complex approaches, including adaptive image fusion, multisensor multiresolution image fusion technique, and wavelet transformation.

The classification was assessed with test samples, a clump analysis, and techniques accounting for classification errors along land cover boundaries. It was found that the adaptive image fusion approach shows best results with low noise content. It resulted in a major improvement when compared with the reference, especially along object edges.

We assessed {{the potential of}} Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO) to estimate mangrove forest biomass from very high resolution (VHR) IKONOS images. The FOTO method computes texture indices of canopy grain by performing a standardized principal component analysis (PCA) on the Fourier spectra obtained for image windows of adequate size. For two distinct study sites in French Guiana, FOTO indices derived from a 1 m <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channel</b> were able to consistently capture the whole gradient of canopy grain observed from the youngest to decaying stages of mangrove development, without requiring any intersite image correction. In addition, a multiple linear regression based on the three main textural indices yielded accurate predictions of mangrove total aboveground biomass. Since FOTO indices did not saturate for high biomass values, predictions were furthermore unbiased, even for levels above 450 t of dry matter per hectare. Maps of canopy texture (with RGB coding) and biomass were then produced over 8000 ha of unexplored, low accessibility mangrove. Applying the FOTO method to the 4 m near-infrared channel yielded acceptable results with some limitations for characterization of juvenile mangrove types.

The VIIRS observes the nighttime lights on Earth through its day-night band (DNB), a <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channel</b> covering the wavelengths from 500 nm to 900 nm. Compared to its predecessors, the VIIRS DNB has a much improved spatial/temporal resolution, radiometric sensitivity and, more importantly, continuous calibration using on-board calibrators (OBCs). In this paper, we describe the current state of the NASA calibration and characterization methodology used in supporting mission data quality assurance and producing consistent mission-wide sensor data records (SDRs) through NASA’s Land Product Evaluation and Analysis Tool Element (Land PEATE). The NASA calibration method utilizes the OBCs to determine gains, offset drift and sign-to-noise ratio (SNR) over the entire mission. In gain determination, the time-dependent relative spectral response (RSR) is used to correct the optical throughput change over time. A deep space view acquired during an S-NPP pitch maneuver is used to compute the airglow free dark offset for DNB’s high gain stage. The DNB stray light is estimated each month from new-moon dark Earth surface observations to remove the excessive stray light over the day-night terminators. As the VIIRS DNB on-orbit calibration is the first of its kind, the evolution of the calibration methodology is evident when the S-NPP VIIRS’s official calibrations are compared with our latest mission-wide reprocessing. In the future, the DNB calibration methodology is likely to continue evolving, and the mission-wide reprocessing is a key to providing consistently calibrated DNB SDRs for the user community. In the meantime, the NASA Land PEATE provides an alternative source to obtain mission-wide DNB SDR products that are calibrated based on the latest NASA DNB calibration methodology...|$|E

40|$|This work investigates an {{integrated}} aerial remote sensor design approach to address moving target detection and tracking problems within highly cluttered, dynamic ground-based scenes. Sophisticated simulation methodologies and scene phenomenology validations {{have resulted in}} advancements in artificial multimodal truth video synthesis. Complex modeling of novel micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS) devices, optical systems, and detector arrays {{has resulted in a}} proof of concept for a state-of-the-art imaging spectropolarimeter sensor model that does not suffer from typical multimodal image registration problems. Test methodology developed for this work provides the ability to quantify performance of a target tracking application with varying ground scenery, flight characteristics, or sensor specifications. The culmination of this research is an end-to-end simulated demonstration of multimodal aerial remote sensing and target tracking. Deeply hidden target recognition is shown to be enhanced through the fusing of panchromatic, hyperspectral, and polarimetric image modalities. The Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation model was leveraged to synthesize truth spectropolarimetric sensor-reaching radiance image cubes comprised of coregistered Stokes vector bands in the visible to near-infrared. An intricate synthetic urban scene containing numerous moving vehicular targets was imaged from a virtual sensor aboard an aerial platform encircling a stare point. An adaptive sensor model was designed with a superpixel array of MOEMS devices fabricated atop a division of focal plane detector. Degree of linear polarization (DoLP) imagery is acquired by combining three adjacent micropolarizer outputs within each 2 x 2 superpixel whose respective transmissions vary with wavelength, relative angle of polarization, and wire-grid spacing. A novel micromirror within each superpixel adaptively relays light between a <b>panchromatic</b> imaging <b>channel</b> and a hyperspectral spectrometer channel. All optical and detector sensor effects were radiometrically modeled using MATLAB and optical lens design software. Orthorectification of all sensor outputs yields multimodal pseudonadir observation video at a fixed ground sampled distance across an area of responsibility. A proprietary MATLAB-based target tracker accomplishes change detection between sequential panchromatic or DoLP observation frames, and queries the sensor for hyperspectral pixels to aid in track initialization and maintenance. Image quality, spectral quality, and tracking performance metrics are reported for varying scenario parameters including target occlusions within the scene, declination angle and jitter of the aerial platform, micropolarizer diattenuation, and spectral/spatial resolution of the adaptive sensor outputs. DoLP observations were found to track moving vehicles better than panchromatic observations at high oblique angles when facing the sensor generally toward the sun. Vehicular occlusions due to tree canopies and parallax effects of tall buildings significantly reduced tracking performance as expected. Smaller MOEMS pixel sizes drastically improved track performance, but also generated a significant number of false tracks. Atmospheric haze from urban aerosols eliminated the tracking utility of DoLP observations, while aerial platform jitter without image stabilization eliminated tracking utility in both modalities. Wire-grid micropolarizers with very low VNIR diattenuation were found to still extinguish enough cross-polarized light to successfully distinguish and track moving vehicles from their urban background. Thus, state-of-the-art lithographic techniques to create finer wire-grid spacings that exhibit high VNIR diattenuation may not be required...|$|R
40|$|The {{installation}} of a land register with multiple goals, requires {{the establishment of a}} basic chart with average scale (between 1 : 50 000 and 1 : 25 000), representative in a total and more or less precise way the territory. The techniques generally used in the developing countries are slow and expensive to achieve this task (raised land surveying, photogrammetry and photo-interpretation); what thus produces constraints of duration of implementation, of cost of realization and update of this basic chart. Vis-a-vis to all these constraints, the remote sensing and the geographical information systems bring new solutions at relatively low cost, in the extraction of information on the natural resources and the environment starting from aerospace images, as well as the analysis, the interpretation and the management of this information. The methodological step consists of the combination of geographical information and a technique of segmentation set of themes by spectral-texturale co-operation of images HRV of SPOT, within the framework of a Geographical Information system GIS. We carried out a classification directed to the maximum of probability on the spectral <b>channels</b> <b>panchromatic</b> and, combined with three channels of texture and process to the digitalization of the topographic card and the card of contours of the fields raised with the GPS of the site of study; these data are then integrated in the GIS in the process of establishment of the basic chart of the area of study. The results show, for classification: a total precision of 87 % for the classes taken into account. For the evaluation of the surfaces, we notice statistics of agreement between the surfaces measured on the basic image and those measured on the ground being located between 85 % and 99 %. We obtain from this fact an average precision of 95 % and a difference of average surface of 1, 3 ha for the whole of the samples of fields. According to the scales, the desired precision is reached in 80 % of the samples of fields on scale 1 : 25 000, and 93 % on scale 1 : 50 000...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o impacto do aumento da resolução espacial e radiométrica da imagem pancromática do Ikonos-II na identificação de plantios de café (Coffea arabica), em comparação com as imagens do Landsat/ETM+. A área de estudo está localizada no Município de Pedregulho, SP, onde foram selecionados 50 talhões com plantios de café, e foram levantados dados referentes à altura, idade, espaçamento e variedade de cada talhão. As imagens permitiram a identificação de talhões com características diferentes em campo, tendo-se destacado a imagem do Ikonos-II, que apresentou melhor desempenho. Para os talhões com características iguais em campo, as imagens analisadas não se mostraram eficientes, independentemente do satélite utilizado. As correções atmosféricas e radiométricas, na imagem do Ikonos-II, não proporcionaram ganho efetivo nas análises realizadas. A maioria dos talhões identificados na imagem do Ikonos-II pode ser localizada na imagem do Landsat/ETM+ (68 %). A correlação significativa entre a banda 4 do Landsat/ETM+ e o canal pancromático do Ikonos-II indica uma forma de ligação entre as imagens dos dois satélites. The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} impact of the better spatial and radiometric resolutions of the Ikonos-II panchromatic image, for the identification of coffee (Coffea arabica) planting areas, in comparison with a Landsat/ETM+ image. The area of study is situated in the city of Pedregulho, State of São Paulo, Brazil, where 50 coffee fields were selected. Information about plants features, like height, age, spacing and variety were collected. Images allowed the identification of coffee areas with different field features, and the calibrated Ikonos-II image showed the best results. Considering the areas with similar field features, images from both satellites were not efficient in the coffee identification. The atmospheric and radiometric corrections applied on the Ikonos-II image did not improve the analyses results. More than half of the identified areas in the Ikonos-II image could be found in the Landsat/ETM+ image (68 %).

40|$|Z/I Imaging {{introduced}} {{with the}} DMC II 140, 230 and 250 digital aerial cameras {{with a very}} large format CCD for the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channel.</b> The CCDs have with 140 / 230 / 250 mega pixel a size not available in photogrammetry before. CCDs in general {{have a very high}} relative accuracy, but the overall geometry has to be checked as well as the influence of not flat CCDs. A CCD with a size of 96 mm x 82 mm must have a flatness or knowledge of flatness in the range of 1 mu m if the camera accuracy in the range of 1. 3 mu m shall not be influenced. The DMC II cameras have been evaluated with three different flying heights leading to 5 cm, 9 cm and 15 cm or 20 cm GSD, crossing flight lines and 60 % side lap. The optimal test conditions guaranteed the precise determination of the object coordinates as well as the systematic image errors. All three camera types show only very small systematic image errors, ranging in the root mean square between 0. 12 mu m up to 0. 3 mu m with extreme values not exceeding 1. 6 mu m. The remaining systematic image errors, determined by analysis of the image residuals and not covered by the additional parameters, are negligible. A standard deviation of the object point heights below the GSD, determined at independent check points, even in blocks with just 20 % side lap and 60 % end lap is standard. Corresponding to the excellent image geometry the object point coordinates are only slightly influenced by the self calibration. For all DMCII types the handling of image models for data acquisition must not be supported by an improvement of the image coordinates by the determined systematic image errors. Such an improvement up to now is not standard for photogrammetric software packages. The advantage of a single monolithic CCD is obvious. An edge analysis of pan-sharpened DMC II 250 images resulted in factors for the effective resolution below 1. 0. The result below 1. 0 is only possible by contrast enhancement, but this requires with low image noise, demonstrating the very good radiometric image quality...|$|E
40|$|MOMS- 2 P (Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral Scanner) is, as a {{continuation}} of MOMS- 01, a development for digital mapping of the Earth´s surface from space. The special characteristic of this CCD push-broom camera is the combination of high resolution panchromatic images for 3 -dimensional geometric information, with multispectral images for thematic applications. With this concept MOMS- 2 P is fundamentally different from all existing remote sensing systems and thus pursues new and independent goals. The technical features of the MOMS- 2 P camera are oriented toward {{the requirements of the}} photogrammetric and thematic sciences. The system layout is chiefly specified through such requirements as · three-fold stereo imagery · along-track stereo imagery · high resolution imagery · multispectral imaging · combinations of stereo and multispectral imaging The MOMS- 2 P camera features, from an orbital altitude of 300 km, a 6 m resolution in the high resolution <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channel</b> and 18 m resolution in the two stereo channels {{as well as in the}} four multispectral channels. The band selection was optimized mainly for applications in vegetation investigations. Th MOMS camera was successfully space flight tested on board of the second German Spacelab mission D 2 in April 1993. During the 10 days mission approximately 7 mio km 2 were covered mainly in the equatorial regions due to the orbit inclination of 28. 5 °. The survey of the data show excellent results in disciplines like geology, ecology, vegetation investigation and photogrammetry. After a refurbishment the system will be flown for at least 18 months on board of the Russian PRIRODA Module attached to the Space Station MIR in May 1996. So far more than 500 test areas were requested by users from various disciplines such as Agriculture, Ecology, Geology, Photogrammetry etc. In order to maximize the scientific output, a complex mission planning system was installed. The MOMS- 2 P camera will is commanded through the DLR Space Operations Center in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. Data receiving is through stations in Russia as well as the DLR station in Neustrelitz. Additionally in Neustrelitz a ground segment was set up for systematic correction of data as well as archiving and distribution of data...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Good {{knowledge}} about the aerosol distribution and compositions {{is essential for the}} understanding of thermodynamic processes in the Martian atmosphere, which in turn is important for the understanding of the Martian climate and the altitude of the upper boundary of the atmosphere. The last point is of special interest for spacecraft aerobreaking manoeuvres. The Martian atmosphere often shows horizontal layers of haze up to altitudes of about 80 km. These have been described and analysed e. g. by Jaquin et al., 1986, usingViking Orbiter images and by Montmessin et al., 2006, who used SPICAM stellar occultation data. Both showed seasonal and latitudinal changes in the vertical structure of the aerosol distribution and composition. Apart from SPICAM, the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) is also on board ESA’s robotic spacecraft Mars Express. HRSC was build and is operated by the German Aerospace Center (Neukum et al. 2004; Jaumann et al. 2007). Mars Express is orbiting Mars in an elliptical orbit, with HRSC scanning the surface of Mars, primarily for geological research. In addition to that, HRSC has been used to sample the planetary limb. We examine the HRSC planetary limb data and analyse the seasonal and latitudinal variations of the maximum altitude of the haze layer and of the occurrence of high altitude detached hazes. We make some comparisons with earlier work. In contrast to the SPICAM instrument, HRSC observes the atmosphere during daytime, which makes it possible to compare night and daytime observations. The HRSC Limb Data: HRSC is a push broom scanner with nine line sensors pointing in different directions to facilitate stereoscopic imaging. Four of the sensors have colour filters at 440 nm, 530 nm, 750 nm and 970 nm, respectively. The five other sensors all have filters centred at 650 nm. These panchromatic filters have a much wider bandpass than the four colour filters. The surface observations which are HRSC’s main purpose, are usually take while the spacecraft is nadirtracking near pericentre. Limb observations, however, are mostly made with a pointing of the spacecraft being inertially fixxed in celestial space. This leaves only a small time window to make observations of the limb during descent or ascent. Therefore, usually {{only a few of the}} nine sensors can be used for the limb observation. Due to the motion of the spacecraft, the individual image lines are taken at different geographical locations and altitudes. The position of each image pixel above the limb has to be calculated from the spacecraft positioning information (Scholten, pers. comm.). The typical difference in altitude between two neighbouring pixels is between a couple of dozen metres and 150 m. HRSC has been observing the limb occasionally throughout the mission since 2004. So far the northern hemisphere and especially the north polar region, were particularly well covered (Figure 1 and 2). In Figure 2, we give an overview of the available data, sorted by season (LS) and latitude. The channel in which the observations have been made is colourcoded. Most observations were made with the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channels.</b> There are also many observations with the blue and green sensors and only a few were made in the red and infra red channels. We find the best data coverage in northern spring in the northern most latitudes. For obvious reasons, we do not have any data during polar nights. For most of our actual analysis we sample the five central pixels of the sensor lines. This allows for minimal horizontal averaging. Analysis: As an example, Fig. 3 shows images and profiles for the blue, nadir, and green channels from orbit 6104. Al three images show a continuously bright limb haze until an altitude of about 20 km. At higher altitudes the limb haze becomes darker and stratified consistent with the limb profiles described by Jacquin et al., 1986. As Mars Express progresses along its orbit, the limb observations are made at different locations above the surface. The locations of the three profiles in Fig. 3 are still in close proximity of each other, in fact they overlap, but none the less they show different vertical aerosol distributions. Beginning above the North Polar cap and going southward, we observe less reflectivity above 20 km and more reflectivity below 20 km, hinting at different compositions or amounts of aerosols. It is not possible to obtain and compare profiles at the same location and at the same time with different sensors, but still, averages of profiles over place and season can provide us with information about typical atmospheric conditions. In Fig. 4 we show spectra from the average profiles at three different latitudinal bands between 70 �N– 90 �N, 30 �S– 30 �N, and 90 �S– 70 �S, on the left, centre, and right, respectively. The different symbols and colours represent the different altitudes at which the spectra were sampled. The size of the symbol increases with the number of averaged profiles. There are very few observations above the South Polar region (compare Fig. 1). In the North (and South) Polar region there is almost no signal above 30 km altitude, while around the equator the limb haze remains bright until altitudes of about 60 km. At the poles, the spectrum at 10 km is reddish. At higher altitudes the spectrum gets whiter, indicating smaller particles or higher ice content. At the low latitudes the spectra are reddish up to 40 km. At 60 km we see a more or less white spectrum. Figure 5 shows the maximum altitude of the aerosols as seen by HRSC, depending on season. During aphelion (LS � 70 �) the maximum altitude of the aerosols that are visible with HRSC is around 40 km. During perihelion (LS � 250 �) the maximum altitude is around 70 km. Discussion: Figure 1 and 2 show that there are plenty of visual and near infra red HRSC observations of the Martian limb available. These show aerosol distributions that change with season and latitude (Fig. 3 and 4). The plots in Fig. 4 show the spectra of the average limb profiles at several altitudes for three latitudinal bands. Two important distinctions can be made between the equatorial and the polar regions. First, the altitude at which aerosol occur is higher in the equatorial region and second, the composition of the aerosols at different altitudes is different. While the spectrum is white around 20 km altitude above the north pole, it is red at the low latitudes. The seasonal variations of maximum altitude of the aerosols is in good agreement with Jaquin et al. (1986) and with Montmessin et al. (2006). The similarity between Montmessin’s results and ours is likely to be due to the large annual variation of atmospheric dust load compared to the diurnal cycle. A much closer look at the data, is forseen to analyse the daily variation of aerosols in the Martian atmosphere. The CO 2 and waterice aerosols are more likely to change their vertical distribution (above the planetary boundary layer) between day and night than the mineral (dust) aerosols. Spectral information would help to discriminate between these components. HRSC can not provide it, because the observation for the different filters take place at different locations and times (see Fig. 3). An alternative is to fit aerosol models to the inverted profiles. Currently, we are preparing this work. Mars Express’ HRSC limb data present a valuable opportunity to analyse Mars daytime atmospheric dust at a high vertical resolution. This work gives a short overview of the available data and analyses some seasonal and latitudinal properties...|$|R
40|$|Book chapter {{partially}} available at: [URL] is {{a strong}} demand for accurate and up-to-date road network information. Road network knowledge is crucial for the creation and the update of maps, geographic information system (GIS) database, transportation or land planning. For local authorities, cartography of the road network is needed for urban planning, dirty water collection through gutter network (most often located under roads), traffic flow analysis or pollution mapping. Closely related applications are geo-marketing, electricity and telecommunication networks, databases for car navigation [...] . Currently, road network cartography is essentially done by human interpretations of high resolution aerial images and additional in situ information. This is a long and tedious work that requires to be done again for each update of the road network. High spatial resolution imagery is recently available for civilian applications and reveals the very fine details of the imaged area. Examples of high resolution satellites are SPOT 5, Ikonos, Quickbird, OrbView or EROS. The term ‘high resolution' is relative and refers to satellites with spatial resolutions better than 5 meters in the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channel</b> (one can even talk about very high resolution when the image resolution is better than 1 meter). The current availability of high spatial resolution images represents an undeniable asset to Earth observation. The urban environment, {{that is the most}} difficult context because of its high complexity and information density, could benefit the most from high resolution imagery (Puissant and Weber, 2002). In addition to the increased precision for the road detection and location, high resolution satellite imagery can be used for numerous cases where the access to the studied area is difficult: administrative constraints, authorization to overfly the area, conflicts, wars or natural catastrophes [...] . Moreover, satellite means is significantly cheaper than aerial or in situ data acquisition campaigns. As promising as it is, the use of high resolution images for road extraction induces a change in the road representation, and a significant increase of noise. Moreover, quantitative assessment of the results has to be redesigned when dealing with such images. In this chapter, a new method suitable for high resolution images is proposed. Originally designed for urban area, this method can naturally be applied on easier cases such as rural or semi-rural areas. The chapter is structured as follow: the change in the road representation induces by high resolution imagery is first presented. A short survey on road extraction with the evolution from linear to surface models for road is proposed (section 2). A new method for extracting road networks from high spatial resolution images is then described. It models roads as a surface and is built on cooperation between linear and surface representation of roads. In order to overcome local artifacts, the method makes use of advanced image processing tools, such as active contours and the wavelet transform (section 3). An example of application of the method on a high resolution image from the Quickbird satellite is proposed. The result is quantitatively assessed compared to human interpretation (section 4). This chapter concludes with a discussion on the principal benefits of the method and on future prospects (section 5) ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{landscape}} {{changes in the}} Yedoma region are particularly pronounced in varying thermokarst lake areas reflecting {{the reaction of the}} land surface on modern climate changes. However, although thermokarst lake change detection is essential for the quantification of water body expansion and drainage within a region, remote sensing-derived surface reflection trends additionally provide valuable information about the general landscape development. The aim of this research is to reveal the regularities of landscape and thermokarst lakes area changes in the Kolyma lowland tundra in comparison with meteorological data and geological and geomorphological features. The Kolyma lowland tundra occupies about 44500 km 2 and is located in Northeast Yakutia within the continuous permafrost zone. Mapping of Quaternary deposits using Landsat images shows that Yedoma (Last Pleistocene remnants formed by ice-rich silty to sandy syngenetic deposits with large polygonal ice wedges) occupies only 16 % of the entire region, while the largest part of it is occupied by alas complex (72 %), formed as a result of Yedoma thaw during the Holocene (Veremeeva and Glushkova, 2016). For the analysis of the landscape and thermokarst lakes area changes of the last 15 years, the entire available Landsat archive from 1999 until 2015 was used for time-series analysis. For this purpose around 800 scenes were processed with an automated workflow, undergoing several necessary processing steps, such as masking, data distribution and calculation of multi-spectral indices. Multi-spectral indices (Landsat Tasseled Cap, NDVI, NDWI, NDMI) were calculated for each unobstructed (cloud-, shadow- and snow-free) observation within the summer months (June to September) between 1999 and 2015. A robust linear trend analysis has been applied to each pixel for the spatial representation of changes of different land surface properties over the observation period. This map shows the magnitude and direction of changes for each multi-spectral index, which are used as proxies for different land-surface properties. For single locations, the entire time-series can be further analyzed in more detail. For the period from 1999 till 2005 air temperatures and precipitation have been analysed for several weather stations that existed in the region. The Landsat time series analysis for the last 15 years shows that {{the northern part of the}} region became wetter over the last 5 – 6 years. The alases are particularly affected by the wetting trend. The analysis of the meteo-data shows a trend of increasing air temperature and especially precipitation during the summer from 2010. The wetness increase, particularly on the coastal zone, is supported by the fact that air temperature trends are the largest at near-coastal meteorological stations. This increase of air temperatures and precipitation is likely connected to the reduced sea ice cover (Bekryaev et al., 2010). The strongest wetness increase were observed in the most northern part of the region within a 50 km wide zone along the East-Siberian sea shore between lowest stream of the Alazeya and Galgavaam rivers. This region is characterised by average terrain heights about 10 - 20 m, the yedoma and thermokarst lakes area here is about 10 - 20 %. There are less increase of wetness in the southern and eastern part of the coastal zone between Galgavaam and Bolshaya Chukochya rivers which is characterized by average heights of 0 - 10 m. The lakes area here is about 40 % and yedoma covers less then 10 % of the territory. Thus the strongest wetness trend for the northern coastal zone can be explained by the high degree of yedoma preservation and its thawing due to the coastal location and higher impact of the increasing temperatures and precipitation. For the recent past from 1999 to 2015, thermokarst lake changes were analysed visually based on the time series trend. For most thermokarst lakes of the Kolyma lowland tundra lake area was increasing from 1999 till 2015, however the trend is not significant. Some of the lakes partially or completely drained. Thermokarst lakes area coverage was quantified based on seven Landsat 8 images for the time period 2013 – 2014. In order to ensure consistency regarding surface moisture, only images acquired from August till September have been used. Atmospheric correction of each image was done for radiometric normalization across the dataset. An increase in ground resolution of the 30 m multi-spectral data was achieved through resolution merge with the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>channel</b> to 15 m pixel size. Subsequent mosaicking, classification and raster to vector conversion was done for the entire Kolyma lowland tundra. Thermokarst lakes cover about 12. 9 % of the Kolyma lowland tundra. For the key investigation area located in the southern tundra around Lake Bolshoy Oler, which covers an area of 2800 km 2, a comparison with lakes mapped in CORONA images from July 21, 1965 and lakes mapped in the 2014 Landsat mosaic was carried for analysis of changes over time during a period of up to 50 years. The overall thermokarst lake area for this region in 1965 and 2014 was 590 and 549 km 2 respectively. This corresponds to a limnicity decrease of 1. 5 % within the study site from 21. 1 to 19. 6 %. About one third of this lake area decrease is due to partial drainage of big lakes with the area in 1965 and 2014 of 141. 8 and 96. 3 km 2, respectively. Analysis of the summer air temperature and precipitation trends from the 1965 till 2015 also shown the trend of their increasing. Therefore, despite the fact that many persistent thermokarst lakes in the Kolyma lowland tundra are increasing in area, modern climate conditions generally seem to favor further relief drainage development. Consequently, thermokarst lake drainage outpaces thermokarst lake growth. This heterogeneous pattern suggests that permafrost degradation and aggradation in the region proceed simultaneously close together.
