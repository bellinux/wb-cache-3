5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid <b>plexus</b> in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid <b>plexus</b> into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid <b>plexus</b> into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid <b>plexus,</b> the epithelial cells lining the choroid <b>plexus</b> contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid <b>plexus</b> in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous <b>plexus</b> or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid <b>plexus.</b> The choroid <b>plexus</b> is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, and occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. CSF is also produced by the single layer of column-shaped ependymal cells which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the subarachnoid space; and a small amount directly from the tiny spaces surrounding blood vessels around the brain.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{is a major}} {{branch of}} the sacral <b>plexus,</b> with fibers {{originating}} in Onuf's nucleus in the sacral region of the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|As the {{recurrent}} nerve hooks {{around the}} subclavian artery or aorta, it gives off several branches. There is suspected {{variability in the}} configuration of these branches to the cardiac <b>plexus,</b> trachea, esophagus and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle.|$|E
5|$|Orešković and Klarica hypothesise that CSF is not {{primarily}} {{produced by the}} choroid <b>plexus,</b> but is being permanently produced inside the entire CSF system, {{as a consequence of}} water filtration through the capillary walls into the interstitial fluid of the surrounding brain tissue, regulated by AQP-4.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid <b>plexus</b> and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid <b>plexus</b> CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves supply sensation to {{the larynx}} below the vocal cords, gives cardiac branches {{to the deep}} cardiac <b>plexus,</b> and branches to the trachea, esophagus and the inferior constrictor muscles. The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscles that can open the vocal cords, are innervated by this nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} needs {{no more than}} 70μg/day to {{synthesise}} the requisite daily amounts of T4 and T3. The higher recommended daily allowance levels of iodine seem necessary for optimal function {{of a number of}} body systems, including lactating breast, gastric mucosa, salivary glands, brain cells, choroid <b>plexus,</b> oral mucosa, and arterial walls.|$|E
5|$|A {{sample of}} CSF {{can be taken}} via lumbar puncture. This can reveal the {{intracranial}} pressure, as well as indicate diseases including infections of the brain or its surrounding meninges. Although noted by Hippocrates, {{it was only in}} the eighteenth century that Emanuel Swedenborg is credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 that Harvey W. Cushing demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid <b>plexus.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{lying on}} the ice for {{approximately}} 10 minutes, Moore {{was removed from the}} playing surface on a stretcher. He was treated for three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a grade three concussion, vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the brachial <b>plexus</b> nerves, and facial lacerations. He was also suffering from amnesia. Bertuzzi apologized to Moore and his family, as well as to Burke, Canucks owner John McCaw, Jr., the Canucks organization, his teammates, and the fans in a press conference two days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, W. Essex Wynter began {{treating}} {{tubercular meningitis}} by tapping the subarachnoid space, and Heinrich Quincke began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate {{description of the}} chemical composition of the CSF. In 1914, Harvey W. Cushing published conclusive evidence that the CSF is secreted by the choroid <b>plexus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{blood in}} the deep {{part of the brain}} drains, through a venous <b>plexus</b> into the {{cavernous}} sinus at the front, and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides, and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back. Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior saggital sinus, which rests in the midline on top of the brain. Blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{developing}} forebrain {{surrounds the}} neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within {{it becomes a}} ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid <b>plexus</b> develops, producing and releasing CSF. The CSF quickly fills the neural canal. Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} duct, which drains {{the majority}} of the body's lymph, passes behind the esophagus, curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in {{the lower part of the}} esophagus, to lying behind the esophagus on the left in the upper esophagus. The esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side. The vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a <b>plexus.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{proposed}} recognition {{meant more}} to Floyd even than trade advantages and justice; {{it was another}} step in the disenthrallment of America. It would afford relief from that political <b>plexus</b> which had {{made it impossible for}} one European nation to move, even in matters relating to America, without creating a corresponding movement in each of the others. He was tired of negotiating the things which related exclusively to America in London, Paris, and Madrid.|$|E
5|$|As {{the brain}} develops, {{by the fourth}} week of embryological {{development}} three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day. At this time, the first choroid <b>plexus</b> can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial <b>plexus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial <b>plexus.</b> Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{accounts}} for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. Fifteen to 20mg of iodine {{is concentrated in}} thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid <b>plexus,</b> arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The action of iodine in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, it is (at least) partially unknown.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac <b>plexus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical <b>plexus</b> all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid <b>plexus</b> that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E
5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal <b>plexus,</b> a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric <b>plexus,</b> a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a <b>plexus</b> between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E
25|$|During {{embryogenesis}} in the choroid <b>plexus</b> of the ventricles, choroid <b>plexus</b> cysts can form.|$|E
25|$|Because transthyretin {{is made in}} part by the choroid <b>plexus,</b> it can be used as an {{immunohistochemical}} {{marker for}} choroid <b>plexus</b> papillomas as well as carcinomas.|$|E

25|$|The {{walls of}} the {{interventricular}} foramina contain choroid <b>plexus,</b> a specialized structure that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The choroid <b>plexus</b> of the third ventricles continues through the foramina into the lateral ventricles.|$|E
25|$|The lumbar <b>plexus</b> {{block is}} an {{advanced}} technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. The lumbar <b>plexus</b> {{is composed of}} nerves originating from L1 to L4 spinal roots such as the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, femoral, and obturator nerves. Since the <b>plexus</b> is located deep, there is {{an increased risk of}} local anesthetic toxicity, so less toxic anesthetics like chloroprocaine or mepivacaine mixed with ropivacaine are often recommended. A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but {{it is often difficult to}} see the <b>plexus,</b> so a nerve stimulator is used to locate it.|$|E

25|$|The brachial <b>plexus</b> {{is formed}} by the ventral rami of C5-C6-C7-C8-T1, {{occasionally}} with small contributions by C4 and T2. There are multiple approaches to blockade of the brachial <b>plexus,</b> beginning proximally with the interscalene block and continuing distally with the supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary blocks. The concept behind all of these approaches to the brachial <b>plexus</b> is {{the existence of a}} sheath encompassing the neurovascular bundle extending from the deep cervical fascia to slightly beyond the borders of the axilla.|$|E
25|$|The {{skin around}} the {{shoulder}} is supplied by C2-C4 (upper), and C7 and T2 (lower area). The brachial <b>plexus</b> emerges as nerve roots from the cervical vertebrae C5-T1. Branches of the <b>plexus,</b> in particular from C5-C6, supply {{the majority of}} the muscles of the shoulder.|$|E

25|$|The lumbar <b>plexus</b> {{is formed}} lateral to the {{intervertebral}} foramina by the ventral rami {{of the first}} four lumbar spinal nerves (L1-L4), which all pass through psoas major. The larger branches of the <b>plexus</b> exit the muscle to pass sharply downward to reach the abdominal wall and the thigh (under the inguinal ligament); {{with the exception of}} the obturator nerve which pass through the lesser pelvis to reach the medial part of the thigh through the obturator foramen. The nerves of the lumbar <b>plexus</b> pass in front of the hip joint and mainly support the anterior part of the thigh.|$|E
