5|$|As {{the world}} starts to globalize, it is {{accompanied}} by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to be overly corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly.

Some choices that corporations take to make profits can affect <b>people</b> <b>all</b> over the world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E
5|$|Author Hiromu Arakawa {{integrated}} several {{social problems}} into the plot, {{such as the}} way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers {{after the death of}} their mother, Trisha. She also looks at how the brothers help <b>people</b> <b>all</b> over the country to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character. Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.|$|E

In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War. She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism.|$|E
5|$|One Arsenal supporter, Paul Dineen {{was stabbed}} {{in the back with}} a knife, during the riots in a pub, near the City Hall Square.

Another three members of the public, identified as one Englishman, Turk and Dutchman were also wounded by knifing when the event was still under its way. Sixty <b>people,</b> <b>all</b> presumed to have been involved, were detained by Danish law enforcement, while another 19 suffered injuries as a result of the violence.|$|E

5|$|Allegations {{were made}} {{against the state}} police, state {{government}} and the chief minister Narendra Modi, citing that government authorities were involved and various police personnel {{played a role in}} the massacre: a number of eyewitnesses reported police officers favouring the mob by allegedly injuring or killing Muslims and damaging public and private property. All allegations were proved to be false and the government and police were cleared of wrongdoing by a Special Investigation Team. The initial report on the case was filed by the Gujarat police, accusing 46 <b>people,</b> <b>all</b> of whom the Special Court deemed unreliable. In 2008, the Supreme Court of India formed a Special Investigation Team to investigate the case. In 2009, the team submitted its report, which accused 70 people of wrongdoing, 61 of whom were charged. On 29 August 2012, the Special Court convicted 32 people and acquitted 29 due to insufficient evidence. Among those convicted were Maya Kodnaniformer Cabinet Minister for Women and Child Development of Gujarat and former Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Narodawho was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment, and Bajrang Dal's Babu Bajrangi, who received a life sentence.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains from Auring {{triggered}} flooding {{across the}} eastern provinces of the Philippines. A total of 38,764 people were evacuated to avoid floodwaters. The rains caused the Cagayan River to swell, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in Gingoog City. In Talisay City, Cebu, a 27-year-old woman was killed after she was electrocuted by a steel wire which was knocked down by high winds produced by Auring. Nine other <b>people,</b> <b>all</b> of whom are children, were listed as missing. About 12,211 people were left stranded at ports due to dangerous conditions caused by the depression. An additional 14 trucks, 44 light cars, 75 passenger buses, 27 vessels and 295 rolling cargoes were also stranded. Severe flooding destroyed 305 homes, 199 of which were in Macasandig. Another 610 homes sustained damage. An estimated 53hectares (130.9acres) of rice and 3.5hectares (8.6acres) of corn were damaged. About 43,851 people were affected by the storm, mainly along the Cagayan River. The remnants of Auring brought heavy rains to the flooded areas again on January7, triggering several landslides which blocked off roads and damaging power lines, leaving parts of the Catanduanes without power for several hours. Damages from the depression were estimated at PHP23million ($498,318USD) and an estimated 5,000 families were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also known}} that Abir {{had been forced to}} put down rebellions of the Yamongo, Boonde, Bofongi, Lilangi, Bokenda, Pukaonga and Kailangi peoples {{around the turn of the}} century and that five Abir sentries had been killed near Bongandanga in 1901 and 1902. The Boangi and Likeli peoples were {{forcibly}} resettled closer to the post at Bosow and in 1903 Abir troops intervened to stop the emigration of the Lika people and villagers near Samba. To stop small scale emigration Abir instigated a permit system for people wishing to visit another village. At the Momponi post the Abir agent led a punitive expedition against the Seketulu tribe which resulted in 400 civilian deaths with hundreds captured and put in prison, where a further 100 died. When the Nsongo Mboyo tribe attempted to emigrate 1,000 were captured and sent to a forced labour camp. The Likongo, Lianja, Nkole, Yan a-Yanju, Nongo-Ingoli, and Lofoma <b>people</b> <b>all</b> successfully fled toward Tshuapa. Despite this chaos Abir managed to increase its exports for 1903 to 951 tons recording the second highest profits in its history. However, this partial recovery did not last long and soon profits were falling once more.|$|E

5|$|It is {{the largest}} of the Small Isles, and the 15th largest Scottish island, but is {{inhabited}} by only about thirty or so <b>people,</b> <b>all</b> of whom live in the village of Kinloch on the east coast. The island has been inhabited since the 8th millennium BC and provides some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. The early Celtic and Norse settlers left only a few written accounts and artefacts. From the 12th to 13th centuries on, the island was held by various clans including the MacLeans of Coll. The population grew to over 400 by the late 18th century but was cleared of its indigenous population between 1826 and 1828. The island then became a sporting estate, the exotic Kinloch Castle being constructed by the Bulloughs in 1900. RÃ¹m was purchased by the Nature Conservancy Council in 1957.|$|E

5|$|The Fringe team {{is called}} {{to the scene of}} a robbery of a metal depository; the body of one of the thieves, shot by a {{security}} guard, inexplicably floats off the ground, while a second culprit has gotten away. They find that the thief has taken off with a supply of osmium, one of the densest elements, and an autopsy later reveals that the dead thief's body is filled with the metal. Tracking a security card on the body, they enter a warehouse where they find the second culprit, dead, along with the bodies of several more <b>people,</b> <b>all</b> of them paraplegic. Walter (John Noble) notes that the physical properties of osmium (both gravitational and thermal) have been reversed, and by melting the osmium collected from the first victim using liquid nitrogen, they detect the presence of the rarer element lutetium, typically only present in meteorites.|$|E

5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel <b>people.</b> <b>All</b> birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|The third season, , begins {{two weeks}} later with <b>people</b> <b>all</b> over the world {{discovering}} airbending powers {{as a result of}} the Harmonic Convergence. As Tenzin, Korra, and her friends recruit them to re-establish the extinct Air Nomads, the newly airbending criminal Zaheer escapes his prison, frees his allies Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li, and attempts to kidnap the Avatar. This fails thanks to the help of Suyin Beifong, Lin's previously estranged sister. Zaheer and his teamâ members of the Red Lotus, an anarchic secret societyâ kill the Earth Queen, throwing her kingdom into chaos, and try to force Korra's surrender by taking the Air Nomads hostage, including Suyin's daughter Opal. In the final confrontation, Zaheer's comrades are killed and he is captured by the Air Nomads led by Jinora. Two weeks later, a weakened, wheelchair-bound Korra watches as Jinora is anointed an airbending master, and Tenzin rededicates the Air Nomads to service to the world.|$|E
