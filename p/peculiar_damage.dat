40|$|Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer {{composites}} {{have been}} developed since the ’ 60 s and allow the design of resistant and innovative lightweight primary structures, replacing traditional metallic materials. However, their intensive structural use remains limited due, between also other factors, to several <b>peculiar</b> <b>damage</b> mechanisms able to quickly degrade the mechanical properties and requiring high maintenance costs due to service interruptions needed for carrying out periodical non-destructive testing inspections. One solution, more and more suggested and proposed in the literature, is then to apply a structural health monitoring approach. The present paper investigates such possibility focusing on {{the application of the}} “Design of Experiment” methodology to the performance of Lamb ultrasonic waves-based monitoring carried out using piezoelectric transducers bonded on the surface of aeronautical laminates. The choice of a Design Of Experiment approach is based on the well-known fact that the success of an ultrasonic monitoring approach is mostly based on the knowledge of the most influencing factors, but also that the today published research studies usually consider them individually. A rigorous factorial design method is then applied in order to study the influence of different operative factors. Since the worst type of damage in a composite structure is a delamination, the research is particularly focused on this kind of defect obtained both artificially, using Teflon patches, and naturally, by suitable mechanical impacts...|$|E
40|$|A very <b>peculiar</b> <b>damage</b> {{patterns}} {{have been}} reported during Northridge earthquake of 1994 and Nisqually earthquake of 2001 caused by basement focusing. Similarly, basement de-focusing may cause lesser damage than the expectations but such inferences have not been reported. Further, {{as far as we}} know, no theoretical study related to de-focusing effects of anticlinal basement topography (ABT) is available in the literature. In order to fulfill this gap, this article presents the combined effects of sediment rheology and ABT on the SH-and SV-waves characteristics. The simulated results revealed an increase of de-amplification factors with distance travelled in basin above the ABT. The computed snapshots also confirmed amplitude de-amplification, diffraction and mode conversion of SV-wave. Elastic response revealed that the de-amplification factors caused by ABT were not frequency dependent. The average spectral de-amplification factors were more or less same for both the waves even after strong mode conversion of SV-wave at the lower part of ABT. Based on simulated results, it was inferred that the incorporation of effects of ABT in seismic hazard assessment is equally important as that of synclinal asement topography (SBT) effects for cost effective earthquake engineering. Fokusiranje potresnih valova topografijom pripadnih strukturnih bazena uzrokova¬lo je neobičnu razdiobu šteta koja je opažena nakon potresa u Northridgeu 1994. i Nisqualliyu 2001. godine. U skladu s time moguće je očekivati i defokusiranje valova potresa antiklinalnom bazenskom topografijom (ABT), ali, koliko nam je poznato, do sada nije objavljena niti jedna studija koja bi se bavila tim problemom. Kako bismo ispunili tu prazninu, ovdje smo razmotrili kombinirani utjecaj reologije sedimenata i ABT na svojstva SH i SV-valova. Rezultati simulacije ukazuju na povećanje deamplifikacije s udaljenosti koju valovi prevale u bazenu iznad ABT. Sintetizirani seizmogrami također potvrđuju deamplifikaciju amplituda, difrakciju te konverziju modova u slučaju SV-valova. Deam¬plifikacija ne ovisi o frekvenciji. Prosječni spektralni faktori deamplifikacije su gotovo jednaki za obje vrste valova, čak i nakon jake konverzije SV-valova u donjim dijelovima ABT. Na temelju simulacija zaključeno je da su efekti ABT u procjeni potresne opas¬nosti za učinkovito porotupotresno projektiranje jednako važni kao i efekti sinklinalne topografije (SBT) ...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} is a {{very important}} but often overlooked symptom of multiple sclerosis. To investigate the type and frequency of symptoms of sexual dysfunction in patient suffering from multiple sclerosis, we performed a case-control study comparing 108 unselected patient with definite multiple sclerosis, 97 patient with chronic disease and 1 10 healthy individuals with regard to sexual function, sphincteric function, physical disorders impeding sexual activity and the impact of sexual dysfunction on social life. Information has been collected from a face-to-face structured interview performed by a doctor of the same gender as the patient. The disability, the cognitive performances, the psychiatric conditions and the psychological profile of patien t a nd co ntrols have bee n assessed. Sexul a dysfu nction was prese nt in 73. 1 % of cases, in 39. 2 % of chronic disease co ntrols and in 12. 7 % of h e althy co ntrols (P < 0. 000 1). Male cases reported symptoms of sexual dysfunction more freq ue ntly th an female cases (P < 0. 002). Symptoms of sexual dysfunction more commonly reported in patient with multiple scerosis were anorgasmia or hyporgasmia (37. 1 %), decreased vaginal lubrication (35. 7 %) and reduced libido (31. 4 %) in women, and impotence or erectile dysfunction (63. 2 %), ejaculatory dysfunction and/or orgasmic dysfunction (50 %) and reduced libido (39. 5 %) in men. Seventy-five per cent of cases, 51. % of chronic disease controls and 28. 2 % of healthy controls (P < 0. 0001) experienced symptoms of sphincteric dysfunction. In conldusion, a substantial part of our sample of patient with multiple sclerosis reported symptoms of sexual and sphincteric dysfunction. Both sexual and sphincteric dysfunction were significantly more common in patient with multiple sclerosis than in either control group. Our findings suggest that a <b>peculiar</b> <b>damage</b> of the structures involved in sexual function is responsible for the dysfunction in patient with multiple scerosis, but the highly significant lower frequency of symptoms of depression and anxiety in healthy controls may also imply a possible causative role of psychological factors...|$|E

40|$|The most {{plant species}} {{cultivated}} in Moldavia (Romania) for various uses aren’t native in this territory. Their introduction by man, from various geographical regions, started long time ago, in ancientness, {{and now it}} is also in a continuous evolution. The most of these plants are met in crop only but a small proportion of them, escape from crops (they turn to wildness), becoming elements of the spontaneous flora. Such plants named hemerophytes can cause <b>peculiar</b> <b>damages</b> to the natural or anthropic invaded ecosystems and their knowledge represents an essential support in the rational management of the biological immigration and invasion. After consulting a great lot of bibliographic sources and based on the field observations of the author in the last years, it results for the Moldavian territory a number of 169 vascular hemerophytes, among which 21. 3 % have an invasive character, 15. 4 % are naturalized ones, and 63. 3 % are only occasional escaped from crops.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{neuropsychological assessment}} {{was performed on}} a 38 -year-old woman with drug-resistant right temporal lobe epilepsy before temporal lobectomy, during a 2 -year follow-up period, and approximately 3 years after surgery when she developed a malignant glioma in the left medial temporal lobe (MTL). Both before and after epilepsy surgery, memory function was normal. When the tumour was discovered, the patient suffered from severe retrograde and anterograde amnesia, whereas working memory and the other cognitive abilities were preserved. Compared with other cases of bilateral temporal lesion, this case is <b>peculiar</b> because the <b>damage</b> occurred on two distinct occasions. It suggests that only one MTL can allow normal memory function, or can take over the function normally subserved by a dysfunctional contralateral MTL when the dysfunction is marked and prolonged, such as in chronic epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|The 1983 Nihonkai-chubu {{earthquake}} occurred of Noshiro City, Akita prefecture, Japan on May 26, 1983. Damage due to soil liquefaction {{was found}} at many sites in Noshiro City and areas heavily damaged by soil liquefaction were located between sand-dune and soft alluvium with a very shallow level of ground water. The results of investigations {{on the characteristics of}} microtremors around Noshiro City, which suffered great damage, were described in conjunction with S-wave velocities of ground surface, geological conditions(microtopography and sdbsurface geology) and the areas damaged by the 1983 Nihonkai-chub earthquake. The short-period microtremors were measured at sites in the above areas by 3 -component seismometers with a natural period of 1 sec. connected to amplifiers and data recorders in field, and were analysed by means of micro-computer in laboratory. The digitized time ⊿t of microtremors was taken equally at 0. 02 sec. considering the frequency range (1 - 25 Hz) under investigation. Fourier spectra were calculated by means of FFT from 2048 digitized data of wave forms of microtremors. Overall frequency characteristics were flat between about 1. 0 and 25 Hz. Results of this investigation are as follows: 1) All spectra of the microtremors were classified into four types(A,B,C and D) for about 1. 0 to 10 Hz. Type A has a single peak below 1, 5 Hz in the spectra, type B has a single peak below 1. 5 Hz and a peak from 2. 0 to 3. 0 Hz, type C has a peak from 2. 0 to 3. 0 Hz, and type D has plural peaks from 1. 0 to 10 Hz. Furthermore, a diferent classification type a and b, from the previouse one, type A,B,C,and D were examined {{from the point of view}} of soil liquefaction as a <b>peculiar</b> <b>damage.</b> The type a has peaks above 4 Hz in the spectra and the type b has no peak there. 2) Average amplitudes of microtremors are particularly small at terrace, and they are slightly larger at natural levee and point bar than at terrace. Type A of microtremor spectra is found mostly at terrace and type B tends　to be　found more at older alluvial soil. 3) Type a of microtremor spectra is measured mostly in areas damaged by soil liquefaction. The spectral peaks at frequencies higher than 4 Hz are found to be related to large velocity contrast between layers. Therefore, microtremor measurements can be useful to estimate the damage due to soil liquefaction in earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|Gross {{anatomical}} {{features and}} {{a complex set}} of vascular changes characterize schistosomal hepatopathy as a peculiar form of chronic liver disease, clinically known as "hepatosplenic schistosomiasis". It differs from hepatic cirrhosis, although clinical and pathological aspects may sometimes induce confusion between these two conditions. Intrahepatic portal vein obstruction and compensatory arterial hypertrophy render the hepatic parenchyma vulnerable to ischemic insult. This may lead to focal necrosis, which may give place to focal post-necrotic scars. These events are of paramount importance for the clinico-pathological evolution of schistosomal hepatopathy. Although portal fibrosis due to schistosomiasis sometimes reveals numerous myofibroblasts, {{it does not mean that}} such fibrosis belongs to a <b>peculiar</b> type. <b>Damage</b> to the muscular walls of the portal vein may be followed by dissociation of smooth muscle cells and their transition toward myofibroblasts, which appear only as transient cells in schistosomal portal fibrosis. Studies made with plastic vascular casts, especially those with the murine model of "pipestem" fibrosis have helped to reveal the mechanisms involved in systematized portal fibrosis formation. However, the factors involved in the pathogenesis of hepatosplenic disease remain poorly understood. A process of chronic hepatitis is a common accompaniment of portal fibrosis in schistosomiasis. Most of the times it is caused by concomitant viral infection. However, no especial interaction seems to exist between schistosomal hepatopathy and viral hepatitis...|$|R
40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: The {{inherent}} seismic {{vulnerability of}} existing R. C. buildings, designed {{prior to the}} introduction of adequate seismic code provisions in the early/mid- 1970 s, has been dramatically confirmed by the catastrophic socio-economical consequences of earthquake events that have occurred worldwide in the past decade. The urgent need for the development of feasible and efficient structural mitigation strategies, and the implementation of “standardized ” retrofit solutions for intervention at urban or territorial scale, has received increasing recognition and attention. Damage scenario and seismic risk analysis, along {{with the use of a}} GIS-environment to represent the results, are considered as a helpful tool to support the decision making for planning and prioritizing seismic retrofit intervention programs at large scale. In this paper, after an overview of current vulnerability methods for seismic risk or damage scenario analysis at a territorial scale, tentative suggestions for possible refinements will be provided with particular focus on the vulnerability models for pre- 1970 reinforced concrete buildings. Improvements should include the possibility to account for the <b>peculiar</b> alternative <b>damage</b> limit states and collapse mechanisms observed in real earthquakes and further confirmed by recent numerical and experimental investigations. Comparative evaluation of the reduced level of expected damage after alternative retrofit solutions will be carried out and described in terms of fragility curves. A damage scenario analysis, referred to a case study area in Italy, will be provided as further exemplification of the effects of implementing a multi-level retrofit strategy approach at territorial scale. 1...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{cliffs and}} {{blockwork}} coastal structures often suffer a <b>peculiar</b> type of <b>damage,</b> whereby individual blocks are removed {{out of their}} location towards the sea. The location of damage suggests that breaking wave action is the main cause. It {{has been suggested that}} wave impact pressures travel into the water or air filled cracks and fissures of the structures, leading to large pressures acting inside of the structure or cliff and to the removal of blocks. This assumption was only recently confirmed for water filled cracks with a series of model tests at Queen's University Belfast. Real cracks in rock cliffs are, however, often only partially filled with water. A new experimental study, also conducted at Queen's University Belfast, revealed that wave impact generated pressures can ravel into both fully or partially water filled cracks or joints. In partially submerged cracks the pressure pulse was found to travel in the air, propagating fast and with little attenuation deep into the structure, signifying that partially filled cracks are potentially more dangerous for the integrity of the structure than completely water filled cracks. These pressure pulses may be the main cause for the seaward removal of blockwork in coastal engineering structures or of rock cliff material...|$|R
40|$|Mutations of Cu/Zn {{superoxide}} dismutase (SOD 1) {{are found in}} patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). A cellular model of FALS was developed by stably transfecting the motor neuron-like cell line NSC- 34 with human wild type (wt) or mutant (G 93 A) SOD 1. Expression levels of G 93 ASOD 1 were close to those seen in the human disease. The presence of G 93 ASOD 1 did not alter cell proliferation but toxicity was evident when the cells were in the growth plateau phase. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that, in this phase, G 93 ASOD 1 significantly lowered viability and {{that the level of}} reactive oxygen species was significantly higher in living G 93 ASOD 1 cells compared to wt SOD 1 cells. Biparametric analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential and viability of transfected cells highlighted a <b>peculiar</b> population of <b>damaged</b> cells with strong mitochondrial depolarization in the G 93 ASOD 1 cells. Mitochondrial function seemed related {{to the level of the}} mutant protein since MTT conversion decreased when expression of G 93 ASOD 1 doubled after treating cells with sodium butyrate. The mutant protein rendered G 93 ASOD 1 cells more sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction induced by stimuli that alter cellular free radical homeostasis, like serum withdrawal, depletion of glutathione by ethacrynic acid or rotenone-mediated inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In conclusion, even a small amount of mutant SOD 1 put motor neurons in a condition of oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage that causes cell vulnerability and death...|$|R
