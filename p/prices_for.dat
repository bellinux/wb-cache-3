40|$|Price {{behavior}} is an indicator for market efficiency. The reseach is conducted: (i) {{to examine the}} relationships between riil <b>price</b> <b>for</b> rice at retail level and riil <b>price</b> <b>for</b> rough rice at producer level, (ii) to examine the relationships between riil <b>price</b> <b>for</b> rice at retail level and riil <b>price</b> <b>for</b> impor rice. The causality is analysed by error correction representation, and the asymmetry of price transmmision is analysed by error correction model approach. It is used monthly time series data from 1998 – 2008. Results of the research show that: (i) the riil <b>price</b> <b>for</b> rice at retail level is integrated to the riil <b>price</b> <b>for</b> rough rice at producer level in the longrun; (ii) there is a causality direction from riil <b>price</b> <b>for</b> rice at retail level to riil <b>price</b> <b>for</b> rough rice at producer level, and no reverse, (iii) the price transmmision of relationship between riil <b>price</b> <b>for</b> rice at retail level and riil <b>price</b> <b>for</b> rough rice at producer level is asymmetry.
