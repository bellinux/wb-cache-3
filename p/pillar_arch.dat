50|$|There was a {{movement}} for the erection of major monuments, representing national sentiments and often focused on national figures. The troubled National Monument of Scotland in Edinburgh, proposed in 1816 {{to commemorate the}} Scottish dead of the Napoleonic Wars, was envisioned as a <b>pillar,</b> <b>arch,</b> church and eventually was modelled on the Parthenon in Athens by Charles Robert Cockerell and William Henry Playfair and moved sites from the Mound to Calton Hill, where the foundation stone was laid in 1822. It remained controversial and failed to gain a consensus on its design. The Scott Monument in Princes Street Gardens (1840-48) in Edinburgh was an elaborate structure built in the Gothic style, designed by carpenter and self-taught architect George Meikle Kemp. The Wallace Monument, paid for by public subscription and built from 1861 to 1869, is a 166 ft tower overlooking {{the site of the}} Battle of Stirling Bridge.|$|E

50|$|In 1952, it was rebuilt by Yury Werner. The <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches</b> and deck were extended, {{widening}} {{the bridge to}} 42.6 meters total width. New arches above embankments (26.0 meter main spans) separated bridge and embankment traffic. Total length reached 352 meters (including western ramp of 106 meters). Tram tracks were removed in 1979.|$|R
50|$|All {{the newly}} built side walls are {{plastered}} and painted white while the original stone surfaces were left uncovered. The ribs, <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches</b> and window niches were restored by sculptor Ernő Szakál in 1961-62. These pieces supposedly belonged to another stately hall situated above the room {{but they were}} built into the reconstructed vaults by 20th century restorers.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Golden Hall Scenic Zone", {{located on}} the Mingfeng Hill in the {{northern}} suburbs of Kunming, is 8 km from central Kunming. Constructed in 1602 (the 30th year of the Wanli reign period of the Ming dynasty), all of its beams, <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches,</b> doors, windows, tiles, Buddhist statues, and horizontal inscribed boards are made of copper, weighing more than 200 tons. It is the largest copper building in China.|$|R
50|$|All {{the newly}} built side walls were {{plastered}} and painted white, while the original stone surfaces were left uncovered. The ribs, <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches</b> and window niches were restored by sculptor Ernő Szakál in 1961-62. The ribs {{have a simple}} profile, but fragments of a more complicated type were {{also found in the}} rubble, together with keystones. These pieces supposedly belonged to another stately hall situated above the room, but they were built into the reconstructed vaults by restorers in the 20th-century.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} again renovated {{starting}} in 1887. After a closure of 5 weeks, the church reopened on 2 September 1888. The ceiling of lath and plaster which covered the central {{aisle of the}} nave was removed. The <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches</b> and north and west walls were stripped of paint and plaster. A new chancel was added in 1887-9 by George Fowler Jones, a York architect, and later extended in 1906. This contains the five-light 15th-century east window. Despite these changes the architectural style is broadly 15th century.|$|R
50|$|This temple carved entirely out {{of white}} marble was built in 1031 A.D. by Vimal Shah, a {{minister}} of Bhima I, the Chaulukya king of Gujarat. The temple is dedicated to Lord Rishabha. The temple stands in an open courtyard surrounded by a corridor, which has numerous cells containing smaller idols of the tirthankaras. The richly carved corridors, <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches,</b> and 'mandaps' or porticoes of the temple are simply amazing. The ceilings feature engraved designs of lotus-buds, petals, flowers and scenes from Jain mythology.|$|R
2500|$|Structural {{elements}} and fittings moved from Church Norton {{to the new}} parish church included a Norman-era font, <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches</b> and three bays of pointed-arched arcading from the nave, a bell cast in 1844 by Mears & Co. of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, and some Eucharistic objects from the 16th to the 18th centuries. [...] The arcading had chamfering and scallop-shaped capitals. Initially the rectory continued to be at Norton, but in 1902 it was sold and a new one built on land adjoining the relocated church. This work was completed in 1903. The name of the old rectory was changed to Norton Priory.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has a masonry foundation, with ashlar stone columns in each corner, and has {{features such as}} chains, windows, buttresses, <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches,</b> transoms, cornices and ornamental features such as corbels. The exterior walls are plastered and whitewashed. The church has a Latin-cross plan with three naves, flat headers, with lateral vestries and a bell tower at the foot, the headwall appears attached to the former parish cemetery, today a garden. The nave and transept have a vaulted ceiling, the apse has a slightly pointed barrel vault ceiling and the central section of the hemispherical dome has scalloped decorations.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} {{in the form of}} a Greek Cross, with arms of equal length and a wide central area. The walls were four to five feet thick, built out of rubble and coral stone, with a {{covering}} of cement. The <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches</b> and pediments of the doorways were built with imported Dutch bricks. The floor was paved with stones 2 sq ft in area, with a number of tombstones, dating from 1660, suggesting that they contained re-interred ashes or remains. The ends of the church's naves were gabled. The windows contained multiple panes and were heavily mullioned.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} Buddhist rock-cut cave abodes {{and sacred}} places (chaiti) {{are found in}} the western Deccan dating back to the 3rd century BC. These earliest rock-cut caves include the Bhaja Caves, the Karla Caves, and some of the Ajanta Caves. Relics found in these caves suggest an important connection between the religious and the commercial, as Buddhist missionaries often accompanied traders on the busy international trading routes through India. Some of the cave viharas and chaityas, commissioned by wealthy traders, included <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches,</b> reliefs and facades while trade boomed between the Roman Empire and south-east Asia.|$|R
5000|$|The Cathedral is a {{striking}} white-painted monumental church with a single high belltower offset {{to the right of}} the main entrance. Built on a plan comprising three longitudinal naves surmounted by semi-ogival <b>arches</b> on square <b>pillars,</b> the basic spatial structure of the Cathedral is typical of the 16th century. Based upon interior features — especially the details of the <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches,</b> and the carved and coffered ceiling — some experts assert that the Cathedral should be characterized as Gothic-Mudéjar in style. It certainly has Gothic features in the pointed arches of its naves, as well as in the ambulatory that surrounds the presbytery.|$|R

50|$|A Thanjavur Painting was {{generally}} {{made on a}} canvas pasted over a plank of wood (Jackfruit or teak) with Arabic gum. The canvas was then evenly coated with a paste of French chalk (gopi) or powdered limestone and a binding medium and dried. The artist then drew or traced using a stencil, a detailed outline of the main and subsidiary subjects on the canvas. A paste, made of limestone powder and a binding medium called sukkan or makku, was used for creating the Gesso work. Gold leaves and gems of varied hues were inlaid in selected areas like <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches,</b> thrones, dresses, etc. Finally, colours were applied on the sketch.|$|R
50|$|Other eusocial creatures, such as termites, use pheromones {{to build}} their complex nests by {{following}} a simple decentralized rule set. Each insect scoops up a 'mudball' or similar material from its environment, invests the ball with pheromones, and deposits it on the ground, initially in a random spot. However, termites are attracted to their nestmates' pheromones {{and are therefore more}} likely to drop their own mudballs on top of their neighbors'. The larger the heap of mud becomes, the more attractive it is, and therefore the more mud will be added to it (positive feedback). Over time this leads to the construction of <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches,</b> tunnels and chambers.|$|R

50|$|The {{three main}} scenes, {{in the shape}} of lunettes, occupy the three {{available}} walls and are enclosed within painted <b>pillars</b> and <b>arches.</b> The latter's painted intrados has geometrical and rosettas decorations, and creates the illusionistic effect of a Greek-cross plan.|$|R
50|$|The mosque {{is divided}} into the main room, ablution, entry gates and towers. The main room, a place of prayer, does not share the same {{octagonal}} theme. On the opposite side is smaller, there is a 'porch' small porch attached to and protrudes out. The windows surrounding the veranda doors made of wood with glass-precious stained glass, remnants of the art nouveau period 1890-1914, combined with Islamic art. The entire ornamentation in the mosque either in walls, ceilings, <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches</b> and rich surfaces with decorative flowers and plants. {{in front of each}} porch stairs there.

50|$|In 1874, {{the nave}} roof was raised on new <b>pillars</b> and <b>arches.</b> The {{enlarged}} building was consecrated by Bishop Mitchinson on Easter Tuesday, 1875. Except for the sanctuary and north porch, added in 1900s, this is substantially the building {{still in use}} today.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} entrance predates the northern. The northern {{entrance of}} the estate was built to reverse the entrance toward Campeche when the property was rebuilt in 1852. The north has a singular arch framed with large stone <b>pillars,</b> three-pointed <b>arch</b> and a diamond center.|$|R
50|$|A {{restoration}} {{was carried}} out in 1886 by Wans and Jolley of Nottingham. The western gallery was removed and the belfry and tower arch were opened out. The plaster was scraped from the <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches</b> and walls. The north door was also opened out. Another restoration was undertaken in 1903 by Percy Heylyn Currey of Derby. The old seats were replaced we new oak pews carved by G and W Eastwood. The floor was re-laid with maple blocking and the heating system was overhauled. The stone paving in the aisles was relaid at the same height {{as the rest of the}} floor. The large reredos was moved from the east end and replaced with a smaller one. The church was reopened on 11 September 1903.|$|R
50|$|Kamani Masjid is {{so named}} {{since it has}} {{architectural}} features of <b>pillars</b> and <b>arches</b> in the hall. The central hall also has a marble-roofed dome fixed with glazed tiles. It is situated near the distant signal of Pavagadh's railroad station in the northbound direction, towards Sivarajpur.|$|R
50|$|Lotus Mahal is a two storied very {{symmetric}} structure exhibiting a {{fine example}} of Indo-Islamic architecture. The base of the structure depicts a Hindu foundation of stone just like in the temples, typical of Vijayanagara Architecture while the upper superstructure is Islamic in architecture with pyramidal towers instead of regular dome shapes, giving it a Lotus-like look, originating in the name. Also, {{this is one of the}} very few buildings that have the plaster intact though it is defaced at several places due to wear and tear, especially; the dampness on the walls is very visible. The exemplary carvings on the <b>pillar</b> <b>arches</b> including those of birds and delicate art work can be very mesmerizing, especially with the Makara Torana on top of these arches that can still be seen on some of them.|$|R
50|$|Henry Gibson died in 1891 after {{spending}} only ten summers in his so-called castle. Upon his death, the mansion was bequeathed to his 22-year-old daughter Mary Klett “May” Gibson. May never married {{but she did}} enjoy a lavish social life. In 1901 she hired George Watson and William D. Hewitt to design a ballroom 60 feet long and 50 feet high, fit for 400 people. The two story ballroom had ornately carved stone <b>pillars,</b> <b>arched</b> windows, and vaulted cathedral ceilings. A cloistered court {{was attached to the}} ballroom featuring stained glass windows by Violet Oakley, the first woman artist to receive a large commission for her work at the ornate capital building in Harrisburg.May also added a large library, a greenhouse, and a carriage house containing an artist studio for herself.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} was built entirely teak and stands adorned with <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches</b> and balconies. It {{is believed that}} Tipu Sultan used to conduct his durbar (court) from the eastern and western balconies of the upper floor. There are four smaller rooms {{in the corners of}} first floor which were used to known as Zenana Quarters.1 There are beautiful floral motifs embellishing the walls of the palace. The site also holds a painting of grand throne visualized by Tipu Sultan himself. Coated with gold sheets and stuck with precious emerald stones, Tipu had vowed never to use it until he completely defeated the English Army. After Tipu Sultan's death, the British dismantled the throne and auctioned its parts as it was too expensive for a single person to buy whole.|$|R
60|$|There {{was little}} sound of hammers {{in this place}} for {{building}} ships, and little work in progress; for the greatness {{of the city was}} no more, as I have said. Indeed, it seemed a very wreck found drifting on the sea; a strange flag hoisted in its honourable stations, and strangers standing at its helm. A splendid barge in which its ancient chief had gone forth, pompously, at certain periods, to wed the ocean, lay here, I thought, no more; but, in its place, there was a tiny model, made from recollection like the city's greatness; and it told of what had been (so are the strong and weak confounded in the dust) almost as eloquently as the massive <b>pillars,</b> <b>arches,</b> roofs, reared to overshadow stately ships that had no other shadow now, upon the water or the earth.|$|R
50|$|Another anecdote {{tells us}} that Thirumalai first brought his queen to the Thirumalai Nayak palace after it was completed. She commented that the giant <b>pillars</b> and <b>arches</b> {{reminded}} her of a stable for elephants, sending the king into such a rage that he had her confined {{for the rest of}} her life. And he took another wife.|$|R
