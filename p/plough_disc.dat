40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to compare the {{performance}} and the costs of alternative tillage systems and machinery, in both energy and economic terms. To determine the energy requirements of tillage implements, experimentation in field conditions and controlled laboratory was conducted. Costs of alternative implements and complete systems were analysed. The field experiment was undertaken to determine the performance of tillage implements in real conditions. Draught force and area of disturbance of the implements were measured and specific resistance calculated. The implements involved in the experiment were 4 furrow mouldboard plough, 3 furrow disc <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> harrow and 7 winged tines. The mouldboard plough was operating at two different depths. Two tractors were used for execution of the implement and the wheel slip was measured. The soil bin studies were conducted in additional evaluation of the implements. The laboratory conditions ensure the uniformity of each test. The experiment was carried out to determine draught force, area of disturbance and specific resistance. The experiment involved single furrow mouldboard <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> harrow and winged tines. Winged tines were made up of four different wing widths. Finally, an economic cost calculator was developed to compare the costs of different implements and tillage systems. Technical parameters and current prices of the implements were obtained from the manufacturers. The results from the field experiment show that there is a similar draught force per unit implement for mouldboard and disc ploughs, while draught force of mouldboard plough is significantly higher. The tillage efficiency of all implements is similar, with a mean of specific resistance of 58 kN/m 2 and a range of 15 kN/m 2. In the soil bin the vertical force preventing penetration occurred for disc plough and disc harrow. The specific resistance of the mouldboard plough had the lowest value, while the specific resistance of disc plough was higher by a factor of 1. 65. By increasing the wing width of the tines the draught force was increased but the specific resistance decreased. Comparing the costs of complete tillage systems it was observed that minimum tillage decreases the operational cost per hectare by 30 % compared to a conventional system based on ploughing. Direct drilling is the cheapest way to establish a crop, but if herbicide has to be applied the cost per hectare {{is similar to that of}} minimum tillage. The costs of different sizes (102, 162, 224 kW tractors) of alternative tillage systems are similar. Namely the cost of mouldboard plough is £ 80. 33 /ha with a range of £ + 2. 48 /- 1. 93 /ha, the cost of shallow mouldboard plough is £ 68. 85 /ha with a range of £ + 2. 02 /- 1. 64 /ha, the cost of stubble cultivator is £ 42. 05 /ha with a range of £ + 2. 02 /- 1. 27 /ha, the cost of direct drill is £ 20. 76 /ha with a range of £ + 0. 89 /- 0. 75 /ha and the cost of direct drill with herbicide application is £ 43. 15 /ha with a range of £ + 0. 41 /- 0. 53 /ha...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} study, dimensional {{analysis was used}} to model the relationship between depth of cut, weight of disc plough and draught on a sandy loam soil. Field experiment was carried out on a site with three different moisture content levels at five different plough speeds (0. 83, 1. 39, 1. 94, 2. 4 and 2. 78 m/s). It was observed that the depth of penetration of <b>plough</b> <b>disc</b> increased with an increased draught and soil moisture content.

Also the draught-speed relationship obtained from this study can be used to predict the power requirement of the disc plough in other soil types. The draught increase linearly with the depth of cut as predicted from the model.

40|$|Abstract: Tillage {{is a very}} {{important}} crop production activity which may affect crop performance differently. An experiment was conducted during the during the 2009 and 2010 major crop growing seasons in Kumasi, Ghana, to compare the effect of four different tillage practices on Asontem cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp) performance. The treatments consisted of <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> only, <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing, disc harrowing only and no tillage. There was significant difference in Asontem cowpea growth, dry matter yield and yield components between tillage practices. <b>Disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing gave the best results producing the highest percentage seedling emergence, tallest plant, biggest stem girth and greatest number of leaves. Furthermore, <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing resulted in the longest root length, highest dry matter yield, highest number of pods per plant, highest number of seeds per pod and highest 1000 seed-weight. The no tillage plots produced the shortest plant, smallest stem girth and smallest number of leaves. In addition, the no tillage plots gave the shortest root length, lowest dry matter yield, smallest number of pods per plant, smallest number of seeds per pod and smallest 1000 seed-weight. Therefore, considering the soil and weather conditions of the experiment the best tillage practice for Asontem cowpea growth and yield is <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by <b>disc</b> harrowing...|$|R

Two-year field experiment was conducted in 2013 and 2014 to investigate the effects of different tillage methods on the physical properties of sandy loam soil, growth and yield of water melon (Citrullus vulgaris) in a semi-arid environment. The Tillage treatments were <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> plus <b>disc</b> harrowing (DP+DH), double <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> (DDP), double <b>disc</b> harrowing (DDH), <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> (DP) and <b>disc</b> harrowing (DH) as minimum tillage (MT) and zero tillage (ZT) and direct drilling method (control). The watermelon seeds were Planted manually placing three (3) seeds per hole at an interval of 1. 5 m along the rows and 50 cm between the rows at an average depth of 5 cm. The treatments were laid in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. Results showed that <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> + <b>disc</b> harrowing (DP+DH) {{was found to be}} more appropriate and profitable tillage method in improving soil physical properties and growth and yield of water melon in a sandy loam soil. Watermelon yield, fruit weight (FW), fruit length (FL), fruit diameter (FD) and leaf area index (LAI) were significantly influenced (P= 0. 05), but influence of tillage treatments were not significant on the number of fruit per plant (NFPP). A numerical value of 31. 0 t/ha, 26. 0, 5. 4 kg, 29. 0 cm, and 33. 8 cm were recorded for maximum crop yield, NFPP, FW, FD and FL respectively in DP+DH-treated plots.

40|$|Most of {{the indices}} {{currently}} employed for assessing soil surface micro-topography, such as random roughness (RR), are merely descriptors of its vertical component. Recently, multifractal analysis provided a new insight for describing the spatial configuration of soil surface roughness. The main {{objective of this}} study was to test the ability of multifractal parameters to assess decay of initial surface roughness induced by natural rainfall under different soil tillage systems in field conditions. In addition, we evaluated the potential of the joint use of multifractal indices plus RR to improve predictions of water storage in depressions of the soil surface (MDS). Field experiments were performed on an Oxisol at Campinas, São Paulo State (Brazil). Six tillage treatments, namely, disc harrow, disc plough, chisel <b>plough,</b> <b>disc</b> harrow + disc level, disc plough + disc level and chisel plough + disc level were tested. In each treatment soil surface micro-topography was measured four times, with increasing amounts of natural rainfall, using a pin meter. The sampling scheme was a square grid with 25 &times; 25 mm point spacing and the plot size was 1350 &times; 1350 mm (≈ 1. 8 m 2 ), so that each data set consisted of 3025 individual elevation points. Duplicated measurements were taken per treatment and date, yielding a total of 48 experimental data sets. MDS was estimated from grid elevation data with a depression-filling algorithm. Multifractal analysis was performed for experimental data sets as well as for oriented and random surface conditions obtained from the former by removing slope and slope plus tillage marks, respectively. All the investigated microplots exhibited multifractal behaviour, irrespective of surface condition, but the degree of multifractality showed wide differences between them. Multifractal parameters provided valuable information for characterizing the spatial features of soil micro-topography as they were able to discriminate data sets with similar values for the vertical component of roughness. Both, rough and smooth soil surfaces, with high and low roughness values, respectively, can display similar levels of spectral complexity. Although in most of the studied cases trend removal produces increasing homogeneity in the spatial configuration of height readings, spectral complexity of individual data sets may increase or decrease, when slope or slope plus tillage tool marks are filtered. Increased cumulative rainfall had significant effects on various parameters from the generalized dimension, Dq, and singularity spectrum, f(α). Overall, micro-topography decay by rainfall produced was reflected on a shift of the singularity spectra, f(α) from the left side (q&gt;&gt; 0) to the right side (q&lt;&lt; 0) and also on a shift of the generalized dimension spectra from the right side (q&gt;&gt; 0) to the left side (q&lt;&lt; 0). The use of an exponential model of vertical roughness indices, RR, and multifractal parameters accounting for the spatial configuration such as D 1 , D 5 , and D 10 improved estimation of water stored in surface depressions...|$|E

Vegetation response was influenced by winter-spring drought after establishment of the experiments, but moderate rainfall followed in late summer-autumn. Species composition varied greatly between sampling times, and the variability due to rainfall differences between seasons and years was greater than the effects of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing or <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing.</b> In the fire experiment, species richness and composition recovered more rapidly after spring than autumn burning. Species richness and composition were similar to control sites within 12 months of burning and mowing, suggesting that removal of the dominant grass canopy is unnecessary to enhance plant diversity. Two fires (separated by 3 years) and post-fire kangaroo grazing had only minor influence on species richness and composition. Even <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> caused only a small reduction in native richness. The minor impact of ploughing was explained by the small areas that were ploughed, the once-off nature of the treatment, and {{the high degree of}} natural movement and cracking in these shrink-swell soils. Recovery of the composition and richness of these grasslands was rapid because of the high proportion of perennial species that resprout vegetatively after fire and mowing. There appears to be little conservation benefit from fire, mowing or ploughing ungrazed areas, as we could identify no native plant species dependent on frequent disturbance for persistence in this grassland community.

Two types of data were user for this study; namely, primary and secondary data which were collected during the period 2008 - 2009. The primary data were collected through social survey as faceto- face interviews with pastoralists and local communities in the study area and by a field experiment on an area of 20 feddans and affected by grazing in the forest. The experimental area was divided into 5 blocks, each block consisted of 4 treatments, namely, seeds of grass and talih (Acacia seyal) were broadcast seeding just before autumn, seeding after <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing,</b> sowing using water harvesting technique and a control (no seeding). The secondary data were collected from the Range and Pasture Administration and the Forest National Corporation (FNC). There were distinct ecological changes in the study area as indicated by the deterioration of the rangelands and retrogression where some palatable weed species disappeared from the study area and were replaced by other unpalatable species due to open grazing pressure, illegal tree felling by the local people and expansion in the rain fed mechanized agricultural schemes due. Moreover, overgrazing represents a real challenge to the conservation and rehabilitation of El Rawashda Forest in the absence of proper protection and management. In addition, the number of animals is more than the carrying capacity of the forest and this resulted in the disappearance of some palatable species and the appearance of new VI unpalatable one. Frequent drought cycles (climate change and variability) and fires also contributed to the deterioration of the forest. The results of the experiment revealed significant differences among some treatments used to improve and tree cover. The seeding of the forage and talh seeds after <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> gave the best results compared to other treatments, followed by forage and talh seed sowing under water harvesting technique and broadcasting of forage and trees seeds and finally the control. In conclusion the deterioration of the natural rangelands in El Rawasha Forest Reserve is due to the existence of livestock in the forest area for a long period of time. This resulted in retrogression where palatable species were replaced by less or unpalatable species.

One consisted in the identification and soil analysis of 3 pairs of sites under different soil types and land use over 5 to 30 years; in the second experiment a long-term fallow area was repeatedly submitted to different types of soil tillage management (mouldboard <b>plough</b> + <b>disc</b> harrow; non-inversion tine cultivation; no-till) over 3 years. Soil texture, bulk density and SOM were analysed along the whole soil profile in the first experiment, whereas bulk density and SOM to a depth of 30 cm was measured before the first tillage operations {{and at the end of}} the observation period in the second experiment. The results clearly indicate that tillage based land use, irrespective of the type of land use, caused a considerable decline in SOM content in the tilled soil layer. Very small and inconsistent differences in SOM between paired soil profiles were observed in the lower part of the profiles. In the second experiment with three types of tillage systems, SOM content decreased with tillage intensity. Avoidance of soil disturbance is an important step towards halting SOM decline under Mediterranean {{climate conditions}}...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to detecting the land use and land cover change (LULC), us-ing remote sensing techniques, then identify the reasons for rangeland and tree cover degradation in El Rawashda Forest, Gadarif State, Sudan. The study has conducted field experiment developed on an area of 20 feddans that was affected by deterioration in the forest and to assess the best method for rehabilitation of the vegetation cover in the area of study. The experimental area was divided into 5 blocks; each block consisted of 4 treatments: grass seeds and Talih (Acacia seyal var. seyal); sowing seeds just before autumn, sowing seeds after <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing,</b> sowing seeds using water harvesting technique and control (no seeding). In the present study an attempt has been made to analyze and monitor the LULC changes using multi-temporal Landsat data deterioration in the forest and to assess the best method for restoration of the vegetation.

40|$|We use hydrodynamical {{simulations}} of a Cartwheel-like ring galaxy, modelled as a nearly head-on collision {{of a small}} companion with a larger disc galaxy, to probe {{the evolution of the}} gaseous structures and flows, and to explore the physical conditions setting the star formation activity. Star formation is first quenched by tides as the companion approaches, before being enhanced shortly after the collision. The ring <b>ploughs</b> the <b>disc</b> material as it radially extends, and almost simultaneously depletes its stellar and gaseous reservoir into the central region, through the spokes, and finally dissolve 200 Myr after the collision. Most of star formation first occurs in the ring before this activity is transferred to the spokes and then the nucleus. We thus propose that the location of star formation traces the dynamical stage of ring galaxies, and could help constrain their star formation histories. The ring hosts tidal compression associated with strong turbulence. This compression yields an azimuthal asymmetry, with maxima reached in the side furthest away from the nucleus, which matches the star formation activity distribution in our models and in observed ring systems. The interaction triggers the formation of star clusters significantly more massive than before the collision, but less numerous than in more classical galaxy interactions. The peculiar geometry of Cartwheel-like objects thus yields a star (cluster) formation activity comparable to other interacting objects, but with notable second order differences in the nature of turbulence, the enhancement of the star formation rate, and the number of massive clusters formed.

40|$|In arable {{cropping}} systems, {{reduced or}} conservation tillage practices are linked with improved soil quality, C retention and higher microbial biomass, but most long-term studies rarely focus on depths greater than 15 cm nor allow comparison of microbial community responses to agricultural practices. We investigated microbial community structure {{in a long-term}} field trial (12 -years, Lincoln, New Zealand) established in a silt-loam soil over four depth ranges down to 30 cm. Our objectives were to investigate the degree of homogenisation of soil biological and chemical properties with depth, and to determine the main drivers of microbial community response to tillage. We hypothesised that soil microbiological responses would depend on tillage depth, observed by a homogenisation of microbial community composition within the tilled zone. Tillage treatments were mouldboard <b>plough</b> and <b>disc</b> harrow, impacting soil to ∼ 20 and ∼ 10 cm depth, respectively. These treatments were compared to a no-tillage treatment and two control treatments, both permanent pasture and permanent fallow. Bacterial and fungal communities collected from the site were not impacted by the spatial location of sampling across the study area but were affected by physicochemical changes associated with tillage induced soil homogenisation and plant presence. Tillage treatment effects on both species richness and composition were more evident for bacterial communities than fungal communities, and were greater at depths < 15  cm. Homogenisation of soil and changing land management appears to redistribute both microbiota and nutrients deeper in the soil profile while consequences for soil biogeochemical functioning remain poorly understood...|$|R
40|$|The area {{devoted to}} growing tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) in the {{province}} of Granma, Cuba, accounted for nearly 2600 ha in the year 1997, which represented the 4 % of the total tobacco plantation area on the island in that year. Tobacco is tillage-intensive since traditional production systems entail seven or eight cultivation operations before transplanting. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate two alternative tillage systems in comparison with conventional tillage for tobacco production with the aim to improve soil conditions, reduce the number of tillage operations for soil preparation for transplanting, and increase yields. The treatments studied were: (T 1) conventional or traditional tillage, (T 2) reduced tillage with a multi-tiller plough, and (T 3) reduced tillage with a chisel plough. T 1 consisted in <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> twice and <b>disc</b> harrowing twice for primary tillage, while before transplanting plots were ploughed twice with a horse-drawn mouldboard plough and harrowed twice with a horse-drawn spike-tooth harrow. In T 2 primary tillage was accomplished with two passes with the multi-tiller followed by disc harrowing twice before transplanting. In T 3 chisel ploughing was substituted for multi-tiller ploughing. The two reduced tillage systems improved the physical conditions of the soil, which resulted in: lower bulk density, with average values across the 0 - 30 cm soil profile of 1. 48, 1. 34 and 1. 30 Mg m - 3 in T 1, T 2 and T 3, respectively, at the end of the growing season; higher soil water content in the soil profile in all four sampling dates per season; greater porosity; and lower resistance to penetration with values of 2. 48, 2. 15 and 1. 71 MPa in T 1, T 2 and T 3, respectively, before crop harvesting. Tillage system T 3 provided the highest crop yields (2. 26 Mg ha - 1) compared with T 2 (2. 14 Mg ha - 1) and T 1 (1. 95 Mg ha - 1), for the plants grown on T 3 plots had the largest number of leaves. The size of the leaves was similar in all three systems, however. </p...|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were done {{to measure the}} effect of different primary tillage methods on the CO 2 flux from soil and to evaluate the effect of conservation tillage tools on short-term CO 2 emissions. The {{experiments were}} conducted on a clay loam soil winter wheat field and a corn field. The three tillage treatments included stubble mulching (disc harrow, mulch tiller, chisel <b>plough),</b> primary tillage (<b>disc</b> harrow, moldboard <b>plough,</b> and chisel plough) and secondary tillage (combined seedbed maker). The control treatment was no-till with soil and residues left by the harvester. The CO 2 flux from the tilled soil surface was measured by a portable closed-chamber tester. Moldboard ploughing produced the roughest soil surface and the highest initial CO 2 flux and maintained the highest flux throughout the experiment. The moldboard ploughing caused higher CO 2 loss than less intensive tillage such as chisel ploughing, mulch cultivating, or disc harrowing. Primary tillage caused higher CO 2 emission in the fall than seedbed preparation did in the spring. These results support increased use of new and improved forms of conservation tillage equipment and offer a significant potential for preserving or increasing soil C levels while decreasing carbon dioxide emissions...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{compares the}} levels of tractor use in {{both public and private}} sectors in Borno State, Nigeria in 1984 and 1998. The major tractor {{operations}} performed in 1984, namely disc harrowing and <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing,</b> were still the important operations carried out in 1998. The available tractor makes and models rose from 12 and 31 in 1984 to 16 and 61 in 1998 respectively. Despite this increase, the specific tractor population density (STPD) decreased from 0. 28 in 1984 to 0. 22 in 1998. Also, there was a decrease in the specific tractor wattage from 16 W/ha in 1984 to 12 W/ha in 1998. This means that farm mechyanization suffered a setback during the 15 -year period, with fewer functional tractors and less power availble per 1000 ha of cultivated land. The major problems of tractor use in the State were high overhead cost, lack of spare parts of some makes and poor operation skills. Despite these odds, there was an appreciable improvement in tractor maintenance culture by both private and public sectors in the state during the 15 -year period. The STPD and tractor use need to be increased so as to uplift farm mechanization in Borno Stat...|$|R
40|$|We {{researched}} {{the influence of}} soil cultivation and fertilization on changes of nitrate, ammonium and inorganic nitrogen content in soil during the monitored vegetation periods (2004 / 2005 – 2005 / 2006). This experiment was realized on experimental bases of Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra – Dolná Malanta on the winter/summer wheat (Triticum aestivum), variety Bonita, with red clover as its before-crop. In the field trial we used two types of tillage, B 1 – conventional tillage up to the depth of 0, 25 m and B 2 – <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> up to 0, 15 m, with three variants of fertilization, 0 – unfertilized control, PH – fertilization according to its content in soil and PZ – fertilization according to its content in soil + plough down of post harvest residues. Samples of the soil {{were taken from the}} two soil depth (0, 0 - 0, 3 m and 0, 3 - 0, 6 m) and in each vegetation period there were 8 takings of soil samples in four repetitions. During monitored vegetation period this dynamics was changeable. The content of nitrate nitrogen in the soil in autumn was about 40 % higher than content of ammonium nitrate. This tendency changed in spring, when the average content of ammonium nitrogen was higher than the content of nitrate nitrogen on average about 60 %. The cultivation had significant influence on dynamics of inorganic nitrogen. The average content of inorganic nitrogen in conventional tillage up to the depth of 0, 25 m was 8, 43 mg. kg- 1 and in <b>disc</b> <b>ploughing</b> it was 7, 60 mg. kg- 1. The influence of fertilization on changes of inorganic nitrogen was significantly important. Monitored ways of fertilization within the content of nitrates in the soil had the following averages: in unfertilized soil 7, 48 mg. kg- 1, in fertilized soil NPK 8, 20 mg. kg- 1 and in the soil fertilized with plough down of post harvest residues 8, 37 mg. kg- 1. In the first and second variety of soil cultivation we found out a low increase of average concentration of nitrates in the fertilized soil in comparison with unfertilized one. High significant influence on dynamics of nitrate nitrogen in the soil had date of sample takings and also depth. In the first depth (0, 0 - 0, 3 m) the level of nitrate nitrogen was 9, 18 mg. kg- 1 and in the second depth (0, 3 - 0, 6 m) it was 6, 85 mg. kg- 1...|$|R
