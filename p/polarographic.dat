The fuel cell produces a voltage linearly proportional to the O2 partial pressure at the membrane.

50|$|Dramatically better {{discrimination}} against the capacitive current {{can be obtained}} using the tast and pulse <b>polarographic</b> techniques. These have been developed with introduction of analog and digital electronic potentiostats. A first major improvement is obtained, if the current is only measured {{at the end of}} each drop lifetime (tast polarography). An even greater enhancement has been the introduction of differential pulse polarography. Here, the current is measured before the beginning and before the end of short potential pulses. The latter are superimposed to the linear potential-time-function of the voltammetric scan. Typical amplitudes of these pulses range between 10 and 50 mV, whereas pulse duration is 20 to 50 ms. The difference between both current values is that taken as the analytical signal. This technique results in a 100 to 1000-fold improvement of the detection limit, because the capacitive component is effectively suppressed.|$|E
50|$|Polarography is a voltammetric {{measurement}} whose {{response is}} determined by combined diffusion/convection mass transport. The simple principle of polarography {{is the study of}} solutions or of electrode processes by means of electrolysis with two electrodes, one polarizable and one unpolarizable, the former formed by mercury regularly dropping from a capillary tube. Polarography is a specific type of measurement that falls into the general category of linear-sweep voltammetry where the electrode potential is altered in a linear fashion from the initial potential to the final potential. As a linear sweep method controlled by convection/diffusion mass transport, the current vs. potential response of a <b>polarographic</b> experiment has the typical sigmoidal shape. What makes polarography different from other linear sweep voltammetry measurements is that polarography makes use of the dropping mercury electrode (DME) or the static mercury drop electrode.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{completion}} of the studies Sister {{was assigned to the}} laboratory of analytical chemistry headed by Professor Yuri Lyalikov. The laboratory {{was a part of the}} Institute of Chemistry at the Moldavian branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, which became the Academy of Sciences of Moldova in 1961.

50|$|There {{are various}} {{limitations}} in particular for the classical polarography experiment for quantitative analytical measurements. Because the current is continuously measured during {{the growth of}} the Hg drop, there is a substantial contribution from capacitive current. As the Hg flows from the capillary end, there is initially a large increase in the surface area. As a consequence, the initial current is dominated by capacitive effects as charging of the rapidly increasing interface occurs. Toward the end of the drop life, there is little change in the surface area which diminishes the contribution of capacitance changes to the total current. At the same time, any redox process which occurs will result in faradaic current that decays approximately as the square root of time (due to the increasing dimensions of the Nernst diffusion layer). The exponential decay of the capacitive current is much more rapid than the decay of the faradaic current; hence, the faradaic current is proportionally larger {{at the end of the}} drop life. Unfortunately, this process is complicated by the continuously changing potential that is applied to the working electrode (the Hg drop) throughout the experiment. Because the potential is changing during the drop lifetime (assuming typical experimental parameters of a 2 mV/s scan rate and a 4 s drop time, the potential can change by 8 mV from the beginning to the end of the drop), the charging of the interface (capacitive current) has a continuous contribution to the total current, even at the end of the drop when the surface area is not rapidly changing. As such, the typical signal to noise of a <b>polarographic</b> experiment allows detection limits of only approximately 10−5 or 10−6 M.|$|E
