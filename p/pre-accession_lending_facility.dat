40|$|The U. S. Treasury {{announced}} in August 2005 {{that it is}} exploring whether to provide a backstop securities <b>lending</b> <b>facility</b> for U. S. Treasury securities. This paper examines the conceptual basis for such a facility by analogizing the market for borrowing and lending Treasury securities with the market for borrowing and lending money prior to {{the founding of the}} Federal Reserve System in 1914. An inelastic supply of currency in the nineteenth century led to periodic suspensions of convertibility of bank deposits; Congress authorized a system of Federal Reserve Banks to address the problem. A similarly inelastic supply of Treasury securities has led to several recent episodes of chronic settlement fails. A backstop <b>lending</b> <b>facility</b> would mitigate the fails problem by allowing the Treasury to act as a lender of last resort of Treasury securities during periods of unusual market stress.

An amalgam of long-standing national housing programs and <b>lending</b> <b>facilities</b> previously managed by the National Mortgage Bank, the FONAVI helped coordinate slum clearance efforts and, since then, has put up over 25,000 housing units a year (both single-family and multi-family types).|$|R
5000|$|The {{collateral}} for the Term Securities <b>Lending</b> <b>Facility</b> (TSLF) {{also has}} been expanded; eligible collateral will now include all investment-grade debt securities.

50|$|In the eurozone the {{discount}} window is called Standing Facilities, {{which are used}} to manage overnight liquidity. Qualifying counterparties can use the Standing Facilities {{to increase the amount}} of cash they have available for overnight settlements using the Marginal <b>Lending</b> <b>Facility.</b> Conversely, excess funds can be deposited within the European Central Bank System (ECBS) and earn interest using the Deposit facility.|$|R
50|$|Therefore, some economists, {{including}} John Geanakoplos, strongly {{argue that}} the Federal Reserve should monitor and regulate the system-wide leverage level in the economy, limiting leverage in good times and encouraging higher levels of leverage in bad times, by extending <b>lending</b> <b>facilities.</b> Moreover, {{it is more important}} to restrict leverage in ebullient times to prevent the crash from happening in the first place.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{depending}} {{on the distribution of}} banks' uncertain liquidity needs and on how monetary policy is implemented, frictions in the interbank market may reinforce the effectiveness of monetary policy. These frictions imply that with its <b>lending</b> and deposit <b>facilities</b> the central bank has an additional effective instrument at hand to impose an impact on bank loan supply. While lowering the rate on the <b>lending</b> <b>facility</b> has, taken for itself, an expansionary effect, lowering the rate on the deposit facility has a contractionary effect.

2500|$|In {{order to}} address {{problems}} related to the subprime mortgage crisis and United States housing bubble, several new tools have been created. The first new tool, called the Term Auction Facility, was added on December 12, 2007. It was first announced as a temporary tool {{but there have been}} suggestions that this new tool may remain in place for a prolonged period of time. Creation of the second new tool, called the Term Securities <b>Lending</b> <b>Facility,</b> was announced on March 11, 2008. The main difference between these two facilities is that the Term Auction Facility is used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term Securities <b>Lending</b> <b>Facility</b> is used to inject treasury securities into the banking system. Creation of the third tool, called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008. The PDCF was a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now the Fed is able to lend directly to primary dealers, which was previously against Fed policy.
