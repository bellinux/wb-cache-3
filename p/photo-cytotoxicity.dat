40|$|Objectives: In this study, {{the early}} {{apoptotic}} events elicited by mTHPC-mediated <b>photo-cytotoxicity</b> were explored {{in a human}} nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (NPC/HK 1). Methods and materials: NPC/HK 1 cells (5 × 10 3) were incubated with photosensitizer mTHPC (0. 8 μg/ml) in chamber slides for 20 h and subjected to light irradiation at 2 J/cm 2 (LD 80). Morphologic changes of treated cells were examined under light microscopy and confocal microscopy at 0 - 4 h after the light irradiation. The early stage of apoptosis was detected by fluorescein-conjugated Annexin V (Annexin V-FITC) assay. Mitochondrial membrane damage and cytochrome c release were determined by flowcytometric analysis. Bcl- 2 expression was measured by Western blot analysis. Results: One hour after mTHPC-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), microscopic examination showed membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage. Annexin V-FITC assay showed that {{a considerable number of}} NPC/HK 1 cells became apoptotic. Flowcytometric analysis showed that the cytochrome c was released at 1 h after PDT. Bcl- 2 expression also declined significantly compared to control groups. Conclusions: mTHPC-mediated <b>photo-cytotoxicity</b> can effectively induce early apoptotic responses in NPC/HK 1 cells which might be modulated by mitochondrial damages and Bcl- 2 inhibition.

40|$|Photo-activatable platinum(IV) diazido {{complexes}} {{with the}} general formula of trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N 3) 2 (OH) (X) (py) (am 1) ] (X is a hydroxide or carboxylate and am 1 is an aliphatic/aromatic amine) show dark-stability under physiological conditions but can induce a photo-cytotoxic effect in cancer cells after irradiation with UVA, blue and/or green light. These platinum(IV) diazido complexes can platinate DNA and induce different lesions that are distinctly different from those generated by the anticancer drug cis-platin. Through the use of EPR, multinuclear NMR, and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, as well as mass spectrometry and some cell studies, this thesis aims to investigate the pathways of photochemical decomposition {{and in particular the}} release of azidyl ligands and their subsequent involvement in <b>photo-cytotoxicity.</b> Firstly, the irradiation of trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N 3) 2 (OH) 2 (py) 2] (40, py = pyridine) with blue light {{in the presence of the}} spin trap 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) led to the detection of a characteristic quartet-of-triplets EPR spectrum, assigned to the azidyl radical adduct, DMPO- 14 N 3. Irradiation of 15 N- 40, led to the detection of a quartet-of-doublets EPR spectrum as assigned to the DMPO- 15 N 3 spin adduct. This confirmed that the ●N 3 radicals arose from the platinum(IV) - bound azide. The DMPO-N 3 spin adduct was also detected from the photoirradiation of trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N 3) 2 (OH) 2 (MA) (py) ] (44, MA = methylamine) with blue light. A greater yield in the DMPO-N 3 spin adduct was formed in PBS/D 2 O. This effect was attributed to the Brownian motion of the ●N 3 radicals. Interestingly, photoirradiation in the cell culture medium-, RPMI- 1640 led to a reduction in the DMPO-N 3 spin adduct. This reduction was accredited to the variety of components present in the cell culture medium which could behave as radical quenchers. Alternative nitrone spin traps, - 4 -pyridyl- 1 -oxide-N-tert-butylnitrone (4 -POBN) and 5 -diethoxyphosphoryl- 5 -methyl- 1 -pyrroline-N-oxide (DEPMPO) also led to the trapping of the azidyl radicals from irradiated 40, forming the 4 -POBN-N 3 (triplet-of-quartets) and DEPMPO-N 3 (octet-of-triplets) spin adducts EPR spectra, respectively. DEPMPO was the most efficient azidyl radical trap; with the DEPMPO-N 3 spin adduct possessing the longest lifetime in aqueous media. Extending the wavelength of activation to green light (517 nm), also led to the detection of DMPO-N 3 from the photo-irradiation of 40 in RPMI- 1640, trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N 3) 2 (OH) (SAD) (py) 2] (56,SAD=succinate), trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N 3) 2 (OH) (ethyl-methyl-SAD) (py) 2] (57) and trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N 3) 2 (OH) (N-MI) (py) 2] (58, N-MI = N-methylisatoate) in H 2 O/DMF. The DEPMPO-N 3 was also detected from the gamma-ray irradiation of 40, which appears to be the first report of the activation of a platinum(IV) diazido anticancer complex with gamma-rays, a procedure which might be useful of clinical use. The azidyl radicals generated from irradiated 40 were unreactive towards both glycine and L-tyrosine. However, in the presence of L-tryptophan the azidyl radicals were quenched. Detection of free azide by 14 N NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this quenching mechanism proceeded through a one-electron transfer pathway. The <b>photo-cytotoxicity</b> of 40 was supressed in the presence of low doses of L-tryptophan in A 2780 ovarian cancer cells. From this study, it was deduced that the <b>photo-cytotoxicity</b> of 40 is comprised of both an acute (radical) and chronic (DNA platination) based mechanisms. Additionally, certain cancers have reported on the depleted serum levels of L-tryptophan, in particular ovarian cancer cells. This suggests the extent of the <b>photo-cytotoxicity</b> of 40 can be controlled in the presence of L-tryptophan. Photo-irradiation of 40 in the presence of melatonin, an analogue of L-tryptophan was also performed. Despite, the structural similarity between L-tryptophan and melatonin, the presence of the 5 -methoxy substituent present in melatonin induced an alternative photo-decomposition pathway of 40. Photo-irradiation of 40 in the presence of melatonin with blue light also led to the detection of the quartet EPR spectrum assigned to the hydroxyl radical adduct, DMPO-OH. Through multinuclear NMR and mass spectrometry the quenching of both the azidyl and hydroxyl radicals by melatonin was determined. Additionally, mass spectrometry also detected a mass adduct attributed to a platinum(II) -melatonin complex. This dual antioxidant and metal-binding ability of melatonin was attributed to the observed photo-protective effect in A 2780 ovarian cancer cells. Melatonin regulates circadian rhythms with a maximum concentration during dark hours. Consequently, treatment of antineoplastic tissue with 40 during the hours of melatonin production may be ineffective. Platinum accumulation and absorption has been suggested to be mediated by organic cation transporters (OCTs), in particular OCT 2. Irradiation of 40 was monitored in the presence of cimetidine, an OCT 2 inhibitor. A new strong absorption band at ca. 354 nm was assigned to an SPtII LMCT band. High resolution mass spectroscopy identified a mass adduct assigned to a novel platinum(II) -cimetidine species. The loss of coordinated pyridine from irradiated 40 as detected by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and the quenching of the azidyl radical by cimetidine were correlated with the observed photo-protective effect in HaCaT keratinocytes cells...|$|E
40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{has emerged}} as a potent novel {{therapeutic}} modality that induces cell death through light-induced activation of photosensitizer. But some photosensitizers have characteristics of poor water-solubility and non-specific tissue distribution. These characteristics become main obstacles of PDT. In this paper, we synthesized a targeting drug delivery system (TDDS) to improve the water-solubility of photosensitizer and enhance the ability of targeted TFR positive tumor cells. TDDS is a transferrin-modified Poly(D,L-Lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) nanoparticle loaded with a photosensitizer hypocrellin A (HA), named TF-HA-CMC-PLGA NPs. Morphology, size distribution, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, encapsulation efficiency, and loading capacity of TF-HA-CMC-PLGA NPs were characterized. In vitro TF-HA-CMC-PLGA NPs presented weak dark cytotoxicity and significant <b>photo-cytotoxicity</b> with strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptotic cancer cell death. In vivo photodynamic antitumor efficacy of TF-HA-CMC-PLGA NPs was investigated with an A 549 (TFR positive) tumor-bearing model in male athymic nude mice. TF-HA-CMC-PLGA NPs caused tumor delay with a remarkable tumor inhibition rate of 63 % for 15 days. Extensive cell apoptosis in tumor tissue and slight side effects in normal organs were observed. The results indicated that TDDS has great potential to enhance PDT therapeutic efficacy...|$|E
40|$|Photosensitizers used in PDT suffer {{degradation}} by light. In this work, photobleaching of Photogem((R)) (PG), Photofrin((R)) (PF), and Photosan((R)) (PS), hematoporphyrin derivatives, were {{induced by}} {{light in the}} presence or absence of 1 % Triton X- 100. The degradation efficiency in the absence of 1 % Triton X- 100 follows the sequence: Pf > PF > Ps, which means that PF presented a greater degradation than PF and PS. Forever, in the presence of the surfactant the degradation efficiency is different: PF congruent to PS > PF. Besides aggregation susceptibility, studies in cell culture (tumor and non tumor cells) and in animals (depth of necrosis) were performed, trying to correlate the stability of these photosensitizers with their photodynamic effect. The results suggest that PF presents higher light induced <b>photo-cytotoxicity</b> than PF and PS for both types of cells. For the depth of necrosis studies, more aggregated photosensitizer showed a longer time to accumulate in liver (30 min for PG, 120 h for PF and 720 h for PS). The, to establish an ideal dosimetry in PDT, one must consider the intrinsic physical chemistry characteristics of the photosensitizer as well as their ability to undergo photobleaching...|$|E
40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a {{non-invasive}} {{treatment of}} cancer with an advantage of having localized photo-activation {{of the drug}} at the targeted tumor cells leaving the healthy cells unaffected by the photo-toxicity of the PDT agent. Organic molecules and 4 d/ 5 d metal complexes have been extensively studied for their DNA cleavage activity and <b>photo-cytotoxicity</b> in UV and/or visible light. The photoactivity of the current PDT drugs is due to reactive singlet oxygen species. To address the hypoxic nature within neoplasia {{and to get a}} realistic scenario to build model and potent PDT agents, attempts have been made in this thesis work to design and synthesize new cobalt and copper complexes having a variety of ancillary ligands and planar phenanthroline bases showing efficient visible light-induced anaerobic plasmid DNA cleavage activity. The disulfide and thiol compounds are known to generate thyil radical in anaerobic medium in presence of some electron donating solvent. To exploit this chemistry of the sulfur anion radical as a reactive species damaging DNA under light irradiation, we have prepared copper(II) complexes of bis(2 -hydroxybenzylamino-ethyl) disulfide and D-penicillaminedisulfide and characterized. The complexes are moderate binders to calf thymus DNA and exhibit plasmid DNA cleavage activity in red light. Near-IR light-induced double-strand DNA cleavage activity is observed for the complexes having 3, 3 ' -dithiodipropionic acid and phenanthroline bases. These complexes show lethal double strand breaks in SC DNA responsible for the inhibition in DNA repair mechanism in the cells thus becoming potent candidates as transcription inhibitors. The work has been extended to achieve better visible light-induced plasmid DNA cleavage activity and UV light-induced photocytotoxicity using a more bio-compatible metal ion, viz. cobalt(II) with the same ligand system and enhancement in the photocytotoxicity is observed. To investigate the role of the disulfide ancillary ligands, complexes of salicylideneaminothiophenol bound to the copper(II) are prepared and the complexes show significant plasmid DNA cleavage activity in red light. Finally, ternary cobalt(III) phenanthroline base complexes are prepared to study their DNA cleavage activity in red light and <b>photo-cytotoxicity</b> in UV light. The complexes show efficient plasmid DNA cleavage activity in red light, significant cytotoxicity in UV light, low dark cytotoxicity, and protein (BSA, lysozyme) cleavage activity in UV light. The mechanistic aspects of the photo-induced DNA and protein cleavage activity of the complexes have been studied. A dual involvement of the charge transfer and d-d band is observed in the photosensitization process leading to generation of reactive oxygen species. In summary, the thesis work presents cobalt and copper complexes having thiolate and disulfide moieties that are designed and synthesized as new photodynamic therapeutic agents showing anaerobic DNA cleavage activity in red light and photocytotoxicity. The present study opens up new strategies for designing and developing cobalt and copper based photosensitizers for their potential photochemotherapeutic applications under hypoxic reaction conditions.

Complexes 2 and 3 display significant and selective <b>photo-cytotoxicity</b> upon irradiation with visible light giving an IC 50 value of about 5 mu M against HeLa and MCF- 7 cancer cells; they are significantly less-toxic against normal 3 T 3 control cells {{and in the absence}} of light.
