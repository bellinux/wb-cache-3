5|$|Downhill it is {{much easier}} to topple over the front wheel because the incline moves the line of mg closer to f. To try to reduce this {{tendency}} the rider can stand back on the <b>pedals</b> to try to keep m as far back as possible.|$|E
5|$|The Futura model gained power {{adjustable}} <b>pedals,</b> {{and side}} airbags, with a DVD entertainment system being offered on upmarket trim levels. The XR8 sedan variant also received the premium audio system.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pedal</b> force {{effectiveness}} in cycling is usually {{measured by the}} ratio of force perpendicular to the crank (effective force) and total force applied to the <b>pedal</b> (resultant force). Most studies measuring <b>pedal</b> forces have been restricted to one leg but {{a few studies have}} reported bilateral asymmetry in <b>pedal</b> forces. <b>Pedal</b> force effectiveness is increased at higher power output and reduced at higher <b>pedaling</b> cadences. Changes in saddle position resulted in unclear effects in <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness, while lowering the upper body reduced <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness. Cycling experience and fatigue had unclear effects on <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness. Augmented feedback of <b>pedal</b> forces can improve <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness within a training session and after multiple sessions for cyclists and non-cyclists. No differences in <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness were evident between summarized and instantaneous feedback. Conversely, economy/efficiency seems to be reduced when cyclists are instructed to improve <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness during acute intervention studies involving one session. Decoupled crank systems effectively improved <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness with conflicting effects on economy/efficiency and performance. <br /...|$|R

5|$|The abbey's next organ {{was built}} in 1836 by John Smith of Bristol, to a {{specification}} of thirty stops over three manuals and <b>pedals.</b> This instrument was rebuilt on a new gallery in the North Transept by William Hill & Son of London in 1868, to a specification of forty stops spread over four manuals and <b>pedals,</b> although the Solo department, which would have brought the total to well over forty, was not completed. It was mostly removed to the Church of St Peter & St Paul, Cromer in 1896, the remainder being kept for incorporation in the new abbey organ.|$|E

5|$|The semi-luxury Futura variant {{was heavily}} {{based on the}} XT, and marketed towards families. Futura models gained cruise control, 16-inch alloy wheels, rear power windows and full {{body-coloured}} side-view mirrors and side-protection moldings. But, side-impact airbags and power adjustable <b>pedals</b> were only available as options.|$|E
5|$|Instrument {{builders}} developed {{other features}} that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and <b>pedals</b> already existed, the first organs with solo stops {{emerged in the}} early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time. Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used mutes to properly blend into chamber music.|$|E

5|$|On that night, Lee maneuvered {{the small}} craft {{out to the}} anchorage. It took two hours to reach his destination, as it was hard work {{manipulating}} the hand-operated controls and foot <b>pedals</b> to propel the submersible into position. Adding to his difficulties was a fairly strong current and the darkness creeping overhead, which made visibility difficult.|$|E
5|$|Smith's early musical {{influences}} {{were his}} mother, and his father, who played guitar. At {{the age of}} four years, Buster was playing the organ with his brother, pianist Boston Smith; Buster played the keys and Boston stepped on the <b>pedals.</b> Soon thereafter, his grandfather gave away the family organ because he believed it would only direct Buster {{to a life of}} sin.|$|E
5|$|The Z-4 was {{designed}} as trainer. Although nearly identical to the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for blind flying training. The four-seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right. Rudder <b>pedals</b> were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight.|$|E
5000|$|On some {{upright pianos}} and lower-quality grand pianos, the middle <b>pedal</b> sustains all {{notes in the}} bass register, {{but this is not}} a true sostenuto <b>pedal.</b> On other uprights, the middle <b>pedal</b> is a {{practice}} <b>pedal</b> (with a locking option), which makes the sound extremely quiet beyond the standard soft <b>pedal.</b> This is often achieved by dropping a felt cloth between the hammers and the strings when the practice <b>pedal</b> is depressed. Not all pianos have a Sostenuto <b>pedal,</b> however. Some older, or modern low-quality uprights do not have this option.|$|R
5000|$|On grand pianos, {{the middle}} <b>pedal</b> is a sostenuto <b>pedal.</b> This <b>pedal</b> keeps raised any damper already raised {{at the moment}} the <b>pedal</b> is depressed. This makes it {{possible}} to sustain selected notes (by depressing the sostenuto <b>pedal</b> before those notes are released) while the player's hands are free to play additional notes (which are not sustained). This can be useful for musical passages with low bass <b>pedal</b> points, in which a bass note is sustained while a series of chords changes over top of it, and other otherwise tricky parts. On many upright pianos, the middle <b>pedal</b> is called the [...] "practice" [...] or celeste <b>pedal.</b> This drops a piece of felt between the hammers and strings, greatly muting the sounds. This <b>pedal</b> can be shifted while depressed, into a [...] "locking" [...] position.|$|R

5|$|The {{first model}} in production, in June 1935, was the Model A. It {{contained}} {{most of the}} features {{that came to be}} standard on all console Hammonds, including two 61-key manuals, a 25-key pedalboard, an expression pedal, 12 reverse-color preset keys, two sets of drawbars for each manual, and one for the <b>pedals.</b>|$|E
5|$|A new organ was {{supplied}} to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and <b>pedals,</b> and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South crossing arches, with the console {{standing on the}} floor next to the north-west pier of the crossing. New cases were to be provided to designs by Brian Oliver of Bath, but were never executed. Norman & Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal.|$|E
5|$|In {{more general}} usage, noise is any {{unwanted}} sound or signal. In this sense, even sounds {{that would be}} perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver. Prevention and reduction of unwanted sound, from tape hiss to squeaking bass drum <b>pedals,</b> is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|E
25|$|The {{chain drive}} {{improved}} comfort and speed, as the drive {{was transferred to}} the non-steering rear wheel and allowed for smooth, relaxed and injury free <b>pedaling</b> (earlier designs that required <b>pedalling</b> the steering front wheel were difficult to <b>pedal</b> while turning, due to the misalignment of rotational planes of leg and <b>pedal).</b> With easier <b>pedaling,</b> the rider more easily turned corners.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, the Fortin {{designed}} flagship 6 channel model 667 {{head was}} announced. Additionally, Randall entered the <b>pedal</b> market with the RG13 1 Watt, 3 channel amp/pedal, the Facepunch overdrive, MOR boost <b>pedal,</b> RGOD preamp <b>pedal</b> and RF8 8 button midi <b>pedal.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pedal</b> steelers {{refer to}} <b>Pedal</b> 8 as the [...] "boo-wah", the [...] "doo-wah", the [...] "splat" [...] <b>pedal</b> or the [...] "ba-room" [...] (bar-room) <b>pedal,</b> {{because of the}} sound the low C string makes when it drops the minor third to A.|$|R
5|$|In the firstpractice session, Hill was fastest {{with a time}} of 1:21.664, twothousands of {{a second}} ahead of {{teammate}} Coulthard. Schumacher was third, with the Ferrari cars of Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger, who had been the leading two for most session, close behind. Blundell in the McLaren was sixth, with teammate Häkkinen finishing the session in 14th position, the Finnish driver complaining of steering problems with the car. The two Ferrari drivers used different pedal layouts in the 412T2 chassis: Berger's car was equipped with two <b>pedals</b> and a hand-operated clutch, whereas Alesi preferred the traditional three-pedal system.|$|E
5|$|Max-Hellmuth Ostermann (11December 1917 – 9August 1942) was a Luftwaffe fighter ace during World War II. A flying ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat. He is credited with 102 enemy aircraft shot down claimed in over 300 combat missions. The majority of his victories were claimed over the Eastern Front with eight claims over the Western Front and one over Belgrade. Ostermann was of such short height that wooden blocks had to be attached to his rudder <b>pedals</b> for him to engage in tight turning aerial combat.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the <b>pedals.</b>|$|E
