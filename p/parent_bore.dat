There was {{very little in the}} way of government funding to cover expenses for skiers wishing to compete on the world stage or to pay for professional training. Recognizing their daughter's gifts, her <b>parents</b> <b>bore</b> the expense for her to spend several winters training in Kitzbühel, Austria. It paid off when she became the first North American Olympic medalist in the downhill in alpine skiing, winning the bronze in 1956 at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. She followed this with a spectacular performance at the 1958 World Championships in Bad Gastein, Austria, where she won both the downhill and the giant slalom and took silver in the combined. Upon her return to Canada a month later, she received tumultuous receptions.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the causes, {{costs and benefits}} of adoption in the altricial lesser kestrel Falco naumanni. Specifically, we tested the intergenerational conflict hy- pothesis, proposed to explain adoption in some birds. Adoptions involved 76 % of the nests and 51 % of the nestlings at a mean age of 25 days (12 days before fledging). Nest-switching nestlings were not in poorer body condition, more parasitized or younger than their siblings, and body condition and prey delivery rates of their parents did not differ from those of other parents. Tn the foster nest, adopted nestlings did not benefit from higher feeding rates or a prolongation of the nestling period. They did not have fewer nest-mates or achieve higher rank within the new brood. Thus, adopted nes- tlings did not improve their body condition and survival. Adult lesser kestrels seemed unable to finely discriminate beween their own and alien chicks. Foster <b>parents</b> <b>bore</b> the cost of an increase of prey delivery rates, although it did not affect their survival or subsequent reproductive performance. Therefore, our results do not support the intergenerational conflict hypothesis, and suggest that adoption in this species is non-adaptive. Traditionally, the lesser kestrel bred in cliffs where movement among nest-sites was restricted. Nowadays, about half of the colonies are in tiled roofs which facilitate nest-switching by nestlings. The high rate of adoptions may thus be explained as reproductive errors associated with the re- cent occupation of a new breeding habitatPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|COMATOSE (CTS) encodes a peroxisomal ATP-binding {{cassette}} transporter required {{not only}} for beta-oxidation of storage lipids during germination and establishment, but also for biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and conversion of indole butyric acid to indole acetic acid. cts mutants exhibited reduced fertilization, which was rescued by genetic complementation, but not by exogenous application of jasmonic acid or indole acetic acid. Reduced fertilization was also observed in thiolase (kat 2 - 1) and peroxisomal acyl-Coenzyme A synthetase mutants (lacs 6 - 1, lacs 7 - 1), indicating a general role for beta-oxidation in fertility. Genetic analysis revealed reduced male transmission of cts alleles and both cts pollen germination and tube growth in vitro were impaired {{in the absence of}} an exogenous carbon source. Aniline blue staining of pollinated pistils demonstrated that pollen tube growth was affected only when both <b>parents</b> <b>bore</b> the cts mutation, indicating that expression of CTS in either male or female tissues was sufficient to support pollen tube growth in vivo. Accordingly, abundant peroxisomes were detected in a range of maternal tissues. Although gamma-aminobutyric acid levels were reduced in flowers of cts mutants, they were unchanged in kat 2 - 1, suggesting that alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid catabolism do not contribute to the reduced fertility phenotype through altered pollen tube targeting. Taken together, our data support an important role for beta-oxidation in fertility in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and suggest that this pathway could play a role in the mobilization of lipids in both pollen and female tissues...|$|R

40|$|RB loss {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as the causative genetic alteration underlying retinoblastoma but it is increasingly evident that other alterations are required for the tumor to develop. Therefore, {{we set out to}} identify additional inheritable susceptibility markers and new potential preventive and therapeutic targets for retinoblastoma. We focused on the p 16 INK 4 A tumor suppressor gene because of its possible role in retinoblastoma pathogenesis and its involvement in predisposition to familial cancer. p 16 INK 4 A expression was analyzed in tumor samples from retinoblastoma patients by immunohistochemistry and in peripheral blood cells from both patients and their parents by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Since promoter methylation is a common mechanism regulating p 16 INK 4 A expression, the methylation status of its promoter was also analyzed in blood samples from patients and their parents by methylation-specific PCR. A downregulation of p 16 INK 4 A was observed in 55 % of retinoblastoma patients. Interestingly, in 56 % of the cases showing p 16 INK 4 A downregulation {{at least one of the}} patients' <b>parents</b> <b>bore</b> the same alteration in blood cells. Analysis of p 16 INK 4 A promoter methylation showed hypermethylation in most patients with p 16 INK 4 A downregulation and in the parents with the same alteration in p 16 INK 4 A expression. The finding that p 16 INK 4 A was downregulated both in patients and their parents suggests that this alteration could be a novel inheritable susceptibility marker to retinoblastoma. The observation that p 16 INK 4 A downregulation seems to be due to its promoter hypermethylation opens the way for the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies using demethylating agents...|$|R

It was happily named Toy Emporium, because one would never have dreamed of according it the familiar and yet pulse-quickening name of toyshop. There was an air of cold splendour and elaborate failure about the wares that were set out in its ample windows; they were the sort of toys that a tired shop-assistant displays and explains at Christmas time to exclamatory <b>parents</b> and <b>bored,</b> silent children. The animal toys looked more like natural history models than the comfortable, sympathetic companions that one would wish, at a certain age, to take to bed with one, and to smuggle into the bath-room. The mechanical toys incessantly did things {{that no one could}} want a toy to do more than a half a dozen times in its lifetime; it was a merciful reflection that in any right-minded nursery the lifetime would certainly be short.|$|R

60|$|They {{were taught}} by the witches {{to go to a}} cross way, and with certain ceremonies to invoke the devil by the name of Antecessor, begging him to carry them off to Blockula, meaning, perhaps, the Brockenberg, in the Hartz forest, a {{mountain}} infamous for being the common scene of witches' meetings, and to which Goethe represents the spirit Mephistopheles as conducting his pupil Faustus. The devil courteously appeared at the call of the children in various forms, but chiefly as a mad Merry-Andrew, with a grey coat, red and blue stockings, a red beard, a high-crowned hat, with linen of various colours wrapt round it, and garters of peculiar length. He set each child on some beast of his providing, and anointed them with a certain unguent composed of the scrapings of altars and the filings of church clocks. There is here a discrepancy of evidence which in another court would have cast the whole. Most of the children considered their journey to be corporeal and actual. Some supposed, however, that their strength or spirit only travelled with the fiend, and that their body remained behind. Very few adopted this last hypothesis, though the <b>parents</b> unanimously <b>bore</b> witness that the bodies of the children remained in bed, and could not be awakened out of a deep sleep, though they shook them for the purpose of awakening them. So strong was, nevertheless, the belief of nurses and mothers in their actual transportation, that a sensible clergyman, mentioned in the preface, who had resolved he would watch his son the whole night and see what hag or fiend would take him from his arms, had the utmost difficulty, notwithstanding, in convincing his mother that the child had not been transported to Blockula during the very night he held him in his embrace.|$|R
60|$|Seeds {{from the}} long-styled oxlip fertilised {{by its own}} pollen were sown, and three long-styled plants raised. The first of these was {{identical}} in every character with its <b>parent.</b> The second <b>bore</b> rather smaller flowers, of a paler colour, almost {{like those of the}} primrose; the scapes were at first single- flowered, but later in the season a tall thick scape, bearing many flowers, like that of the parent oxlip, was thrown up. The third plant likewise produced at first only single-flowered scapes, with the flowers rather small and of a darker yellow; but it perished early. The second plant also died in September; and the first plant, though all three grew under very favourable conditions, looked very sickly. Hence we may infer that seedlings from self-fertilised oxlips would hardly be able to exist in a state of nature. I {{was surprised to find that}} all the pollen-grains in the first of these seedling oxlips appeared sound; and in the second only a moderate number were bad. These two plants, however, had not the power of producing a proper number of seeds; for though left uncovered and surrounded by pure primroses and cowslips, the capsules were estimated to include an average of only from fifteen to twenty seeds.|$|R
40|$|In this study, I {{investigated}} {{the role of}} parental educational expectations in promoting children’s social mobility. I paid attention to Chinese socio-economic developments, the changing social structure and dynamics of social stratification {{as well as the}} development of education from the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Thus, I examined and analysed the changing patterns of parental expectations for their children’s education, factors shaping their construction in this regard and effects of parental educational expectations on their children’s educational attainments along with the aforementioned changes in social contexts. In view of the explorative nature of my study, a reflexive qualitative approach was adopted in the research design. The data were collected through semi-structured life history interviews. Research participants were selected from my home city, Hebi, located in the north of Henan province, China. Participants in my study were classified into three Generations, which represent <b>parents</b> who <b>bore</b> their first child in 1960 - 1979, 1980 - 1989, and 1990 - 2000 respectively and their children. Thematic coding was adopted for data analysis. The findings revealed that, first of all, as it had been generally presumed Chinese parents attached great importance to their children’s education and held high educational expectations. Secondly, besides the influence of Confucian philosophy, Chinese parents predominately grounded their educational expectations in their social contexts and family backgrounds. Thirdly, parents’ educational expectations impacted on children’s educational outcomes mainly through parents’ involvement in their children’s education to make their educational expectations come true. Moreover, I emphasized that children’s educational achievements were determined by an interaction between parental expectations and children’s aspirations regarding education. Thus, I suggest that children’s social mobility is an outcome of the negotiated interaction between parents’ agency, children’s agency, and social, economic and political factors and contexts determining the positioning of people in society. Nevertheless, I maintain that it {{is beyond the scope of}} the current thesis to comment upon the relevance of these research findings beyond the small sample studied. It could serve as the basis for a large-scale study that attempts to examine the situation in China more generally. Finally, I conclude with some policy and practice recommendations regarding the narrowing achievement gap and lessening social fluidity occurring in contemporary China. ...|$|R
