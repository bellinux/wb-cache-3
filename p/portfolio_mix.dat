40|$|Abstract: While {{there has}} been a {{significant}} amount of research on the predictability of traditional asset classes, very {{little is known about the}} predictability of returns emanating from alternative vehicles such as hedge funds. This paper attempts to fill this gap by documenting evidence of predictability in hedge fund returns. Using multi-factor models for the return on nine hedge fund indexes, where the factors are chosen to measure the many dimensions of financial risks (market, volatility, credit and liquidity risks), we find strong evidence of very significant predictability in hedge fund returns. We also find that the benefits in terms of tactical style allocation portfolios are potentially very large. Even more spectacular results are obtained both for an equity-oriented <b>portfolio</b> <b>mixing</b> traditional and alternative investment vehicles, and for a fixed-income oriented <b>portfolio</b> <b>mixing</b> traditional and alternative investment vehicles. These results do not seem to be significantly affected by the presence of reasonably high transaction costs...|$|R

In a monopoly market {{the primary objective}} of a utility is to meet electricity demand within a ‘reasonable’ loss of load probability (LOLP) or energy not served (energy not served (ENS) or expected unserved energy is the expected amount of energy not delivered each year because of scarcities in generating capacities and or shortage in energy supplies) at a minimum cost, whereas in a liberalized electricity market {{the aim is to}} meet demand at a reduced ENS and wholesale electricity price [21]. However, all things being equal supply should always meet demand at the least cost. The generation expansion model for the AIG is built in WASP-IV, which uses three main optimization techniques to find the most optimal <b>portfolio</b> <b>mix</b> for a power system within user defined constraints. Probabilistic estimation is applied to determine system production costs, ENS costs and reliability. Linear programming finds the optimal <b>portfolio</b> <b>mix,</b> which satisfies exogenous constraints on environmental emissions, fuel availability and electricity generation by some plants.

40|$|Merton and Perold (1993) {{offered a}} {{framework}} for determining risk capital in a financial firm based {{on the cost of}} the implicit guarantee the firm provides to the individual financial products sold. Merton and Perold assume the price of such guarantees is observable from the market at large. For an insurer, this may not be a realistic assumption. This paper proposes an insurance-specific framework for determining the cost of those parental guarantees, and utilizing that cost in pricing and <b>portfolio</b> <b>mix</b> evaluation. An insurer’s capital is treated as a shared asset, with the insurance contracts in the portfolio having simultaneous rights to access potentially all that shared capital. By granting underwriting capacity, an insurer’s management team is implicitly issuing a set of capital call options— similar in structure to letters of credit (LOC), except the calls are not for loans but for funding. The paper will (i) discuss the valuation of parental guarantees, beginning with Merton and Perold; (ii) treat insurer capital as a shared asset and explore the dual nature of insurer capital usage; (iii) offer a method for determining insurer capital usage cost; and (iv) demonstrate how this method could be used for product pricing and <b>portfolio</b> <b>mix</b> evaluation using economic value added concepts...|$|E

Immigrants’ and natives’ portfolios are likely to differ in substantial ways due to various economic, social and cultural factors. For example, due to differences in labor market opportunities or risk preferences, immigrants may be more or less likely to own businesses, hold certain types of financial assets or invest in non-owner occupied housing than natives. As such, immigrants and natives might have either responded to or been impacted by the 2008 – 2009 economic shock in different ways. By examining the impact of the recession by group, we may gain insights into whether different approaches to asset accumulation are better or worse suited to withstanding shocks like the Great Recession as different <b>portfolio</b> <b>mixes</b> may have either accentuated or attenuated the economic shock following the downturn.|$|R

We also find that the deregulated all-island system will face major challenges moving into the future since returns to traditional fossil-fuelled plants might not be sufficient to create new (needed) investment when wind penetration is high. electricity/growth/Interconnection/investment/Ireland/returns to investment/wind generation...|$|R

The constraints address collateral and solvency requirements, initial capital, position limits, and other trading constraints that credit swap investors often face in practice. The multimoment formulation accommodates the complex distribution of the portfolio value, which is a nested expectation under risk-neutral and actual probabilities. It also generates computational tractability. Numerical results illustrate the features of optimal portfolios.

40|$|High and {{volatile}} fossil fuel prices, growing concerns over energy {{security and the}} risk of climate change have all contributed to revived interest in nuclear power around the world. This is particularly the case in fast developing ASEAN countries. However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the prospects of nuclear power in terms of its economic viability and associated risks given a highly uncertain future energy industry context. This paper employs a stochastic tool based on the Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess the expected generation costs and risk profiles of different electricity generation portfolios of coal, Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT), and nuclear plants. The tool explicitly incorporates uncertain future fuel and carbon price, and plant capital costs into the analysis. Results from the model enable tradeoffs between expected system generation cost, associated risks and CO 2 emissions among generation portfolios to be identified. In this paper the economics of nuclear power in relation to coal and CCGT are evaluated for different <b>portfolio</b> <b>mixes</b> under a number of scenarios of future fuel and carbon prices {{in the context of the}} ASEAN region.

40|$|The European Union has {{established}} a number of targets regarding energy efficiency, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and CO 2 reductions as the 'GREEN PAPER on Energy Efficiency', the Directive for 'promotion {{of the use of}} bio-fuels or other renewable fuels for transport' or 'Directive of the European Parliament of the Council on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market'. A lot of the according RES and RUE measures are not attractive for investors from an economic point of view. Therefore governments all over the world have to spend public money to promote these technologies/measures to bring them into market. These expenditures have to be adjusted to budget concerns and should be spent most efficiently. Therefore, the spent money has to be dedicated to technologies and efficiency measures with the best yield in CO 2 reduction without wasting money. The core question: "How can public money - for promoting sustainable energy systems - be spent most efficiently to reduce GHG-emissions?" has been well investigated by the European project Invert. In course of this project a simulation tool has been designed to answer this core question. This paper describes the modelling with the Invert simulation tool and shows the key features necessary for simulating the energy system.
