5|$|Brian ends up exercising {{for hours}} {{with the help}} of Stewie, parodying Rocky Balboa in the movie Rocky IV, but realizes his test is only a few hours away. He becomes {{stressed}} at being late for his exam, so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A-Team one last time and drive Brian to his test, which is successful, and Brian arrives on time. He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the dismay of the family, who tells him that he <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> cheated. Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} Inspector General's {{report concluded}} that 1) CREW {{had received the}} emails in July and turned {{them over to the}} FBI within two days; 2) the FBI's decision not to pursue charges against Foley based on the initial emails did not constitute misconduct; but 3) the FBI <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> referred the case to the House Page Board or other authorities based on what they received.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The advertised EC {{policy toward}} sugar is clearly to let market drive supply and demand. But there exist reasons {{to think that}} the setting up of the {{traditional}} quota policy was not a consequence of chance, or of an efficient lobbying system by farmers, but of practical necessity and of efficiency, in face of market failures. In view of this reasoning, it is not impossible that a large crisis in the more or less remote future leads to reinstall a sugar quota system which <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>had</b> to be reformed, but <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> been suppressed...|$|R
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Myles McNutt {{gave the}} episode a C- rating and criticized the episode's lack of complexity. He wrote that, [...] "I would argue, though, that [...] {{part of the}} show’s problem right now" [...] and noted that Tate's performance was expanded [...] "little ... beyond her initial appearance last season." [...] In a review for the subsequent episode, [...] "After Hours", however, McNutt acknowledged that, [...] "If I'm being honest with , last week's <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been above a 'C-,' but I went with my gut and have to stand by that decision." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's final parody is [...] "eBay", {{based on}} [...] "I Want It That Way" [...] by Backstreet Boys. In this song, the narrator {{describes}} {{a variety of}} obscure items that he purchased on the online auction site eBay. Yankovic later noted, [...] "I was going to shoot a video for eBay, but right at the same time, eBay started doing all of these commercials with song parodies. [...] I didn't want my parody to come off as a commercial for eBay. In retrospect, I <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done a video {{because it would have}} been one of my biggest hits." [...] Indeed, the song is one of Yankovic's most popular, and ranks as one of his most-downloaded tracks on digital music outlets.|$|E
6000|$|Leger smiled. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm uncommonly {{glad to hear}} it; and {{in regard}} to the other {{question}} neither of us has any intention of blaming you. So far, we have been a good deal better off than we <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> ever <b>have</b> been in England." ...|$|R

500|$|In 2006, {{members of}} the school's faculty were {{involved}} in controversy surrounding the U.S. Republican Party presidential primaries. On October 9, Dean Hill and Associate Dean W. Steve Albrecht sent an e-mail to 50 BYU Management Society members and 100 {{members of the}} school's National Advisory Council asking them to support Mitt Romney's bid for the U.S. presidency. Hill and Albrecht signed the message with their official BYU titles, sent the e-mail from a BYU e-mail address, and began the message [...] "Dear Marriott School Friend." [...] Both the LDS Church and BYU, as tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations, are prohibited by federal law from endorsing a particular candidate or political party. Albrecht said {{that he should not}} have sent it in his capacity as a BYU dean: [...] "It wasn't something BYU did, it wasn't something I <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done, and it was bad judgment." ...|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{the song}} being an {{original}} as opposed to their traditional covers, McKay said, [...] "If 'Loser Like Me' were a bad song, then it wouldn't matter whether it was original or a cover: we wouldn't be playing it. That the song is good, {{and that it has}} the 'Glee' reach, makes it an easy song to play." [...] Keith Kennedy, program director at WKDD said the single made him ponder why they haven't played Glee songs prior to [...] "Loser Like Me". Kennedy said, [...] "How many times have you heard radio programmers claim that they use sales numbers to shape their stations' playlists? Look at iTunes every Wednesday: Glee often dominates the top 10." [...] Kennedy's station, WKDD, holds a [...] "Glee O'clock" [...] segment daily and he said [...] "While some of the remakes have leaned toward show tunes, several <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> received more airplay." ...|$|E
500|$|Live {{performances}} {{are very important}} to the band. [...] "We love playing live," [...] said Scogin, [...] "That's what this band are all about: playing live shows." [...] This mentality leaked into their recording process: the band's first album was recorded entirely live in one take. Their next two efforts followed more traditional recording sensibilities: [...] "We may go in and [...] this one part," [...] explained Scogin, [...] "but [...] there's lots of stuff we <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> tightened up. [...] But that [...] it feeling like a real record." [...] Despite their attentiveness to the recording process, Scogin has maintained that their focal point is live performances, [...] "...recording records, that's all circled around hopefully bringing more kids to the live show so we can perform for them." [...] The band's shows have built up a reputation; MTV called them [...] "the thing of metalcore legend". When tasked to describe their set on the Scream the Prayer Tour in HM Magazine, Corey Erb wrote: ...|$|E

50|$|Maury Dexter later recalled:The {{film was}} a nice production, but didn’t really come off. It did nothing {{at the box office}} and the critics panned it. Serling, Boone, Forrest and Eden were all play-or-pay contracts, so... Fox {{preferred}} to play instead of paying off the commitments. (<b>Probably</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> thrown good money after bad.) I produced the show, and with due respect to all concerned, the production overshadowed the drama.|$|R
5000|$|Teammate Mario Andretti {{clinched}} the championship at the race. [...] "It was so unfair {{to have a}} tragedy connected with <b>probably</b> what <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been the happiest day of my career", Andretti said, [...] "I couldn't celebrate, but also, I knew that trophy would be with me forever. And I knew also that Ronnie {{would have been happy}} for me".|$|R
500|$|A {{video game}} {{of the same name}} based on the series was created by Radical Entertainment and {{released}} for PlayStation 2 on November 18, 2002, and later on Xbox. Alba and Weatherly voiced their respective characters in the game. Development of the game started before the series was cancelled, and the game was met with mixed to negative reception upon release. Brett Todd of GameSpot gave the game 3.8 out of 10, saying: [...] "Although it's impossible to say whether or not the developers' morale was affected by the cancellation of the series, this third-person action adventure plays like it was cranked out to fulfill a contract" [...] and concluded [...] "the development of this game <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been cancelled {{at the same time as}} the television series". Duke Ferris from Game Revolution gave the game a 'D+', saying that while fans of Dark Angel would enjoy it as it [...] "mirrors an episode of the show almost exactly", anybody else was likely to find it boring.|$|E
500|$|The third {{reason the}} product was brought back was because of a new {{approach}} the company was taking regarding LTO products; instead of putting out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience, it instead would only add a smaller amount of products that have broader market appeal. Chicken Fries were part of that goal, with the re-introduction utilizing a three prong approach: its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact, a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns, and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> thought about before discontinuing. The idea of reintroducing older products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product by allowing a company to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain already which is already established to deliver the product ingredients. The limited-time offers allow chains to bring [...] "new" [...] product the menu without adding permanent complexity to their kitchen operations.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Berman of THEM Anime Reviews {{rated the}} anime {{adaptation}} of Twin Spica {{five out of}} five stars but told readers, [...] "Subtract a star if you don't like anime that have a somewhat slow pace." [...] Berman praised its artistic design and noted that the character designs reminded her of works by Studio Ghibli. She found the characters [...] "likeable" [...] and saw Marika Ukita as the most intriguing character. Despite her praises, Berman noted one weakness in the anime adaptation. She observed the ending as [...] "a rather open-ended one, and while it wasn't a bad ending, they <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> thought of something better". Similar to the manga, the anime series was seen as gender neutral. Sony Pictures Entertainment vice president Todd Miller stated that Twin Spica {{was one of the}} titles aired on Animax which appealed to both genders. The first episode of the drama series aired with a 3.4 percent domestic viewership rating. Reviewers from the Yomiuri Shimbun rated the live-action adaptation an average two out of three stars and ranked it third overall among 11 series airing in summer 2009.|$|E

50|$|Al Jean {{noted that}} when {{characters}} go very off model, {{it can cause}} issues. He noted that some were thrown off by the Marge-on-steroids look and said Marge <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> gotten as muscular as she did. The idea behind the design was that Marge, wanting to never be weak again, ends up overcompensating to become super aggressive and overpowering. Omine said that these things, plus her becoming less likable and off-model, was a negative combination.|$|R
5000|$|Mike Rutherford {{later called}} the album [...] "dodgy", elaborating that [...] "I {{look back at}} it and you know... we made the record, I didn't {{think too much about}} it, but later - I <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> done it. The {{chemistry}} with Carrack and Young was great, then we lost Paul Young and I kind of battled on - with some nice songs. I shouldn't have done it. And the sound on that - I don't like it." ...|$|R
500|$|Walter {{was not a}} holy man, {{although}} he was, as John Gillingham, a historian and biographer of Richard I, says, [...] "one of the most outstanding government ministers in English History". Hugh of Lincoln, a contemporary and later canonised, {{is said to have}} asked forgiveness of God for not having rebuked Walter as often as he <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have.</b> Modern historians tend not to share the older view that Walter was {{the driving force behind the}} administrative changes during Richard's reign, that Richard was uninterested in government, and that he left all decisions in the hands of his ministers, especially Longchamp and Walter. The studies of James Holt and others have shown that Richard was highly involved in government decisions, and that it was more a partnership between the king and his ministers. Walter was, however, very innovative in his approach to government. Walter continued to enjoy the support of Richard's brother John, and it was during John's reign that a number of Walter's administrative reforms took place, although how much royal initiative was behind the innovations is unknown, given John's interest in government and administration.|$|E
500|$|... "My career {{could be}} divided up into two sections: the first being when I was an out-and-out fast bowler and played for England when I {{probably}} {{should not have}} done; and the second being when I slowed down a bit, learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when I <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done. His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut, and his first and last ODIs were played {{less than a month}} apart. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman opined, [...] "his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country, taking 194 wickets, but in 1989, when England were desperate for pace bowlers, his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire". In 1988, when Agnew was selected as a Cricketer of the Year, Wisden recorded this verdict on the contrariness of Agnew's Test career: [...] "Asked about Agnew's omission, the chairman of selectors, P. B. H. May, expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement to make about someone who bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{primary reason}} {{the product was}} brought back was because of a new {{approach}} the company was taking regarding new and limited time offering (LTO) products. [...] Instead of putting out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience, it would only add a smaller amount of products that have broader market appeal. Along with its BK Chicken Fries product, the Big King {{was part of that}} goal, with the reintroduction utilizing a three prong approach: its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact, a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns, and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> thought about before discontinuing. The idea of reintroducing older, possibly discontinued products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product. In many cases the reintroduction allows these companies to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain which is already established to deliver the product ingredients while catering to the public's feelings of nostalgia for these products. The limited-time offers allow chains to bring [...] "new" [...] products to the menu without adding permanent complexity to their kitchen operations. The Chicken Big King was introduced because of an increased spike in demand for chicken-based products, coupled with the success of the Big King's reintroduction.|$|E

2500|$|Campbell is {{involved}} with a side band, The Dirty Knobs. [...] "It's rougher-edged ," [...] Campbell says of the group. [...] "It's slightly over-driven, less polished, lots of Sixties influence: The Kinks, Led Zeppelin, The Animals. It's something I <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done a long time ago, but I didn't 'cause I was {{wrapped up in the}} Heartbreakers." [...] Some Dirty Knobs material has been recorded.|$|E
