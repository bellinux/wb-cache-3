25|$|During the Iraq War, Staff Sergeant Popaditch was {{assigned}} as a tank commander and platoon sergeant. Participating in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, his unit gained fame when it helped topple {{the statue of}} Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square on April 9, 2003. Associated <b>Press</b> <b>photographer</b> Laurent Rebours photographed Popaditch in his tank’s cupola, smoking a cigar with the statue of Saddam looming in the background. The image, which earned him the nickname “The Cigar Marine,” appeared {{on the front pages}} of newspapers around the world to describe the Battle of Baghdad. He would later reveal that his smoking was a celebration of his and his wife's twelfth wedding anniversary as well as victory. Following his return to the United States, he was promoted to gunnery sergeant and volunteered to return to Iraq in 2004.|$|E

Rodriguez was killed outside of the Marriott Hotel in Panama City early on December 21. In June 1990, his family filed a claim for wrongful death against the United States Government. When the Rodriguez claim {{was rejected by the}} US government, in 1992 the Spanish government sent a Note Verbale extending diplomatic protection to Rodriguez and demanding compensation on behalf of his family. However, the US government again rejected the claim, disputing both its liability for warzone deaths in general and whether Rodriguez had been killed by US rather than Panamanian gunfire.|$|E

25|$|Kim Phúc and {{her family}} were {{residents}} of the village of Trang Bang, South Vietnam. On June 8, 1972, South Vietnamese planes dropped a napalm bomb on Trang Bang, which had been attacked and occupied by North Vietnamese forces. Kim Phúc joined a group of civilians and South Vietnamese soldiers who were fleeing from the Caodai Temple {{to the safety of}} South Vietnamese-held positions. A Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilot mistook the group for enemy soldiers and diverted to attack. The bombing killed two of Kim Phúc's cousins and two other villagers. Kim Phúc was badly burned and tore off her burning clothes. Associated <b>Press</b> <b>photographer</b> Nick Ut's photograph of Kim Phúc running naked amid other fleeing villagers, South Vietnamese soldiers and press photographers {{became one of the most}} haunting images of the Vietnam War. In an interview many years later, she recalled she was yelling, Nóng quá, nóng quá ("too hot, too hot") in the picture. New York Times editors were at first hesitant to consider the photo for publication because of the nudity, but eventually approved it. A cropped version of the photo—with the press photographers to the right removed—was featured on the front page of The New York Times the next day. It later earned a Pulitzer Prize and was chosen as the World Press Photo of the Year for 1973.|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, FIT {{officers}} in plain clothes were spotted by a <b>press</b> <b>photographer</b> at {{a protest against}} companies avoiding tax, despite Commander Bob Broadhurst telling a parliamentary committee in May 2009, that only uniformed officers distinguishable by their blue and yellow jackets were involved in gathering intelligence at protests. The Metropolitan Police told The Guardian {{that it was necessary}} to deploy plain-clothed officers to [...] "gather information to provide us with a relevant and up-to-date intelligence picture of what to expect". It {{was the first time that}} FITs are known to have been deployed in plain clothes.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Middlesex {{was awarded}} the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The Pulitzer Board wrote in their report that Middlesex is a [...] "vastly realized, multi-generational novel as highspirited as it is {{intelligent}} [...] [...] [...] Like the masks of Greek drama, Middlesex is equal parts comedy and tragedy, but its real triumph is its emotional abundance, delivered with consummate authority and grace." [...] Eugenides was attending the Prague Writers' Festival when Middlesex won the Pulitzer Prize. When a young Associated <b>Press</b> <b>photographer</b> notified him about winning the award, Eugenides was dubious, noting that [...] "t seemed very unlikely {{that he would be}} the messenger of such news." [...] At the time, Eugenides was with the Canadian author Yann Martel who confirmed the photographer's words after checking on the hotel's computer. A waiter brought champagne to Eugenides, and Greek women started kissing him. When journalists called Eugenides, he declined to take their calls, saying in an interview later that he wanted to [...] "celebrate the moment instead of leaping immediately into the media maelstrom." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} morning, as {{the group}} is leaving town, Deke accepts Glenda's offer, after being fired because of a complaint by a customer regarding a late delivery. [...] Glenda just happens to have prepared a contract, which grants her half of his income. [...] With Tex headlining, they start touring throughout Texas, along two other acts: Susan [...] "Susie" [...] Jessup (Dolores Hart) and a singing trio. [...] As Deke's popularity grows, Glenda devises publicity stunts to leverage it. At one show, she pays two aged woman to criticize him. When they start to argue with young fans, Glenda has a <b>press</b> <b>photographer</b> document the incident. As the tour progresses, Deke and Susan become interested in one another. After playing small venues, the group is hired {{to play in a}} large Amarillo theater on a four-day run. Convinced that it is his ticket to regain fame, Tex accepts Glenda's suggestion to share the bill with Deke, after which she calls reporters of The Dallas Chronicle to write a story on Deke.|$|E
500|$|Two other {{participants}} were profoundly affected. Firstly, Knicks center Darrall Imhoff was branded as {{the player who}} let Chamberlain score 100 on him, although he only played 20 of 48minutes and {{was not on the}} court when it happened. On the other hand, the game immortalized little-used Warriors reserve player Joe Ruklick as the man who gave Chamberlain the 100-point assist. Decades later, The New York Times interviewed Ruklick and found out that he refers to himself as [...] "a walking footnote" [...] of one of basketball's greatest moments. The game also produced the famous picture of Chamberlain sitting on a bench, holding up a paper with a scribbled [...] "100". The photograph was actually a matter of improvisation: when Warriors PR manager Harvey Pollack entered the Warriors locker room, he took a paper and scribbled the number on it, and Associated <b>Press</b> <b>photographer</b> Paul Vathis who was there at the game (not for professional reasons, but rather because he wanted to give his son a treat) took the now-famous photo. Cherry calls it the [...] "ultimate picture" [...] of Wilt Chamberlain.|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, {{opened a}} Michael Jordan exhibit that {{contained}} items from his college and NBA careers, {{as well as}} from the 1992 [...] "Dream Team". The exhibit also has a batting glove to signify Jordan's short career in minor league baseball. After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him. As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, growing up in North Carolina, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels, and greatly admired Thompson, who played at rival North Carolina State. He was inducted into the Hall in September, with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč. Two of Jordan's former coaches, Dean Smith and Doug Collins, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech—when he began to cry—was captured by Associated <b>Press</b> <b>photographer</b> Stephan Savoia and would later become widely shared on social media as the Crying Jordan Internet meme. In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.|$|E
