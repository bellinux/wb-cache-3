5|$|Inside, {{the main}} room is a conference room {{on the main floor}} that {{includes}} a large <b>projection</b> <b>system</b> {{that can be used for}} remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. A painting by John Fery is displayed over the fireplace, which the fireplace was part of the original structure in the conference room. The remainder of the interior of the building has a modern look with glass-enclosed offices surrounding an open common area. Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum of Art is displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the look-out basement. A small meeting room is located above a small portion of the main floor.|$|E
5|$|The four-minute ride uses 85-foot IMAX Dome {{screens and}} Sony Projectors. There are 24 ride cars, each seating eight people, and {{approximately}} 2000 people can ride it per hour. The <b>projection</b> <b>system</b> uses four overlapping Sony SXRD 4K resolution projectors on each dome, using custom-made semi-circular fisheye lenses to project undistorted images {{at a rate}} of 60 frames per second (in comparison, most feature films project at 24 frames per second). The video is projected onto two dome screens which are made of 416 panels (each 4feet by two feet) and are approximately 80feet tall and 85feet wide. The animation in the ride uses computer generated 3D animation rendered by Blur Studio and Reel FX, rather than the traditional 2-D animation seen on The Simpsons and the queue and pre-show of the ride. The animation reference was provided by Film Roman, the animation studio that animates the series. Each car contains 12 speakers and a Dolby 6.1 surround sound, while the domes contain an additional 90 speakers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{possibilities}} of using the LumiTRIX <b>projection</b> <b>systems</b> in outdoor (OOH) advertising.

The second chapter is dedicated to video mapping and LumiTRIX <b>projection</b> <b>systems.</b> The research can be found then in the third chapter. The possibilities of using LumiTRIX <b>projection</b> <b>systems</b> are explored here by means of individual in-depth interviews with representatives of Czech OOH advertising companies. The research proves that LumiTRIX <b>projection</b> <b>systems</b> can be very well used in outdoor advertising.

25|$|A <b>projection</b> <b>system</b> {{with two}} CRTs {{was better than}} three, but still not {{practical}} for a home receiver. Baird continued to consider other solutions. One used a single conventional CRT with the two images displayed in a single frame, with {{the top half of}} the image containing the image for one color and the bottom the other. Lens systems focused on the display were positioned to see only the top or bottom image, passed them through filters, and then recombined them on a screen. There were drawings showing a similar system with three frames. Like many similar efforts from other experimenters, Baird abandoned this approach.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of 1895, {{it became clear that}} the Kinetoscope was going to lose out on one end to {{projected}} motion pictures and, on the other, to a new [...] "peep show" [...] device, the cheap, flip-book-based Mutoscope. In its second year of commercialization, the Kinetoscope operation's profits plummeted by more than 95 percent, to just over $4,000. The Latham brothers and their father, Woodville, had retained the services of former Edison employee Eugene Lauste and then, in April 1895, Dickson himself to develop a film <b>projection</b> <b>system.</b> On May 20, in New York City, the new Eidoloscope was used for the first commercial screening of a motion picture: a boxing match between Young Griffo and Charles Barnett, four or eight minutes long. European inventors, most prominently the LumiÃ¨res and Germany's Skladanowsky brothers, were moving forward with similar systems.|$|E

500|$|The man was Dickson; {{the little}} movie, {{approximately}} three seconds long, is now {{referred to as}} Dickson Greeting. On August 24, three detailed patent applications were filed: the first for a [...] "Kinetographic Camera", the second for the camera as well, and the third for an [...] "Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects". In the first Kinetograph application, Edison stated, [...] "I {{have been able to}} take with a single camera and a tape-film as many as forty-six photographs per second...but I do not wish to limit the scope of my invention to this high rate of speed...since with some subjects a speed as low as thirty pictures per second or even lower is sufficient." [...] Indeed, according to the Library of Congress archive, based on data from a study by historian Charles Musser, Dickson Greeting and at least two other films made with the Kinetograph in 1891 were shot at 30 frames per second or even slower. The Kinetoscope application also included a plan for a stereoscopic film <b>projection</b> <b>system</b> that was apparently abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Crecine was {{instrumental}} in securing the 1996 Summer Olympics for Atlanta. In September 1989 he imagined a grand multimedia presentation for the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The resulting 3-D presentation, developed by the institute's Multimedia Laboratory, provided a [...] "1996" [...] view of Atlanta, complete with digitized graphic models of non-existent facilities overlaid on their proposed sites. More than 40 Georgia Tech computer scientists were recruited to assemble the virtual reality, three-dimensional tour through Olympic venues {{that had not yet}} even been designed. The term [...] "virtual reality" [...] was almost unknown in 1989 when Tech's seven-foot tall, three-screen, 3-D interactive video and laser disc <b>projection</b> <b>system</b> debuted during a meeting of the IOC at San Juan, Puerto Rico. Members of the committee used a trackball and a touch screen to view a dazzling montage of animation, computer graphics, aerial photography, video, and satellite topographical photographs created to depict Atlanta during the Centennial Olympic Games. Many believe the presentation showed the IOC that Atlanta was a major player in its Olympics bid and served to create the foundation for the city's high-tech theme for the Centennial Games.|$|E
500|$|The Kinetoscope {{was also}} gaining notice {{on the other}} side of the Atlantic. In the summer of 1894, it was {{demonstrated}} at 20, boulevard PoissonniÃ¨re in Paris; this was one of the primary inspirations to the LumiÃ¨re brothers, who would go on to develop the first commercially successful movie <b>projection</b> <b>system.</b> On October 17, 1894, the first Kinetoscope parlor outside the United States opened in London. Dissemination of the system proceeded rapidly in Europe, as Edison had left his patents unprotected overseas. The most likely reason was the technology's reliance on a variety of foreign innovations and a consequent belief that patent applications would have little chance of success. An alternative view, however, used to be popular: The 1971 edition of the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, for instance, claims that Edison [...] "apparently thought so little of his invention that he failed to pay the $150 that would have granted him an international copyright [...]" [...] As recently as 2004, Andrew Rausch stated that Edison [...] "balked at a $150 fee for overseas patents" [...] and [...] "saw little commercial value in the Kinetoscope." [...] Given that Edison, as much a businessman as an inventor, spent approximately $24,000 on the system's development and went so far as to build a facility expressly for moviemaking before his U.S. patent was awarded, Rausch's interpretation is not widely shared by present-day scholars. Whatever the cause, two Greek entrepreneurs, George Georgiades and George Tragides, took advantage of the opening. Already successfully operating a pair of London movie parlors with Edison Kinetoscopes, they commissioned English inventor and manufacturer Robert W. Paul to make copies of them. After fulfilling the Georgiadesâ€“Tragides contract, Paul decided to go into the movie business himself, proceeding to make dozens of additional Kinetoscope reproductions. Paul's work would result in a series of important innovations in both camera and exhibition technology. Meanwhile, plans were advancing at the Black Maria to realize Edison's goal of a motion picture system uniting image with sound.|$|E
