5|$|Lactuca sativa is {{a member}} of the Lactuca (lettuce) genus and the Asteraceae (sunflower or aster) family. The species was first {{described}} in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his Species Plantarum. Synonyms for L.sativa include Lactuca scariola var. sativa, L.scariola var. integrata and L.scariola var. integrifolia. L.scariola is itself a synonym for L.serriola, the common wild or <b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce.</b> L.sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce. Lettuce is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to L.serriola, an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in much of the world.|$|E

30|$|A further {{source of}} {{concern is the}} {{potential}} for hybridisation with related species. In fact, many of the sexually compatible species cited in [27] can be found in ruderal habitats in Switzerland [40]. In particular, several of them were detected on the railroads of Ticino (e.g. Brassica oleracea L., Brassica rapa L., Diplotaxis muralis (L.) DC., Diplotaxis tenuifolia (L.) DC., Erucastrum gallicum (Willd.) O.E. Schulz, Raphanus raphanistrum L., Rapistrum rugosum (L.) All.), and often grow sympatrically with oilseed rape [29, 30]. For most of these species, hybridisation frequencies with oilseed rape are very low, but introgression can occur significantly with B. rapa (reviewed in [41]). However, under strong selection pressure such as regular herbicide application on railway infrastructure, a rare hybridisation event may have significant biological consequences. For instance, a previous study on the <b>prickly</b> (wild) <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca serriola L.), an almost completely autogamous species with low hybridisation rates with its cultivated counterpart Lactuca sativa L. (tens of times lower than between oilseed rape and B. rapa), showed that even rare hybridization events could have important consequences on the introgression of conventional and/or GE-traits even in absence of continued hybridization [42]. Railway habitat may act as a catalyst of gene flow from GMHT oilseed rape to its wild relatives. Moreover, B. rapa may act as a bridge for gene flow towards species with low hybridization frequencies with oilseed rape, but that are sexually compatible with B. rapa.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{present the}} results of a {{community}} initiative focused on strengthening physical activity and the consumption of fruits, vegetables and natural water while discouraging the use of highly energetic food and sugary drinks in public schools of Morelos. Methods: A quasi-experimental study with an educational initiative focused on the school community of two primary schools and two junior high schools. Pre- and-post initiative measurements were made. The study took place in the municipality of Yautepec, Morelos, Mexico, in a rural area and an urban area, from August 2010 to July 2011.    Results: Water consumption among school-aged children increased from 15. 1 % to 20. 1 % and soda consumption decreased from 21. 4 % to 13. 2 %. A slight increase in the consumption of fruits and vegetables was also measured (oranges, jicamas, bananas, tomatoes, <b>prickly</b> pear pads, <b>lettuces),</b> that are accessible in the region. It was found that the supply of fresh food is limited and that high energy density foods have an oversupply in both study areas. Physical activity increased with actions such as football and dancing, in accordance with the baseline measurement. No changes were observed in the nutritional condition of school-aged children (n= 150; 13. 3 % with overweight and 7. 3 % with emaciation), or in adults who presented a body mass index higher than normal, 60. 2 % to 88. 4 %. Conclusion: In addition to educational activities, schools need to implement strategies to improve the access and availability of fresh foods while limiting the access of high energy-density foods...|$|R
5000|$|The Obamas {{planted a}} {{vegetable}} garden on the South Lawn of the White House on March 20, 2009. This L-shaped 1100 sq ft garden is located by the mansion’s tennis courts {{and can be}} seen from E street. [...] The plot provides more than 55 varieties of vegetables along with fruits that are incorporated into meals made for the Obama family as well as invited guests. Another portion of the yields are donated to the local soup kitchen and the Food Bank Organization. There are 55 varieties of vegetables grown, including: arugula (rocket), cilantro (coriander), tomatillo, hot peppers, spinach, chard, collards, black kale, berries and lettuce. In addition to the seeds selected to be planted are twenty five heirloom seeds and ten different herbs such as anise hyssop and Thai basil. Former presidents' favorite produce will also be sown such as President Thomas Jefferson’s preferred vegetables “Brown Dutch and Tennis Ball <b>lettuce,</b> <b>Prickly</b> Seed spinach and Savoy cabbage” but beets will not be grown as President Obama does not like them. Along with the vegetable garden a beehive was added near the chef’s kitchen that is overseen by Charlie Brandts, a beekeeper and White House carpenter. Honey collected from the beehives has been used to brew White House Honey Ale. The contributing gardeners responsible for {{the early stages of the}} garden include the First Lady herself, White House Horticulturist Dale Haney, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, a team of chefs, and fifth graders from Bancroft Elementary School in Washington. These twenty-three fifth grader advocates, who have grown a garden at their school, helped with digging up the soil, planting, harvesting, and cooking the crops produced. Project facilitator Michelle Obama has made the vegetable garden a priority by requiring hands on assistance from all the family members. In May 2012, the First Lady published American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America, a book detailing her experiences with the Kitchen Garden and promoting healthy eating.|$|R

50|$|An adult female lays up to 6 egg {{masses in}} soft soil, {{each of which}} can contain 40-200 eggs. The eggs begin {{embryonic}} development the summer they are laid, then enter diapause for the winter, to hatch over period of about two weeks in early summer of the next year. There is one generation per year. The nymphs take about 32 days from hatching to reach adulthood. Their development is well synchronized, and most nymphs transform to winged adults {{during a period of}} just a few days.Differential grasshoppers are polyphagous, eating both grasses and forbs, but experiments have shown that they grow faster if fed forbs. The most favored food plants tend to be Giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), Common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), <b>Prickly</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca serriola).

50|$|The {{most common}} {{vegetables}} used as bitter herbs are horseradish and romaine lettuce. Romaine lettuce is not initially bitter, but becomes {{so after the}} first taste, which is symbolic {{of the experience of}} the Jews in Egypt. Wild or <b>Prickly</b> <b>Lettuce</b> (Lactuca serriola), found in Israel, is a bitter vegetable that fits all descriptions of Chazeret in the Talmud. Other suitable vegetables include endive and charchavinah (variously identified as a vine growing around palms, a type of thistle, or a type of acacia), both of which are mentioned explicitly in the Mishna (Pesachim 2:6). Some Sephardic families use green onions or curly parsley. Although many Jews use Khreyn condiment (a mixture of cooked horseradish, beetroot and sugar) the Code of Jewish Law Shulchan Aruch requires that maror be used as is, that is raw, and not cooked or mixed with salt, vinegar, sugar, lemon, or beets.|$|E
50|$|Lactuca saligna is {{an annual}} herb growing from a taproot to heights between one half and one meter (20-40 inches), and {{occasionally}} taller.

The leaves are {{very long and}} narrow, up to 15 cm (6 inches) long but rarely than one centimeter (0.4 inches) wide, usually with no lobes and no teeth. The top part of the stem is occupied by a narrow inflorescence. The branches may be pressed against the main stem, that is, or they may branch outward. The flower head is up to about 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) wide when open, with rectangular pale yellow ray florets with toothed tips. There are no disc florets. The fruit is a spiny-ribbed dark brown achene (or cypsela) almost a centimeter (0.4 inches) long with a long white pappus.|$|E
50|$|As {{the central}} deity of {{fertility}} and possibly orgiastic rites Min became {{identified by the}} Greeks with the god Pan. One feature of Min worship was the wild <b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce</b> Lactuca virosa and Lactuca serriola {{of which is the}} domestic version Lactuca sativa (lettuce) which has aphrodisiac and opiate qualities and produce latex when cut, possibly identified with semen. He also had connections with Nubia. However, his main centers of worship remained at Coptos and Akhmim (Khemmis).Male deities as vehicles for fertility and potency rose to prevalence at the emergence of widespread agriculture. Male Egyptians would work in agriculture, making bountiful harvests a male-centered occasion. Thus, male gods of virility such as Osiris and Min were more developed during this time. Fertility was not associated with solely women, but with men as well, even increasing the role of the male in childbirth. As a god of male sexual potency, he was honoured during the coronation rites of the New Kingdom, when the Pharaoh was expected to sow his seed — generally thought to have been plant seeds, although there have been controversial suggestions that the Pharaoh was expected to demonstrate that he could ejaculate — and thus ensure the annual flooding of the Nile. At the beginning of the harvest season, his image was taken out of the temple and brought to the fields in the festival of the departure of Min, the Min Festival, when they blessed the harvest, and played games naked in his honour, {{the most important of these}} being the climbing of a huge (tent) pole. This four day festival is evident from the great festivals list at the temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu.|$|E
5000|$|Hieracium ,known by {{the common}} name {{hawkweed}} and classically as hierakion (from ancient Greek ιεράξ, hierax 'hawk'), [...] is a genus of the sunflower (Helianthus) family Asteraceae (or Compositae), and {{closely related to}} dandelion (Taraxacum), chicory (Cichorium), <b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca) and sow thistle (Sonchus),which {{are part of the}} tribe Cichorieae. Hawkweeds, with their 10,000+ recorded species and subspecies, do their part to make Asteraceae the second largest family of flowers.Some botanists group all these species or subspecies into approximately 800 accepted species, while others prefer to accept several thousand species. Since most hawkweeds reproduce exclusively asexually by means of seeds that are genetically identical to their mother plant (apomixis or agamospermy), clones or populations that consist of genetically identical plants are formed and some botanists (especially in UK, Scandinavia and Russia) prefer to accept these clones as good species (arguing {{that it is impossible to}} know how these clones are interrelated) whereas others (mainly in Central Europe and USA) try to group them into a few hundred more broadly defined species. What is here treated as the single genus Hieracium is now treated by most European experts as two different genera, Hieracium and Pilosella, with species such as Hieracium pilosella, Hieracium floribundum and Hieracium aurantiacum referred to the latter genus. Many members of the genus Pilosella reproduce both by stolons (runners like those of strawberries) and by seeds, whereas true Hieracium species reproduce only by seeds. In Pilosella, many individual plants are capable of forming both normal sexual and asexual (apomictic) seeds, whereas individual plants of Hieracium only produce one kind of seeds. Another difference is that all species of Pilosella have leaves with smooth (entire) margins whereas most species of Hieracium have distinctly dentate to deeply cut or divided leaves.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{semi-arid}} {{region of}} south-eastern Australia, {{high levels of}} subsoil boron (B) in alkaline soil can limit production of dryland crops. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the whole plant response to a range of subsoil-extractable B concentrations for a number of crop and weed species common to agricultural areas of South Australia. Specifically, the objectives were to determine (a) the morphological response of the entire root system to high subsoil B and (b) the available B concentrations in subsoil critical for expression of shoot traits commonly used in selection of B tolerance. Barley grass (Hordeum glaucum L.), crop barley (Hordeum vulgare) variety Clipper and breeders’ line VB 9953, fababean (Vicia faba var. Fjiord), Lincoln weed (Diplotaxis tenuifolia L.), <b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca serriola), and evening primrose (Oenothera stricta L.) were grown in sealed PVC cylinders (500 mm deep by 150 mm diam.) containing a sandy soil. The concentration of extractable B in the topsoil (0 – 0. 20 m), considered non-toxic, was 0. 5 mg/kg for all cylinders but a range of B treatments (0. 5, 2. 4, 4. 3, 6. 8, or 12. 2 mg/kg) was applied directly to the subsoil (0. 30 – 0. 50 m). Increasing the concentration of extractable B in the subsoil decreased root dry weight in this region, but did not reduce water use from subsoil by barley grass or evening primrose. The response of the roots in the topsoil and subsequent responses in the shoot also differed among species. Symptoms of B toxicity in shoots of all the species were observed at subsoil-extractable B concentrations of 12. 2 mg/kg and at lower concentrations in some of the crop and weed species. Shoot growth, total water use, and root growth in topsoil of Clipper and Lincoln weed were severely impaired by high subsoil-extractable B, as was topsoil root growth in evening primrose, with the reduction in the weed species being mostly associated with a decrease in taproot dry weight. Barley grass, VB 9953, evening primrose, {{and to a lesser extent}} fababean and <b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce,</b> maintained shoot growth at all subsoil-extractable B concentrations, despite a reduction in subsoil water use by VB 9953. <b>Prickly</b> <b>lettuce</b> and VB 9953 also sustained root growth in the topsoil whilst fababean and barley grass increased root growth in the topsoil in response to high subsoil extractable B. There was no direct relationship between the quantity of B accumulated in shoots and detrimental effects on growth. Furthermore, there appeared to be no direct relationship between water uptake and B uptake since irrespective of the effect of subsoil B on either subsoil or total water use, shoot B concentration increased in all the species/genotypes as subsoil B increased. The degree to which plants were deemed to exhibit tolerance was, therefore, highly dependent upon the trait used for assessment. One suggestion in the current study is that shoot dry matter in B toxic soil can be a consistent parameter for considering varieties for tolerance to B toxicity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{previous}} studies we proposed the plant leaf fatty acid composition, and more precisely the ratio C 18 : 3 /(C 18 : 0 + C 18 : 1 + C 18 : 2) {{as a tool}} to diagnose soil contamination ex situ. These studies led us to normalize this parameter as a biomarker of soil quality using Lactuca sativa growing under controlled conditions as the plant model species. The evaluation of the toxic effects of pollutants is more difficult to grasp in a real and more complex environment. Hence we developed a study to test the hypothesis that plant leaf fatty acid composition could be used also as a reliable tool to diagnose soil contamination in situ. We tested whether Lactuca serriola (<b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce)</b> {{could be used as a}} plant model species for such studies, primarily because it is widely distributed in various European countries and recorded at different habitats, and regarded as an ancestor of the cultivated lettuce L. sativa that was used for ex situ experiments. The results show that the lipid biomarker values were significantly lower in leaves of L. serriola grown on a metallurgic landfill soil than in leaves of plants harvested on surrounding countryside areas. To determine whether the value of the lipid biomarker in L. serriola leaves could be correlated to the soil metal content, we also measured the metal content of the soil corresponding to the rhyzospheric areas from where the <b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce</b> leaves were harvested. The results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) show that the lipid biomarker is negatively correlated with both Ni and Cr content. Moreover, these results show that the lipid biomarker values measured in situ were repeatable from year to year, confirm that this biomarker measured in situ would provide an early indication of a plant's exposure to metal, and could be therefore used to facilitate or strengthen the diagnosis of soil contamination.

40|$|Hybridization and {{introgression}} between {{crops and}} wild relatives may have important evolutionary and ecological consequences such as gene swamping or increased invasiveness. In the present study, we investigated hybridization {{under field conditions}} between crop lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and its wild relative <b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce</b> (L. serriola), two cross-compatible, predominantly autogamous and insect pollinated species. In 2003 and 2004, we estimated the rates of hybridization between L. sativa and L. serriola in close-to-reality field experiments carried out in two locations of Northern Switzerland. Seeds set by the experimental wild plants were collected and sown (44 352 in 2003 and 252 345 in 2004). Progeny was screened morphologically for detecting natural hybrids. Prior to the experiment, specific RAPD markers were used to confirm that morphological characters were reliable for hybrid identification. Hybridization occurred up to the maximal distance tested (40 m), and hybridization rates varied between 0 to 26 %, decreasing with distance. More than 80 % of the wild plants produced at least one hybrid (incidence of hybridization, IH) at 0 m and 1 m. It equaled 4 to 5 % at 40 m. In sympatric crop-wild populations, cross-pollination between cultivated lettuce and its wild relative has {{to be seen as}} the rule rather than the exception for short distances...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{structure}} {{and diversity of}} natural populations of <b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca serriola) were studied using AFLP markers and then compared with {{the diversity of the}} RGC 2 disease resistance gene cluster. Screening of 696 accessions from 41 populations using 319 AFLP markers showed that eastern Turkish and Armenian populations were the most diverse populations and might be located in the origin and center of diversity of L. serriola. Screening 709 accessions using the microsatellite MSATE 6 that is located in the coding region of most RGC 2 homologs detected 366 different haplotypes. Again, the eastern Turkish and Armenian populations had the highest diversities at the RGC 2 cluster. The diversities at the RGC 2 cluster in different populations were significantly correlated with their genomewide diversities. There was significant variation of copy number of RGC 2 homologs in different populations, ranging from 12 to 22 copies per genome. The nucleotide diversities of two conserved lineages (type II) of RGC 2 genes (K and L) were not correlated with diversities calculated using the MSATE 6 or AFLP data. We hypothesize that the high genomewide diversity and diversity of the RGC 2 cluster in eastern Turkish and Armenian populations resulted from high abiotic and biotic stresses in the regions of origin of L. serriola...|$|E

Those weeds produce most of their seeds post-harvest. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the ability of an optical sensor, installed for on-the-go measurement of grain protein concentration, to detect the presence of green plant matter in flowing grain and assess the potential usefulness of this information for mapping weeds at harvest. Spectra of the grain stream were recorded continuously at a rate of 0. 33 Hz during harvest of two spring wheat fields of 1. 9 and 5. 4 ha. All readings were georeferenced using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with 1 m positional accuracy. Chlorophyll of green plant matter was detectable in the red (638 – 710 nm) waveband. Maps of the chlorophyll signal from both fields showed an overall agreement of 78. 1 % with reference maps, one constructed prior to harvest and the other at harvest time, both based on visual evaluations of the three green weed species conducted by experts. Information on weed distributions at harvest may be useful for controlling post-harvest using variable rate technology for herbicide applications...|$|E
40|$|Many {{plant species}} can hybridise and produce fertile offspring. Hybridization between {{cultivated}} species and their wild relatives has raised concerns {{with regard to}} GM crops, as it constitutes a possible route along which the transgene could disperse from crops into related wild species, establish itself in the natural population, and persist under natural conditions. This may cause unintended ecological consequences such as the formation of more invasive weeds and genetic erosion. After crop-wild hybridization, {{the persistence of the}} hybrids and of the crop genes (including the transgenes) in later generations depends on their genetic make-up, which consists of specific combinations of wild and crop genomic segments, and on the environmental conditions. Therefore, knowledge on the dynamics of crop-wild hybridization and introgression using conventional crop varieties is needed as it constitutes the baseline for putting into perspective the effects of transgene introgression under natural conditions.   This study focused on understanding the genetic process of hybridization and introgression from cultivated to wild relative species using cultivated lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and its closest wild relative, <b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce</b> (L. serriola L.) as a crop-wild complex model. Natural populations of <b>prickly</b> <b>lettuce</b> in Europe were tested for the occurrence of crop-wild hybrids using Bayesian-based programmes (Structure, InStruct and NewHybrids) which returned a crop-wild hybrid occurrence of 7 %.   However, the geographical location of the hybrids led to the conclusion that crop-wild hybridization is not the cause of the recent northward spread of L. serriola in Europe. To test for the importance of the crop genomic segments to the performance of lettuce crop-wild hybrids, three hybrid generations were created (F 2 as a selfing generation, and BC 1 and BC 2, backcrossed to the wild genotype to mimick the introgression process) by crossing L. sativa (cv. Dynamite) with L. serriola collected from Eys (the Netherlands). The three populations were genotyped with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism markers for genetic analysis. Because {{of the importance of the}} abiotic stresses as selection factors under natural conditions and the prospective of generating GM crop varieties with enhanced abiotic stress tolerance, the three populations were evaluated for vigour at the rosette stage under greenhouse conditions of non-stress, drought, salinity and nutrient deficiency. The BC 1 population was also evaluated under field conditions at two locations (Wageningen and Sijbekarspel, the Netherlands) for hybrid germination, vigour, survival and reproduction. Based on the location and allelic effect of the QTLs for germination, vigour, survival and reproductive traits in the current lettuce crop-wild cross, genomic regions were suggested where transgenes could be or could not be located in order to mitigate their persistence in crop-wild hybrids through genetic hitchhiking and background selection.   ...|$|E
30|$|One year post fire, offsite colonizers (OC) {{canopy cover}} {{was low and}} did not differ by treatment; year one also had the lowest OC cover of any post-fire year (Figure 4). In years two, three, and four post fire, however, {{moderate}} and high severity plots had significantly greater canopy cover of OC plants than did low severity plots (P < 0.005), and in year three post fire, high severity plots also had significantly greater cover of offsite colonizers than unburned plots (P < 0.001). Over all years on the plots that were not salvage logged, moderate and high severity plots had higher OC cover than unburned, low severity, and high severity seeded plots. Offsite colonizers cover on plots that were salvage logged was not statistically different than plots that were not salvage logged, except on the moderate severity plots, where salvage logging decreased OC cover (P = 0.003) (Table 3). The OC cover differed with year (P < 0.001) and the interaction of year and treatment (P = 0.003), but not with treatment (P = 0.17). High severity, unseeded plots had higher OC cover than low severity and high severity seeded plots (Figure 4). <b>Prickly</b> <b>lettuce,</b> thistles (Cirsium spp. Mill.), and many grasses commonly establish as OC. The OC cover four years after fire increased with greater pre-fire tree density (P = 0.01).|$|E
