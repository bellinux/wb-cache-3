5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, {{but it may also}} be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E
5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E

5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version {{of the problem is that}} we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E

500|$|However, {{development}} proceeded {{slowly through}} the 1980s and early 1990s, {{in part due to}} inadequate planning. One significant <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> limited development is limited road access to the area; Poinciana is surrounded by extensive wetlands and lakes with few arterial roads leading out of the community. In the late 1970s, Polk County built an unrelated road also named [...] "Poinciana Parkway" [...] leading south and the Cypress Parkway was built leading west to Haines City. In 1981, Poinciana Boulevard was extended to US 192 to improve access to I-4 and Kissimmee. In 1998, Pleasant Hill Boulevard was widened to four lanes. In the 2000s, a housing boom led to a huge increase in the town's population, from 13,647 in 2000 to 53,193 in 2010. Since Poinciana is intended to be a bedroom community, improved road access is seen as essential to the community's future; prior to the construction of the Poinciana Parkway, the average commute was 45minutes, which was among the highest commute times for small cities in the US.|$|E

Similar to the bomber-specific August 2007 Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident, this incident took place within the larger environment of declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance" [...] and that [...] "the investigation identified commonalities between the August 2007 Minot incident and this [...] event." [...] In his investigation report, Donald stated that the issues identified by his investigation were [...] "indicative of an overall decline in Air Force nuclear weapons stewardship, a <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been identified but not effectively addressed for over a decade. Both the Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident and the Taiwan misshipment, while different in specifics, have a common origin: the gradual erosion of nuclear standards and a lack of effective oversight by Air Force leadership." ...|$|E

500|$|Generally, StarCraft was {{received}} positively by critics, with many contemporary reviewers noting {{that while the}} game may not have deviated significantly from the status quo of most real-time strategy games, {{it was one of}} the best to have applied the formula. In addition, StarCrafts pioneering use of three distinct, unique and balanced races over two equal sides was praised by critics, with GameSpot commenting that this helped the game to [...] "avoid the <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> plagued every other game in the genre". Many critics also praised the strength of the story accompanying the game, with some reviewers being impressed by how well the story was folded into the gameplay. The game's voice acting in particular was praised; GameSpot later hailed the voice work in the game as one of the ten best in the industry at the time. Equally, the multiplayer aspects of the game were positively received. StarCraft has received multiple awards, including being named as one of the best games of all time by GameSpot, IGN, and Game Informer. According to Blizzard Entertainment StarCraft has won 37 awards, and has received a star on the floor of the Metreon as part of the Walk of Game in San Francisco in early 2006.|$|E
