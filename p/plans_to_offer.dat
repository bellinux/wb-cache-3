This reduces the need to construct new power lines and increases the amount of electric power sent to population centres. Series compensation is based on capacitor technology.

5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events of that meeting are vague, but what is clear was that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV.

ITV had in the same month revealed <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights.

5|$|Finding {{an account}} of a World War II-era Japanese {{military}} and Nazi scientific expedition to the island that sought a way to harness the storms as a weapon, Lara decides to explore a coastal tomb, where she finds {{the remains of a}} samurai general who committed seppuku. It is revealed in a message he left that he led the Queen's Stormguard, the Oni that defend the monastery, and that the Queen's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen's power. Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen, but rather a ritual that transfers the original Sun Queen's soul into a new body; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl's body each time she grew old. The last priestess' suicide had interrupted the ritual, and left the Queen's soul trapped in her old decaying body, and Himiko's spirit has wanted to escape that corpse ever since. Her rage is what's causing the storms on the island. As a descendant of Yamatai, Sam is a viable candidate, and Mathias <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> Sam as a new host in exchange for his freedom. Once the Sun Queen awakens in Sam's body, the storms will subside.|$|E
