For the implementation of the Ryan White HIV/ AIDS Program (RWHAP) Metropolitan (Part A) and State (Part B) programs, HRSA HAB and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborate to ensure the appropriate HIV and AIDS surveillance data are used in determining eligibility and funding allocation amounts. In FY 2017, HRSA used total counts of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed HIV infection non-AIDS and <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever clas- sified as AIDS to calculate funding allocation amounts for eligible jurisdictions. The number of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed HIV infection non-AIDS and the number of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever classified as AIDS are used to determine funding levels for RWHAP Parts A and B. For FY 2017, CDC provided HRSA with data files containing the total number of <b>persons</b> reported <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed HIV infection non-AIDS and the total number of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever classified as AIDS through calendar year 2015 for all jurisdic- tions. The number of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed HIV infection non-AIDS and the number of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever classified as AIDS were added together to arrive at the total number of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed HIV infection non-AIDS and infection ever classified as AIDS for each eligible area: eligible metropolitan area (EMA), transitional grant area (TGA), emerging community (EC), state, and territory.

40|$|<b>Persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) are living longer and therefore {{are more likely to}} suffer significant morbidity due to potentially treatable liver diseases. Liver diseases alone have been shown to have a significant negative effect on one's health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Clinical evidence suggests that <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV and liver disease, a growing number of individuals, may have a poorer HRQOL than <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV who do not have liver disease. Thus, this study examined the multiple components of HRQOL by testing Wilson and Cleary's model in persons with HIV and in <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV and liver disease using structural equation modeling. This secondary analysis used de-identified baseline and medical record review data from a parent study testing interventions to improve medication adherence in <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV (R 01 NR 04749). The Wilson and Cleary model components include: biological/physiological factors (HIV viral load, CD 4 counts), symptom status (Beck Depression Inventory II, Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey [MOS-HIV] mental function), functional status (missed appointments, MOS-HIV physical function), general health perceptions (Perceived burden visual analogue scale, MOS-HIV health transition), and overall QOL (Satisfaction with Life Scale, MOS-HIV overall QOL). Characteristics of the individual and environment were also explored. The Wilson and Cleary (1995) model was found to be useful in linking clinical indicators to patient-related outcomes. The findings provide the foundation for development and future testing of a targeted bio-behavioral nursing intervention to improve HRQOL in <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV and liver disease...|$|R

40|$|Huntington's Disease (HD) is a fatal, {{neurodegenerative}} disease {{for which there}} is no known cure. The thesis describes the impact of Huntington's disease on health-related quality of life and reports the development and validation of the first disease specific questionnaire HDQ-D 2 with established psychometric measurement properties which address the aspects of quality of life considered important to <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> Huntington's disease. Literature review revealed that studies have relied on various generic health and quality of life instruments to measure patient experiences of <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HD. Generic instruments may not capture the reality of <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HD, address its specific aspects and measure its effect on the quality of life of persons sufficiently. A disease specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument may facilitate research into HRQOL in HD. The 40 -item HDQ-D 2 was developed on the basis of experiences of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HD and consequently covers areas of concern which are of particular importance to this group. The development and validation process comprised three stages. In-depth interviews <b>with</b> 31 <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HD generated items for the item selection questionnaire (HDQ-D 1). The 81 -HDQ-D 1 was administered to 313 <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HD in twelve different countries to select 40 items for HDQ-D 2. Following pre-testing and pilot testing, the 40 - item HDQ-D 2 was administered to 261 <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HD for psychometric evaluation and assessment of measurement properties. Qualitative data was analysed systematically and sequentially. Statistical analysis of the HDQ-D 1 and HDQ-D 2 data utilized methods of Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory in triangulation. The 40 -item HDQ-D 2 covers six key aspects of HRQOL of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HD: cognitive, hopes and worries, services, physical and functional, mood state, self and vitality. It is an acceptable, reliable and valid instrument to measure the extent of impact of HD on the quality of life of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> the condition. HDQ-D 2 as an instrument can be used for evaluation as well as for research and practice innovation. HDQ-D 2 has three primary, six specific and an summary index scales. Thirty-eight of its items can be used to calculate six specific profile scores; thirty-five of its items can be used to calculate three primary profile scores; and twenty-one of its items can be used to calculate a summary index score. The primary and specific profile scores are useful for measuring the impact of interventions upon particular areas of HRQOL and the summary index score is relevant for evaluation of the overall effect of interventions on HRQOL. The development of HOQ- 02 provides the option of using psychometrically based patient-generated questionnaires to measure quality of life of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HO. The study contributed to the body of knowledge by designing the first disease specific instrument for measuring health-related quality of life in <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HO. For this reason, this newly developed disease specific HRQOL instrument for <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HO is a unique contribution to patient reported outcomes research and tools.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{albinism}} affects several South Africans, it is a condition that remains deeply misunderstood. Albinism is steeped in myth and false notions, and is perceived by many as a curse and contamination. For years, <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> albinism have been treated with doubt and suspicion. Also in schools and in the wider community, children with albinism are subjected to violence and ridicule. In certain areas on the African continent, including Southern Africa, <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> albinism are killed for the trade in body parts for use as sacramental medicines, or sexually assaulted {{as a result of}} the belief that raping them may offer a cure for HIV/AIDS. All of this highlights the extreme vulnerability of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> albinism, not to mention the many violations of their fundamental rights that follow from the manner in which they are treated. Within the social context that frames the experience of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> albinism, the primary purpose of this study is to highlight some of the pertinent challenges faced by <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> albinism in South Africa which compromise the full enjoyment of their fundamental rights as enshrined in the South African Constitution.

Attributes of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV/AIDS in the State have not been documented. This study was designed to describe the socio-demographic characteristics of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV infection accessing health care in the State. Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study design was used. Patients enrolled in the study were drawn from five health care facilities where antiretroviral clinics were located in the State. A total of 252 <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV/AIDS who were consecutively present over a period of one month in each facility were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Results: Mean age of respondents was 34. 8 ± 1. 2 years, with the highest proportion of 21. 4 % in ages 20 – 24 years.

Background: Community palliative and hospice care in Africa and Botswana were developed for persons with end-stage acquired immune deficiency syndrome and other terminal illnesses being cared for at home. As antiretro viral therapies extend the lives of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> human immune virus/acquired immune deficiency syndromes, there is an increase in the chronic conditions associated with human immune virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Despite a strong demand for care of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> human immune virus/acquired immune deficiency syndromes and other chronic illnesses, little is known about Botswanan community nurses&# 039; capacity to manage community-based end-of-life care for <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> human immune virus/acquired immune deficiency syndromes.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the role of coping on {{caregiver}} burden among a heterogeneous group of caregivers of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Methods: Burden and coping were examined among 176 caregivers of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV. Three styles of coping were examined using a 7 -item scale: active-approach (task), blame–withdrawal (emotion), and distancing (avoidance). Results: A total of 58. 8 % of the caregivers were women. They had a mean age of 42 years; 61. 9 % cohabited <b>with</b> the <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV who had a mean CD 4 count of 401. All three styles of coping were significantly positively correlated with caregiver burden. After controlling for demographic variables and caregiver depression, active-approach coping and distancing coping independently moderated the relationship between perceived severity of HIV-related symptoms (stress) and caregiver burden; however, some caregivers experienced burden even at low levels of stress.

40|$|CANO/ACIO Position {{statement}} on the nursing care of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> cancer pain Background The need for a position {{statement on}} the nursing care of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> cancer pain is derived from CANO/ACIO‟s mission and values. CANO/ACIO„s mission is to lead nursing excellence in cancer control for Canadians. Core values of this organization include promoting evidence-informed practice and knowledge exchange. Quality nursing care of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> cancer pain is {{a high priority for}} oncology nurses because pain is common among cancer patients and is not always well-controlled (Fisher et al., 2010). Cancer pain is experienced by up to 85 % of cancer patients especially in advanced disease (Jahn et al. 2010). Pain may be a consequence of the disease itself and/or associated treatments.

40|$|The growing {{pandemic}} {{of diabetes}} mellitus (DM) {{is continuing to}} spread {{around the world with}} developing countries being most vulnerable. Diabetes mellitus is the direct cause of 5 percent of deaths worldwide at present, with an expected increase of 50 percent in the next 10 years. Diabetes mellitus was virtually unknown in Africa {{at the start of the}} 20 th century but the incidence is expected to increase by 80 percent by 2025. South African estimates indicate that at present there are up to four million people <b>living</b> <b>with</b> DM in South Africa, with an expected rise of 25 percent by 2020. If DM is not adequately controlled, life-threatening complications ensue, resulting in financial, physical and emotional costs both for people <b>living</b> <b>with</b> the condition and for their families. There is also a great financial burden on the state, both directly due to the cost of providing health care and indirectly due to loss of productivity and a reduced tax base. Global initiatives against DM include the Diabetes Strategy for Africa compiled by the International Diabetes Federation and World Health Organization. There are several forms of DM with Type 2 being the most common with an estimated 95 % of cases. Optimal glycaemic control is essential for the management of DM, potentially allowing the course of the disease to be slowed or halted. The previous medical model of management of chronic disease has changed to an empowerment approach where the <b>person</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> the condition is a partner in the management process. This is particularly true of DM where all aspects of life are affected by the condition. During Phase One of this study, a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive, contextual approach was utilized to explore and describe the experiences of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> DM and of diabetes nurse educators who assist them in Nelson Mandela Bay. During Phase Two, a conceptual framework was created and utilized to develop strategies which professional nurses may use in facilitating self-management by <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> DM. <b>Persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> DM experience a definite initial experience on diagnosis of DM but gradually gain an acceptance and acknowledgment of their condition. They have definite views on the concept of self-management and experience both positive and negative factors influencing self-management. They also have definite ideas on how professional nurses may assist them in achieving self-management. These findings were confirmed ii by the experiences of the diabetes nurse educators who formed the second group of participants in this study. The ACE approach to self-management of DM consists of an Action Strategy, a Coordination Strategy and an Education Strategy. The ACE approach makes use of grand and functional strategies implemented on the macro (national), meso (provincial) and micro (local) levels to enable the professional nurse to assist <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> DM to achieve self-management of their condition. Grand strategies need to be implemented on a macro or meso level to enable the professional nurse to function effectively on a micro level. Assisting the patient has to go beyond merely improving knowledge about the condition but has to include individual goal setting as well as problem solving skills and coping strategies as part of a therapeutic relationship between the professional nurse and the <b>person</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> DM. The level of personal responsibility achieved by <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> DM is affected by the memes which they hold regarding their level of health and their ability to address any barriers to self-management which they may experience. Making use of the process of the therapeutic relationship, the professional nurse is able to positively influence the memes held by <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> DM and assist them in achieving a greater level of personal responsibility. The therapeutic relationship is potentially influenced by all three of the strategies described above. This study provides insight into the experiences of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> DM and of the diabetes nurse educators who assist them in Nelson Mandela Bay. Recommendations regarding the implementation of a National Diabetes Policy on a macro level are made, as well as recommendations for nursing practice, education and research. The strategies which were evaluated by an Expert Panel provide a tool for the professional nurse to use while assisting <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> DM by facilitating the growth of personal responsibility leading to self-managemen...|$|R

In community-based health care, the <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) are in their natural environment {{in the context of the}} family and the community. The goals of care are focused around maximizing the <b>person</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> SPMI’s quality of life (Hunt, 2001 : 15 - 16). In South Africa, an integrated package of essential Primary Health Care (PHC) services has been made available to the entire population in order to provide the solid foundation of a single unified health care service (Department of Health, 2000 : 4). The assessment of health care needs of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> SPMI is a dynamic on-going process that is used to collect information, recognise changes, analyse needs and plan health care to provide baseline information to help evaluate the physiological and psychological normality and functional capacity of persons with SPMI (Hunt, 2001 : 100). There is insufficient information from the Department of Health to either satisfy the enquiry of whether the health care needs of <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> SPMI are being met comprehensively or whether the practitioners rendering community-based health care are knowledgeable and comply with PHC norms and standards developed by this Department. The researcher is interested in understanding how the <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> SPMI and their families experience the community-based health care provided by PHC nurses. The purpose of this research study is to develop strategies that would assist the PHC nurses in the selected rural areas of the Eastern Cape to facilitate community-based health care and to render a health care service relevant to the health care needs of the <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> SPMI and their families. To achieve the objective of the study, the research design was based on a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive, contextual research approach. Phase one includes describing and selecting the research population and the sampling process prior to conducting the field work which comprises individual interviews <b>with</b> <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> SPMI and their families as well as PHC nurses. According to Dickoff, James and Weidenbach (1968 : 422) and Chinn and Kramer (1995 : 78), this strategy involves identifying concepts from fieldwork and creating conceptual meaning to provide a foundation for developing strategies to facilitate community-based care for <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> mental illness. Phase two of the research design will focus on development of conceptual framework in order to allow better understanding of the phenomenon of interest, as the major concepts will be simplified by connecting all related concepts together by means of statements. This was done by making use of the themes identified during data analysis and the literature sources used throughout this research process. The evaluation criteria of Chinn and Kramer (2008 : 237 - 248) were used to evaluate the strategies. It is therefore concluded that the researcher succeeded in achieving the purpose of this study because strategies which were understandable, clear, applicable and relevant to the nursing practice have been developed for use by Department of Health and Primary Health Care to facilitate the multifaceted role of the PHC nurses...|$|R

We used multivariable analyses to explore the influence of residing in the targeted states at diagnosis on deaths among <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV after adjustment for demographics and transmission risk. In 2011, the targeted states had a higher HIV diagnosis rate (24. 5 / 100, 000 population) than the US overall (18. 0 / 100, 000) and higher proportions than other regions of individuals diagnosed with HIV who were black, female, younger, and living in suburban and rural areas. Furthermore, the targeted states had lower HIV and AIDS survival proportions (0. 85, 0. 73, respectively) than the US overall (0. 86, 0. 77, respectively) and the highest death rate among <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV of any US region. Regional differences in demographics and transmission risk did not explain the higher death rate among <b>persons</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> HIV in the targeted states indicating that other factors contribute to this disparity. Differences in characteristics and outcomes of individuals with HIV in the targeted states are critical to consider when creating strategies to address HIV in the region, as are other factors identified in previous research to be promi-nent in the region including poverty and stigma...|$|R
