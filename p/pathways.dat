5|$|The central <b>pathways</b> of {{metabolism}} described above, such as glycolysis and the {{citric acid}} cycle, {{are present in}} all three domains of living things and {{were present in the}} last universal common ancestor. This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a methanogen that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The retention of these ancient <b>pathways</b> during later evolution {{may be the result of}} these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with <b>pathways</b> such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first <b>pathways</b> of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic <b>pathways</b> were a part of the ancient RNA world.|$|E
5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic <b>pathways</b> and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic <b>pathways</b> are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
5000|$|The RecOR <b>pathway</b> of RecA loading {{differs from}} the RecFOR <b>pathway</b> in several respects, most notably its {{molecular}} interaction requirements and its ideal DNA substrate. [...] Unlike the RecFOR <b>pathway,</b> the RecOR <b>pathway</b> requires an interaction between RecO and the C-terminus of SSBP. The RecOR <b>pathway</b> also does not need a ssDNA-dsDNA junction to begin loading RecA onto the 3' overhang, whereas the RecFOR <b>pathway</b> typically does to work efficiently. Thus, the RecOR <b>pathway</b> in most conditions is more efficient than the RecFOR <b>pathway</b> in loading RecA.|$|R

5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic <b>pathways</b> have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic <b>pathways</b> become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.|$|E

In many aspects, Neocognitron may {{be regarded as the}} artificial analogue of the parvocellular <b>pathway.</b> It is interesting then to model the magnocellular <b>pathway.</b> In order to achieve rotation invariance for Neocognitron, we propose a neural network model after the magnocellular <b>pathway</b> and expand its roles to include surmising the orientation of the input pattern prior to recognition. With the incorporation of the magnocellular <b>pathway,</b> a basic shift in the original paradigm has taken place. A pattern is now said to be recognized when and only when one of the winners of the magnocellular <b>pathway</b> is validified by the parvocellular <b>pathway.</b> We have implemented the magnocellular <b>pathway</b> coupled with Neocognitron parallel on transputers; our simulation programme is now able to recognize numerals in arbitrary orientation...|$|R

30|$|IPP and DMAPP {{are mainly}} {{synthesized}} via two pathways: the mevalonate (MVA) <b>pathway</b> (Liao et al. 2016) and the non-mevalonate <b>pathway,</b> {{which is also}} known as the 2 -C-methyl-d-erythritol 4 -phosphate (MEP) <b>pathway</b> (Rohmer 1999). The MVA <b>pathway</b> mainly exists in the cytoplasm and peroxisome of eukaryotes, while the MEP <b>pathway</b> exists in most bacteria (Boucher and Doolittle 2000; Lange et al. 2000). In addition, plants harbor the MVA <b>pathway</b> in the cytoplasm to form sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid, and the MEP <b>pathway</b> in plastid to form monoterpenoid, diterpenoid and tetraterpenoid, respectively (Henry et al. 2015; Lichtenthaler 1999; Lichtenthaler et al. 1997).|$|R
5000|$|The {{indirect}} <b>pathway</b> of {{the motor}} circuit is thought to project from the cortex, to the putamen, and to the thalamus and brainstem indirectly by passing through the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). [...] The indirect <b>pathway</b> {{is responsible for the}} termination of movement. The indirect <b>pathway</b> inhibits unwanted movements by simultaneous increase in excitatory input to other GPi and SNr neurons. [...] Similar to the direct <b>pathway,</b> the indirect <b>pathway</b> is regulated by striatal dopamine. D2 dopamine receptors inhibit transmission via the indirect <b>pathway.</b> D2 receptors inhibit striatal neurons in the inhibitory <b>pathway.</b> This inhibitory effect of dopamine on the indirect <b>pathway</b> serves the same function as its excitatory effects in the direct <b>pathway</b> in that it reduces basal ganglia output, leading to the disinhibition of motor neurons.|$|R

5|$|Salicylates are {{excreted}} {{mainly by}} the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all <b>pathways</b> proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation <b>pathways</b> {{concerned with the}} formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic <b>pathways</b> become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination.|$|E

She describes the physiology behind neurological <b>pathways</b> which include webs of neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid <b>pathways</b> {{will be less}} susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes neurological science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid <b>pathways,</b> and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these <b>pathways.</b> She explains that repetition {{is an integral part}} of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals of frequency and intensity. She argues that people in their teenage years and early twenties are more susceptible to persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the temporal lobe, the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as lability.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic <b>pathways,</b> {{in which one}} chemical is transformed {{through a series of}} steps into another chemical, by a sequence of enzymes. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy.

30|$|FA {{patients}} {{have an increased}} risk of developing tumours, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), suggesting that the FA proteins take part in DNA damage repair. Profiling of DNA repair <b>pathway</b> through synthetic lethality mechanism can be applicable as therapeutic approach for FA <b>pathway</b> deficient tumours. There are various DNA repair pathways; base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) in the cell that plays a role when DNA damage occurs, depending upon its type. All FA proteins interact in a common <b>pathway</b> involving in homologous recombination. Loss of one DNA repair <b>pathway</b> may result in hyper-dependence on a second, compensatory DNA repair <b>pathway.</b> For example, cancer cells with a mutated FA <b>pathway</b> may be hyperdependent on the BER, NHEJ or TLS <b>pathway</b> (D'Andrea 2010; Tutt et al. 2001). Therefore, in FA patients, tumours with defect in FA <b>pathway</b> can be treated by inhibiting this second <b>pathway.</b> The idea is to find a drug that can target the second <b>pathway</b> and can effectively kill the cancer cell. For example, FA deficient tumour cells are known to be hypersensitive to the inhibition of CHK 1, particularly when combined with cisplatin therapy (Chen et al. 2009). Moreover, if the FA <b>pathway</b> serves as a backup for some other <b>pathway,</b> inhibition of such a <b>pathway</b> will lead to the activation of the FA <b>pathway</b> and thus be detrimental in FA <b>pathway</b> deficient cells (Evers et al. 2010). For example, Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) is involved in base excision repair, a <b>pathway</b> repairing DNA single-strand breaks (SSB). Loss of PARP 1 leads to the conversion of SSBs to double-strand breaks (DSBs) and increases the demand for HR repair <b>pathway.</b> Utilizing PARP inhibitors may therefore be a successful therapeutic strategy for a subset of AML patients with deficient in HR such as FA deficient <b>pathway</b> or deficient in RAD 51 loci (D'Andrea 2010).|$|R
