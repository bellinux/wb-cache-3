30|$|The {{parameter}} γ, {{representing the}} <b>package</b> <b>density</b> {{of the solid}} between the HEX fins, varies passing from the loose grains configuration to the composite foam. Indeed, for the latter, this parameter is equal to 1.0, since the whole volume can be filled with the foam itself. On the contrary, the packing density of SAPO- 34 grains, assumed as spheres, is not a uniquely defined problem. Indeed, {{it is known that}} the theoretical maximum achievable packing density is about 0.74, but typical values obtained randomly dispersing mono-sized spheres in a confined volume are in the range of 0.64 [42]. Accordingly, the cooling COP was calculated for two loose grains configurations (with γ equal to 0.74 and 0.64) and for five foam configurations (i.e., ZF- 70, ZF- 66, ZF- 60, ZF- 50 and ZF- 40).|$|E
