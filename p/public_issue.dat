On 31 May 1976, a 'People's Assembly' in Dili, selected by Indonesian intelligence, unanimously endorsed an 'Act of Integration', and on 17 July, East Timor officially became the 27th province of the Republic of Indonesia.

[...] "Not only was the war in Europe the burning <b>public</b> <b>issue</b> of the time," [...] Mulvey wrote, [...] "it was of passionate personal importance to Orson Welles...

[...] Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the President's Science Advisory Committee.

To cover the losses, the airline issued a private placement for NOK12 million and a <b>public</b> <b>issue</b> of NOK18 million. The airline retained only a single aircraft in operation until late 1989 and the staff of 50 to 60 employees {{was too much for}} the revenue form a single aircraft to cover. The airline planned to acquire a third aircraft in 1990 and budgeted with a profit of NOK7 million in 1989 and NOK32 million in 1990. Sun Tours filed for bankruptcy in late May 1988. However, Åreskjold stated that the bankruptcy [...] "came at a convenient time" [...] as in the short term Norway Airlines would fly back Sun Tours customers {{at the expense of the}} Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund and that there was a deficit of aircraft on the European charter market. Within a week, Norway Airlines had signed a contract to fly with both aircraft for Britannia Airways out of London Gatwick Airport. A new issue of shares for NOK25 to 30 million took place in June 1988 and the company stated its intent to list itself on the Trondheim Stock Exchange.

40|$|D. Comm. South African {{universities}} (SAUs) will {{be facing}} two main {{challenges in the}} next decade, namely: continuous change and decreasing predictability of the future. The urgency for change in SAUs flows mainly from conditions of turmoil and pressure, which in turn, emanate from <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> as they emerge within the macro-environment of SAUs. Decreasing predictability stems {{to a great extent}} from a lack of foreknowledge of how such emerging macro-environmental <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> will develop, and how they can influence SAUs through the public policy process. Management of SAUs therefore need to rely on crucial intelligence and foreknowledge concerning events, trends and developments of <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> that affect the future strategic viability of their institutions. They also need to rely on an agenda for understanding change as well as a means of marshalling participation in the public policy process, in order to manage <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> impacting on their institutions in a pro-active manner. At the onset four management concepts and processes were emphasised in this study, namely the concept of issues management within a macro-environmental context, issues management from an offensive environmental management perspective, strategy from an issues management perspective, and the concept of strategic change management within an issues management context. A proposed <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> management structure indicating the flow of information and actions within and outside the organisation, and how they could combine in <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> management programmes was also proposed. A macro-environmental perspective of universities in general and SAUs in particular was furthermore presented. It included the nature and function of universities, the history and management of SAUs and <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> impacting on SAUs. The practical aspect of this study was firstly based on an analysis of the different mission statements and mission goals of SAUs. The analysis was done to determine the management mode of management in SAUs; that is, whether management in SAUs operates in a pro-active management mode with regard to <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> in the <b>public</b> policy process. Secondly, models developed by Human & Horwitz (1992) as well as Ashley & Morrison (1995) and Theron (1994) were used to empirically determine the manner in which SAUs cope with change and to analyze the quality of the management of <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> in SAUs respectively. Descriptive data indicated that management in SAUs exhibit a proactive management mode with regard to <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> and a reasonable ability to cope with macro-environmental change. The management of emerging <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> and consequently pro-active change is, however, approached with bland commitment, a lack of strategic orientation and inadequate facilities and skills. It was concluded that, in view of the need in SAUs for a structured means of managing emerging <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> and consequently pro-active change, and in view of issues management constituting such a process, there is relevance for the implementation of issues management programmes in SAUs. In this regard a number of general recommendations were made with respect to managing the dynamic aspects of change, the implementation of strategies, and the implementation of an issues management strategy in SAUs. A framework was furthermore suggested for the implementation of an issues management strategy in SAUs in the belief that this framework, and the overall research reported in this thesis could be of theoretical as well as empirical value for managers in SAU...|$|R
