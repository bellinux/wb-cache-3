The argument is thus made that homochiral stereochemistry may in protein folding provide the unifying basis for its solvent- and sequence-mediated control based on screening of peptide-chain electrostatics Under conflict with folding of the chain due to homochiral stereochemistry.

40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] PU vir CHO, 1987 The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to evaluate and analyse Maaberone against the background of the Northern Sotho Culture so as to determine if it meets with the requirements for a drama of a high literary standard. Maaberone should also be placed within the framework of Northern Sotho literature, but more specifically in Nothern Sotho drama within a given period, and according to determined classification criteria. In conjunction with the specified period and the determined criteria, the stature of G. H. Franz as dramatist can also be ascertained. Research procedure Because Maaberone is a written drama, it cannot be accepted without further evidence that it is modern. Consequently further <b>proofs</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of, or against this conclusion should be sought for, in existing references. To place Maaberone within a determined period context, all the available sources published in the same year, should be consulted. In determining the stature of Maaberone as drama and Franz as dramatist within the framework of Northern Sotho Drama and Northern Sotho Literature, extensive use is made of the classification criteria of Lestrade (1956 : 291), supplemented by other sources. The approach by means of which Maaberone is analysed, is based mainly on the structural analysis model of Levitt (1971) and supported by other references. The effective interweaving and mutual relationships of the action in its totality, will determine the success of the drama. When Maaberone is compared with existing dramas and Northern Sotho Literature in its entirety, {{in the context of the}} year in which it was published, it becomes evident that it belongs to the beginning of the modern period. Because Maaberone is a Northern Sotho Drama written by a White, it cannot be classified within Lestrade's three-fold grouping criteria. Consequently the play finds itself in a "created" category which consists of White dramatists who write in an African language. Should the quantitative and qualitative building material of Maaberone be closely scrutinised, it becomes obvious that it has such a significant infrastructure, that it can be considered as an exceptional drama. The only criticism against it is that the sub-plot sometimes tends to dominate the main plot. Master...|$|R
40|$|AbstractReceptor for {{advanced}} glycation end products (RAGE) is a multiligand {{member of the}} immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules whose repertoire of ligands includes advanced glycation end products (AGEs), amyloid fibrils, amphoterins and S 100 /calgranulins. The overlapping distribution of these ligands and cells overexpressing RAGE results in sustained receptor expression which is magnified via the apparent capacity of ligands to upregulate the receptor. We hypothesize that RAGE-ligand interaction is a propagation factor {{in a range of}} chronic disorders, based on the enhanced accumulation of the ligands in diseased tissues. For example, increased levels of AGEs in diabetes and renal insufficiency, amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer’s disease brain, amphoterin in tumors and S 100 /calgranulins at sites of inflammation have been identified. The engagement of RAGE by its ligands can be considered the ‘first hit’ in a two-stage model, in which the second phase of cellular perturbation is mediated by superimposed accumulation of modified lipoproteins (in atherosclerosis), invading bacterial pathogens, ischemic stress and other factors. Taken together, these ‘two hits’ eventuate in a cellular response with a propensity towards tissue destruction rather than resolution of the offending pathogenic stimulus. Experimental data are cited regarding this hypothesis, though further studies will be required, especially with selective low molecular weight inhibitors of RAGE and RAGE knockout mice, to obtain additional <b>proof</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of our concept...|$|E
40|$|Galectins form {{a family}} of carbohydrate-binding {{proteins}} defined by their affinity for beta-galactosides containing glycoconjugates. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) {{is responsible for the}} specificity of galectins for saccharides. This binding may result in modulated cell proliferation, cell death and cell migration, three processes that are intimately involved in cancer initiation and progression. Galectins can also display protein-protein types of interactions with their binding partners. Certain galectins directly involved in cancer progression seem to be promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat cancer. Indeed, migrating cancer cells resistant to apoptosis still constitute the principal target for the cytotoxic drugs used to treat cancer patients. Reducing the levels of migration in apoptosis-resistant cancer cells can restore certain levels of sensitivity to apoptosis (and so to pro-apoptotic drugs) in restricted-migration cancer cells. Anti-galectin agents can restrict the levels of migration of several types of cancer cell and should therefore be used in association with cytotoxic drugs to combat metastatic cancer. We provide experimental <b>proof</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of this concept. While the present review focuses on various experimental strategies to impair cancer progression by targeting certain types of galectins, it pays particular attention to glioblastomas, which constitute the ultimate level of malignancy in primary brain tumors.

40|$|The common {{practice}} of treating psychiatric conditions with medications is {{justified by the}} belief that mental illnesses {{are the result of}} underlying biological deficits. Genetic research is one avenue of research that is frequently cited as <b>proof</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of this belief; and, in turn, one of the most commonly cited pieces of genetic evidence is the concordance rate for identical twins diagnosed with schizophrenia. When discussing schizophrenia twin studies psychiatrists often report a 45 %- 50 % concordance rate for identical twins, compared to only a 15 % concordance rate for fraternal twins. These numbers which are often cited in psychiatry textbooks, peer reviewed papers, magazine articles, speeches and even newspaper articles are generally considered the most important piece of evidence supporting the biological theory of schizophrenia—and even as evidence that mental illnesses in general are biologically based. Concerning the genetic theory of schizophrenia, the most recent edition of the neuroscience textbook Fundamental Neuroscience by Squire et al. (2003) states, “The most compelling evidence is the 50 % concordance rate for monozygotic twins relative to the 15 % concordance for dizygotic twins ” (Rapp and Bachevalier, 2003, p. 1193). A new book The Gene Illusion, by Jay Joseph shatters the validity of this statement and leaves the most commonly mentioned statistic in psychiatry in tatters. Joseph’s book is an analysis of psychiatric genetic research and covers topics such as the heritability concept, the genetics of IQ, the genetics of criminality, the schizophrenia adoption studies—but his most devastating criticism is of the schizophrenia twin studies (Joseph, 2003). It is hard to find any defense of biological psychiatry that does not mention the schizophrenia twin research.

Thus, {{the development of an}} effective antifilarial strategy has become a global research thrust mandated by the World Health Organization. Nanoparticles of silver endowed with antibacterial potency are known to induce apoptosis in eukaryotic cells. The present study was designed to investigate the possible microfilaricidal efficacy of silver nanoparticles and to establish the validity of apoptotic rationale in antifilarial drug designing. Methods: This report analyzed the effect of nanoparticles of silver as well as gold (size range: 10 &ndash; 15 nm) on the microfilariae of Brugia malayi obtained from the lavage of peritoneal cavities of infected jirds (Meriones unguiculatus). The study included a microfilarial motility assay, a trypan blue exclusion test, a poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase activity study, ethidium bromide/acridine orange differential staining, and transmission, as well as scanning electron microscopic evaluation of ultrastructural changes in microfilariae. Results: The study demonstrates that nanoparticles of silver, but not of gold, elicited significant loss in microfilarial motility. Differential staining of parasites with ethidium bromide and acridine orange, poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase activity in microfilarial lysate, and electron microscopic findings underscored apoptotic death of parasites attributable to nanosilver. In a trypan blue exclusion test, the 50 % lethal dose of nanosilver was measured to be 101. 2 &micro;M, which was higher than the recorded complete inhibitory concentration value (50. 6 &micro;M), thus supporting nanosilver as a potential drug candidate against lymphatic filariasis. Conclusion: The present report provides the first ever conclusive <b>proof</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of apoptosis as a novel stratagem in antifilarial drug designing and nanoscale silver as a valid lead in research on antifilarial therapeutics. The main embargo about the current drug diethylcarbamazine citrate is its empirical use without rationale. Effective microfilaricidal activity of nanosilver at relatively low concentrations as reported in this study, with evidence of the induction of apoptosis in microfilariae, projects nanosilver as a potential drug adjuvant against lymphatic filariasis. The much higher 50 % lethal dose value of nanosilver compared to the complete inhibitory concentration value reported in this study argues in favor of a safe therapeutic window of this agent in its antifilarial efficacy.
