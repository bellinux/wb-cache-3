Channel 4 broadcast the series in November 2011. It was rebroadcast in the UK on More4 in 2012, and on ABC2 in Australia in 2013. Also in 2013, two of the show's participants themselves started making documentary short films and videos about transgender.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with <b>people</b> <b>my</b> age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|In an oral history, Lopez-De La Cruz remembered some {{circumstances}} {{of being a}} female labor organizer. “It was very hard being a woman organizer. Many of our <b>people</b> <b>my</b> age and older were raised with the old customs where the husband rules and the wife obeys… Neighbors in Parlier were for the union, {{but they were not}} taking orders from women.” She suggested reforms to make the union more inclusive to women, for example her “suggestion” to add women to the all male ranch committee of Christian Brothers Wine Company, and her push to end a ban on women pruning, making higher paying work available to women’s crews at the Christian Brothers Wine Company. She also remembered how women took the lead in volunteering for store front picket lines and engaging customers in conversations about the struggle. Aside from being an efficient and passionate organizer, Lopez-De La Cruz is remembered for her incredible wit. Many stories have survived of her ability to invoke humor and justice in situations. For example, after being red bated at a picket line at a Fresno Safeway in the mid 1960s and being asked by a white man “how do you say communists in Spanish?”, she responded “Ustedes Ganaran” (You shall win), and the man went on to passionately shout the phrase while UFW members looked on and laughed.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2013, Cher reflected on how her voice had evolved {{during the course of}} her career, eventually getting stronger and suppler over the years. While she didn't really like it at the beginning, working with vocal coaches had made a significant difference; she stated in the Toronto Sun: [...] "It's so freaky because <b>people</b> <b>my</b> age are having to lose notes and I'm gaining notes, so that's pretty shocking." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Teen Spirit" [...] {{is widely}} {{interpreted}} to be a teen revolution anthem, an interpretation {{reinforced by the}} song's music video. In an interview conducted the day Nevermind was released, Cobain stated the song was about his friends, explaining, [...] "We still feel as if we're teenagers because we don't follow the guidelines of what's expected of us to be adults [...] It also has kind of a teen revolutionary theme." [...] As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the song's meaning.

[...] In an interview with Chun, Guerrero discussed the concept and title, stating [...] "It's just this funny idea I had, {{growing up in the}} city – it's so diverse. The city itself is just down-home, down-to-earth, blue-collar, full of everyday kind of <b>people.</b> <b>My</b> music is along the same lines, just being simple – I just try to be honest in what I do." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{becoming}} {{a model to}} support her acting career, Guillory waited tables at a club. In an interview in 2000, she said about the experience [...] "Supporting my acting habit with waitressing {{was probably the most}} useful thing I've done." [...] During her time as a model, she studied acting at the New World School of the Arts and the Paris Conservatoire, also taking small television and film roles in The Future Lasts a Long Time (1996), The Rules of Engagement (1999), Star! Star! (1999), Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) (2000), The 3 Kings (2000), and Two Days, Nine Lives (2000). During this time, Guillory decided to go on with her acting career because [...] "I was so scared of going to university and being with <b>people</b> <b>my</b> own age again, having been with that tiny little sect of girls in Norfolk whose daddies were farmers and politicians, who didn't trust me and didn't know where I was coming from".|$|E
500|$|Radcliffe {{made his}} film debut in The Tailor of Panama, an American 2001 film based on John le Carré's 1996 spy novel, and a {{moderate}} commercial success. In 2002, {{he made his}} stage debut as a celebrity guest in a West End theatre production of The Play What I Wrote, directed by Kenneth Branaghwho also appeared {{with him in the}} second Harry Potter film. In 2007, he appeared in the film December Boys, an Australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in 2005 and released to theatres in mid-September 2007. Also in 2007, Radcliffe co-starred with Carey Mulligan in My Boy Jack, a television drama film shown on ITV on Remembrance Day. The film received mostly positive reviews, with several critics praising Radcliffe's performance as an 18-year-old who goes missing in action during a battle. Radcliffe stated, [...] "For many <b>people</b> <b>my</b> age, the First World War is just a topic in a history book. But I've always been fascinated by the subject and think it's as relevant today as it ever was." ...|$|E
500|$|Cobain usually wrote lyrics for songs {{minutes before}} {{recording}} them. Cobain said, [...] "When I {{write a song}} the lyrics are the least important subject. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all". Cobain told Spin in 1993 that he [...] "didn't give a flying fuck" [...] what the lyrics on Bleach were about, figuring [...] "Let's just scream some negative lyrics {{and as long as}} they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay", while the lyrics to Nevermind were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to In Utero were [...] "more focused, they're almost built on themes". Cobain didn't write necessarily in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; the songwriter explained, [...] "I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [...] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most <b>people</b> <b>my</b> age are".|$|E

500|$|While {{agency is}} the first of two {{dimensions}} of Dyer's story, the second is allegiance. [...] Dyer became a known in the public eye on the day when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated, and Dyer took her hand while they walked out of the meeting house together. [...] Dyer had a strong affiliation and allegiance to this older woman who shared the secret of her unfortunate birth. [...] Likewise, two decades later she framed her acts as a means to stand by her friends and share in their fate. [...] In the first of two letters of Dyer's that have been preserved, she wrote to the General Court, [...] "if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, so long as I should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these <b>People,</b> <b>my</b> dear Brethren and Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done these two years". [...] Traditional bonds for females were to spouses and children, yet in the Quaker community there were strong spiritual bonds that transcended gender boundaries. [...] Thus the Puritan public found it very unusual that Dyer walked to the gallows hand-in-hand between two male friends, and she was asked if she was not ashamed of doing so. [...] This spiritual closeness of the Quakers was very threatening to the Puritan mindset where allegiance was controlled by the male church members. [...] The Quakers allowed their personal bonds to transgress not only gender lines, but also the boundaries of age and class.|$|E

2500|$|Keaton's {{first major}} hit since 1996 came in 2003's Something's Gotta Give, {{directed}} by Nancy Meyers and co-starring Jack Nicholson. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 66 and 57 respectively, {{were seen as}} bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy. Twentieth Century Fox, the film's original studio, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were {{too old to be}} bankable. Keaton commented about the situation in Ladies' Home Journal: [...] "Let's face it, <b>people</b> <b>my</b> age and Jack's age are much deeper, much more soulful, because they've seen a lot of life. They {{have a great deal of}} passion and hope—why shouldn't they fall in love? Why shouldn't movies show that?" [...] Keaton played a middle-aged playwright who falls in love with her daughter's much older boyfriend. The film was a major success at the box office, grossing US$125million in North America. Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Nicholson and Keaton bring so much experience, knowledge and humor to their characters that the film works in ways the screenplay might not have even hoped for." [...] The following year, Keaton received her fourth Academy Award nomination for her role in the film.|$|E
