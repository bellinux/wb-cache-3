Under these conditions, the electron density will build up, slowly at first where free diffusion is the controlling factor, and then more rapidly as the diffusion is inhibited by the building up of a <b>positive</b> ion <b>space</b> <b>charge.</b> The density build-up with <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> is much more rapid than the density build-up without <b>space</b> <b>charge.</b> The controlling factor, therefore, will be the density build-up with free dif-fusion to a point where <b>positive</b> ion <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> becomes appreciable.

The exact {{mechanism for the}} observed close relationship between global geomagnetic field and the tropospheric weather patterns is not clear. In this paper a universal theory of atmospheric eddy dynamics is presented which shows that the global geomagnetic field, atmospheric electric field and weather systems are manifestations of a semi permanent scale invariant hierarchical atmospheric eddy continuum. Quantitative equations are derived {{to show that the}} full continuum of atmospheric eddies exist as a unified whole and originate from buoyant energy supply from frictional turbulence at the planetary surface. Large eddy growth occurs from turbulence scale by the universal period doubling route to chaos. The turbulent eddies are carried upwards on the large eddy envelopes and vertical mixing occurs by the turbulent eddy fluctuations resulting in downward transport of negative <b>space</b> <b>charges</b> from higher levels and simultaneous upward transport of <b>positive</b> <b>space</b> <b>charges</b> from surface levels. The eddy circulations therefore generate a large-scale vertical aerosol current, which is of the correct sign and magnitude to generate the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field.

40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves [57]- 61. ix, 63, A- 2, B- 2 l illusThe {{problem of}} {{electrical}} charges on raindrops from non-thunderstorm clouds is investigated. Measurements of raindrop charges, precipitation currents and <b>space</b> <b>charges</b> made {{in various parts}} of the world indicate that on the average positive charges prevail on raindrops. To explain rain charges, a well known hypothesis requires the melting of snow. In Hawaii, however, rain often forms by condensation and coalescence without ice or snow in the upper portions of the cloud. Yet raindrop charges do not differ from charges measured in other type s of rain. Measurements of charges on Hawaiian rain are discussed together with observations of electric field and condensation nuclei profiles. It was found that positive charges are of the order of 10 ^- 4 esu. A correlation of these charges with wind speed was found. Electric fields in rain clouds are generally positive except at the lower cloud boundary where negative fields of up to - 1000 V/m exist. Several thunderstorm theories are discussed and their applicability to the warm rain mechanism is examined. A new hypothesis is necessary to explain the observed electrical features of warm rain. A theory based on influence is presented and formulated. Due to low electrical conductivity inside the cloud, <b>positive</b> <b>space</b> <b>charges</b> form in the upper:. part of the cloud and negative in the lower, influenced by an impressed conduction current from above the cloud. These <b>space</b> <b>charges</b> diffuse to the raindrops. Considering a coalescence mechanism for drop growth, the residence time of raindrops in the negative <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> area is much smaller than the corresponding time in the positive area, and so the drops usually leave the cloud with a positive charge. Numerical solutions to drop charges and electric field profiles using a realistic cloud model were obtained through the use of digital computer techniques.

40|$|It {{was found}} by early workers in {{atmospheric}} electricity that, during conditions of steady rain, when the potential gradient at the ground was negative the potential gradient {{at the top of}} a high mast was occasionally positive. This indicated the presence of negative <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> in the layer between the two measurements. To farther investigate this effect simultaneous recordings were taken of the potential gradient and the precipitation current at the top and bottom of the mast, 21 metres high, situated in a field adjacent to Durham Observatory. Large differences in the values of the precipitation currents at the two levels were found. Due to the concentration of the lines of force on the earthed mast, and so on the upper shielded collector, laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the charging effects caused when drops splash in a region of high potential gradient. It was found that the differences between the currents could be accounted for by the splashing of drops on the edges of the upper collector. As there is no obvious way of correcting for this effect it would appear that the shielded rain collector of the design used in the present work is unsuitable for measuring the precipitation current in regions of high potential gradient and even in other regions, the recorded currents must be considered with caution. Also drops were found to release negative charge to the air in regions of aero potential gradient. The actual reversal of sign of potential gradient between the top and bottom of the mast was only observed tor a number of very short periods, the longest being 4 ½ minutes, during low potential gradients. But on the majority of recordings the potential gradients did indicate the presence of excess of negative <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> in the layer below the top of the meat, although on occasions the <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> was <b>positive.</b> The <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> was of the same sign, and varied in the same sense, as the potential gradient recorded at the ground.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this paper is to cross-correlate the {{information}} obtained by <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> distribution analysis and electroluminescence (EL) detection in cross-linked polyethylene samples submitted to dc fields, with the objective to make a link between <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> phenomena and energy release as revealed by the detection of visible photons. <b>Space</b> <b>charge</b> measurements carried out at different field levels by the pulsed electro-acoustic method show the presence of a low-field threshold, close to 15 - 20 kV mm- 1, above which considerable <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> begins to accumulate in the insulation. Charges are seen to cross the insulation thickness through a packet-like behaviour at higher fields, starting at about 60 - 70 kV mm- 1. EL measurements show the existence of two distinct thresholds, one related to the continuous excitation of EL under voltage, the other being transient EL detected upon specimen short circuit. The former occurs at values of field corresponding to charge packet formation and the latter to the onset of <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> accumulation. The correspondence between pertinent values of the electric field obtained through <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> and EL analyses provides support for the existence of degradation thresholds in insulating materials. Special emphasis is given to the relationship between charge packet formation and propagation, and EL. Although the two phenomena are observed in the same field range, it is found that the onset of continuous EL follows the formation at the electrodes of <b>positive</b> and negative <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> regions that extend into the bulk prior to the propagation of charge packets. Charge recombination appears to be the excitation process of EL since oppositely charged domains meet in the material bulk. To gain an insight into specific light-excitation processes associated with charge packet propagation, EL has been recorded for several hours under fields at which charge packet dynamics were evidenced. It is shown that current and luminescence oscillations are detected during charge packet propagation, and that they are in phase. The mechanisms underlying EL and charge packets are further considered on the basis of these results.

40|$|The {{electrostatic}} precipitator {{has been widely}} used {{for many years in}} the electricity supply industry to remove particles from a gas stream. The collection of particles in an {{electrostatic precipitator}} is adversely affected if the resistivity of the particles is high. Attempts to overcome this problem have been made by: flue gas conditioning, operating at high and low temperatures, modifying the shape of the applied voltage. This project is limited to the investigation of the last method. Effects of negative pulsed voltage on the characteristics of corona discharge in clean atmosphere are investigated when the laboratory scale electrode system is clean with collector electrode in clean and contaminated conditions respectively. Fundamental characteristics of clean electrode system are investigated to check whether there is any difference in the discharge mechanism under negative pulsed and negative D. C. voltages. From the measurement of the light intensity emitted from the discharge electrode, the ionisation activities in the high field strength region are interpreted both in the forms of average corona current and the temporal development and movement of ions and electrons. Linear relat ionship is found to exist between the average photon current and the average corona current under both negative D. C, and pulsed voltages. When the average photon current is the same, the discharge patterns are similar for both kinds of voltage. The collisions of highly energised ions with neutral gas molecules give rise to the phenomenon which is known as Electrical Wind is studied. Experimental evidence of these characteristics coupled with a theoretical study of corona discharge indicate that within the frequency range of 13 Hz - 150 Hz the discharge mechanism is the same for both voltages, and the instantaneous properties of the corona current pulse are affected by the accumulation of negative and <b>positive</b> <b>space</b> <b>charges</b> in the neighbourhood of the discharge electrode. Sparking mode is studied with a multiple-point electrode and the results are compared with that obtained with a single point electrode to check the role of negative streamers in forming the complete breakdown. Sparkover voltage is measured when the electrode system is energised by negative D. C. voltage and is compared with that which is obtained with pulsed voltage. The characteristics of the electrode system are changed when the anode plane is covered with a layer of highresistivity, porous material which is used to simulate the contamination condition. The sparkover voltage of the system is drastically reduced by the local gas discharge which takes place in the contaminant. In order to explain the change of sparkover voltage with pulsed energisation, some important properties of the discharge are studied, such as: the distribution of surface charge which accumulates on the layer, the conduction of current and the electrical breakdown in the contaminant, the effect of surface potential gradient on the formation of a stable back discharge. These features are summarised in a proposed mechanism of the formation of back corona discharge. This is extended to explain an increase in sparkover voltage when the system is energised with pulsed voltage in comparison to that with negative D. C. voltage...|$|R

In case of a positive ion beam the <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> of the confined electrons causes compensation of the ion beam <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> forces.

A <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> develops a potential that slows the carriers down. For example, an electron approaching a cloud of other electrons will slow down due to the repulsive force. The slowing carriers also increases the <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> density and resulting potential. In addition, the potential developed by the <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> can {{reduce the number of}} carriers emitted. When the <b>space</b> <b>charge</b> limits the current, the random arrivals of the carriers are smoothed out; the reduced variation results in less shot noise.|$|R
