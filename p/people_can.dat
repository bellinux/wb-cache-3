5|$|In {{cultural}} terms, telecommunication {{has increased}} the public's ability to access music and film. With television, <b>people</b> <b>can</b> watch films they have not seen before {{in their own home}} without having to travel to the video store or cinema. With radio and the Internet, <b>people</b> <b>can</b> listen to music they have not heard before without having to travel to the music store.|$|E
5|$|Availability of {{substitute}} goods: The {{more and}} closer the substitutes available, {{the higher the}} elasticity is likely to be, as <b>people</b> <b>can</b> easily switch from one good to another if an even minor price change is made; There is a strong substitution effect. If no close substitutes are available, the substitution effect will be small and the demand inelastic.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its high}} salt concentration, the lake water is unusually dense, and most <b>people</b> <b>can</b> float more easily than in other bodies of water, {{particularly}} in Gunnison Bay, the saltier north arm of the lake.|$|E
25|$|War and {{conflict}} between different <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> hinder intermarriage between them.|$|R

5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{are also used}} within China to write non-Han languages. The largest non-Han group in China, the Zhuang, have for over 1300 years used Chinese characters. Despite both the introduction of an official alphabetic script in 1957 and lack of a corresponding official set of Chinese characters, more Zhuang <b>people</b> <b>can</b> read the Zhuang logograms than the alphabetic script.|$|E
5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of <b>people</b> <b>can</b> correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Judicial {{independence}} is essential. It would be futile {{for people to}} approach the courts for adjudication of their disputes if the courts do not apply the law independently. Moreover, <b>people</b> <b>can</b> only be guided by the law if judges apply it correctly.|$|E

5|$|Maurice's natural {{goodness}} never wavers in the story. Unlike Shelley's Frankenstein, {{which suggests}} that environment determines a person's morality, Maurice assumes that <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be innately good. Maurice even forgives Dame Smithson, who stole him from his nurse. The story aims to generate sympathy in its readers. In contrast with other children's stories of its day, it lacks didacticism and draws no clear distinctions between virtue and vice.|$|E
5|$|Monitoring of {{the volcano}} and {{predictions}} of large eruptions are particularly important because of its location in a densely populated area, {{with the city of}} Kagoshima's 680,000 residents just a few kilometers from the volcano. The city conducts regular evacuation drills, and a number of shelters have been built where <b>people</b> <b>can</b> take refuge from falling volcanic debris.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>people</b> <b>can</b> only {{judge of}} things by the {{experiences}} of ordinary life, but phenomena {{outside the scope of}} this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.|$|E
30|$|Connecting strokes {{refer to}} how the letters {{composing}} words are connected to each other. These are dichotomized into not connected (refers to <b>people</b> that <b>can</b> hardly adapt to change), medium connectivity (refers to <b>people</b> who <b>can</b> adapt to change as well as like changing environments), and connected letters (refers to <b>people</b> who <b>can</b> quickly adapt to change).|$|R

50|$|Punan {{are mostly}} found around Bintulu, Sarawak. Punan <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> only {{be found at}} Pandan, Jelalong and Kakus in Bintulu Division; along the Rajang River, their longhouses dotted areas {{spanning}} from Merit District to lower Belaga town.|$|R
5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} tests (NAATs), direct fluorescein tests (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are highly}} sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present. Serology testing for antibodies {{is not as}} useful since {{the presence of the}} microorganisms in healthy <b>people</b> <b>can</b> confound interpreting the antibody titer levels, although antibody levels can indicate whether an infection is recent or long-term.|$|E
5|$|<b>People</b> <b>can</b> {{be exposed}} to indium in the {{workplace}} by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.|$|E
5|$|While Smith {{tends to}} write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a {{collaborative}} effort. The song writing starts with Smith on the piano or acoustic guitar where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full 'Editors song'. Smith {{has said that he}} purposely makes the lyrics ambiguous so <b>people</b> <b>can</b> draw their own conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the strong}} {{influence}} of Hong Kong soap operas, Guangdong provincial television programs and Cantonese pop songs, many young Chaoshan <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> understand {{quite a lot of}} Cantonese even if they cannot speak it in certain degrees of fluency.|$|R
25|$|Historians draw a sharp {{distinction}} between prehistory and history, with history {{defined by the}} advent of writing. The cave paintings and petroglyphs of prehistoric <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> be considered precursors of writing, {{but they are not}} considered true writing because they did not represent language directly.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{implications}} of Hegel’s Philosophy of World History with respect to colonialism. For Hegel, freedom can be recognized and practised only in classical, Christian and modern Europe; therefore, the world’s other <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> acquire freedom only if Europeans impose their civilization upon them. Although this imposition denies freedom to colonized peoples, this denial is legitimate for Hegel {{because it is the}} sole condition on which these <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> gain freedom in the longer term. The article then considers whether Hegel’s basic account of freedom can be extricated from his Eurocentric and pro-colonialist interpretation of the course of history. The article argues that matters are more complicated because that interpretation has significant connections with Hegel’s conception of freedom as self-determination...|$|R
5|$|Zemus is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of the game. He wishes to destroy the human race so that his <b>people</b> <b>can</b> populate the earth. He uses Golbez to do this by controlling him and Kain with his psychic powers to activate the Giant of Babil, a huge machine created {{to carry out the}} genocide.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of <b>people</b> <b>can</b> have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
50|$|The {{organization}} {{is named after}} the Mexica (a.k.a. Aztec) civilization. This civilization {{is seen as the}} best chance from which the continent's indigenous-descent <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> reconstruct themselves as a nation, similar to the way that modern Italians unified their nation under Roman-Italic identity and the Tuscan dialect.|$|R
25|$|A major {{advantage}} {{to open source}} code is the ability {{for a variety of}} different people to edit and fix problems and errors that have occurred.

5|$|During {{the final}} stages, {{the patient is}} {{completely}} dependent upon caregivers. Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, <b>people</b> <b>can</b> often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately {{not be able to}} perform even the simplest tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates {{to the point where they}} are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.|$|E
5|$|Hawaii did {{not allow}} {{same-sex}} marriages or civil unions, but two unmarried <b>people</b> <b>can</b> register for a reciprocal beneficiary relationship, which {{provides some of the}} rights and benefits that come with marriage. The bill was written to become law on January 1, 2010, would allow all couples to obtain rights equal to those of married couples, and make Hawaii the only state in the Western United States to allow civil unions instead of domestic partnerships.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Serbia it was {{believed}} that ale who interact with <b>people</b> <b>can</b> metamorphose into humans or animals, after which their true selves can be seen only by so-called šestaci– men with six fingers on both hands and six toes on both feet– though human-looking ale cause houses to shake when they enter. By a belief recorded in the Homolje region, ale that charge to the Moon also display shapeshifting abilities: they repeatedly shift from their basic shape of two-headed snakes to six-fingered men who hold iron pitchforks, black young bulls, big boars, or black wolves, and back.|$|E
50|$|To sum it up, {{the history}} of Latin and Romance-speaking <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> hardly be {{described}} by a binary branching pattern; therefore, one may argue that any attempt to fit the Romance languages into a tree structure is inherently flawed. In this regard, the genealogical structure of languages forms a typical linkage.|$|R
