40|$|An {{equilibrium}} model {{driven by}} climatic parameters, the Siberian Vegetation Model, {{was used to}} estimate changes in the <b>phytomass</b> of Siberian vegetation under climate change scenarios (CO 2 doubling) from four general circulation models (GCM’s) of the atmosphere. Ecosystems were classified using a three-dimensional climatic ordination of growing degree days (above a 5 °C threshold), Budyko’s dryness index (based on radiation balance and annual precipitation), and Conrad’s continentality index. <b>Phytomass</b> density was estimated using published data of Bazilevich covering all vegetation zones in Siberia. Under current climate, total <b>phytomass</b> of Siberia {{is estimated to be}} 74. 1 ± 2. 0 Pg. Note that this estimate is based on the current forested percentage in each vegetation class compiled from forest inventory data. Moderate warming associated with the GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) and OSU (Oregon State Univ.) projections resulted in a 23 – 26 % increase in <b>phytomass</b> (to 91. 3 ± 2. 1 Pg and 93. 6 ± 2. 4 Pg, respectively), primarily due to an increase in the productive Southern Taiga and Subtaiga classes. Greater warming associated with the GFDL (General Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) and UKMO (United Kingdom Meteorological Office) projections resulted in a small 3 – 7 % increase in <b>phytomass</b> (to 76. 6 ± 1. 3 Pg and 79. 6 ± 1. 2 Pg, respectively). A major component of predicted changes using GFDL and UKMO is the introduction of a vast Temperate Forest-Steppe class covering nearly 40 % of the area of Siberia, at the expense of Taiga; with current climate, this vegetation class is nearly non-existent in Siberia. In addition, Subboreal Forest-Steppe <b>phytomass</b> doubles with all GCM predictions. In all four climate change scenarios, the predicted <b>phytomass</b> stock of all colder, northern classes is reduced considerably (viz., Tundra, Forest-Tundra, Northern Taiga, and Middle Taiga). <b>Phytomass</b> in Subtaiga increases greatly with all scenarios, from a doubling with GFDL to quadrupling with OSU and GISS. Overall, <b>phytomass</b> of the Taiga biome (Northern, Middle, Southern, and Subtaiga) increased 15 % in the moderate OSU and GISS scenarios and decreased by a third in the warmer UKMO and GFDL projections.

The higher average values of above ground <b>phytomass</b> as well as RSS were achieved on the Troubsko location where the above ground <b>phytomass</b> was 19. 57 t. ha− 1 and RSS was 2. 71 nanofarad (nF). The impact of the variety was highly statistically significant only in respect to RSS. The effect of variety on the alfalfa above ground <b>phytomass</b> was not proven. The higher average RSS values were reached by the Hodonínka variety (2. 59 nF). The effect of the plant spacing on both the above ground <b>phytomass</b> and the RSS values was highly statistically significant. The higher average above ground <b>phytomass</b> was achieved when the 25 × 25 [*]cm plant spacing was employed (18. 64 t. ha− 1). As for the RSS value, the case was exactly opposite – the higher average value was reached when the plant spacing was 50 × 50 [*]cm (2. 99 nF). The impact of the cut number on both the above ground <b>phytomass</b> and the RSS was highly statistically significant. The highest average above ground <b>phytomass</b> and root system size were measured in the third cut. The above ground <b>phytomass</b> was 30. 36 t. ha‑ 1 and RSS was 3. 86 nF...|$|E
30|$|All {{the past}} {{attempts}} have depended on supplementing the <b>phytomass</b> with large proportions of animal manure, especially cow dung [13],[15],[18],[19]. This has two major disadvantages. First {{is that to}} process the very large quantities of <b>phytomass</b> that are available, equally large quantities of animal manure shall be needed. But {{it is not easy}} to find so much manure because of numerous competitive uses already in existence [20],[21]. The second major disadvantage is that, unlike waste <b>phytomass,</b> animal manure is not available free of cost [21]. Hence dependence on animal manure makes the process economics highly unfavorable.|$|E
40|$|Aggregated {{estimates}} {{of the dynamics of}} <b>phytomass</b> and Net Primary Production (NPP) of Russian forests are presented for the period 1961 - 1998. The calculations for 1990 are based on detailed inventories, using data from the State Forest Account by ecoregions, available results of measurements and reference data on the productivity of forests which have been accumulated in Russia during the last decades. For 1990, the total amount of <b>phytomass</b> in forest ecosystems is estimated to be 66450 Tg (= 10 ^ 12 g) dry matter, or 32862 Tg C. Of the total amount of <b>phytomass</b> carbon, 78. 0 % of <b>phytomass</b> are above ground (including 6. 2 % green part and 71. 8 % woody part) and 22. 0 % are presented by roots. The NPP is estimated to be 3660 Tg dry matter per year or 1708 Tg C yr^- 1. 75. 4 % of NPP are allocated above ground, and 49. 0 % of total NPP are in green parts. During the period 1961 - 1998, {{it has been shown that}} <b>phytomass</b> of forest ecosystems in Russia increased from 29. 59 to 34. 30 Pg (= 10 ^ 15 g) C, i. e. annual average accumulation of carbon in <b>phytomass</b> is estimated at 127 Tg C yr^- 1. NPP, calculated as smoothed average for a 5 year period, increased from 1488 Tg C yr^- 1 in 1961 to 1735 Tg C yr^- 1 in 1998...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{consciousness}} for safeguarding the aqueous {{environment has}} prompted {{a search for}} alternative technologies {{for the removal of}} toxic metal ions from aqueous solutions. In this regard, a wide variety of biomass is being considered as adsorbents of heavy metals for treatment of industrial and domestic wastewaters as well as natural waters, including drinking water. In the present investigation, the potential of Quercus ilex <b>phytomass</b> from stem, leaf and root as an adsorbent of chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) at ambient temperature was investigated. The metal uptake capacity of the root for different metals was found to be in the order: Ni>Cd>Pb>Cu>Cr; stem Ni>Pb>Cu>Cd>Cr; and leaf Ni>Cd>Cu>Pb>Cr. The highest amount adsorbed was Ni (root>leaf>stem). Data from this laboratory demonstrated that Ni is sequestered mostly in the roots, where concentrations can be as high as 428. 4 ng/g dry wt., when 1 -year-old seedlings were treated with Ni (2000 mg/l) in pot culture experiments, compared to 7. 63 ng/g dry wt., control (garden and greenhouse soil) topsoil where Ni was present in trace amounts. This proves that the root biomass of Q. ilex has the capacity for complexing Ni. Cr exhibited the least adsorption values for all the three types of <b>phytomass</b> compared to other metals. The trend of adsorption of the <b>phytomass</b> was similar for Ni and Cd, i. e. root>leaf>stem. Desorption with 10 mM Na 4 EDTA was effective (55 - 90 %) and, hence, there exists the possibility of recycling the <b>phytomass.</b> The biosorption results of recycled <b>phytomass</b> suggest that the selected adsorbents are re-usable. The advantages and potential of the Q. ilex <b>phytomass</b> as a biofilter of toxic trace metals, the scope and need for enhancing the efficiency of the Q. ilex <b>phytomass</b> as an adsorbent of metals are presented.

In this study, multispectral reflectance and thermal emittance data were {{used in conjunction with}} micrometeorological data in a simple model to estimate above-ground total dry <b>phytomass</b> production of several spring wheat canopies. The fraction of absorbed photosynthetic radiation (PAR) by plants was estimated from measurements of visible and near-infrared canopy reflectance. Canopy radiation temperature was used as a crop stress indicator in the model. Estimated above-ground <b>phytomass</b> values based on this model were strongly correlated with the measured <b>phytomass</b> values {{for a wide range of}} climate and plant-canopy conditions...|$|E
40|$|In two old Norway spruce stands, {{the one at}} Garpenberg {{in middle}} Sweden, the other at Flakaträsk in {{northern}} Sweden, the <b>phytomass</b> of the field- and ground-layer was measured before clearfelling and one and four years later. The <b>phytomass</b> of the field-layer was also measured 10 and 16 years after clearfelling. Of 13 - 14 plant species originally in the field-layer, 2 - 3 were not found after clearfelling. In contrast, 15 and 9 new species appeared on the plots on which slash was left, at Garpenberg and at Flakaträsk. Some were short-lived, and 16 years after clearfelling, only 11 and 7; respectively, persisted. Corresponding figures for the plots from which slash was removed were 9 and 8; and for the burnt plots 11 and 9. Clearfelling of the old forests at Garpenberg and Flakaträsk also increased the <b>phytomass</b> of the field-layer. Removal of slash decreased the <b>phytomass</b> of some species, increased it for others. During {{the first few years}} after burning, <b>phytomass</b> on the burnt plots was less than that on the controls, but three years later it was similar to that on the unburnt plots. The spatial variation in <b>phytomass</b> was great, and no significant difference was found between treatments after clearfelling. The biomass of the most common moss species of Swedish coniferous forests declined strongly after clearfelling. Two new mosses appeared on the clearfelled plots, viz.
