40|$|Abstract: To {{investigate}} parametrically forced excitation and transverse oscillations of {{the belt}} with local heterogeneity, a new dynamic model of a V-belt drive with longitudinal motion has been developed. The model shows that when an appropriate quantitative and qualitative level of local heterogeneity is achieved, the oscillation mode {{of the belt}} starts to change, and the belt tensile force developing due to deformation of the belt significantly increases. Another V-belt drive dynamic model was developed based on the finite element model (FEM) analysis. This {{was used to examine}} the interaction of the belt, containing local heterogeneity, with the pulley in the area of contact angle. The natural frequencies of the system were calcu-lated and the system’s response to harmonic excitation was established. The correlation between the presence of defects in the belt and vibration activity of the driving <b>pulley</b> <b>bearing</b> housing was established. Using the developed model, the relationship between the defective belt and the dynamic component of the vibration reaction force of the driven pulley was studied. Spectrum components are identified and are used in the belt drive’s practical diagnostics. The method developed based on these models enables non-destructive assessment of the failure state of the mounted belt to be performed in order to assess the failure state of different belt drive types...|$|E

40|$|Issue: Glass is a hard, highly abrasive, and {{sometimes}} very sharp material {{which can cause}} excessive wear on ancillary processing equipment such as conveyors. Excessive wear can lead to costly downtime and higher maintenance costs, detracting from the economics of glass recycling. This Best Practice describes {{some of the issues}} to be considered before purchasing conveyors for glass processing systems. Best Practice: If glass-processing systems kept glass completely contained and within the equipment, most of the wear would be restricted to the actual crushing mechanisms. However, every system generates some amount of fugitive glass. Some of the fugitive glass is fine glass particles that can cause abrasion in moving parts like <b>pulleys</b> and <b>bearings</b> by contaminating lubricants and grinding down surfaces. Glass pieces also wedge into moving parts and fall below conveyor belts to build up over time, interfering with belt performance. In addition, post-consumer cullet contains beverage residue and moisture, which can cause it to stick to conveyor surfaces. The conveyor system must be designed to anticipate these occurrences. The following issues should be considered when designing a conveyor system. Cleats. A decision must be made whether or not to use cleated belts. If the cullet is wet or sticky, it may be preferable to use a belt without cleats, so a belt scraper can be installed {{on the underside of the}} conveyor.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{outlines the}} conceptualisation, design, manufacture, assembly and experimental testing of an affordable anthropomorphic mechanical hand prosthesis. In many countries, upper-limb amputees lack access to prosthetic hand devices. Furthermore, currently available mechanical devices require {{a large amount}} of effort to actuate; fatiguing and frustrating patients who have no other alternative but to use them. Consequently, a need has arisen to provide a mechanical device that is affordable enough to be accessible to low and middle-income patients, is functional enough to allow users to easily perform their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), and is aesthetically appealing enough to ensure that patients feel comfortable and confident when wearing it. Concept solutions of several mechanisms were identified and evaluated from which the final design was selected. Analytical force analysis was used to generate a mathematical model to analyse the response of each dynamic member in the hand. A linear relationship between the input-force and applied grasp-forces of the hand was identified. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) used to investigate the lateral and hyperextensive loading limits of the phalanges, generated results that corresponded well to the experimental outcomes. Amongst the utilised actuation mechanisms (levers, <b>pulleys,</b> tendon-wires, <b>bearings</b> and springs), the tendon-wires were of concern due to their repetitive tensile loading and relative movement with the phalanges. Tensile testing of various tendon-wires and endurance testing of the phalangeal tendon-channels, yielded a combination which surpassed the infinite life requirement of 1, 200, 000 loading cycles; with carbon-nylon contact wearing at the lowest rate as confirmed by gravimetric tests in accordance with ASTM F 2025 (2000). Manufacture of the hand used rapid prototyping in combination with traditional machining methods and standard components, enabling a fully-assembled cost of R 11, 628. 37; below the required R 18, 000 limit. Various power and precision grasping configurations were achieved and the contact forces satisfactorily maintained, using the hand’s built-in locking mechanism. Feedback gathered from the prosthetist and patients suggested making slight alterations to the hand’s aesthetics and to address minor functional challenges, such as the control of the closing trajectory for precision grasps...|$|R

40|$|Composite {{material}} {{could be}} developed into new material that would be useful for many interests. Fiber as composite raw material must be given pretreatment {{to improve the quality}} of composite. In this research, raw material for the composite was umbrella grass (Cyperus Alternifolius). A tool was designed to facilitate the processes of rolling or pressing, or abbreviated as roll press. Indeed, the design of roll press was preceded by designing the construction section that involved shaft, transmission system, <b>bearing,</b> <b>pulley</b> belt, and driver motor to move the roll. Result of rolling must be suitable for processing umbrella grass into the fiber of composite raw material. Testing was conduced to examine the work of the tool against the stalk of umbrella grass. Two testing was considered. First was testing against the variation of loads, which involved 10 kg, 12 kg and 14 kg. Second test was against the variation of roll rotation at 160 rpm, 197 rpm and 280 rpm. Result of both tests provided specific fiber derived from umbrella grass that would be compatible to be composite material. Some results of research were indicated. Main drive motor was ½ PK with rotation (n 1) = 1430 rpm. Pulley diameter (d 1) was 75 mm. Reducer system was signified by n 2 = 831 rpm and d 2 = 129 mm, and if d 3 = 59 mm was used, the outcome was n 4 = 160 rpm with d 4 = 307 mm.

By taking account all these results, it could be said that the result of roll press processing had successfully produced the fiber from umbrella grass into the suitable raw material for the composite...|$|R
40|$|The V-belt {{drive is}} a rather popular, widely used form of power {{transmission}} in agricultural and food industry engineering. At the same time, its stability, the lifetime of V-belt is influenced by several environmental factors, namely in the food industry by the contamination affecting the belt sides, the ambient temperature, humidity and the occasionally aggressive (acidic, alkaline air, air saturated with gases, etc.) medium. In the case of agricultural machinery, the vibration caused by uncertainly oriented <b>pulleys</b> with <b>bearing</b> in different plate structures (often being shaken in the fields) as well as alignment adjustment inaccuracies jeopardize {{the reliability of the}} parameters of the drive. Furthermore, the efficiency is determined by several factors together: the slippage occurring during drive transmission, the hysteresis loss resulting from the external and internal friction occurring with the belt entering and exiting the pulley. Experimental equipment and calculation methods were developed to determine the dynamics of temperature increase generated by the belt and pulley relationship. The temperature generated in the V-belt was measured as a function of pretension, pulley diameter and bending frequency. The so-called damping factor characterizing the contact with the pulley (the external friction when entering and exiting the groove) and the hysteresis loss (inner friction) are also determined. On the basis of the damping factor (ζ ≈ 400 Ns/m 2) of the V-belt involved in the experiments the other losses (P oth) occurring from the pulley—V-belt contact and internal friction may be estimated. The drive parameters may be optimized with the mathematical model describing the effect of the pulley diameter and belt frequency on the increase in temperature. A standardized calculation method as well as design factors valid for the properly adjusted drive and normal operating conditions determined through empirical and laboratory experiments are used for the sizing of V-belt drives. The lifetime of V-belt drives designed in this way, used in extreme conditions typical of agricultural machinery will not be appropriate and will not provide clear, predictable information for maintenance planning. In such cases the results of our own many lifetime tests conducted in the given circumstances can be safely relied on. The agricultural harvesting machines are large plate-body self-propelled structures on which most of the power supply of the (threshing, cleaning, moving, etc.) machine units handling the crop is realized via belt drives. The distance and angular displacement of the axes involved in the drive can vary within wide limits. The misalignment and angular displacement of the pulleys can be the result of installation instability — due to the plate structure — and the deformation of the plate structure occurring during the operation as well. V-belt drives operate satisfactorily under such conditions as well, however these faults are unfavourable in terms of belt lifetime and result in the reduction of drive efficiency. A further aim of our research is to examine through experiments the lifetime and efficiency of V-belts used in agricultural machines as a function of drive adjustment errors. According to the results of the measurements of the geometrical adjustment errors of V-belt drives performed in the field, the pulleys of agricultural equipment are not always positioned in the medium plane of the drive. In our experiments these data served as independent variables. Figure 1 shows the arrangement of a V-belt drive in a grain harvester with the laser pulley alignment measuring instrument installed as an accessory. In the case of many machine types in 80 % of the tested drives three times the permissible error was measured, and because of off-road use, due to dynamic load these errors further increased {{as a result of the}} frame deformation. The results of both the belt bending testing and the geometrical adjustment testing of the drive offer great help in the design of belt drives. At the same time they can be the source of lifetime and efficiency forecasts...|$|R
40|$|The book is {{organised}} in {{two main}} parts: Part I and Part II and into several chapters. The Part I includes two chapters. The first one, by the Editor, deals with basic theory, which is described following the historical steps by eminent scientists, from Herschel, to Nobili, Melloni, Stefan, Boltzmann, Planck and others. The radiation mechanisms {{with the most}} important parameters, which {{play a key role}} in acquisition and interpretation of thermal images are recalled and discussed. A section is devoted to detectors used for infrared technology. The main steps in detectors development following the technological progress are also drawn. The second chapter is by Roberto Rinaldi of the Infrared Training Center (ITC) by Flir Systems in Milan (Italy). This chapter is concerned with an overview of infrared imaging devices from the first prototype developed in 1958 to the multitude of models, which are today available. The historical evolution of the infrared technology is traced within the key features of each model. In particular, some basic characteristics and performance are described which may help the reader in the choice of the most appropriate device for the specific application. Part II is subdivided into four sections and many chapters. The first section regards applications to medicine (Chap. 1) and veterinary (Chap. 2). The study of the temperature of the human body has been associated with health as far back as the 1 st century BC, when Hypocrites, (the father of medicine), used the sense of touch to skin surface temperature anomalies and to determine the health of his patients. Still today, monitoring the body temperature variation, aides in both diagnosis and treatment planning. Chapter one was prepared by Boris G. Vainer of the Institute of Semiconductor Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This chapter reports on the IRT’s state of art in medicine with methodological approaches and a variety of applications such as in the diagnosis of breast cancer, in ophthalmologic surgery, in cardiovascular surgery, in the visualization of ischemic tissues and in many others. Chapter two presents application and use of infrared thermography in farm animals and veterinary medicine. This chapter was supplied by Petr Kunc and Ivana Knizkova of the Institute of Animal Science - University of Prague (The Czech Republic). The addressed areas include reproduction, thermoregulation, animal welfare and the milking process. The application of IRT to veterinary medicine is particularly useful to predict inflammation since, contrary to human beings, animals cannot reveal any symptom before the illness has become important. Section two includes a chapter on the use of Infrared thermography in foodstuff conservation by Klaus Gottschalk of the Leibniz-Institut für Agrartechnik Potsdam (Germany). It is shown the usefulness of IRT to control the conservation conditions of fruits and vegetables. The main advantage of using an infrared device lies in the possibility to control and improve the climate, which is essential in prolonging the shelf life of crops. Section three regards applications of IRT to industrial engineering. The first chapter, prepared by Giovanni M. Carlomagno of the Department of Aerospace Engineering - University of Naples Federico II (Italy), is an overview on IRT to thermo-fluid-dynamics. After recalling the first historical attempts in measuring heat transfer coefficients, this chapter describes the most useful heat flux sensors, supplies information about thermal restoration of data and shows several examples of convective heat transfer measurements in complex fluid flows, ranging from natural convection to hypersonic regime. The attention of chapter two is focused on the application of IRT to combustion. This contribution is by Christophe Allouis and Rocco Pagliara of the Combustion Institute CNR in Naples (Italy). It is demonstrated the usefulness of an infrared imaging system for understanding fluid-dynamics phenomena associated with combustion processes in turbine burners. The third chapter by Ralph A. Rotolante of Vicon Infrared in Boxborough, MA (USA) regards the use of IRT for nondestructive inspection purposes. The main pulse and lockin techniques are described with some application examples including also the inspection of real aircraft parts. Indeed, a remote imaging system offers many advantages over other methodologies since it is fast and two-dimensional with safeguard of the part integrity. Section four is concerned with the application of IRT in architecture and civil engineering. This is a relevant topic for infrared thermography applications after Building Regulation (2007) for Conservation of Fuel and Energy. A chapter by Ermanno Grinzato of CNR-ITC in Padua (Italy) reports some examples of structural analysis aided by IR thermography. In particular, it is stressed the impressive help, which is given to the comfort monitoring by the distributed temperature map measured by an infrared device. The attention goes also to the possibility, using a novel method, to “see” the environmental main quantities as air temperature, relative humidity and velocity, obtained from thermographic readings. Besides those herein described, an infrared imaging system can be advantageously used for many other applications. Infrared thermography is an excellent condition monitoring tool to assist in the reduction of maintenance costs on mechanical equipment. One of the biggest problems in mechanical systems is heat generated by friction, cooling degradation, material loss or blockages. The infrared technique allows for the monitoring of temperatures and thermal patterns, on a wide variety of equipments including pumps, motors, <b>bearings,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> fans, drives, conveyors etc, and while the equipment is online and running under full load. Information acquired from thermographic images enable a company to predict equipment failure and to plan corrective actions before a costly shutdown, equipment damage, or personal injury occurs. What it is more, the inspection can be performed far away from any dangerous condition without additional costs in terms of workers health care. However, it has to be pointed out that infrared thermography is still not completely exploited. It could be employed in a lot of other novel applications; it is only a matter of fantasy and skill...|$|R
