The main {{objective of this}} study was to develop and evaluate an effective seed processing system for guayule. A combined threshing and grading system was developed following laboratory investigation of different approaches to seed threshing and separation. The seed processing system includes a rough surface belt type threshing mechanism, a cleaning unit consisting of a three layer reciprocating screen and an air assisted momentum discrimination chamber for grading and final separation. Harvested seed was processed using the machine at three belt clearances and speeds. The <b>processed</b> <b>seed</b> was analysed for seed purity, germination, thousand seed mass, clean seed recovery and processing efficiency. A threshing efficiency of up to 77 % was achieved at processing capacity of 300 g/h of clean seed. Belt clearance and speed both affected the quality of <b>processed</b> <b>seed.</b> The grading system resulted in separation of up to 63. 5 % of first grade seed with a purity of 98 % and germination of up to 76 %.

40|$|AbstractThe {{nutritive value}} of raw and <b>processed</b> rubber <b>seed</b> meal (Hevea brasiliensis) was {{investigated}} {{by considering the}} following parameters – proximate composition, gross energy, mineral composition and anti-nutritional factors. The raw and <b>processed</b> <b>seeds</b> were dried, milled and chemically analysed. Crude protein contents of the raw and <b>processed</b> rubber <b>seeds</b> ranged between 21. 08 % and 24. 60 %, while the crude fibre values ranged between 4. 47 % and 5. 88 %. The gross energy content for the raw had significantly (P< 0. 05) higher values than the processed. Mineral content (macro and micro) of seeds boiled was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than other processing methods. Also, seeds boiled had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower values in all anti-nutritional factors, with hydrogen cyanide and trypsin inhibitor completely destroyed by both boiling and toasting. With high value of crude protein (24. 60 %), appreciable energy content (2. 32 MJ/kg), highest value of macro and micro minerals and significantly lower values in all the anti-nutritional factors for the seeds boiled, boiling is therefore recommended for usage in livestock and poultry ration...|$|R

40|$|Peanut allergy {{continues}} to be a problem in most developed countries of the world. We sought a processing method that would alter allergenic peanut proteins, such that allergen recognition by IgE from allergic individuals would be significantly reduced or eliminated. Such a method would render accidental exposures to trace amounts of peanuts safer. A combination of boiling and frying decreased recovery of Ara h 1 and Ara h 2 at their expected MWs. In contrast, treatment with high pressures under varying temperatures had no effect on protein extraction profiles. Antibodies specific for Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 6 bound proteins extracted from raw samples but not in boiled/fried samples. However, pre-incubation of serum with boiled/fried extract removed most raw peanut-reactive IgE from solution, including IgE directed to Ara h 1 and 2. Thus, this method of processing is unlikely to generate a peanut product tolerated by peanut allergic patients.

The seeds were used as raw, boiled for 30 minutes, toasted for 30 minutes or soaked in water for 24 hours. Each treatment (raw, boiled, toasted, soaked or control diets) was replicated three times.

40|$|Abstract: Treculia africana {{seeds are}} used {{in a variety of}} foods like porridges, {{pastries}} and weaning food formulations. These food applications require <b>processed</b> <b>seed</b> flour. In processing, parboiling is employed for easy dehusking of the seeds for improved appeal of the products. This study was carried out on four groups of parboiled and native T. africana seed flours to investigate the effect of parboiling on the composition and physicochemical properties of the flours. Results indicate that parboiling had significant effect on the composition and properties of T. africana seed flours though the effect varied from one tree source to another. Higher yields of flour were obtained with parboiled (61. 26 - 87. 65 %) compared with native (52. 84 - 74. 02 %). The proximate composition, inorganic minerals, tannins and phytates levels of the flours of the parboiled were significantly lower than those of the flours of unparboiled. Flours of the parboiled seeds exhibited lower water absorption capacity and lower freeze-thaw stability than the flours of the unparboiled seeds. The RVA paste viscosity of 14 % flour slurry showed that parboiling increased the pasting temperature, reduced the viscosity peak and stabilized the resultant paste to breakdown by shearing forces...|$|E

Ground and fermented, and dehulled Christmas bush (CB) seed meals were analyzed for their anti-nutrient contents whereas ground and sieved (GS), ground-sieved and fermented (GSF) and non-sieved and fermented (NSF) seed meals were incorporated into starter broiler diets to replace 10 % of maize, respectively. Fermented and dehulled CB seed meals contain 574. 4 and 21. 3 mg/ 100 g phytic acid, respectively. Cyanide was not identified in any of the meals. Dehulling eliminated the anthraquinone and tannin contents whereas fermentation only eliminated the tannin content. None of the methods completely eliminated the saponin, cardiac glycoside, flavonoid and alkaloid contents of the seed meals. With GS seed meal, broilers had lower average daily weight gain (P< 0. 05) than the control group. Feed intake decreased (P< 0. 05) but feed conversion ratio was not different when compared with control. Inclusion of GSF seed meal improved growth and feed intake when compared with the NSF seed meal and by day 35, growth and feed intake were comparable to those of the control birds. Blood plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphates and aspartate aminotransferase increased with GS CB seed meal diet, while serum calcium decreased. Neither raw nor fermented seed meals altered other measures of the blood chemistry. It is concluded that CB seeds contain toxic anti-nutrient compounds and that sieving out the hulls in the ground raw seed meal before fermentation improved the feeding value of the seeds for broilers at 10 % replacement for maize...|$|E
