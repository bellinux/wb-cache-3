5|$|The Gore letter did spur some {{progress}} in negotiations, as the Soviet Union allowed in late November 1958 for explicit control measures {{to be included}} in the text of the drafted treaty. By March 1959, the negotiators had agreed upon seven treaty articles, but they primarily concerned uncontroversial issues and a number of disputes over verification persisted. First, the Soviet verification proposal was deemed by the West to be too reliant on self-inspection, with control posts primarily staffed by citizens of the country housing the posts and a minimal role for officials from the international supervisory body. The West insisted that half of a control <b>post</b> <b>staff</b> be drawn from another nuclear state and half from neutral parties. Second, the Soviet Union required that the international supervisory body, the Control Commission, require unanimity before acting; the West rejected the idea of giving Moscow a veto over the Commission's proceedings. Finally, the Soviet Union preferred temporary inspection teams drawn from citizens of the country under inspection, while the West insisted on permanent teams composed of inspectors from the Control Commission.|$|E
25|$|The {{police report}} makes {{the claim that}} the warning sent to the French Consulate was {{received}} five minutes after the main explosion. This is contradicted by multiple eyewitnesses who reported seeing staff opening the Consulate windows five minutes before it. The report also claims that the warning received by the Palestine Post was not received until after the explosion. That claim is supported in the report by the testimony of two members of the Palestine <b>Post</b> <b>staff,</b> one of whom said that she was put under pressure by the Palestine Police to withdraw statements she had made in her account.|$|E
25|$|The Irgun sent {{warnings}} by telephone, {{including one}} to the hotel's own switchboard, which, possibly because hoax bomb warnings were rife at the time, the staff decided to ignore, but none directly to the British authorities. From {{the fact that a}} bomb search had already been carried out, it appears that a hoax call or tip-off had been received at the hotel earlier that day. Subsequent telephone calls from a concerned Palestine <b>Post</b> <b>staff</b> member and the police caused increasing alarm, and the hotel manager was notified. In the closing minutes before the explosion, he called an unknown British officer, but no evacuation was ordered. Controversy has arisen over the timing and adequacy of the warnings and, based on the not necessarily true assumption that {{the number of people in}} the blast zone would have been reduced, the reasons why the hotel was not evacuated.|$|E

It joined 66 AA Bde covering the Salerno area in January 1944, and the brigade took over defence of the Anzio area {{as well in}} July 1944. In June 1944, the regiment joined 62 AA Bde supporting US IV Corps in its advance to the Arno and beyond. All the British HAA regiments working with US forces retained their AA role, but one battery was also assigned a corps ground role as medium artillery, providing fire tasks for US and British troops. With ample stocks of AA ammunition, and [...] few German aircraft remaining in the theatre, the modern 3.7-inch guns then in use were in great demand for tasks such as Counter-battery fire, 62 AA Bde forming a flash-spotting troop from HAA command <b>post</b> <b>staff.</b> When the Germans launched a counter-attack to retake Leghorn, 71 HAA responded to 104 calls for support, firing 1840 rounds.

2500|$|In 1977 Gradishar {{assisted}} the Broncos to Super Bowl XII, their very first. He earned Pro Bowl honors {{and was named}} first team All-Pro. Gradishar anchored a defense that led the AFC in fewest points allowed (148 in the 14-game season) and gave up the 6th fewest yards. Gradishar was also voted the AFC Defensive Player of the Year by the Columbus Touchdown Club. The 1977 Broncos season is documented {{in a new book}} by Terry Frei, 77: Denver, the Broncos, and a Coming of Age that features Gradishar, Lyle Alzado and others. The 1977 Broncos season began with a 7–0 shutout of the St. Louis Cardinals that {{had been one of the}} NFL's top offenses from 1974–1976 that featured offensive stars like Jim Hart, Terry Metcalf, Mel Gray, Dan Dierdorf and Conrad Dobler. In a 14–7 win against the Kansas City Chiefs the Broncos made a goal line stand as time expired to preserve a win. Denver <b>Post</b> <b>staff</b> writer Terry Frei's book, 77: Denver, the Broncos, and a Coming of Age, put it this way, [...] "Gradishar penetrated and stopped two running plays, as Gradishar did time and time again on the goal line in his career.

2500|$|Washington <b>Post</b> <b>Staff</b> Writer Hal Hinson wrote, [...] "the banality of the story, the pallid look, the {{flatness}} of {{the characters}} {{add up to a}} product that is, at best, second rate". SFGate said the [...] "gnashing whale scenes are intense enough to push the G-rating envelope". The Spokesman-Review wrote, [...] "it is only an average effort in virtually every respect". The Record said [...] "The orchestration is too fancy, too loud and often drowns out the lyrics. This is a kid's movie, but musically it sounds like a full-costume Broadway show with full-supporting chorus line". It added [...] "It's a little disturbing to see a children's movie that perpetuates the erroneous image of killer whales as violent creatures. It is, however, a perfect indication of the limited imagination which went into writing The Pebble and the Penguin". The Free Lance–Star said the film got a [...] "charming mating ritual" [...] and turned it into [...] "sappy action romance with celebrity voices". The book Contemporary North American Film Directors suggested that the film suffered from [...] "the same unimaginative and cliched Disney of the 1970s that Bluth had been so critical of". The Animated Movie Guide said, [...] "the hero was a stuttering wimp, the songs didn't advance the plot, the dialogue was incessant and superfluous, and the pacing was plodding and dull".|$|E
2500|$|Some critics did praise {{various aspects}} of the film, however, {{particularly}} in regard to Bluth's animation. These reviews, however, were almost exclusively mixed. Common Sense Media said, [...] "the background animation of capricious weather conditions is lovely, as are the top-notch original songs by Barry Manilow and Mark Watters". Deseret News said: [...] "Bluth's strength continues to be colorful, classical-style animation, and there are some gorgeous moments here — especially some underwater sequences". The Austin Chronicle said: [...] "The Pebble and the Penguin features some beautifully animated sequences [...] The characters are great and the voice talents of Martin Short...and James Belushi...are terrific". Variety said the film has a [...] "heartwarming story, some lively songs and professional animation", adding that it is [...] "a sweet, enjoyable romantic tale more likely to succeed as an afternoon diversion on home video than on the big screen". The New York Times wrote [...] "The tunes Mr. Manilow has written for the movie are, like his familiar pop standards, bouncy and catchy", and commented that [...] "the animation is fine". Washington <b>Post</b> <b>Staff</b> Writer Hal Hinson wrote that [...] "A flourishing opening number—titled 'Here and Now'—proves that Short can belt out a song with the best of them", adding that the [...] "Bluth studio style of animation is passable, and, {{in the case of a}} Brecht-Weill flavored production number, occasionally inspired." ...|$|E
