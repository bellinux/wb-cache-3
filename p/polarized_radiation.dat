2500|$|The photon propagator, {{which is}} the multiplicative factor {{corresponding}} to an internal photon in the Feynman diagram expansion of a QED calculation, contains a factor gμν corresponding to the Minkowski metric. [...] An expansion of this factor as a sum over photon polarizations involves terms containing all four possible polarizations. [...] Transversely <b>polarized</b> <b>radiation</b> can be expressed mathematically as a sum over either a linearly or circularly polarized basis. [...] Similarly, one can combine the longitudinal and time-like gauge polarizations to obtain [...] "forward" [...] and [...] "backward" [...] polarizations; these are a form of light cone coordinates in which the metric is off-diagonal. [...] An expansion of the gμν factor in terms of circularly polarized (spin ±1) and light cone coordinates is called a spin sum. [...] Spin sums can be very helpful both in simplifying expressions and in obtaining a physical understanding of the experimental effects associated with different terms in a theoretical calculation.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of antennas are linearly polarized. In fact it can be shown from considerations of symmetry that an antenna that lies entirely in a plane which also includes the observer, can only have its polarization {{in the direction of}} that plane. This applies to many cases, allowing one to easily infer such an antenna's polarization at an intended direction of propagation. So a typical rooftop Yagi or log-periodic antenna with horizontal conductors, as viewed from a second station toward the horizon, is necessarily horizontally polarized. But a vertical [...] "whip antenna" [...] or AM broadcast tower used as an antenna element (again, for observers horizontally displaced from it) will transmit in the vertical polarization. A turnstile antenna with its four arms in the horizontal plane, likewise transmits horizontally <b>polarized</b> <b>radiation</b> toward the horizon. However, when that same turnstile antenna is used in the [...] "axial mode" [...] (upwards, for the same horizontally-oriented structure) its radiation is circularly polarized. At intermediate elevations it is elliptically polarized.|$|E
2500|$|Forward and {{backward}} <b>polarized</b> <b>radiation</b> can be omitted in the asymptotic states of a {{quantum field theory}} (see Ward–Takahashi identity). [...] For this reason, and because their appearance in spin sums {{can be seen as}} a mere mathematical device in QED (much like the electromagnetic four-potential in classical electrodynamics), they are often spoken of as [...] "unphysical". [...] But unlike the constraint-based gauge fixing procedures above, the Rξ gauge generalizes well to non-abelian gauge groups such as the SU(3) of QCD. [...] The couplings between physical and unphysical perturbation axes do not entirely disappear under the corresponding change of variables; to obtain correct results, one must account for the non-trivial Jacobian of the embedding of gauge freedom axes within the space of detailed configurations. [...] This leads to the explicit appearance of forward {{and backward}} polarized gauge bosons in Feynman diagrams, along with Faddeev–Popov ghosts, which are even more [...] "unphysical" [...] in that they violate the spin-statistics theorem. [...] The relationship between these entities, and the reasons why they do not appear as particles in the quantum mechanical sense, becomes more evident in the BRST formalism of quantization.|$|E

Given the larger refractive index of the ground (typically n=2) compared to air (n=1), the phase of horizontally <b>polarized</b> <b>radiation</b> is reversed upon reflection (a phase shift of [...] radians or 180°). On the other hand, the vertical component of the wave's electric field is reflected at grazing angles of incidence approximately in phase. These phase shifts apply as well to a ground modelled as a good electrical conductor.|$|E
