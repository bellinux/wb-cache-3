5|$|No.5 SFTS {{reached a}} {{strength}} of some 2,000 personnel during the war, and graduated 1,515 pilots. The rate of flying {{conducted at the}} school declined during 1945 and, by November, its aircraft were being readied for storage. In February 1946, No.5 SFTS was disbanded and its staff and equipment used to re-establish No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS), which had operated during the war as No.1 Service Flying Training School prior to disbanding in 1944. No.1 FTS was allocated 55 Wirraways, two de Havilland Tiger Moths, and one Avro Anson, though in the event it undertook little flying before relocating to Point Cook in August 1947. Post-war demobilisation saw the establishment of several RAAF Care and Maintenance Units (CMU), which {{were responsible for the}} upkeep of surplus equipment <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>disposal.</b> No.5 SFTS spawned Care and Maintenance Unit Uranquinty to look after aircraft stored at the base. These were auctioned off in November 1948, and CMU Uranquinty was dissolved the next month.|$|E

50|$|Piranha {{solution}} {{should be}} allowed to cool, and oxygen gas {{should be allowed}} to dissipate <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>disposal.</b> When cleaning glassware, it is both prudent and practical to allow the piranha solution to react overnight. This allows the spent solution to degrade <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>disposal.</b> While some institutions believe that used piranha solution should be collected as hazardous waste, others believe that it can be neutralized and poured down the drain with copious amounts of water. Attempting neutralization by adding bases can instead cause fast decomposition, which releases pure oxygen.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the {{war there}} was, naturally, a sudden and {{enormous}} surplus of ammunition.

50|$|Wastewater from toilets {{is assumed}} to contain {{bacteria}} and viruses capable of causing disease. Disinfection methods used <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> surface <b>disposal</b> of municipal sewage cannot be used with septic tanks because disinfection would prevent wastewater treatment by killing the septic tank and soil ecosystems catabolizing the putrescible contents of the wastewater.
