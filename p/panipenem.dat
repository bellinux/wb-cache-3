40|$|There is {{evidence}} {{indicating that the}} carbapenem antibiotic <b>panipenem</b> decreases plasma concentrations of valproic acid (VPA) in epileptic patients during VPA therapy. The mechanism for panipenem-induced changes in the pharmacokinetics of VPA was investigated in rats with and without bile duct cannulation. The effect of <b>panipenem</b> on the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac, which undergoes extensive enterohepatic recirculation, was also examined. VPA (50 mg/kg of body weight) or diclofenac (10 mg/kg of body weight) was administered intravenously under the steady-state plasma <b>panipenem</b> concentration of 4 μg/ml, which had been achieved by a constant infusion rate. <b>Panipenem</b> decreased the plasma VPA concentrations in rats without bile duct cannulation but did not change {{the volume of the}} initial space and protein binding of VPA.

The secondary increase in plasma diclofenac concentration observed in the absence of <b>panipenem</b> was diminished in the presence of <b>panipenem.</b> These findings suggest that <b>panipenem</b> decreases plasma VPA concentrations by suppressing its enterohepatic recirculation, probably due to a panipenem-induced decrease in the numbers of enteric bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Evidence of {{permeation}} of <b>panipenem</b> {{through the}} OprD (D 2) channel of Pseudomonas aeruginosa outer membrane was shown by using OprD protein-producing and -nonproducing strains which contained plasmid pHN 4, which codes for L- 1 beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia. Permeation by <b>panipenem</b> {{was determined by}} measuring hydrolysis of the carbapenem by beta-lactamase in the periplasmic space. Permeation by <b>panipenem</b> was also determined by counting uptake of [14 C]panipenem into P. aeruginosa PAO 1 and its OprD protein-deficient mutant, and this permeation of PAO 1 was inhibited by L-lysine. These results indicate that <b>panipenem,</b> as well as imipenem, uses the OprD channel, which functions as a specific channel for diffusion of basic amino acids. <b>Panipenem</b> and imipenem showed stronger activities against PAO 1 and clinical isolates in human serum than in Mueller-Hinton broth, which contains more amino acids than human serum does. The activities of the carbapenems were reduced by addition of L-lysine to human serum. Similar results were obtained with mouse serum and ascitic fluid. In contrast, such {{a change in the}} activities of carbapenems was not observed with an OprD protein-deficient mutant, suggesting that the main reason for the strong activities of carbapenems in biological fluids is a decrease in competition between the antibiotics and basic amino acids for permeation through the OprD channel. <b>Panipenem</b> and imipenem showed much stronger therapeutic efficacies against experimental infections with P. aeruginosa in mice than did the reference antibiotics.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the enhanced activity of BO- 2727 against imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied by using a set of four isogenic strains derived from beta-lactamase-deficient P. aeruginosa PAO 4089 (blaJ blaP). Complementation of the blaJ and blaP mutations conferred greater resistance to biapenem, <b>panipenem,</b> and imipenem than to BO- 2727 and meropenem, most notably in the outer membrane protein D 2 -deficient strain. The higher levels of resistance to biapenem, <b>panipenem,</b> and imipenem {{can be explained by}} the slow but significant hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, whereas the reduced levels of resistance to BO- 2727 and meropenem would be attributable to their stability in the presence of high levels of beta-lactamase and the fact that they cause only low induction of beta-lactamase. It is also noted that the activity of BO- 2727 against the beta-lactamase-deficient strain was less affected by the loss of the D 2 porin than was that of meropenem, indicating that BO- 2727 in comparison with meropenem can overcome an intrinsic resistance caused by the loss of D 2. Moreover, comparative in vitro resistance studies have shown that BO- 2727 and meropenem selected fewer resistant cells than other carbapenems. In conclusion, BO- 2727 exhibited improved activity against imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, probably because of its ability to overcome loss of the D 2 porin and beta-lactamase hydrolysis...|$|E

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 showed {{increased}} phenotypic {{resistance to}} imipenem, <b>panipenem,</b> and biapenem {{specifically in the}} presence of salicylate. The antipseudomonal activity of carbapenems was reduced in proportion to the concentration of salicylate. This resistance was transient and nonheritable. The synthesis of the outer membrane protein D 2 (OprD or OprD 2) in P. aeruginosa PAO 1 was inhibited by 4 to 32 mM salicylate in the bacterial growth medium, whereas no changes in any other outer membrane proteins were observed. These results indicate that salicylate suppresses the synthesis of OprD and therefore reduces the antipseudomonal activity of carbapenems.

40|$|In 1996, Serratia marcescens KU 3838 was {{isolated}} from the urine of a patient with a urinary tract infection {{at a hospital in}} northern Japan and was found to contain the plasmid pKU 501. Previously, we determined that pKU 501 carries blaIMP and the genes for TEM- 1 -type β-lactamases as well as producing both types of β-lactamases (H. Yano, A. Kuga, K. Irinoda, R. Okamoto, T. Kobayashi, and M. Inoue, J. Antibiot. 52 : 1135 – 1139, 1999). pKU 502 is a recombinant plasmid that contains a 1. 5 -kb DNA fragment, including the metallo-β-lactamase gene, and is obtained by PCR amplification of pKU 501. The sequence of the metallo-β-lactamase gene in pKU 502 was determined and revealed that this metallo-β-lactamase gene differed from the gene encoding IMP- 1 by one point mutation, leading to one amino acid substitution: 640 -A in the base sequence of the IMP- 1 gene was replaced by G, and Ser- 196 was replaced by Gly in the mature enzyme. This enzyme was designated IMP- 6. The strains that produced IMP- 6 were resistant to carbapenems. The MICs of <b>panipenem</b> and especially meropenem were higher than the MIC of imipenem for these strains. The kcat/Km value of IMP- 6 was about sevenfold higher against meropenem than against imipenem, although the MIC of meropenem for KU 1917, which produced IMP- 1, was lower than that of imipenem, and the MIC of <b>panipenem</b> was equal to that of imipenem. These results support the hypothesis that IMP- 6 has extended substrate profiles against carbapenems. However, the activity of IMP- 6 was very low against penicillin G and piperacillin. These results suggest that IMP- 6 acquired high activity against carbapenems, especially meropenem, via the point mutation but in the process lost activity against penicillins.

Population pharmacokinetic studies {{were performed to}} determine the optimal dosage regimens for three types of antibiotics: an aminoglycoside, arbekacin; a glycopeptide, vancomycin; and a carbapenem, <b>panipenem.</b> Eighty-three neonates received arbekacin (n = 41), vancomycin (n = 19), or <b>panipenem</b> (n = 23). The postconceptional ages (PCAs) were 24. 1 to 48. 4 weeks, and the body weights (BWs) ranged from 458 to 5, 200 g. A one-compartment open model with first-order elimination was applied and evaluated with a nonlinear mixed-effect model for population pharmacokinetic analysis. In the fitting process, the fixed effects significantly related to clearance (CL) were PCA, postnatal age, gestational age, BW, and serum creatinine level; and the fixed effect {{significantly related to the}} volume of distribution (V) was BW. The final formulas for the population pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows: CLarbekacin = 0. 0238 × BW/serum creatinine level for PCAs of < 33 weeks and CLarbekacin = 0. 0367 × BW/serum creatinine level for PCAs of ≥ 33 weeks, Varbekacin = 0. 54 liters/kg, CLvancomycin = 0. 0250 × BW/serum creatinine level for PCAs of < 34 weeks and CLvancomycin = 0. 0323 × BW/serum creatinine level for PCAs of ≥ 34 weeks, Vvancomycin = 0. 66 liters/kg, CLpanipenem = 0. 0832 for PCAs of < 33 weeks and CLpanipenem = 0. 179 × BW for PCAs of ≥ 33 weeks, and Vpanipenem = 0. 53 liters/kg. When the CL of each drug was evaluated by the nonlinear mixed-effect model, we found that the mean CL for subjects with PCAs of < 33 to 34 weeks was significantly smaller than those with PCAs of ≥ 33 to 34 weeks, and CL showed an exponential increase with PCA. Many antibiotics are excreted by glomerular filtration, and maturation of glomerular filtration is the most important factor for estimation of antibiotic clearance.

The rapid {{spread of}} IMP-type metallo-b-lactamases (MBLs), {{which have a}} broad {{spectrum}} of substrates and a poor susceptibility to clinically available inhibitors, further restricts b-lactam use. In the present study, we evaluated the potency of IMP- 10 MBL in hydrolysing antipseudomonal b-lactams currently available in the clinic. Crude IMP- 10 MBL was prepared from two clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa harbouring the blaIMP- 10 gene. The sensitivity of b-lactams to hydrolysis by IMP- 10 MBL was determined by comparing the MICs of 14 antipseudomonal b-lactams against a susceptible strain of P. aeruginosa in the presence and absence of IMP- 10 MBL. Carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and <b>panipenem)</b> and extended-spectrum cephems (ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefsulodin and cefepime) were sensitive to the hydrolysing activity of IMP- 10 MBL.

The affinity of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 of TL 2740 for imipenem and meropenem was ten-fold less than that of C 600, thereby providing an explanation for the mutant's reduced susceptibility to some carbapenems and mecillinam. However, this theory, was confounded by the observation that the in-vitro activities of meropenem against both parent and mutant strains were virtually the same and by the fact that PBP 2 is the principal target of the antibiotic. Imipenem and aztreonam, which bind to PBP 2 and PBP 3 respectively, demonstrated synergic activity when tested in combination against both C 600 and TL 2740.

PAPM and BP were biphasically eliminated from plasma after intravenous (i. v.) administration of PAPM-BP to mice, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits, monkeys, and dogs. Elimination rates of PAPM and BP were correlated with animal size: the larger the animal was, the slower the elimination was. As for PAPM and BP, log-log plots of total plasma clearance (CLtot) versus body weight and log-log plots of distribution volume at steady state (VSS) versus body weight for six animal species were linear, with high correlation coefficients. These allometric equations were extrapolated to predict CLtot and VSS for PAPM and BP in humans. In addition, concentration in plasma-time profiles for humans were predicted by using two-exponent equations fitted to the complex Dedrick plot of animal data. Predicted values for CLtot and VSS for PAPM and BP in humans agreed well with observed values in humans given 750 / 750 mg of PAPM-BP as an i. v. drip infusion for 30 min.

40|$|Plasma {{levels of}} valproic acid (VPA) are {{decreased}} by concomitant use with carbapenem antibiotics, such as <b>panipenem</b> (PAPM). One of the plausible mechanisms of this interaction is the inhibition of VPA glucuronide (VPA-G) hydrolysis by carbapenems in the liver. To elucidate this interaction mechanism, we purified VPA-G hydro-lase from human liver cytosol, {{in which the}} hydrolytic activity was mainly located. After chromatographic purification, the VPA-G hy-drolase was identified as acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH). APEH-depleted cytosol, prepared by an immunodepletion method, com-pletely lacked the hydrolytic activity. These results demonstrate that APEH is a single enzyme involved in PAPM-sensitive VPA-G hydrolysis in cytosol. In addition, the hydrolytic activity of recom-binant human APEH was inhibited by PAPM and the inhibition profile by typical esterase inhibitors (diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 5, 5 -dithiobis(2 -nitrobenzoic acid), p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and D-saccharic acid 1, 4 -lactone) {{was similar to that}} of human liver cytosol. Cytosolic VPA-G hydrolase activity was slightly inhibited by cholinesterase and carboxylesterase inhibitors. -Glucuroni-dase activity remained in APEH-depleted cytosol, whereas VPA-G hydrolase activity was completely abolished. Thus, either cholines-terase, carboxylesterase, or -glucuronidase in cytosol would not be involved in VPA-G hydrolysis. Taken together, APEH {{plays a major role in}} the PAPM-sensitive VPA-G hydrolysis in the liver. These findings suggest that APEH could be a key enzyme for the drug interaction of VPA with carbapenems via VPA-G hydrolysis...|$|E

40|$|The broad antipseudomonal {{spectrum}} of the carbapenem BMS- 181139 includes clinical strains and laboratory mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that are resistant to imipenem. Unlike other known carbapenems (meropenem, <b>panipenem,</b> biapenem, and BO- 2727), which have reduced activity against imipenem-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, BMS- 181139 was equally active against imipenem-susceptible (D 2 -sufficient) and imipenem-resistant (D 2 -deficient) strains. Conversely, imipenem and meropenem activities were the same against the susceptible parental strains and their BMS- 181139 -resistant mutants. Whereas basic amino acids antagonized the antipseudomonal activities of imipenem and meropenem, they {{had no effect on}} the activity of BMS- 181139. These results suggest that the uptake of BMS- 181139 into pseudomonal cells occurs by a non-D 2 pathway. Compared with imipenem and meropenem, BMS- 181139 may have a slightly higher affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP- 2) of P. aeruginosa. The rates of resistance development to imipenem, meropenem, and BMS- 181139 in P. aeruginosa strains were similar; resistance occurred at frequencies of approximately 10 (- 7) to 10 (- 8). Resistance to BMS- 181139 in P. aeruginosa is presumed to be caused by its diminished permeability since no change in their penicillin-binding protein affinities or beta-lactamase levels could be detected. In summary, BMS- 181139 is a new carbapenem which differs from other known carbapenems in its lack of cross-resistance with imipenem.

Measurements and resultsSerum and pleural fluid specimens were serially collected at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min after antibiotic administration for measurement of antibiotic levels. We investigated each agent alone as well as drug solutions containing each agent and a dehydropeptidase-I-specific inhibitor, cilastatin (CS), to remove the influence of dehydropeptidase-I-related hydrolysis. Groups of animals (n= 3) received each carbapenem agent with or without CS. Serum and pleural fluid antibiotic levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Because Cmax is not useful for evaluating the antimicrobial effects of carbapenem antibiotic agents due to their dose-dependent antimicrobial activity, we also investigated the AUC, which is correlated with the total drug levels in vivo. Among the drug solutions containing CS, MEPM/CS had the highest pleural fluid AUC 0 – 360 (1594. 8 ± 510. 3 μgmin/ml), and the highest pleural fluid AUC 0 – 360 /plasma AUC 0 – 360 ratio (0. 79 ± 0. 04). BIPM/CS had the highest plasma AUC 0 – 360 (3040. 1 ± 1525. 9 μgmin/ml). In pleural fluid AUC 0 – 360 /plasma AUC 0 – 360 ratio MEPM/CS was significantly higher than those for the remaining agents. In pleural fluid AUC 0 – 360 and plasma AUC 0 – 360 {{there were no significant differences}} among these mixed solutions. ConclusionsMEPM had the most favorable pleural fluid penetration. Pleural fluid penetration should be examined in infection models and in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of carbapenem gives a revolutionary impact to the chemotherapy of infectious diseases. The bacteriological and clinical efficacies of carbapenems, including imipenem/cilastatin, panipenem/betamipron, meropenem and biapenem, were evaluated. All four carbapenems were potent against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The antimicrobial activities of meropenem against Enterobacteriaceae were slightly superior to other carbapenems. Imipenem and <b>panipenem</b> were slightly more active against gram-positive bacteria than meropenem and biapenem. Biapenem {{was the most}} potent against Acinetobacter anitratus. The in vitro activity of imipenem was compared between 1990 and 1992 in Nagasaki University Hospital. The resistance rate of S. aureus, whose MIC is higher than 25 mg/l, increased from 3 % to 22 %, S. pneumoniae, whose MIC is higher than 0. 05 mg/l, increased from 9 % to 30 % and P. aeruginosa, whose MIC is higher than 5 mg/l, increased from 20 % to 32 %. The isolation rates of S. maltophilia from sputum increased gradually from 0. 9 % in 1984 to 3. 5 % in 1991. The clinical efficacy rates of imipenem/cilastatin and panipenem/betamipron were 79 % and 77 %, and the rates of meropenem and biapenem 100 % and 96. 2 % {{for the treatment of}} respiratory infection in our department, respectively. The efficacy rates of imipenem/cilastatin decreased from 79 % to 67. 7 % after being commercialized. This decline was due to administration to patients with severe underlying diseases and with infection caused by resistant strains such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The phase II and III trials of carbapenems in internal medicine, which were performed separately in Japan, showed that the clinical efficacy rates were 73 %, 79 %, 86 % and 89 %, and the rates of adverse reaction were 4. 7 %, 3. 3 %, 1. 8 % and 2. 2 % in imipenem /cilastatin, panipenembetamipron, meropenem and biapenem, respectively.

40|$|The {{antibiotic}} susceptibilities, genotypes of penicillin (PEN) -binding protein genes (pbp), and serotype {{distributions of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from meningitis patients were investigated by a nationwide surveillance group in Japan between 1999 and 2002. We analyzed 146 isolates from children (≤ 17 years old) and 73 from adults (≥ 18 years old). Isolates {{with or without}} abnormal pbp 1 a, pbp 2 x, or pbp 2 b genes identified by PCR were classified into six genotype patterns and 90 % MIC (MIC 90) values for PEN: (i) strains with three normal genes (17. 2 % of isolates; MIC 90, 0. 031 μg/ml); (ii) strains with abnormal pbp 2 x (22. 1 %, 0. 063 μg/ml); (iii) strains with abnormal pbp 2 b (1. 0 %, 0. 125 μg/ml); (iv) strains with abnormal pbp 2 x and pbp 2 b (7. 4 %, 0. 25 μg/ml); (v) strains with abnormal pbp 1 a and pbp 2 x (12. 7 %, 0. 25 μg/ml); and (vi) strains with three abnormal PBP genes (39. 7 %, 4 μg/ml), which are termed genotypic PEN-resistant S. pneumoniae (gPRSP). <b>Panipenem,</b> a carbapenem, showed an excellent MIC 90 (0. 125 μg/ml) against gPRSP, followed by meropenem and vancomycin (0. 5 μg/ml), cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (1 μg/ml), and ampicillin (4 μg/ml). Strains of gPRSP were significantly more prevalent in children (45. 2 %) than in adults (27. 4 %). The most frequent serotypes were 6 B, 19 F, 23 F, 6 A, and 14 in children and 23 F, 22, 3, 10, 6 B, and 19 F in adults. Serotypes 6 B, 6 A, 19 F, 23 F, and 14 predominated among gPRSP. In children, 7 - and 11 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines would cover 76. 2 and 81. 3 % of isolates, respectively, although coverage would be lower in adults (43. 9 and 56. 0 %, respectively). These findings {{suggest the need for}} early introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and continuous bacteriological surveillance for meningitis...|$|E
