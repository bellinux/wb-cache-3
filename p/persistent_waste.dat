5000|$|Soviet Economics (1970) {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the economic system of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from its foundation until the cautious economic reforms of Khrushchev and Brezhnev. The study examines the evolving political priorities of the communist party leadership {{in the context of the}} Marxist theoretical framework; the challenges of the Civil War; foreign intervention and the 1941 invasion; post-war reconstruction; and the attempt to gain military and economic parity with the USA. At each point, Kaser describes how the internal dialogue between enterprises, consumers and the state apparatus influenced the strategies adopted for economic growth and agricultural and industrial development. Kaser highlights the contributions made to the internal debate by N I Bukharin, G V Plekhanov, E A Preobrazhensky, N D Kondratiev, A V Chayanov, V G Groman, L V Kantorovich, Ye G Liberman, G A Feldman, V V Novozhilov, Branko Horvat and A G Aganbegyan. He is critical of the approaches of Western Marxists (for example, Paul A. Baran and Paul M Sweezy) and of Joan Robinson as presenting an over simplified picture of the way decision-making operated and of tending to conflate state ownership with control over resources. He argues that because the planning procedures had changed little since the first Five Year Plan (1928-32), enterprises were forced to engage in numerous deals over the composition and timing of their supplies and deliveries that in turn manifested itself in both chronic shortages and <b>persistent</b> <b>waste.</b> The [...] "three laws of socialism" [...] promulgated by Stalin, which in effect meant that heavy industry was given preference over the production of consumer goods, along with a high rate of saving and the maintenance of a stable proportion in the shares of national output between agriculture and industry, held back the growth of national income in comparison with market oriented industrial countries, notably the USA. Kaser explains how the invention of mathematical tools to achieve balance in a planned economy were swept aside under Stalin and continued to be viewed with suspicion until the 1960s. Even so, he doubts whether such computerised techniques could in practice generate efficient pricing and assure balanced growth and general economic equilibrium in the USSR.|$|E

According to Harvey, the trip he had shared with the Prime Minister of New Zealand into four Pacific Island Countries ‘left him fearing {{for the future of}} some of the Pacific’s most pristine tourist destination’ (PACNEWS 2009), which are threatened by pollution and poor waste management. According to Mr Harvey, the failure to meet basic requirements for sewerage, commercial and farm runoff and domestic waste were ruining paradise. I agree with Mr Harvey and regard waste management today amongst the three main environmental problems faced in the Pacific Islands. Experience over the last few decades has shown that Pacific Islanders have used economic development as the excuse to pollute their homes because they have not seriously managed their waste or have cut corners to reduce their costs of production. Consequently, Pacific Islanders are disposing highly toxic, non biodegradable and <b>persistent</b> <b>waste</b> as they do their garden and household biodegradable and have not learned from the painful experiences in countries such as Japan, which at one time was ravaged by diseases such as the Minamata that were due to improper waste management practices. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Assimilative {{capacity}} {{is the ability}} of natural systems to assimilate humankind's wastes. Wastes (output) of some species in natural systems are the resources (input) of other species. Before the Industrial Revolution, this concept of input and output held true for human activity, but industrialization created wastes that were qualitatively and quantitatively different from those of natural systems. The unique nature of some <b>persistent</b> <b>wastes</b> that accumulate in organisms {{over long periods of time}} makes estimates of safety problematic. An even larger problem is the devastating effects that global heating and other types of climate change are having on the integrity of ecosystems. An ecosystem in disequilibrium probably has no assimilative capacity. Since greenhouse gas emissions are increasing rapidly, the already bad situation will worsen. Another factor diminishing the probability of the effective use of the assimilative capacity concept is ecological overshoot (i. e., humankind's failing to live on ecological services and using ecological capital as a substitute), which is an unsustainable practice. Biotic impoverishment (i. e., loss of biodiversity) also increases the probability of ecological disequilibrium. Finally, exponential growth of the human population, about 1. 5 million additional people weekly, means a steadily increasing loss of space for natural systems and more acquisition of natural resources for human use. In short, present waste disposal practices are no longer suitable...|$|R
30|$|The use of {{biodegradable}} plastics {{can reduce}} the accumulation of environmentally <b>persistent</b> plastic <b>wastes.</b> The rate of degradation of biodegradable plastics depends on environmental conditions and is highly variable.

Here, we show that Pseudozyma spp. yeasts, which are common in the phyllosphere and are easily isolated from plant surfaces, displayed strong degradation activity on films made from poly-butylene succinate or poly-butylene succinate-co-adipate. Strains of P. antarctica isolated from leaves and husks of paddy rice displayed strong degradation activity on these films at 30 °C. The type strain, P. antarctica JCM 10317, and Pseudozyma spp. strains from phyllosphere secreted a biodegradable plastic-degrading enzyme with a molecular mass of about 22 kDa.

30|$|Biodegradable {{plastics}} (BPs) {{have been}} developed as a possible solution to such environmental problems caused by the <b>persistent</b> plastic <b>wastes.</b> To date, various aliphatic polyesters that can be degraded by microorganisms in the natural environment have been commercialized as BP materials. Mulch films made from BPs {{are already in the}} market and are used to help farmers save time and labor as well as to reduce plastic wastes (Ngouajio et al. 2008). Chemical, physical, and biological degradability of BP mulch films are largely affected by the composition of the BP materials (Kyrikou and Briassoulis 2007). Although degradation speed of BP mulch films depends largely on environmental conditions (Kariyazono et al. 2000; Hoshino et al. 2001), the key factor controlling the degradation speed of BP mulch film in soil has not yet been elucidated. Knowledge of the mechanisms involved would enable the development of an indicator that would help farmers predict the degradability of mulch films under a given farmland condition before planting, and thus, select the suitable mulch film for their farm use.|$|R
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: In this work, {{two kinds}} of rare earth {{hypophosphites}} (REHP), lanthanum hypophosphite (LaHP) and cerium hypophosphite (CeHP), were synthesized and characterized. Subsequently, LaHP and CeHP were added into polylactide to improve its flame retardant properties. Thermal gravimetric analysis was employed to investigate the thermal decomposition behavior of REHP and flame retardant polylactide composites (FR-PLA). The fire performance evaluated by microscale combustion calorimetry and cone calorimeter clearly demonstrated that the addition of LaHP and CeHP resulted in significant reduction of the heat release rate, low total heat release, and compact intumescent char layer. Thermogravimetric analysis− infrared spectrometry testing indicated that the addition of REHP significantly decreased the yields of pyrolysis products. Furthermore, the crystallization behaviors of FR-PLA composites were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. The char residue of FR-PLA composites after cone calorimeter testing were also be investigated by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

Data collection for this project included obtaining secondary data from publicly available sources. Alaskan shorebased seafood processing facilities discharge water mixed with fish waste from an outfall(s). Once discharged, buoyant fish waste enters the water column and floats to the surface, while denser fragments sink. Fish waste accumulates on the seafloor and creates fish <b>waste</b> piles. A <b>persistent</b> fish <b>waste</b> pile depletes the oxygen from the water column, smothers benthic invertebrates, alters benthic habitat and creates dead zones, all which lead {{to changes in the}} overall ecosystem. As the deposited material breaks down, it produces hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which may be released into the environment and affect aquatic ecosystem health. Less than fifty percent of the facilities in the data set are in compliance with the requirement to monitor their fish waste piles. At least 115 acres of the Alaska seafloor is covered by fish waste piles and the impacts of these 115 acres are not widely known. The recovery process of benthic communities is typically different than a simple reverse of the pattern observed during its decline. It is unlikely that any benthic community impacted by these fish waste piles will recover to its original state, even if the organic loading ceases...|$|R

In the present study, we addressed whether renal βENaC expression {{is required for}} sodium and potassium balance or can be compensated by remaining (α and γ) ENaC subunits using adult nephron-specific knockout (Scnn 1 b(Pax 8 /LC 1)) mice. Upon induction, these mice present a severe PHA- 1 phenotype with weight loss, hyperkalemia, and dehydration, but unlike the Scnn 1 a(Pax 8 /LC 1) mice without <b>persistent</b> salt <b>wasting.</b> This {{is followed by a}} marked downregulation of STE 20 /SPS 1 -related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase (SPAK) and Na(+) /Cl(-) co-transporter (NCC) protein expression and activity. Most of the experimental Scnn 1 b(Pax 8 /LC 1) mice survived with a HNa(+) /LK(+) diet that partly normalized NCC phosphorylation, but not total NCC expression. Since salt loss was minor, we applied a standard-sodium/LK(+) diet that efficiently rescued these mice resulting in normokalemia and normalization of NCC phosphorylation, but not total NCC expression. A further switch to LNa(+) /standard-K(+) diet induced again a severe PHA- 1 -like phenotype, but with only transient salt wasting indicating that low-K(+) intake is critical to decrease hyperkalemia in a NCC-dependent manner. In conclusion, while the βENaC subunit plays only a minor role in sodium balance, severe hyperkalemia results in downregulation of NCC expression and activity. Our data demonstrate the importance to primarily correct the hyperkalemia with a low-potassium diet that normalizes NCC activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of <b>persistent</b> plastic <b>wastes</b> is raising general global concern, and disposal methods are limited. Incineration may generate toxic air pollution, satisfactory landfi ll sites are limited, and recycling methods for com-mingled waste are expensive and often energy- intensive. In addition, petroleum resources are fi nite and are becoming limited. It {{will be important to}} fi nd durable plastic substitutes, especially in short- term packaging and disposable applications. The continuously growing public concern in the problem has stimulated research interest in biodegradable polymers as alternatives to conventional nondegradable polymers such as polyethylene and polystyrene etc. Several concerns must be addressed prior to commercial use of biobased primary packaging materials. These concerns include degradation rates under various conditions, changes in mechanical properties during storage, potential for micro-bial growth, and release of harmful compounds into packaged food products. Furthermore, the biopackaging must function as food packaging and meet the requirements of particular food products. In Europe, the biopackaging fi eld is regulated primarily by two EU directives: “ Plastic Materials and Articles Intended to Come into Contact with Foodstuffs ” (90 / 128 /EEC), with later amendments, and “ Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive ” (94 / 62 /EEC). Biopackaging often has diffi culties in complying with the migration requirements of the directive on “ Plastic Materials and Articles Intended to Come into Contact with Foodstuffs ”. Furthermore, several of the raw materials and additives used to produce biopackaging materials are not included in the list of approved components. Polymers derived from renewable resources (“ biopoly-mers ”) are broadly classifi ed according to the method of production.

Despite the correction of the hyperparathyroidism, the withdrawal of corticosteroids, and the reduction of immunosuppressive treatment to tacrolimus-based monotherapy, the osteoarticular pains persisted. Skeletal investigations at month 9 post-transplantation demonstrated a significant bone mineral density loss associated with osteomalacia and osteoporosis on the bone biopsy. Laboratory data showed persistent hypophosphatemia, and phosphate diabetes was then diagnosed explaining the post-transplant bone disease. A tacrolimus-induced renal tubular disorder was suspected to contribute to the excessive renal phosphorus wasting. The replacement of tacrolimus by sirolimus, in addition to oral phosphorus and vitamin D supplementations, led to the disappearance of pains, the normalization of urinary and plasma phosphate level, and a significant improvement of bone mineralization...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the Material Efficiency practices of manufacturing {{companies in the}} UK. The study was motivated by the increasing attention given by literature to sustainable strategies in general, with less attention being given to material resources which in turn contributes to the reduced supply of natural resources, <b>persistent</b> solid <b>waste</b> and toxicity. There is also a lack of insight about how the manufacturing industry is coping with pressures to reduce solid waste and better utilise materials as resources. A critical literature review identifies Material Efficiency and related strategies and any issues of implementation. This academic perspective is supported by an exploratory study of Material Efficiency practices using multiple case studies and qualitative data collection and analysis. The participating companies selected were manufacturing companies that practice Material Efficiency and any related strategies. It was found that manufacturers do practice Material Efficiency and related strategies although few of them use the names and constructs found in the literature. Most of the companies do practice the lowest strategy (e. g. Waste Minimisation) in the sustainable manufacturing hierarchy, while most companies struggle with developing the higher strategies such as Resource Efficiency and Eco-efficiency, {{in part due to}} measurement complexity. The investigation found a set of attributes in the difficulties, benefits and accelerators that affect manufacturers when implementing Material Efficiency strategies and also studied the factors that motivated the manufacturers to implement and to choose the strategies. It is found from this research that these attributes are interrelated and dependent on each company’s context such as company’s size, type of product, and type of materials used etc. The findings describe real Material Efficiency practices as used inside the UK manufacturing industry, while comparing actual practice to what has been suggested in the literature. The study provides insight into how companies experience and practice Material Efficiency and other related sustainable manufacturing strategies.

Using genetic tools, we investigated its prevalence and contribution to diarrhea and malnutrition in hospitalized children in Uganda. A cross-sectional, case-control study involving diarrheic children who were matched for age and sex (3 : 1) with control children. Measurements included anthropometry and clinical assessment. A total of 17. 4 % of 1, 779 children with diarrhea were infected with E. bieneusi compared with 16. 8 % of 667 control children (2 0. 137, P 0. 712). Prevalence was highest during the rainy seasons. There was no significant relationship between infection with E. bieneusi and stunting, being underweight, wasting, or acute diarrhea. However, children who were E. bieneusi-positive by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) had diarrhea for a longer period (15. 15 versus 9. 67 days; F 12. 02; P 0. 001) compared with children who were either uninfected or were E. bieneusi-positive by a nested PCR. We conclude that E. bieneusi is widespread among children 3 – 36 months of age in Uganda, and that in a cross-sectional study, there was no clear association of E. bieneusi with poor nutrition or diarrhea. Since E. bieneusi is closely linked with <b>persistent</b> diarrhea and <b>wasting</b> in adults who are positive for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), the outcome of follow-up studies involving children who are HIV/AIDS-positive and severely malnourished children may be entirely different and warrants further study...|$|R

To study the physiological role of HNF- 3 α, we generated mice that lack HNF- 3 α by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for a null mutation in the HNF- 3 α gene develop a complex phenotype that is characterized by abnormal feeding behavior, progressive starvation, <b>persistent</b> hypoglycemia, hypotriglyceridemia, <b>wasting,</b> and neonatal mortality between days 2 and 14. Hypoglycemia in HNF- 3 α-null mice leads to physiological counter-regulatory responses in glucocorticoid and growth hormone production and an inhibition of insulin secretion but fails to stimulate glucagon secretion. Glucagon-producing pancreatic alpha cells develop normally in HNF- 3 α−/− mice, but proglucagon mRNA levels are reduced 50 %. Furthermore, the transcriptional levels of neuropeptide Y are also significantly reduced shortly after birth, implying a direct role of HNF- 3 α in the expression of these genes.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is to evaluate environmental burdens associated with a product, process or activity by quantifying energy and materials used and wastes released to the environment. The assessment includes the entire life cycle of the product encompassing raw material processing, manufacturing, transportation, use, recycling and disposal. This paper analyzes the multilayer plastic fuel tank from the LCA perspective, determines the main environmental burdens and expands the analysis on the improvement areas of the product for the purpose of lowering the environmental burdens. Many companies in the private sector are beginning to see the advantages of life cycle thinking in product management. As evidence of its importance, industry itself is tacking significant steps to guide the use of life cycle thinking through its involvement in the development of international standards. Life cycle assessment allows these companies to make effective trade-offs between suppliers of key product inputs or between a number of ways of designing and manufacturing the products themselves. Life cycle assessment helps companies to keep a step ahead of rapidly changing regulatory requirements on solid <b>waste,</b> <b>persistent</b> toxic chemicals, emissions, and effluent discharges.
