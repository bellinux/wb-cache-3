40|$|We {{explored}} the developmental course of goal prediction and imitation as two commonly used measures of action understanding. In particular, we investigated {{the relationships between}} the measures in two complex multistep <b>actions</b> (hammering and <b>pulling</b> <b>action)</b> in children between 12 and 30  months (n =  64) in a between-subjects design. The results showed that the prediction of an action goal was related to the imitation in the hammering action, but not in the <b>pulling</b> <b>action.</b> The results are discussed in the light of current theories on goal prediction and imitation...|$|R

50|$|The Repeating Rifle Model 1886 {{commonly}} known as Mannlicher Model 1886 was a late 19th-century Austrian straight-pull bolt-action rifle, adopted in 1886. It used a wedge-lock straight <b>pull</b> <b>action</b> bolt. It was the first straight-pull bolt-action service rifle of any nation.|$|R
50|$|The mortar could fire {{two types}} of shell, a heavy armour-piercing shell with a delayed <b>action</b> <b>fuse</b> {{weighing}} 384 kg, and a lighter 287 kg shell fitted with an impact fuze. The light shell was capable of creating a crater 8 meters wide and 8 meters deep, as well as killing exposed infantry up to 400 m away.|$|R
50|$|This {{treatment}} {{consists of}} aligning a bone or bones by a gentle, steady <b>pulling</b> <b>action.</b> The <b>pulling</b> may be {{transmitted to the}} bone or bones by a metal pin through a bone or by skin tapes. This is a preliminary treatment used in preparation for other secondary treatments.|$|R
5000|$|Manual crank (lockout) {{stringing}} machines use a crank {{to achieve}} the correct tension, {{at which point the}} tension mechanism locks into place. These stringing machines allow racquets to be strung more quickly than with drop weight machines. The lockout action permits more tension loss than drop weight [...] and constant <b>pull</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bridge led a squad which defused a bomb with {{a delayed}} <b>action</b> <b>fuse</b> in September 1940, {{for which he}} {{received}} the George Medal. In March 1941, he defused 15 bombs, including a bomb which had fallen in the Naval dockyard at HMNB Devonport, for which he received a King's Commendation for Brave Conduct. In October 1941 he was awarded a bar to his George Medal after defusing a bomb in the docks in Falmouth.|$|R

50|$|The Blaser R8 has an {{uncommon}} detachable box magazine/trigger unit. When detached it renders the rifle inoperable and safe. To avoid accidents with set triggers, Blaser offers the R8 {{only with a}} direct trigger. The compact detachable box magazine/trigger unit contributes to balancing the rifle, as the Blaser straight <b>pull</b> <b>action</b> is about 50 to 60 mm shorter than conventional bolt actions.|$|R
5000|$|On June 28, Pennsylvania's brig Nancy {{arrived in}} the area with 386 barrels of powder in her hold and ran aground while {{attempting}} to elude British blockader [...] Barry ordered the precious powder rowed ashore during the night leaving only 100 barrels in Nancy at dawn.

50|$|From {{the vast}} field of issues (Agenda Universe), groups push issues meriting public {{attention}} “within the legitimate jurisdiction of existing governmental authority” (Birkland, quoting Cobb and Elder), {{moving to the}} next level (Systemic Agenda). Ideas that gain active and serious consideration of decision/policy makers go the next level (Institutional Agenda). If acted upon, it reaches Decision Agenda—the last level in the policy making process. Within these levels there are push and <b>pull</b> <b>actions</b> that happen between and among interest groups in order to pursue or challenge such initiatives.|$|R
50|$|In {{conventional}} bolt-action rifles {{such as the}} Mauser, Mosin-Nagant or Lee-Enfield, {{the bolt}} is unlocked or locked by the raising or lowering of the bolt handle, before the bolt is drawn back and after it is pushed forward. The single motion required to open or close the bolt of a straight <b>pull</b> <b>action</b> rifle is theoretically faster and easier for soldiers to learn, thus perhaps offering {{a higher rate of}} fire. In addition, unlike the Lee-Enfield, the bolt Ross rifle could be disassembled more quickly without special tools, although this was not necessarily an advantage as it encouraged unauthorized disassembly by soldiers.|$|R

2500|$|Broadly speaking, the {{categories}} for shanties {{can be understood}} in terms of whether the task(s) for which they were used was/were related to hauling or heaving. [...] "Hauling" [...] (<b>pulling)</b> <b>actions</b> were intermittent in nature. They required a coordinated show of focused exertion, not sustained, but rather at specific moments. Shanties for hauling tasks thus coordinated the timing of those exertions, the [...] "pulls." [...] "Heaving" [...] (pushing) actions were of a continuous nature. In these, coordination was of minor importance as compared to pacing. Rather than rhythmically timing the labor, shanties for heaving were more intended to set an appropriate, manageable pace and to occupy or inspire workers throughout the duration of what could often be long tasks.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{anaphase}} chromatid separation in normal lymphocytes showed that {{the onset of the}} movement is asynchronous and morphologically characterised by "diamond shape figures", very likely due to the <b>pulling</b> <b>action</b> of the centromeres on the passive chromatids. These typical figures have been observed in a case of human acute leukemia, in bone marrow cells treated with colchicine and hypotonic medium. It has been possible to identify the chromosomes. A correlation between DNA synthesis and anaphase migration is suggested: the later a chromosome duplicates, the later its chromatids separate and move towards the poles. This suggestion however is only volid for the present case, and cannot actually be generalized. © 1966. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|During the war a dummy {{airfield}} {{was built}} using wood and cardboard {{a few miles}} west of the original airfield and successful efforts were made to hide the proper field (supposedly led by Jasper Maskelyne). Aircraft and buildings were made of cardboard and wood and some real, but old tractors were driven around the site. The Germans attacked the dummy field a number of times and it was rebuilt each time.On 15 July 1940, four 250 kg bombs failed to explode, 2 of them near assembly sheds. It was unclear to the newly appointed bomb disposal team led by Colonel Stuart Archer GC whether they were dealing with delayed <b>action</b> <b>fuses</b> -then causing major disruptions to vital buildings and airfields or more likely booby-trapped devices. The decision was taken to move the bombs to be detonated elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|For most {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{in carrying out}} hazardous work in a very brave manner, to 2nd Lieutenant A. F. Campbell, R.E. (since deceased). Second Lieutenant Campbell was called upon {{to deal with an}} unexploded bomb in the Triumph Engineering Company's works in Coventry. This bomb had halted war production in two factories involving over 1,000 workers and evacuation of local residents. He found it to be fitted with a delayed <b>action</b> <b>fuse</b> which was impossible to remove. He decided to remove the bomb to a safe place. This was done by lorry with Second Lieutenant Campbell lying alongside the bomb to enable him to hear if it started ticking so he could warn the driver to escape. Having got it to a safe place he successfully disposed of it. Unfortunately, he was killed the next day whilst dealing with another unexploded bomb.|$|R

50|$|On 17 October 1940, Second Lieutenant Sandy Campbell of the Royal Engineers Bomb Disposal Company {{was called}} upon {{to deal with an}} unexploded bomb that had fallen at the Triumph Engineering Company's works in Canley. War {{production}} in two factories had ceased on a temporary basis because of it, with {{a large number of people}} living nearby having to be evacuated. Campbell found that the bomb was fitted with a delayed <b>action</b> <b>fuse</b> that was impossible to remove, so he decided to transport it to a safe place. That was done by lorry, and he lay alongside the bomb so that he could hear if it started ticking and could warn the driver to stop and run for cover. Having taken it to a safe distance, he disposed of the bomb successfully but was killed whilst dealing with another bomb the next day. Campbell was posthumously awarded a George Cross for his actions on 17 October 1940.|$|R
25|$|The Nave, {{the body}} of the church, {{accommodates}} nine hundred sixty-six people for daily Masses and other ceremonies. The Nave has no pews, utilizing individual, movable chairs, complete with kneelers. Usually arranged in straight rows facing the altar and allowing for a center aisle and two side aisles, the chairs may also be placed in rows the length of the church, facing each other across the center aisle for special services such as those of Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil. It may also be noted that during the renovations by Conrad-Schmitt, the entire building was cracked down the middle and deeply in danger of collapse. To resolve this, steel strand beams were mounted from wall to wall in the nave to provide a counter push and <b>pull</b> <b>action,</b> keeping the building from falling in or out.|$|R

5000|$|This German [...] "Einhand" [...] {{system allows}} {{the user to}} single-handedly chamber a {{cartridge}} by pulling the trigger guard back, which {{is connected to the}} slide. This <b>pulling</b> <b>action</b> will retract the slide back against the return spring. When the trigger guard is released, the slide will return and chamber the cartridge almost instantaneously. The chamber is fluted to reduce slide recoil, this reduces gas pressure acting on the base of the cartridge case. The trigger is then pulled to fire in single-action and the trigger guard is then automatically locked forward as to not strain the index finger during normal firing. An advantage of this system is that misfired cartridges can be quickly discharged with only one hand. If one prefers to carry with a loaded chamber, a traditional, manual safety exists above the left grip panel on the frame.|$|R
