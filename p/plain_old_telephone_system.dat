As new technology-neutral policies are implemented, we argue that this is increasingly dangerous as trac data granularity aects the sensitivity of the data collected.

40|$|The circuit {{switched}} POTS (<b>Plain</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>System)</b> pre-serves {{the timing}} relationship between media samples from sender to receiver {{through use of}} a common clock. For PC-based Inter-net multimedia, the existence of separate audio and system clocks on either end-host can introduce significant complications. Much work {{has taken place in}} recent years that addresses the issue of system clock skew and its effect on precise delay measurement. In a Voice over IP (VoIP) environment, where adaptive buffering techniques are employed, system and audio clock skew can distort both delay measurement and playout control as well as lead to poor buffer performance. This paper presents a high level mechanism to measure and compensate for the skew relationships between sys-tem and audio clocks at each end of a multimedia session. The mechanism utilises both the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and the RTP (Realtime Transport Protocol) Control Protocol or RTCP. Preliminary and positive results are presented from a testbed sys-tem and plans for further work are outlined. 1...|$|E

40|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} popular way to provide phone services. At this moment there is a transition going on from delivering voice over the <b>Plain</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> (POTS) to using VoIP technology. Line echo is created in the 2 -wire to 4 -wire hybrid circuit between the VoIP phone and the POTS phone and is much more apparent due to the large delay in the packet network; line echo cancellation is necessary to ensure satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS). It {{turns out that the}} performance limit of the amount of echo that can be cancelled is set by the non-linear portion of the signal. Line probing is a method of inserting a known signal at the far-end and recording the near-end signal.

40|$|Voice over Internet Protocol is a {{technology}} that enables people to use the Internet, rather than the traditional public switched telephone network, as the transmission medium for voice communications. VoIP is becoming increasingly popular due to its significant advantages in cost and flexible features compared with the <b>plain</b> <b>old</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> The proliferation of VoIP calls has significant implications on the security and privacy aspects of voice calls. For example, the use of VoIP has made {{it much easier to}} achieve confidentiality and anonymity in voice communications. On the other hand, VoIP has imposed significant new challenges in providing the same call-identifying and wiretapping capabilities as those that exist in traditional circuit-switched networks. In this article we examine the privacy and security aspects of peer-to-peer (P 2 P) VoIP calls and show how the use of VoIP has substantially shifted the previous balance between privacy and security that exists in traditional PSTN calls. In particular, we show that the use of strong encryption and available low-latency anonymizing network at the same time does not necessaril...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} work in progress relating {{to the use of}} synchronised time in Voice over IP (VoIP) networks. One of the principal limitations of conventional IP networks is the best-eort service that they provide. In recent years, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) have created the multimedia data and control architecture which incorporates protocols such as the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP), RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP). Whilst these protocols assist in delivery of multimedia trac, the lack of bounds on end-to-end delay still presents signicant problems for interactive applications such as VoIP. The ITU-T recommendation G. 114 species that a round-trip-delay of 300 ms should not be exceeded and the <b>Plain</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> (POTS) generally does much better than this. Along with RTP and RTCP, various approaches have been proposed and taken to improve the performance of VoIP networks from an interactive viewpoint. These range from sender-based codec measures to network-based policies that dierentiate between trac ows and - nally to various buer schemes at the receiver that balance overall delay with receiver packet loss due to late arrival. This paper summarises much of this work but focuses on receiver-based measures. RT...|$|E
