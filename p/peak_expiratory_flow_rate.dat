50|$|There are two subtypes {{divided by}} symptoms: Type 1 and Type 2, {{depending}} on {{the stability of the}} patient's maximum speed of expiration, or <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> (PEFR). Type 1 is characterized by sustained, chronic variability of PEFR, while type 2 is distinguished by sudden unpredictable drops in PEFR where asthma symptoms are otherwise well controlled and the function of the lungs is not substantially impaired.|$|E
50|$|Other non {{specific}} tests could require {{the patient to}} run {{for a few minutes}} at a continuous pace.

50|$|Other {{supportive}} evidence includes: a ≥20% {{difference in}} <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> {{on at least}} three days in a week for at least two weeks, a ≥20% improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone, or a ≥20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger. Testing peak expiratory flow is more variable than spirometry, however, and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis. It may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking the effectiveness of new medications. It may also be helpful in guiding treatment in those with acute exacerbations.|$|E
5000|$|Wheezes occupy {{different}} {{portions of}} the respiratory cycle depending {{on the site of}} airway obstruction and its nature. The fraction of the respiratory cycle during which a wheeze is produced roughly corresponds to the degree of airway obstruction. Bronchiolar disease usually causes wheezing that occurs in the expiratory phase of respiration. The presence of expiratory phase wheezing signifies that the patient's <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> is less than 50% of normal. Wheezing heard in the inspiratory phase on the other hand is often a sign of a stiff stenosis, usually caused by tumors, foreign bodies or scarring. This is especially true if the wheeze is monotonal, occurs throughout the inspiratory phase (i.e. is [...] "holoinspiratory"), and is heard more proximally, in the trachea. Inspiratory wheezing also occurs in hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Wheezes heard at the end of both expiratory and inspiratory phases usually signify the periodic opening of deflated alveoli, as occurs in some diseases that lead to collapse of parts of the lungs.|$|E
40|$|Cough {{effectiveness}} {{is determined by}} a combination of volume of air expired and maximum expiratory airflow rate. Studies of cough sensitivity identify cough thresholds based on at least 2 or 5 -cough re-accelerations to a stimulus, however to date no study has examined the interplay between the distribution of cough expired air and cough airflow rates for these induced sequential coughs. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between reflex cough re-accelerations, cough airflow and cough inspired and expired volume. Twenty adults (18 – 40 years, 4 men) volunteered for study participation, and were outfitted with a facemask in-line with a pneumotachograph and a one-way valve for capsaicin delivery on inspiration. Cough inspired and expired volume (Liters of air) as well as airflow parameters (<b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> L/s) were measured for each cough response. Results demonstrate significant linear relationships between cough expired volume, <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> and the total number of coughs produced. Thus, as the number of coughs in an epoch increase, the mechanical effectiveness of coughs within the epoch may decrease according to <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and cough expired volume, particularly for coughs comprised of more than 3 re-accelerations...|$|R

40|$|Background : Doing {{exercise}} {{is an excellent}} way to improve the vitality of lungs function, stimulates respiration process and increases lungs volume. Nowadays, zumba has become a trend of exercise. Zumba has some variations, two of them are aqua zumba and zumba. The difference between them is the media of exercise, aqua zumba is done in the water, while zumba is done in the studio. One way to know the lung function is measuring the <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> (PEFR). Aim : To prove the difference of <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> between aqua zumba and zumba gymnasts. Methods : This research was quasi experimental study. Research’s samples were aqua zumba and zumba gymnasts groups (n= 16 for each group) which the <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> was measured using Mini-Wright Peak Flow Meter. The data were analyzed using Independent T- Test. Result : The mean <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of aqua zumba gymnasts group is 386, 9 ± 55, 10 liter/minute with the minimum rate is 300 liter/minute and the maximum rate is 470 liter/minute. The mean <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> of zumba gymnasts group is 365, 6 ± 43, 04 liter/minute with the minimum rate is 300 liter/minute and the maximum rate is 430 liter/minute.

Forced expiratory volume in one second and <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> were measured in the outpatient clinic, on the last day with medication. Peak expiratory flow rates were then measured every four hours on days 4, 5 and 6 without medication. Seventeen children showed an amplitude in circadian <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> values of more than 20 % (group I) and nine children showed an amplitude of 20 % or less on the three study days (group II). Mean values +/- SEM were 34. 7 +/- 2. 1 % and 10. 5 +/- 1. 5 %, respectively. Forced expiratory volume in one second values were comparable in both groups. Daytime <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> values before and after withdrawal, remained on the same level in both groups.

5000|$|It {{might be}} {{expected}} that people with E.I.B. would present with shortness of breath, and/or an elevated respiratory rate and wheezing, consistent with an asthma attack.

[...] Similarly, examination may reveal wheezing and prolonged expiratory phase, or may be quite normal. Consequently, a potential for under-diagnosis exists.

40|$|OLD) remain one of {{the most}} common {{workplace}} health challenges since the industrial revolution. One of the risks for OLD is the exposure to cement dust which is associated with varying degrees of respiratory symptoms and reduction in lung function. This study aimed to measure the <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> (PEFR) of workers in a cement manufacturing company in Port Harcourt and estimate the determinants of the measured rates. Method: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 105 workers of a cement company who presented for the annual fitness to work exercise were sampled and had their <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> measured using a spirometer. Data were also collected using structured interviewer-administered questionnaires and a walk through survey carried out to examine workplace situation. The results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The study showed that 13. 3 % of the workers had abnormal (i. e low) PEFR. The lowest mean PEFR of 327. 5 L/min was found among workers who had worked for 21 23 years and worked mainly at the production and bagging area. Most of the workers (81. 9 %) made effective use of some form of personal protective equipment (PPE).

30|$|The {{experimental}} variable in this study, dynamic strain, was adjusted {{by changes in}} TLow. To guide these changes, the expiratory flow curve {{was used as a}} tool to achieve specific targets, aimed at terminating the expiratory flow on each breath at two different points. In the OD + LDS group, as the flow decelerated from its <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> TLow was adjusted to terminate gas flow at 75 % of that <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> For example, if a <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> reached 100  L/min, the flow would be terminated once the deceleration of the flow rate reached 75  L/min. Another example of this method can be seen in Fig. 2 b. The OD + HDS group used the same method, but TLow was adjusted to terminate gas flow at 25 % of the <b>peak</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> This ratio allowed three times as much expiratory flow to escape as compared to the OD + LDS, thus creating more end-expiratory collapse.|$|E
