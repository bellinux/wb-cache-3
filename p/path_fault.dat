40|$|Aircraft engine {{performance}} trend monitoring and gas <b>path</b> <b>fault</b> diagnostics {{are closely related}} technologies that assist operators in managing the health of their gas turbine engine assets. Trend monitoring {{is the process of}} monitoring the gradual performance change that an aircraft engine will naturally incur over time due to turbomachinery deterioration, while gas path diagnostics is the process of detecting and isolating the occurrence of any faults impacting engine flow-path performance. Today, performance trend monitoring and gas <b>path</b> <b>fault</b> diagnostic functions are performed by a combination of on-board and off-board strategies. On-board engine control computers contain logic that monitors for anomalous engine operation in real-time. Off-board ground stations are used to conduct fleet-wide engine trend monitoring and fault diagnostics based on data collected from each engine each flight. Continuing advances in avionics are enabling the migration of portions of the ground-based functionality on-board, giving rise to more sophisticated on-board engine health management capabilities. This paper reviews the conventional {{engine performance}} trend monitoring and gas <b>path</b> <b>fault</b> diagnostic architecture commonly applied today, and presents a proposed enhanced on-board architecture for future applications. The enhanced architecture gains real-time access to an expanded quantity of engine parameters, and provides advanced on-board model-based estimation capabilities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} analytical {{techniques for}} aiding system designers in making aircraft engine health management sensor selection decisions. The presented techniques, {{which are based}} on linear estimation and probability theory, are tailored for gas turbine engine performance estimation and gas <b>path</b> <b>fault</b> diagnostics applications. They enable quantification of the performance estimation and diagnostic accuracy offered by different candidate sensor suites. For performance estimation, sensor selection metrics are presented for two types of estimators including a Kalman filter and a maximum a posteriori estimator. For each type of performance estimator, sensor selection is based on minimizing the theoretical sum of squared estimation errors in health parameters representing performance deterioration in the major rotating modules of the engine. For gas <b>path</b> <b>fault</b> diagnostics, the sensor selection metric is set up to maximize correct classification rate for a diagnostic strategy that performs fault classification by identifying the fault type that most closely matches the observed measurement signature in a weighted least squares sense. Results from the application of the sensor selection metrics to a linear engine model are presented and discussed. Given a baseline sensor suite and a candidate list of optional sensors, an exhaustive search is performed to determine the optimal sensor suites for performance estimation and fault diagnostics. For any given sensor suite, Monte Carlo simulation results are found to exhibit good agreement with theoretical predictions of estimation and diagnostic accuracies...|$|E

40|$|Gas <b>path</b> <b>fault</b> {{isolation}} {{is one of}} the key techniques in Engine Health Management systems. In order to accomplish gas <b>path</b> <b>fault</b> isolation successfully for a gas turbine engine, both an accurate off-design performance model and an effective fault isolation approach are necessary. In this thesis, two original and useful contributions to knowledge are presented: a new gas turbine off-design performance model adaptation approach and a new gas turbine fault isolation approach. This new adaptation approach uses optimal multiple scaling factors obtained by using a Genetic Algorithm to scale inaccurate component characteristic maps in gas turbine performance models to improve their prediction accuracy in different off-design conditions. The major feature of this approach is that it provides non- linear map scaling and therefore is able to provide more effective adaptation. The new fault isolation approach can be used to discover knowledge hidden in engine fault samples, transfers that knowledge into rules, and then uses those rules for fault isolation. In addition, it is also capable of selecting appropriate measurements for fault isolation, dealing with uncertainty caused by measurement noise. Enhanced fault signatures, which are represented by the measurement deviations and their ranking pattern in terms of magnitude, are developed to make gas turbine faults easier to distinguish and hence make this fault isolation approach more effective. The new adaptation approach was applied to the off-design performance model adaptation of a gas turbine, while the new fault isolation approach was employed for fault isolation in a gas turbine. The results show that the new adaptation approach is very effective in improving the prediction accuracy of off- design performance models and the new fault isolation approach is not only effective in fault isolation but also in selecting measurements for isolation and generating fault isolation rules.

40|$|A Kalman filter-based {{approach}} for integrated on-line aircraft engine performance estimation and gas <b>path</b> <b>fault</b> diagnostics is presented. This technique is {{specifically designed for}} underdetermined estimation problems where there are more unknown system parameters representing deterioration and faults than available sensor measurements. A previously developed methodology is applied to optimally design a Kalman filter to estimate a vector of tuning parameters, appropriately sized to enable estimation. The estimated tuning parameters can then {{be transformed into a}} larger vector of health parameters representing system performance deterioration and fault effects. The results of this study show that basing fault isolation decisions solely on the estimated health parameter vector does not provide ideal results. Furthermore, expanding the number of the health parameters to address additional gas path faults causes a decrease in the estimation accuracy of those health parameters representative of turbomachinery performance deterioration. However, improved fault isolation performance is demonstrated through direct analysis of the estimated tuning parameters produced by the Kalman filter. This was found to provide equivalent or superior accuracy compared to the conventional fault isolation approach based on the analysis of sensed engine outputs, while simplifying online implementation requirements.

40|$|Gas <b>path</b> <b>fault</b> {{diagnosis}} {{involves the}} effective utilization of condition-based sensor signals along engine gas path to accurately identify engine performance failure. The rapid development of information processing technology {{has led to}} the use of multiple-source information fusion for fault diagnostics. Numerous efforts have been paid to develop data-based fusion methods, such as neural networks fusion, while little research has focused on fusion architecture or the fusion of different method kinds. In this paper, a data hierarchical fusion using improved weighted Dempster–Shaffer evidence theory (WDS) is proposed, and the integration of data-based and model-based methods is presented for engine gas-path fault diagnosis. For the purpose of simplifying learning machine typology, a recursive reduced kernel based extreme learning machine (RR-KELM) is developed to produce the fault probability, which is considered as the data-based evidence. Meanwhile, the model-based evidence is achieved using particle filter-fuzzy logic algorithm (PF-FL) by engine health estimation and component fault location in feature level. The outputs of two evidences are integrated using WDS evidence theory in decision level to reach a final recognition decision of gas-path fault pattern. The characteristics and advantages of two evidences are analyzed and used as guidelines for data hierarchical fusion framework. Our goal is that the proposed methodology provides much better performance of gas-path fault diagnosis compared to solely relying on data-based or model-based method. The hierarchical fusion framework is evaluated in terms to fault diagnosis accuracy and robustness through a case study involving fault mode dataset of a turbofan engine that is generated by the general gas turbine simulation.

40|$|Delay {{fault testing}} and at-speed testing {{are widely used}} to verify the timing of {{synchronous}} digital IC’s. The importance of these techniques is still growing because of the relevant IC’s parameters uncertainties which characterize the current technologies. In order to drive this process, several fault models and test generation techniques have been developed that target different trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. The largest fraction of these approaches is based upon gate level descriptions of the circuit. In case the basic building blocks are more complex than logic gates and their implementation is not known, functional level approaches have been proposed. For instance, {{this is the case}} for look-up tables based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and it may be a perspective for deep submicron circuits that exploit logic bricks as basic building blocks. This class of circuits has been referred to as macro or module based. In this context, the main activities performed during the tree years of my PhD are related to the timing failures problems in module-based CMOS VLSI circuits. The attention to module-based (or block-based) circuits follows the current VLSI physical design trends that attempt to limit the parametric failures due to the scaling of technology toward nanometric feature sizes. In such technologies, in fact, the traditional design paradigms that are based on small (i. e gate level) cells may produce high levels of variability, thus resulting in parametric defects. The use of highly regular cell structures, called logic bricks has been proposed to solve these problems thus increasing the yield of VLSI circuits. A brick comprises a logic function created from a small set of logic primitives that are mapped on to a micro-regular fabric. Such logic function is typically more complex that those implemented in traditional VLSI libraries. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology also exploits a module based design approach. Unlike logic bricks, FPGAs are completely programmable, because they are based on look up tables (a n-bit LUT can accomplish every n-bit function), but the drawback is related to the implementation of the LUT, that is unknown to designer and not optimized for regularity. In this scenario, the delay fault testing became a big issue, since {{it is very difficult to}} study a circuit built using modules whose implementation in not known, either for technological and for intellectual property reasons. Moreover, the aggressive timing policies used in today’s ICs make the need for delay fault testing more relevant. The main PhD activity, that will be explained in detail in this thesis, is related to a new method that we propose to generate test vectors for path delay faults in circuits based on modules. In particular, we consider the single path delay fault model in combinational circuits or in (enhanced) full-scan ones that are composed of functional blocks whose implementation is not known. In such circuits a <b>path</b> <b>fault</b> is detected by suitable conditions so that a test pair is able to propagate a transition through the path under test, in order to detect a path delay fault. In order to identify such conditions, we introduced a new signal representation that enables the use of boolean differential calculus. Also, additional conditions to prevent invalidation of tests by hazards have been identified. We suppose that the dynamic behavior of the block is modeled using input delays such as in the timing arc delay model. We target simple combinational blocks such as logic bricks, that are expected to present up to 8 - 10 inputs and a low logic depth. The used method is scalable, to generate conditions for path delay fault tests also at gate level. In order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach, I realized a software, written in C/C++, that permits to find out robust and non-robust test pairs, starting from the BLIF description of a module based circuit. Such a software uses a BDD description of the blocks’ functions on which we apply Boolean Differences to obtain local sensitization conditions at module level. Since there are circuits whose BDD structure may be very large and it may be inefficient (in some cases also infeasible) to treat it, we translate functions obtained at macros level to a CNF description. After that, a SAT solver generates the test pairs at circuit level starting from the conjunction of all the CNF functions. The software tool was used to verify the proposed approach on a set of benchmarks (both combinational or full-scan) from ITC’ 99 and ISCAS’ 85 sets. Such benchmarks allowed to show the feasibility of the proposed approach, although they are not fully representative of the target circuits for which the method was developed. Another significant work, carried out during my PhD period, also deal with testing of macro-based circuits, but it concerns specifically logic bricks. In particular, a method for high quality functional fault simulation and test generation for such circuits was conceived and a software tool that implements it was developed. For both the approaches, results showed the feasibility of them, but also highlighted possibilities to improve and extend the work done...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel Design for Testability {{technique}} to apply two pattern tests for <b>path</b> delay <b>fault</b> testing. Due to stringent timing requirements of deep-submicron VLSI chips, design-for-test schemes {{have to be}} tailored for detecting stuck-at as well as delay faults quickly and efficiently. Existing techniques such as enhanced scan add substantial hardware overhead, whereas techniques such as scan-shifting or functional justification make the test generation process complex and produce lower coverage for scan based designs as compared to non-scan designs. We exploit the characteristics of CMOS circuitry to enable the application of two-pattern tests. The proposed technique reduces the problem of <b>path</b> delay <b>fault</b> testing for scan based designs to that of <b>path</b> delay <b>fault</b> testing with complete accessibility to the combinational logic, and has minimal area overhead. The scheme also provides significant reduction in power during scan operation. 1...|$|R
