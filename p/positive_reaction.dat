40|$|Background: Multiple {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} diverse allergens in paediatric populations. Consensus is still lacking on which allergens are most commonly implicated in allergic contact dermatitis. Objectives: To evaluate {{the proportion of}} <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> for allergens tested in children and to identify allergens with <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> in at least 1 % of them. Methods: Systematic review of studies in PubMed (1966 - 2009) investigating allergens in at least 100 enrolled children. Proportions of <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> for each allergen were combined with fixed and random effects models across studies. Results: We included 48 studies with available data on 172 allergens. Each study tested a median of 2 allergens. Among the 95 allergens evaluated by at least two studies, 59 had estimates of <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> of at least 1 % by random effects calculations and for 21 of them the 95 % confidence interval ensured {{that the proportion of}} <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> was at least 1 %. The top five allergens tested by at least two studies included nickel sulphate, ammonium persulphate, gold, thimerosal and p-toluene diamine. For most allergens, the proportion of <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> was higher in studies published after 1995 than earlier studies (p= 0. 001). Conclusions: The meta-analysis offers guidance on which allergens are most prevalent in the paediatric population and should have priority for inclusion in standardized allergen series, in accordance with the history of each patient. ...|$|R

40|$|Explanation. Mantoux test is used {{to detect}} the tuberculous infection; however, low {{specificity}} of this method results in {{a high rate of}} false positive responses due to cross-reactions of PPD (protein purified derivate) antigens contained in many mycobacterial species and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) strains. New drug Diaskintest (DST) — recombinant protein CFP 10 -ESAT 6 produced by Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) /pCFP-ESAT proved to be the best acceptable diagnostic drug. The article was aimed at studying effectiveness of tuberculous recombinant allergen tests for detecting tuberculosis in the children and adolescents, who were registered in Moscow in 2013. Methods. Mantoux tests were used to examine 1, 420, 100 persons; <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> were observed in 1, 020, 000 children and adolescents (71, 8 %); 131, 361 (12. 9 %) of them were examined using DSTs. Results. <b>Positive</b> <b>reactions</b> to DST were observed in 3, 304 persons (2. 5 % of the persons with <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> to Mantoux test). The tuberculosis detection rate among the persons with <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> to Mantoux tests using 2 TU PPD-L (Leningrad Research Institute of Vaccines and Serums) is 0. 13 %, among the persons with <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> to DSTs — 4. 9 %, i. e. 40 times more often (p = 0. 000). Post-tuberculosis alterations were detected in 169 persons: in 0. 13 % of the persons with <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> to Mantoux tests using 2 TU PPD-L and in 5. 1 % of the persons with <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> to DSTs (p = 0. 000). Conclusion. Cohort studies conducted in Moscow demonstrated high effectiveness of Diaskintests for detecting tuberculosis in children and adolescents. High sensitivity of the method helps to detect {{the overwhelming majority of the}} persons with tuberculosis. </strong...|$|R

40|$|Acylated {{homoserine}} lactones (AHLs) are chemical {{signals that}} mediate population density-dependent (quorum-sensing) gene expression in numerous gram-negative bacteria. In this study, gram-negative bacilli isolated from catheters were screened for AHL production by a cross-feeding assay utilizing an AHL-responsive Agrobacterium tumefaciens reporter strain. <b>Positive</b> <b>reactions</b> {{were obtained from}} 14 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; negative or weakly <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> were recorded for isolates of five other species. P. aeruginosa biofilms were then produced on catheters in a physical model of the bladder. Sections of colonized all-silicone catheters gave <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> for the quorum-sensing signal molecules as did sections that had been cleaned of biofilm and autoclaved. Control sections of unused catheters were negative in the tests. Sections from four of nine catheters that had been freshly removed from patients gave <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> for AHLs. Cleaned autoclaved sections of three of these catheters also gave strongly <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> for AHLs. These results demonstrate that AHLs are produced by biofilms as they develop on the catheters both in vitro in the model and in vivo in the patient’s bladder. They represent the first demonstration of AHL production by biofilms in a clinical setting.

5|$|In 2013, {{leading up}} to the release of Tales of Symphonia Chronicles, Baba called Symphonia the most {{successful}} title in the series in the west thus far, although the series' main target audience was still in Japan. In an earlier interview, Baba commented that the team behind the series put a large amount of effort and development in keeping the series fresh while retaining the base elements across each installment. The <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> of gamers in the US to Symphonia influenced the way the various teams developed titles after that point. Speaking in 2014, production manager Denis Lee said that, since Symphonias release, the popularity of the series has grown. In response, Bandai Namco have focused on getting more entries out in western territories. Much of their research about what titles to release or develop in the future revolves around direct conversation with Tales series fans at gaming conventions and special events.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company's first public stock offering in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. The latter measure, and Disney's sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to a 1941 animators' strike which lasted five weeks. While a federal mediator from the National Labor Relations Board negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he knew would be unfavorable to the studio. As {{a result of the}} strikeand the financial state of the companyseveral animators left the studio, and Disney's relationship with other members of staff was permanently strained as a result. The strike temporarily interrupted the studio's next production, Dumbo (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and inexpensive manner; the film received a <b>positive</b> <b>reaction</b> from audiences and critics alike.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} several groups have used {{serological}} methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. In {{the present study}} 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (Omniserum). Representatives of the following species were included: Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, S. intermedius, S. lactis, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. suis, and Aerococcus viridans. Serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. Fifteen (12 %) of the strains gave <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> by all three methods. <b>Positive</b> <b>reactions</b> were also observed with another 32 strains (26 %) {{with two of the}} methods, whereas 37 strains (30 %) gave <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> by just one technique.

Latex agglutination gave <b>positive</b> <b>reactions</b> with 26 (21 %) strains compared with 57 (46 %) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51 %) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. Absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. These findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci...|$|R

The première was controversial, in particular because it depicted the character Nathan, aged 15, in sexual intercourse with an older man; the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom received 136 complaints and the series received criticism from Hunnam's parents and from activist Mary Whitehouse. The controversy was amplified when the sponsor Beck's withdrew after several episodes and homosexual activists complained that the series was not representative of gay culture.
