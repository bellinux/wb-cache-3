5|$|The Grand Prix formula {{was changed}} again in 1938, abandoning the {{previous}} system of weight restrictions and instead limiting <b>piston</b> <b>displacement.</b> Mercedes-Benz' new car, the W154, proved its abilities at the French Grand Prix, where von Brauchitsch won ahead of Caracciola and Lang {{to make it}} a Mercedes 1–2–3. Caracciola won two races in the 1938 season: the Swiss Grand Prix and the Coppa Acerbo; finished second in three: the French, German and Pau Grands Prix; and third in two: the Tripoli and Italian Grands Prix, to take the European Championship for the third and final time. The highlight of Caracciola's season was his win in the pouring rain at the Swiss Grand Prix.

40|$|Pneumatic {{actuators}} are preferred for low {{to medium}} power requirements {{due to their}} desirable features like large power to weight ratio, low cost and safe working medium. Position control of pneumatic actuators is however difficult due to inherent nonlinearity-contributing factors. Therefore, position control of pneumatic actuators {{have been found to}} be a challenging task using fixed gain controllers. Sliding mode control can be used to overcome this difficulty. Further, the nonlinear response of pneumatic actuators under variable loading conditions makes it a fit case for using heuristic control based on the knowledge of the system behaviour. This may be done by using fuzzy logic based control approach. In the present work, a hybrid controller was synthesized using fuzzy logic control and sliding mode control for position control of a pneumatic actuation system. The quantitative results emphasized that hybrid FLC-SMC controller exhibited effective position control for pneumatic actuation system as fuzzy logic control was effective for combinations of lower payloads and smaller <b>piston</b> <b>displacements,</b> whereas sliding mode controller was effective for combinations of higher payloads and larger <b>piston</b> <b>displacements...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{double acting}} {{cylinder}} operation has been fully monitored in its key functional parameters, focused on characterization of end-of-stroke cushioning and starting phases. Being the cylinder performance reliant in the piston constructive geometry, the number and location of piston circumferential grooves is a significant parameter affecting the internal cushioning system performance. An eddy current displacement sensor assembled in the piston allows assessment of <b>piston</b> radial <b>displacement</b> inside the cylinder tube, which is directly related with the studied operating phases. Due to such 3 D <b>displacements,</b> the <b>piston</b> becomes as an active and self-adjusting element along the functional cycle of the cylinder.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper investigates the possibility of precise experimental identification of steady damper characteristics. The paper considers velocity sensitive and nominally symmetric hydraulic dampers. The proposed identification methodology is based on a piecewise constant velocity excitation. One goal of the paper is to analyze the transient nature of the damper response in the context of finite permissible <b>piston</b> <b>displacements</b> and first order transient effects due to elastic elements in the damper structure. The proposed methodology is formalized in a framework suitable for experimental design, allowing the detailed study of steady state damper performance. The second goal of the paper is to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed methodology. It is applied to the case of a safety critical hydraulic damper used for stability augmentation in production helicopters. The research work presented shows that this methodology can be used for identification in a finite but relatively wide range of piston velocities. The case study demonstrates a successful example of damper property identification where the resulting characteristics prove useful as a tool for model validation. Finally, the identification results are related to the results of a more traditional test with harmonic piston excitation...|$|R

The PAAM {{consists of a}} mirror supported by flexures allowing the mirror to rotate with a maximum stroke of ± 1 mrad. The mirror is actuated in 0. 14 μrad steps by two redundant linear Piezo LEGS ® actuators driving a sine-bar.
