5|$|Several {{missions}} were {{proposed to}} demonstrate methods of landing the Gemini spacecraft on land. The spacecraft {{had originally been}} designed to land using a <b>paraglider</b> {{and a set of}} skis or wheels, however this was abandoned in favor of splashdowns under parachutes due to delays in development and failures during testing. As the proposed Big Gemini spacecraft would have landed this way, McDonnell Aircraft asked NASA to consider flying standard Gemini spacecraft with the <b>paraglider</b> in order to test the system before it would be required operationally.|$|E
5|$|Big G {{would have}} made {{landings}} on land, using a parasail or <b>paraglider</b> to guide it onto a runway or dry lake, {{such as the one}} at Edwards Air Force Base. It would have landed using skids derived from the North American X-15.|$|E
