5|$|In the 1880s, Esteban Martínez, {{the parish}} priest of the ruined church, {{approached}} Spanish architect Genaro Palacios with a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> fire and earthquake-resistant structure made entirely of steel. Palacios completed {{a design that}} fused Earthquake Baroque with the Neo-Gothic style. His final design {{was said to have}} been inspired by the famed Gothic Burgos Cathedral in Burgos, Spain.|$|E

5|$|After its {{announcement}} in 1995, the project stalled because P Associates {{was unable to}} find investors to finance the project. Investors were skeptical that luxury residential apartments outside the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in Center City could be successful. The delay allowed another developer to announce an agreement to acquire the property. In March 1999, Chicago-based developer the Barton Group announced its <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> 37-story, 322-unit luxury residential tower. The Barton Group's plan would also incorporate the PSFS headquarters building and York Row into the tower.|$|E
5|$|Paul Thiry was the fair's chief architect; he also {{designed}} the Coliseum building. Among the other {{architects of the}} fair, Seattle-born Minoru Yamasaki received {{one of his first}} major commissions to build the United States Science Pavilion. Yamasaki would later design New York's World Trade Center. Victor Steinbrueck and John Graham, Jr. designed the Space Needle. Hideki Shimizu and Kazuyuki Matsushita designed the original International Fountain. Despite the <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> permanent civic center, more than half the structures built for the fair were torn down more or less immediately after it ended.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board {{announced}} a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned bridges connecting artificial islands, {{to be built}} on the Safety Valve and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. Áleman was expected to donate the right-of-way for a road running {{down the middle of}} the island to the first bridge at Cape Florida. With the prospect of a major highway passing through his property, Áleman rushed to prepare it for development: he had it completely cleared, leveled and filled in. A seawall was constructed along the western (Biscayne Bay) side of the Cape Florida property.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{to create}} a {{supercomputer}} capable of 20 petaFLOPS at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) originated {{as far back as}} 2005, when Jaguar was built. Titan will itself be replaced by an approximately 200 petaFLOPS system in 2016 as part of ORNL's plan to operate an exascale (1000 petaFLOPS to 1 exaFLOPS) machine by 2020. The initial <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new 15,000 square meter (160,000 ft2) building for Titan, was discarded in favor of using Jaguar's existing infrastructure. The precise system architecture was not finalized until 2010, although a deal with Nvidia to supply the GPUs was signed in 2009. Titan was first announced at the private ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference (SC10) on November 16, 2010, and was publicly announced on October 11, 2011, as {{the first phase of the}} Titan upgrade began.|$|E
5|$|The first {{healthcare}} structure, the Santa Casa da Misericórdia da Póvoa de Varzim (Holy House of Mercy), {{opened in}} 1756. The hospitals {{of the city}} are the São Pedro Pescador Hospital (state-run) in Largo das Dores and the privately held Hospital da Luz Póvoa de Varzim (notable private hospital previously known as Clipóvoa) in Rua Manuel I street. The public hospital suffers from lack of bed spaces. Due to this, it underwent expansion works {{and there is an}} ongoing <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> modern hospital in the border between the cities of Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde, to serve the population of both municipalities. The Centro de Saúde da Póvoa de Varzim (Health Centre) is a public primary care building which has extensions in the main suburbs.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, a 24-year-old Hope is {{leader of}} the {{scientific}} expedition group known as the Academy {{a decade after the}} events of Final Fantasy XIII. He helps Noel and Serah in their journey to find Lightning when they arrive in his time. Other than knowing that time travel is possible and wishing to undo events of the past, Hope is planning on reviving Cocoon with a different power source. Originally planning to create an artificial fal'Cie, he is dissuaded upon seeing a vision of Serah fighting his creation. He and his assistant Alyssa Zaidelle then use a time capsule to go 387 years into the future to oversee Hope's New Cocoon Project, a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> man-made Cocoon in preparation for Cocoon's destined fall in the next century. When the old Cocoon does fall, Hope and Sazh manage to rescue Vanille and Fang from the crystal pillar before it crumbles.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 2014 season, the Sounds, Metro Nashville, and the State of Tennessee {{finalized}} a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new ballpark {{to replace}} Greer Stadium {{at the beginning}} of the 2015 season. On August 27, 2014, the Sounds hosted the final game at Greer Stadium, an 8–5 loss to the Sacramento River Cats. In his only plate appearance, Nashville catcher Lucas May struck out swinging with a full count and the bases loaded to end the game. The announced attendance at the game was a standing-room-only crowd of 11,067, the first sellout since 2010, and the largest crowd since 2007. The team, led by veteran minor league manager Rick Sweet, finished the season with a 76–67 record, in second place, two-and-a-half games behind Memphis. Jimmy Nelson, the Brewers' top prospect at the start of the season, was elected PCL Pitcher of the Year; he received all but one of the votes. The Sounds severed ties with the Brewers, with whom they had had the longest affiliation in franchise history, after the 2014 season citing poor on-field performance from recent Brewers Triple-A teams.|$|E
5|$|The City of Miami {{responded to}} the {{hurricane}} by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. The Miami Herald declared {{two weeks after the}} storm that almost everything in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the American Red Cross was able to collect only $3million of $5million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20million <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it; more than $14million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.|$|E
5|$|As the 1995–96 season concluded, John McNamara {{sold the}} club to Premier Computers, headed by Alan McGrath. McGrath {{unveiled}} a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> state-of-the-art stadium in the Dublin southwest suburb of Tallaght, and employed Pat Byrne as commercial manager. However, {{after a couple of}} weeks and a loss in {{the first game of the}} season, O’Neill was dismissed, while Eviston resigned in solidarity. Byrne was appointed manager of the side playing in Tolka Park once again, and they struggled through the season with the League's joint top scorer, Tony Cousins playing a leading role in avoiding relegation. In May 1997, Alan McGrath resigned as club chairman and was replaced by Brian Kearney, also of Premier Computers, who succeeded in acquiring planning permission for the new stadium in January 1998. However, the permission was delayed by objections until November 1998, by which time Joe Colwell had replaced Kearney as chairman and ended Premier Computers' involvement with the club. On the pitch, Mick Byrne guided Rovers to an Intertoto Cup spot in 1997–98 and an eighth-place finish, the next season. He was replaced by Damien Richardson, who managed the club during their stay at Morton Stadium before his dismissal in April 2002, after a disagreement with Colwell. By that time, a half-built shell of a stadium stood at the Tallaght site; Mulden International Ltd, recruited by Colwell to complete the project, had pulled out of building the stadium. They leased it to a separate company, transferring the responsibility, and focused on four acres that they had retained for themselves.|$|E

5|$|A reformist, Dunstan brought {{profound}} {{change to}} South Australian society. His socially progressive administration saw Aboriginal land rights recognised, homosexuality decriminalised, {{the first female}} judge appointed, the first non-British governor, Sir Mark Oliphant, and later, the first indigenous governor Sir Douglas Nicholls. He enacted consumer protection laws, reformed and expanded the public education and health systems, abolished the death penalty, relaxed censorship and drinking laws, created a ministry for the environment, enacted anti-discrimination law, and implemented electoral reforms such as the overhaul of the Legislative Council of parliament, lowered the voting age to 18, enacted universal suffrage, and completely abolished malapportionment, changes which gave him a less hostile parliament and allowed him to enact his reforms. He established Rundle Mall, enacted measures to protect buildings of historical heritage, and encouraged a flourishing of the arts, with support for the Adelaide Festival Centre, the State Theatre Company, {{and the establishment of}} the South Australian Film Corporation. He encouraged cultural exchanges with Asia, multiculturalism and an increase in the state's culinary awareness and sophistication. He is recognised for his role in reinvigorating the social, artistic and cultural life of South Australia during his nine years in office, remembered as the Dunstan Decade. However, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan's pet projects, a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new city at Monarto to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan's administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a judicial investigation. In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as unsubstantiated rumours of corruption and personal impropriety. Dunstan became increasingly short-tempered, and the strain was increased by the death of his second wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he would live for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for progressive social policy.|$|E
