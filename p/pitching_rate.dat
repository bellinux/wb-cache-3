However, {{the impact of the}} <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> on crucial fermentation and beer quality parameters has never been assessed systematically. In this study, five pitching rates were applied to lab-scale fermentations to investigate its impact on the yeast physiology and beer quality. The fermentation rate increased significantly and the net yeast growth was lowered with increasing <b>pitching</b> <b>rate,</b> without affecting significantly the viability and the vitality of the yeast population. The build-up of unsaturated fatty acids in the initial phase of the fermentation was repressed when higher yeast concentrations were pitched. The expression levels of the genes HSP 104 and HSP 12 and the concentration of trehalose were higher with increased pitching rates, suggesting a moderate exposure to stress in case of higher cell concentrations. The influence of <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> on aroma compound production was rather limited, with the exception of total diacetyl levels, which strongly increased with the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate.</b> These results demonstrate that most aspects of the yeast physiology and flavour balance are not significantly or negatively affected when the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> is changed.

40|$|The simple {{canonical}} {{problem of}} a two-dimensional wing profile undergoing a single linear pitch-up/pitch-down maneuver in a uniform flow is studied computationally with direct numerical simulation of the Navier–Stokes equations. The effects of <b>pitch</b> <b>rate</b> and Reynolds number are both studied, for both elliptical and thin flat-plate profiles. In par-ticular, flows at Reynolds numbers of 102 – 104 are computed, and the resulting lift, drag and vortex shedding are examined. It is found that, during the pitch-up, all forces increase monotonically with increasing <b>pitch</b> <b>rate,</b> and that large <b>pitch</b> <b>rates</b> produce a net thrust and negative lift {{during most of the}} pitch-down interval. The pitch-up lift is notably larger as Reynolds number increases. A flat plate generally produces greater lift than an elliptical wing, at the cost of greater drag. At low <b>pitch</b> <b>rates,</b> a large leading-edge vortex is formed during the pitch-up and is shed during the pitch-down, and wake vortices are weak and relatively diffuse. In contrast, high <b>pitch</b> <b>rates</b> lead to stronger, more compact leading-edge and wake vortices. The wake vortices exhibit distinct pairing, and the leading-edge vortex shows less tendency to separate. Surface pressure distributions, which are used to connect the force generation with these shedding observations, confirm the important role of the leading-edge vortex in lift generation. During pitch-down, at low <b>pitch</b> <b>rates</b> the lift from the leading-edge vortex overcomes the downforce to produce positive lift, whereas downforce dominates at high <b>pitch</b> <b>rates.</b> Vorticity fields at Reynolds number 104 compare very well with corresponding results of OL (AIAA Paper 2009 - 3686) in the companion experimental study.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate cavitating flows around a pitching hydrofoil via combined physical and numerical studies. The aims are to (1) improve the understanding of the interplay between unsteady cavitating flow, hydrofoil motion, and hydrodynamic performance, (2) quantify the influence of <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> on subcavitating and cavitating responses, and (3) quantify the influence of cavitation on the hydrodynamic load coefficients and surrounding flow structures. Results are presented for a NACA 66 hydrofoil undergoing controlled, slow (α̇ = 6 ∘/s) and fast (α̇ = 63 ∘/s) pitching motions from α = 0 ° to α = 15 ° and back to α = 0 ° for both subcavitating and cavitating conditions at a moderate Reynolds number of Re = 750 [*] 000. The experimental studies were conducted in a cavitation tunnel at the French Naval Academy, France. The numerical simulations are performed by solving the incompressible, multiphase Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations via the commercial code CFX using a transport equation-based cavitation model; a modified k-ω SST turbulence model is used to account for the effect of local compressibility on the turbulent eddy viscosity. The results showed that increases in the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> suppressed laminar to turbulent transition, delayed stall, and significantly modified post-stall behavior. Cavitation inception at the leading edge modified the pressure distribution, which in turn significantly changed the interaction between leading edge and trailing edge vortices, and hence the magnitude as well as the frequency of the load fluctuations. For a fixed cavitation number, increases in <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> lead to increase in cavitation volume, which in turn changed the cavity shedding frequencies and significantly modified the hydrodynamic loads. Inversely, the leading edge cavitation observed for the low pitching velocity case tends to stabilize the stall because of the decrease of the pressure gradient due to the formation of the cavity. The results showed strong correlation between the cavity and vorticity structures, which suggest that the inception, growth, collapse and shedding of sheet/cloud cavities are important mechanisms for vorticity production and modification...|$|E

One of these promising strategies could be the increase of suspended yeast cells in the reactor. Therefore, the fermentation characteristics of 11 lager yeast strains were studied in normal pitched worts (20 × 106 cells/ mL) (LD) and in worts with a four-fold higher <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> (HD). The fermentation rate was 2 - 4 times increased when high initial cell levels were used.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{exemplary}} {{results on the}} influence of two fundamental unsteady parameters, the reduced frequency k and the non-dimensional <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> α+, on the transition from a steady to an unsteady flow field around the reference airfoil BAC 3 - 11 /RES/ 30 / 21 are presented using experimental and numerical techniques. The tools used are described and their results verified with each other. On the experimental side, water tunnel experiments are conducted using particle-image-velocimetry (PIV) and strain-gauge-balance (SGB) measurement techniques. The experimental results are enhanced by two-dimensional laminar unsteady numerical Navier-Stokes simulations of the experiments with a state of the art code from the Featflow package. The numerical simulations are found to agree well with experimental results, despite three-dimensional effects and a relatively high Reynolds number of Rec = 16000. An influence of the reduced frequency on the lift coefficient at a local non-dimensional <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> value of α+ = 0 for the relevant range is not detected, while for the drag and the pitching moment a decrease and an increase respectively is observed. Nevertheless a phase difference for the lift with increasing reduced frequency was calculated, which appears at least above k = 0. 14 and indicates unsteady effects. The same was observed for the pitching moment. The effects of the airfoil camber are clearly seen dur-ing the phase of negative angle of attack, inducing leading and trailing edge separation.

40|$|Vertical Takeoff-and-Landing (VTOL) Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) {{provide a}} {{versatile}} operational platform which combines {{the capabilities of}} fixed wing and rotary wing MAVs. In order to improve performance of these vehicles, {{a better understanding of}} the rapid transition between horizontal and vertical flight is required. This study examines the flow structures around the Mini-Vertigo VTOL MAV using flow visualization techniques. This will gives an understanding of the flow structures which dominate the flight dynamics of rapid pitching maneuvers. This study consists of three objectives: develop an experimental facility, use flow visualization to investigate the flow around the experimental subject during pitching, and analyze the results. The model used for testing features a low aspect ratio (AR), low Reynolds number (Re) Zimmerman planform wing with two contra-rotating propellers in a tractor configuration. The experimental facility, located at the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at The University of Arizona, consists of: a closed loop open test section wind tunnel capable of airspeeds up to 15 m/s and controlled with a variable frequency drive (VFD); a power source and wire to generate vapor from a mixture of turbine oil, petroleum jelly, and iron powder, which is placed across the wind tunnel nozzle outlet; a five axis robotic arm mounted below the test section capable of controlling the experimental subject for pitching maneuvers; and, a pair of video cameras capable of recording the flow visualization at 600 frames per second. The flow within the wind tunnel was carefully examined in order to insure that the experimental subject was placed within a region of flow unaffected by boundary effects and that there were no significant disturbances or oscillations within the flow. The flow around the experimental subject was studied in both static and dynamic testing. For the static tests, the angle of attack (AOA) of the experimental subject was varied across a range of AOA from 15 to 70 degrees. For each range of AOA, the Re was varied to 10700, 22600, and 35500, and advance ratio (J) was varied from undefined, 0. 60, to 0. 47. Several conclusions can be drawn from the static testing. The flow is dominated by the propeller slipstream effects. The slipstream drastically delayed leading edge (LE) separation and vortex shedding. It also causes flow to be either deflected downward into the slipstream or to deflect outward towards the wing tip before passing over the LE. The slipstream strength also increases the turbulence in the slipstream and relative velocity of the flow at the wing surface compared to freestream. The Re affects the LE (visible only without slipstream) and trailing edge (TE) vortex shedding frequencies, increased Re increases the frequency. Additionally, it appears that the non-dimensional LE and TE vortex shedding frequencies are constant at a value of 0. 216, irrespective of both Re and advance ratio. This is important because it means that these observations are likely valid across a broad range of flight conditions. Dynamic testing also varied the advance ratio and the Re. It also varied the reduced frequency. Both positive and negative pitching was examined. Many of the conclusions drawn were the same as those from static testing. Increasing the Re increased the vortex shedding frequency. The slipstream delayed LE separation and caused significant deflection downward and towards the wingtip, as well as increasing turbulence and relative flow speed at the top surface prior to separation. Dynamic testing also found that in the presence of the slipstream, increased Re decreases the AOA of LE separation, while without the slipstream, increased Re increases the AOA of LE separation. In addition, the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> has several effects on the flow. For positive pitching, increasing the pitch rate decreases the AOA of separation and for negative pitching; increasing the pitch rate has no apparent effect on the AOA of separation. This is contrary to expectations. Previous study 1 has shown that increasing the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> delays stall and nose down pitching hastens stall. Additionally, greater positive <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> slightly increases the TE vortex shedding frequency. In the absence of a slipstream, LE and TE vortex-shedding frequency are generally the same. Some interesting phenomena were found at the LE. In the presence of a pulsating slipstream from the propellers, the LE separation bubble oscillates in both height and length. It does so at the same frequency as the propeller rotation and is due to variation in the flow speed at the LE. During pitch down maneuvers, the flow reattaches at the LE first and then the region of attached flow moves aft, opposite of the characteristics of pitch up. With only minimal variation, the non-dimensional TE vortex shedding frequency remains constant at an average value of 0. 229. However, it appears that increasing the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> increases this value slightly. Re and advance ratio have no appreciable effect on this data. It is therefore possible to extend this result to a large range of flight conditions. A comparison of the static and dynamic testing resulted in several findings that correlated very well with previous research on this model. During positive, nose-up, pitching, the increase in lift found previously was due to the increased downward deflection of the flow and the delay of stall was due to the delay in LE separation. The opposite effects were found in negative, nose-down, pitching. There was disagreement in the findings based on the size of the turbulent separation wake and the increase and decrease in drag. Positive pitching was found to increase the drag on the model however positive pitching reduces the size of the turbulent separation wake which should decrease drag. The increase in downward flow deflection caused by <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> was significantly less than that due to the slipstream. Therefore the increase in lift due to the slipstream is greater than that due to pitching. The flow around the Mini-Vertigo VTOL MAV is dominated by the slipstream from its propellers. The slipstream delays LE separation and causes drastic deflection in the flow. While the frequency of the vortices shed from the LE and TE varies with flow speed, the non-dimensional frequency does not. It does, however, vary slightly with the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate.</b> These results are applicable across a wide range of flight conditions...|$|E

The variables included in this study were the primary fermentation temperature, wort concentration (extract) and yeast <b>pitching</b> <b>rate.</b> Static fermentations were carried out anaerobically in 2 L tall tubes (EBC recommendation for small scale brewing fermentations) with 15, 18 and 22 ºP wort, at constant temperature of 12, 15 and 18 ºC. The yeast was grown aerobically at 27 ºC in 15 ºP wort (saturated with air) and collect by filtration to inoculate by mass at different pitching rates of 12, 18 and 22 million cells/ml. Fermentations were monitored daily measuring the ethanol, extract, pH, temperature, biomass in suspension and viability. At the end of the primary fermentation, the green beer was analysed concerning diacetil, esters and high alcohols by gas chromatography. Fermentation data were statistically treated in order to obtain an optimum approach for the studied parameters. For statistical proposes, the fermentation performance was measured by ethanol produced, apparent extract and the fermentation time. Although the temperature has a positive effect on the indicators of the fermentation performance, the wort concentration has not a positive effect for all indicators. When the wort has higher concentration {{at the beginning of the}} fermentation, as expected, the fermentation takes longer to be finished with more ethanol produced.

Gene deletion of the HSP 26 gene in distiller's yeast revealed that four copies were present, and ploidy analysis confirmed that distiller's yeast indeed is a tetraploid strain. The deletion of the HSP 26 gene did not influence yeast sensitivity against lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol or oxidative stress.

Above this level, production problems such as slow or stuck fermentations and poor yeast viability occur. Ethanol toxicity has been cited as the main cause, as brewers' yeasts are reported to tolerate only 7 to 9 % (vol/vol) ethanol. The inhibitory effect of high osmotic pressure has also been implicated. In this report, it is demonstrated that the factor limiting the production of high levels of ethanol by brewing yeasts is actually a nutritional deficiency.

40|$|During Aqua launch support, {{attitude}} analysts noticed several anomalies in Onboard Computer (OBC) {{rates and}} in rates computed by the ground Attitude Determination System (ADS). These included: 1) periodic jumps in the OBC <b>pitch</b> <b>rate</b> every 2 minutes; 2) spikes in ADS <b>pitch</b> <b>rate</b> every 4 minutes; 3) close agreement between <b>pitch</b> <b>rates</b> computed by ADS and those derived from telemetered OBC quaternions (in {{contrast to the}} step-wise pattern observed for telemetered OBC rates); 4) spikes of +/- 10 milliseconds in telemetered IRU integration time every 4 minutes (despite the fact that telemetered time tags of any two sequential IRU measurements were always 1 second apart from each other). An analysis presented in the paper explains this anomalous behavior by a small average offset of about 0. 5 +/- 0. 05 microsec in the time interval between two sequential accumulated angle measurements. It is shown that errors in the estimated pitch angle due to neglecting the aforementioned variations in the integration time interval by the OBC is within +/- 2 arcseconds.

40|$|The {{volumetric}} {{productivity of}} the beer fermentation process can be increased by using a higher <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> (i. e., higher inoculum size). However, the decreased yeast net growth observed in these high cell density fermentations can {{have a negative impact}} on the physiological stability throughout subsequent yeast generations. The use of different oxygen conditions (wort aeration, wort oxygenation, yeast preoxygenation) was investigated to improve the growth yield during high cell density fermentations and yeast metabolic and physiological parameters were assessed systematically. Together with a higher extent of growth (dependent on the applied oxygen conditions), the fermentation power and the formation of unsaturated fatty acids were also affected. Wort oxygenation had a significant decreasing effect on the formation of esters, which was caused by a decreased expression of the alcohol acetyl transferase gene ATF 1, compared with the other conditions. Lower glycogen and trehalose levels at the end of fermentation were observed in case of the high cell density fermentations with oxygenated wort and the reference fermentation. The expression levels of BAP 2 (encoding the branched chain amino acid permease), ERG 1 encoding squalene epoxidase), and the stress responsive gene HSP 12 were predominantly influenced by the high cell concentrations, while OLE 1 (encoding the fatty acid desaturase) and the oxidative stress responsive genes SOD 1 and CTT 1 were mainly affected by the oxygen availability per cell. These results demonstrate that optimisation of high cell density fermentations could be achieved by improving the oxygen conditions, without drastically affecting the physiological condition of the yeast and beer quality. status: publishe...|$|E

The study of the effect of the environmental variables namely wort concentration, temperature, <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> and oxygenation was performed in EBC- 2 L tubes. The results obtained demonstrate that very high gravity worts at 22 ºP can be fermented in the same period of time as 15 ºP wort, by raising the temperature to 18 ºC, the initial oxygen level to about 22 ppm and increasing the <b>pitching</b> <b>rate</b> to 22 million cells per ml. By using this strategy, a finished beer at 11. 5 ºP extract will increase the volumetric brewing capacity (by dilution) by 91 % for the 22 ºP wort, comparing to 30 % for 15 ºP wort. The effect of the operation variables on the most important aromatic compounds was limited. Within the range of tested conditions, the concentration of the higher alcohols did not change beyond the respective thresholds as well as the acetaldehyde concentration.

This suggests that beer produced with VHG worts would acquire a fruity aroma when compared with beer produced from standard gravity worts. The second studied approach to overcome VHG limitations corresponded to the nutritional supplementation of the yeast slurry. For this, several simple and complex nutrients reported in the literature as being relevant in the fermentation performance were tested, and the ones with higher positive effect were selected. The combination of linoleic acid (6 mg. g- 1), MgCl 2 (5 g. l- 1) and Tween 80 (6 mg. g- 1) on the supplementation of the yeast slurry during 24 h before pitching the wort produced higher ethanol concentration (11. 7 %, v/v) than the unsuplemented yeast at the same conditions (10. 1 %, v/v). The scale-up of the studied conditions to pilot plant fermentations indicated that although the results obtained in EBC tall tubes are extremely useful to compare brewing conditions, the absolute profile of an industrial scale fermentation would be different. In large 250 L fermentations, many physico-chemical indicators were different between a beer produced from a VHG wort at 18 ºC and a beer from a standard 15 ºP wort fermented at 12 ºC. However, in the sensorial triangular test those beers were indistinguishable. This is an important indicator of the feasability of a VHG brewing at 18 ºC with 22 ºP wort to produce an identical beer as the one produced in standard conditions. The study of the cropped yeast indicated that the yeast settled {{on the bottom of the}} cylindroconical fermenter after a lager brewing fermentation can be in similar physiologic conditions. The lab-fermentation trials using samples collected along the yeast cropping presented similar profiles. However, the fractionation of the yeast slurry by density indicated that several types of cells with distinct physiological state are present in the brewer’s storage tank. This work suggests that the last formed cells at the end of the fermentation may have their physiological state compromised by the absence of nutrients. Another finding suggests that the proportion of young virgin cells in the cropped yeast may increase during brewing fermentations. This fact can have an important impact on the yeast slurry recycling procedure widely used by the brewers. A presente tese teve como objetivo principal a otimização do desempenho fermentativo de uma estirpe de levedura cervejeira para produção de cerveja a partir de mosto de muito alto extrato. Neste estudo foram abordadas duas estratégias para ultrapassar as limitações impostas pelo stress inerente às fermentações de mosto concentrado. A primeira abordagem consistiu na otimização das variáveis ambientais influentes na atividade da levedura. A segunda estratégia baseou-se no pré-acondicionamento nutricional da levedura antes de ser usada para inocular o mosto cervejeiro. O estudo das variáveis ambientais de fermentação nomeadamente a concentração do mosto, a temperatura e as taxas de oxigenação e de inóculo foi efetuado em tubos EBC- 2 L com a levedura cervejeira. Os resultados obtidos demonstraram que o mosto de alto extrato a 22 ºP pode ser fermentado no mesmo período de tempo que as fermentações de mosto a 15 ºP aumentando a temperatura de 12 ºC para 18 ºC, o oxigénio dissolvido para 22 ppm e o inóculo para 22 milhões de células por mililitro. A cerveja após diluição para um extrato de 11. 5 ºP aumentaria a capacidade volumétrica em 91 % for 22 ºP, em comparação com o aumento de 30 % para o mosto a 15 ºP. Foi ainda demonstrado que o efeito das condições ótimas de produtividade no perfil aromático é limitado. A variação na concentração de ésteres não ultrapassa o limite de deteção nos compostos analisados, embora o aumento na concentração de ésteres indique que a cerveja produzida nestas condições apresenta um aroma mais frutado quando comparado com a cerveja produzida nas condições padrão. A segunda alternativa estudada para ultrapassar as limitações mosto VHG correspondeu à suplementação nutricional da levedura. Para tal foi efetuado um levantamento de nutrientes simples ou compostos referenciados na literatura como influentes no desempenho fermentativo, seguido de um rastreio daqueles com maior impacto positivo na fermentação. A combinação dos nutrientes como o ácido linoleico (6 mg. g- 1), MgCl 2 (5 g. l- 1) e Tween 80 (6 mg. g- 1) usada para acondicionamento da pasta de levedura durante 24 h antes de inocular permitiu uma concentração final em etanol de 11. 7 %. A fermentação nas mesmas condições com levedura não suplementada produziu 10. 1 % em etanol. Os estudos de aumento de escala das fermentações cervejeiras para a escala piloto indicaram que embora os resultados obtidos em tubos EBC- 2 L são uteis para comparação de condições experimentais, os perfis absolutos de uma fermentação à escala industrial serão diferentes. Em fermentações com volume de 250 L, vários parâmetros físicoquímicos apresentaram diferenças entre a cerveja produzida por mosto VHG a 18 ºC e a cerveja produzida a partir de mosto 15 ºP a 12 ºC. Contudo, na análise sensorial triangular essas cervejas foram consideradas idênticas sendo um excelente indicador da viabilidade da produção de uma cerveja por fermentação de alto extrato idêntica à produzida nas condições padrão. O estudo da levedura recolhida após a fermentação cervejeira sugere que a levedura sedimentada no cone do fermentador após a fermentação cervejeira do tipo lager pode encontrar-se em condições fisiológicas similares. Os ensaios fermentativos laboratoriais realizados com as amostras de leveduras retiradas ao longo da remoção da levedura do cone para o tanque de armazenamento apresentaram perfis similares de desempenho. Contudo, o fraccinamento de amostras de levedura homogeneizada do tanque de armazenamento de acordo com a densidade demonstrou a existência de diferentes tipos de células relativamente ao estado fisiologico e ao número da geração. Este trabalho sugere que as últimas células capazes de se dividirem durante a fermentação cervejeira possam ter baixo estado fisiológico causado pela ausência de nutrientes. Os resultados indicam ainda que a proporção de células virgens na levedura recolhida poderá aumentar ao longo da fermentação. Este facto terá um impacto importante na prática corrente da indústria cervejeira na reutilização da levedura entre ciclos fermentativos...|$|E
40|$|Mead is a {{traditional}} drink that contains 8 % and 18 % (v/v) of ethanol, resulting from the alcoholic fermentation of diluted honey by yeasts. Mead fermentation is a time-consuming process {{and the quality of}} the final product is highly variable. Therefore, the present investigation had two main objectives: first, to determine the adequate inoculum size of two commercial wine-making strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the optimisation of mead fermentation; and second, to determine if an increase in yeast pitching rates in batch fermentations altered the resulting aroma profiles. Minor differences were detected in the growth kinetics between the two strains at the lowest <b>pitching</b> <b>rate.</b> With increasing pitching rates net growth of the strain ICV D 47 progressively decreased, whereas for the QA 23 the increasing inoculum size had no influence on its net growth. The time required to reach the same stage of fermentation ranged from 24 to 96 h depending on the inoculum size. The final aroma composition was dependent on the yeast strain and inoculum size. Fourteen of the twenty-seven volatile compounds quantified could contribute to mead aroma and flavour because their concentrations rose above their respective thresholds. The formation of these compounds was particularly pronounced at low pitching rates, except in mead fermented by strain ICV D 47, at 106 CFUs/mL. The esters isoamyl acetate, ethyl octanoate and ethyl hexanoate were the major powerful odourants found in the meads. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that yeast strain and inoculum size can favourably impact mead’s flavour and aroma profiles.
