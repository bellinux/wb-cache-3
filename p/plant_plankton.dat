50|$|Flamingos filter-feed on brine {{shrimp and}} blue-green algae. Their bills are {{specially}} adapted to separate mud and silt {{from the food}} they eat, and are uniquely used upside-down. The filtering of food items is assisted by hairy structures called lamellae which line the mandibles, and the large rough-surfaced tongue. The pink or reddish color of flamingos comes from carotenoids in their diet of animal and <b>plant</b> <b>plankton.</b> These carotenoids are broken down into pigments by liver enzymes. The source of this varies by species, and affects the saturation of color.

40|$|In {{the present}} study changes in {{ecosystems}} of the Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Baltic Sea after the invasion of ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi were investigated. Excessive increase in <b>plant</b> <b>plankton</b> {{as a result of}} antrophogenic eutrophication leads to a shift in mesozooplankton com¬position, which is the main food item of these comb jellies. For instance, while some mesozoo¬plankton species disappeared from the environment or substantially decreased in number, some others increased in quantity. These changes in food chain may promote the rise of jellyfishes rather than fish in the environment. In addition, decrease in planktivorous fish abundance as a consequence of overfishing also triggers the increase of newly introduced comb jellies, which were possibly introduced via ballast waters of ships, in the ecosystem. Increase in abundance of M. leidyi, which compete with planktivorous fishes (anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus ponticus in the Black Sea, kilka, Clupeonella spp. in the Caspian Sea) for their food, causes to decrease of planktivorous fish stocks which have already been vulnerable due to overfishing. Another reason for successfully adaption of M. leidyi to its new ecosystems could be linked to global warming which provides favourable temperature ranges for reproduction and growth of this ctenophore. Although there are still many debates related to possible negative effects, one of the ways to reduce harmful impacts of invaders might be the transport of natural predators of these invaders to the new ecosystems of invaders. For example, it was reported that the abun¬dance of Mnemiopsis leidyi decreased to very low levels during 1999 - 2004 in the Black Sea following the introduction of another comb jelly, Beroe ovata, which feed on this ctenophore...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Ultrasound (US) -assisted {{extraction}} {{has been}} widely used for metal ion extraction in plants due to its unique properties of decreased extraction time, minimal contamination, low reagent consumption and low cost. However, very few papers present a sound comparison between probe-focussed sonication and conventional stirring {{in the evaluation of}} metal ion extraction in plants. In this study, ultrasonic-assisted digestion has been evaluated and compared to magnetic stirring for total copper and cadmium determination by atomic absorption spectrometry in biological samples (<b>plants,</b> <b>plankton</b> and mussels). The same experimental conditions of sample amount and particle size, extractant solution and extraction time were applied for both ultrasound and magnetic stirring-assisted extraction methods in order to truly compare their effect on metal ion solubilisation. To gain further insight in this issue, dried and fresh plants were tested. The results obtained indicated that osmotic tension in cell walls, produced when dried and powdered samples were immersed in the extractant solution, had an important contribution to metal ion solubilisation, the enhancement due to US for the same purpose being negligible...|$|R

This article looks at what a mutation is, and at evidence that the biggest changes in the history of life have been the result of genetic sub-programs being switched on or off by regulatory systems. Biological studies do not support the idea that evolution (which has certainly occurred) is undirected. The theory of evolution depends on belief in only one kind of evolution. Over time species change, diversifying into new species, and with this is associated the idea that every organism is related to every other: bacteria, fungi, animals, <b>plants,</b> <b>plankton</b> in the sea, the lot. The logical leap is as big as the biological: finches on the Galapagos Islands have been evolving different shapes of beak, therefore all organisms are connected to the same tree, rooted in the unseen murk of a „prebiotic soup‟. Similarly, it is contended that there is only one alternative to the belief that all organisms evolved from a soup of chemicals, and that is the view that all organisms were created just as they are now: According to creationism, all species present on Earth today have remained unchanged since they were created by God.

SPOM from Varzea had a major contribution of autochthonous material from phytoplankton and C- 3 aquatic plants. As shown from stable isotope composition of SPOM (delta C- 13 - 31. 3 +/- 3. 2 parts per thousand; delta N- 15 3. 6 +/- 1. 5 parts per thousand), the C- 4 aquatic phanerogam (delta C- 13 - 13. 1 +/- 0. 5 parts per thousand; delta N- 15 4. 1 +/- 1. 7 parts per thousand) contribution appeared to be weak, although these plants were the most abundant macrophyte in the Varzea. During low water season, increasing concentration of 18 : 3 omega 3 was recorded in the SPOM of lakes. This FA, abundant mainly in the Varzea plants (up to 49 % of total FAs), {{was due to the}} accumulation of their detritus in the ecosystem. This dry season, when connectivity with the river mainstem was restricted, was also characterized by a high concentration in the SPOM of the cyanobacteria marker 16 : 1 omega 7 (up to 21 % of total FAs). The FA compositions of SPOM from the Amazon River also exhibited significant seasonal differences, in particular a higher concentration of 16 : 1 omega 7 and 18 : 3 omega 3 during the dry season. This suggests a seasonal contribution of autochthonous material produced in Varzea to the Amazon River SPOM...|$|R

Herbivorous animals, which depended on <b>plants</b> and <b>plankton</b> as their food, died out as their food sources became scarce; consequently, the top predators such as Tyrannosaurus rex also perished. Yet only three major groups of tetrapods disappeared completely; the non-avian dinosaurs, the plesiosaurs and the pterosaurs.

50|$|The American Spadefoot Toad has {{a unique}} diet. The adult’s diet and the tadpole’s diet vary. The adults diet {{consists}} of invertebrates. They eat flies, crickets, caterpillars, moths, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, earthworms and snails. The tadpole’s diet is related to its surroundings and food supply. When they are first born, they eat microscopic <b>plants</b> called <b>plankton.</b> After a few days they become carnivorous and eat meat. Tadpoles sometimes resort to cannibalism to survive. After multiple experiments,Paul Székely, Marian Tudor, and Dan Cogalniceanu concluded that tadpole development is influenced by hydroperiod, or {{the period in which}} an area is full of water. Since American Spadefoot Toads breed in shallow waters, they are under “constant stress from drying waters, increasing temperatures, reduced food densities, and crowding”. Since they are under an ample amount of stress,the tadpoles eat other tadpoles. When they resort to cannibalism, begin to morph. They “develop larger heads, sharp beaks, stronger jaw muscles, and shortened intestine”. Researchers have concluded that this is an adaptive trait because it accelerates the rate of growth of the tadpoles by allowing for an increased calorie intake.|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} focused on the {{discovery}} of thermostable CAZymes, particularly cellulases, from an oil reservoir metagenome using both sequence-based and function-based screening. Cellulases are glycoside hydrolases (GH) {{that are able to}} hydrolyze 1, 4 -β-d-glycosidic linkages in cellulose, hemicellulose, lichenin, and cereal β-d-glucans. The CAZy database currently lists a total of 131 GH families, 17 of which include enzymes with cellulase activities (Lombard et al. 2013). Cellulases have many applications, including biofuel production (e.g. cellulosic ethanol) by decomposition of plant-derived cellulose into monosaccharides {{that can be used in}} fermentation (Brethauer and Wyman 2010). However, biofuel production processes such as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) or separated hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) can profit from high temperature, which would inhibit the activity of many currently available cellulolytic enzymes (Lynd et al. 2002). Therefore, identification of novel thermostable cellulases could be a vital step in improving the efficiency and economy of cellulosic biofuel production. The availability of specific carbon substrates (e.g., cellulose) within these oil reservoir samples was unknown, but given the history of formation of these petroleum reservoirs essentially from ancient <b>plant</b> biomass <b>plankton,</b> it has been hypothesized that carbohydrate-degrading enzymes would be encoded in the metagenomes of microorganisms populating such a habitat and would have evolved enhanced thermal stability (Tissot and Welte 1978).|$|R
40|$|Phosphate {{removal from}} waste waters {{has become an}} {{environmental}} necessity, since these phosphates stimulate the growth of aquatic <b>plants</b> and <b>planktons</b> {{and contribute to the}} eutrophication process in general. The physicochemical methods of phosphate ion removal are the most effective and reliable. This paper presents studies on the process of phosphate ion removal from waste waters resulting from the fertiliser industry’s use of the method of co-precipitation with iron salts and with calcium hydroxide as the neutralizing agent. The optimal process conditions were established as those that allow achievement of a maximum degree of separation of the phosphate ions. The precipitate resulting from the co-precipitation process was analysed for chemical composition and establishment of thermal and structural stability, and the aim was also to establish in which form the phosphate ions in the formed precipitate can be found. Based on these considerations, the experimental data obtained in the process of phosphate ion removal from waste waters were analysed mathematically and the equations for the dependence of the degree of phosphate separation and residual concentration versus the main parameters of the process were formulated. In this paper an automated scheme for the phosphate ion removal from waste waters by co-precipitation is presented...|$|R

As part of aquatic reclamation efforts, experimental test sites that contain a range of OSPM (solid and liquid components) were constructed to monitor the evolution and viability of aquatic habitats used as disposal sinks for OSPM produced by mining activities. In the present study, stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur were used to gauge some of the potential effects of OSPM site construction methods on aquatic food webs. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures of sediment, dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic matter, periphytic material, <b>plants,</b> <b>plankton,</b> aquatic invertebrates and fish {{were used to assess}} differences related to the naphthenic acid (NA) concentration in OSPM and reference sites. For statistical analyses, sites were grouped into low (0 to 4 mg/L), medium (4 to 15 mg/L) and high (> 15 mg/L) NA concentrations. There {{were no significant differences in}} food web area or food web length among the low, medium and high NA concentration sites. In most cases, sample carbon isotope analyses of low, medium and high NA concentration sites were not significantly different, suggesting food web carbon sources did not include significant contributions from OSPM materials at OSPM sites. Significant differences, however, were found in the sample nitrogen isotope signatures between low, medium and high NA concentration sites. Ammonia from OSPM is suggested to be the main contributor to δ 15 N enrichment. 	To determine the potential effects of site construction and OSPM within experimental test sites, carbon and sulphur stable isotopes of water, plankton, aquatic invertebrates and fish were analyzed. With the exception of Chaoborus and Haliplus, all carbon isotope signatures were not significantly different in constructed and reference sites. Also with the exception of Haliplus, sulphur isotope values for aquatic organisms from constructed and reference sites were significantly different. Aquatic organisms and water samples from constructed sites built in, or close, to the boundary of Kcw clays typically had δ 34 S 34 S signatures found in these aquatic systems were elevated sulphate concentrations. The waters at experimental test sites are in direct contact with the soil materials that facilitate the accumulation of sulphates as a result of the oxidation of substrate sulphide minerals. In general the results of the study suggest that aquatic food web structure and function do not change with the introduction of OSPM. Shifts in isotopic signatures suggestive of changes in food web structure, however, do occur when site construction exposes Kcw clays in the substrate...|$|R

The samples were taken at 15 stations in four profiles located near Wyspa Sobieszewska (Sobieszewo Island), perpendicular to the coastline. Both the taxonomic and numerical structure of phytoplankton and zooplankton were typical of the coastal area of the Gulf of Gdansk. The species diversity depends on hydrological conditions, mainly input from the River Wisla (Vistula). The abundance and biomass of phytoplankton in 1998 were several times lower than in 1994 and 1995 in the area off Gorki Wschodnie, the profile located closest to the planned construction site. This could have been caused by generally lower temperatures in 1998 in comparison to previous years. In the investigated area only traces of algal eutrophication indicator species were noted. However, potentially toxic species were confirmed and were most abundant near the Wisla mouth. The highest concentrations of pelagic fauna occur in the shallowest area closest to the shoreline.
