40|$|Context. The {{frequency}} of <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> binaries {{is an important}} issue in the field of extrasolar planet studies, because of its relevance in estimating of the global planet population of our Galaxy and the clues it can give to our understanding of planet formation and evolution. However, only preliminary estimates are available in the literature. Aims. We analyze and compare the {{frequency of}} <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> multiple systems to the frequency of planets orbiting single stars. We also try to highlight possible connections between the frequency of planets and the orbital parameters of the binaries (such as the periastron and mass ratio.) Methods. A literature search was performed for binaries and multiple systems among the stars of the sample with uniform planet detectability defined by Fischer & Valenti (2005), and 202 of the 850 stars of the sample turned out to be binaries, allowing a statistical comparison of the frequency of <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> binaries and single stars and a study of the run of the planet frequency {{as a function of the}} binary separation. Results. We found that the global frequency of <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> the binaries of the sample is not statistically different from that of <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> single stars. Even conservatively taking the probable incompleteness of binary detection in our sample into account, we estimate that the frequency of <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> binaries can be no more than a factor of three lower than that of <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> single stars. There is no significant dependence of planet frequency on the binary separation, except for a lower value of frequency for close binaries. However, this is probably not as low as required to explain the presence of <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> close binaries only as the result of modifications of the binary orbit after the planet formation.

5|$|During the 1660s, Giovanni Cassini used a new {{telescope}} to discover spots and colorful bands on Jupiter and {{observed that the}} planet appeared oblate; that is, flattened at the poles.

5|$|Earth's axis of {{rotation}} is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.

5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b {{is outside}} its star's {{habitable}} zone, its gravitational influence would disrupt {{the orbit of}} <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> the outer part of the habitable zone.

5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the planet Saturn, {{and at first}} mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system.

The rings reappeared when he observed the <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> 1616, further confusing him.|$|E
5|$|Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets {{primarily}} {{composed of}} {{hydrogen and helium}} and are the most massive planets in the Solar System.

5|$|Haumea (43.13AU average) is in {{an orbit}} similar to Makemake except {{that it is in}} a 7:12 orbital {{resonance}} with Neptune.

5|$|In 2002, further {{measurements}} {{revealed the}} presence of a long-period <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> an orbit at around 5 AU from the star. The same measurements also indicated {{the presence of}} another inner planet, designated 55 Cancri c.|$|E

5|$|In 2003 it was {{hypothesized}} that these clumps could be caused by a roughly Neptune-mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65AU over 56millionyears, an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega.
