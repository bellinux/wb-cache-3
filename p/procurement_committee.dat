Research result indicated that there are significant differences assessment between Government Intern Party and BPKP Auditor towards variables such as public <b>procurement</b> <b>committees</b> quality, public <b>procurement</b> partners/suppliers quality, public procurement systems and procedures, public procurement ethics, and public procurement environment, except for public <b>procurement</b> <b>committees</b> income. Further, on simultaneous test, just public procurement partners/suppliers quality and public procurement environment that had negative influence towards public procurement fraud on government environment instance in Semarang. Whereas that if the test had carried out in partial way, based on Government Intern Party respondent, none of independent variables had influence towards dependent variable. Based on BPKP Auditors, public <b>procurement</b> <b>committees</b> quality variable had positive influence, public procurement partners/suppliers quality had negative influence, and public procurement environment had negative influence towards public procurement fraud. Threatening on previous research, survey method that used questionnaire still couldn’t explain the factors that influenced procurement fraud on government environment more clearly.

This study used primary data gathered by survey to auditors of Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia in its head office and several selected representative offices. Respondents {{were asked to provide}} their answer/perception for questions in questionnaire regarding factors influencing the procurement fraud of government’s goods and services. The results show that the procurement frauds are significantly influenced by weaknesses in procurement system, lack of <b>procurement</b> <b>committee's</b> quality, and the intention to engage fraud. Furthermore, the intention to engage fraud are influenced by attitude, subjective norms, and the perceived behavioral control. These findings suggest that procurement frauds are associated with individual factors as rationalization and opportunities.

This method is criticized, however, for its violating the basic propositions of the measurement theory, being easily biased by a few members in the evaluation Committee, and lack of distinct bases to discriminate the evaluation differences among the Committee members. The improved procedure suggested in this study, which is based on fuzzy relations and adopts eigenvector method, conforms to the judgment principles as well as the measurement theory. With analysis of a procurement case, the results demonstrate that the improved procedure is able to use quantitative methods to identify the evaluation differences among individual Committee members.

40|$|Abstract: The {{construction}} procurement {{evaluation method}} using lowest price conforming methods often causes some quality problems for  owners {{and increases the}} probability of dispute and delay during the contract execution. On the other hand, merit point system evaluation method can provide quality assurance, but the <b>procurement</b> <b>committees</b> are often dificult to apply it, and to determaine mesurable criteria evaluation. Therefore, {{it is necessary for}} a more in-depth study to find out the criteria evaluation for construction procurement. The research conducted in Bali, and adopted inductive qualitative approach involving 45 experts participated in construction procurements using merit point system evaluation. Puposive sampling is applied to determine the respondents come from all actors included during procurement process. The data was collected through interviews, observation participant and questionnaires, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is choosed to analyse them. The result shows that : the merit point system evaluation for construction procurement can determine the contractor provides better quality than the lowest price conforming method when theevaluation criteria are clear, mesurable and transparant in the bidding document. There are two principle aspects that must be considered to assurethe quality that is: the technical aspect and the cost that weight consecutively 60 % and 40 %. The technical aspect comprises of : a) the existance of work plan (13. 51 %), comprising of construction methods (4. 12 %), supporting  equipment (4. 05 %), supporting material (3. 46 %), suporting workers (1. 88 %); b) competencies of human recources (19. 91 %), comprising of project management competencies(2. 31 %), existence of expert (7. 92 %) and certificated human resources (9. 68 %); c) existence of supporting equipments (15. 54 %) consisted of lifting support (4. 79 %), transportation support (6. 17 %), surveying support equipment(4. 58 %); d) the existing of time management (6. 30 %) consisted of network planning (4. 13 %), bar chart (1. 03 %), and S-curve (1. 14 %); and e) existence of quality assurance (2. 14 %) consisted of quality management system (1. 95 %), performance quality management (0. 66 %) and material management quality (2. 14 %).

Consequently, the outcomes of the procurement reform process are expected to be, a new framework of interlinked institutions, professionalisation of the procurement function and economic efficiency. By using public choice as an analytical framework the paper argues that, a reduction in efficiency losses and real or perceived corruption by rent-seeking public officials will be the most crucial test of the success of the reform...|$|R
50|$|The arms <b>procurement</b> investigative <b>committee</b> {{was inaugurated}} on 31 August 2015 by President Muhammadu Buhari to {{investigate}} the procurement of ammunition to fight against insurgency during the administration of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The interim report of the committee revealed several illicit and fraudulent financial transactions. The report revealed an extra-budgetary spending {{to the tune of}} N643.8 billion and inexplicable spending of about $2.2 billion in the foreign currency component under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. This amount excluded grants received by the state governments and funds received by the Directorate of State Services and the Nigerian Police Force.The committee analyzed how funds were transferred {{to the office of the}} National Security Adviser and the Nigerian Armed Forces in local and foreign currencies.The committee observed that about $2.2 billion was disbursed for the procurement of ammunition to tackle insurgency but regretted that despite this enormous financial transactions, little or nothing was spent for the procurement of the arms for which the fund was disbursed.The committee discovered that out of the 513 contracts awarded at $8,356,525,184.32, ₦2,189,265,724,404.55 and £54,000.00, about 53 were failed contracts amounting to about $2,378,939,066.27 and ₦13,729,342,329.87 respectively.The committee also noted that the amount of foreign currencies spent on failed contracts was more than twice the $1 billion loan approved by the National Assembly for borrowing from the World bank to fight insurgency.The investigative committee also discovered a total transfer of ₦3.850 billion to a single company by Colonel Dansuki, the former National Security Adviser. These transactions were made with neither agreements nor fulfilment of tax obligations to the Federal Government of Nigeria.|$|R
40|$|Article 4. 27 of the Dutch Public Procurement Act 2012 (‘Aanbestedingswet’) {{provides}} for a statutory basis for extra-judicial public procurement complaints review by an independent body: The Public <b>Procurement</b> Experts <b>Committee</b> (‘Commissie van Aanbestedingsexperts’), hereinafter referred to as: ‘the Committee’. This statutory-based extra-judicial complaints review board does not substitute the system of judicial review of public procurement cases by the ordinary courts. Neither does it prevent a complainant from bringing his complaint before the court at any stage of the public procurement process, {{whether or not the}} Committee has been addressed beforehand. The main objective of offering extra-judicial complaints review is to lower the threshold for complainants – particularly SME’s – who encounter difficulties in bringing their complaints before the ordinary courts. This objective is mainly achieved by issuing – free of charge – non-binding opinions on complaints. In addition, rather than being an alternative to judicial review by the ordinary courts, complaints review by the Committee is intended as a means to deal with public procurement complaints in a satisfactory manner before court proceedings, if any, are started. The Committee became operational on 1 April 2013, when the Dutch Public Procurement Act 2012 entered into effect. The Committee received 70 complaints in the period from 1 April 2013 to 1 March 2014. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide the reader with information on the purpose and the organisation of the Committee, and to explain the design of the Committee’s complaints procedure. In doing so, we will share the experiences we have gained with this procedure so far, by providing data regarding complaints that were received and processed by the Committee.

Each year, the federal government spends billions of dollars to maintain its buildings. Even so, the General Services Administration (GSA) contends that it needs $ 4 billion, over and above these expenditures, to maintain its existing inventory. This report identifies the potential benefits to the federal government of entering into public-private partnerships on real property [...] an arrangement in which the federal government contributes real property and a private entity contributes financial capital and borrowing ability to redevelop or renovate the real property. GAO found that public-private partnership authority could be an important management tool to address problems in deteriorating federal buildings, but further study of how the tool would actually work and its benefits compared to other options is needed. Potential net benefits to the federal government of entering into these public-private partnerships include better space, lower operating costs, and increased revenue without up-front federal capital expenditures if further analysis shows {{that they would not be}} treated as capital leases for budget-scoring purposes. The potential benefits of public-private partnerships do not diminish the need for GSA to pursue other alternatives for addressing problems in deteriorating federal buildings.
