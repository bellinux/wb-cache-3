50|$|After master Marubi’s death, {{he became}} the {{legitimate}} inheritor of the studio, transforming it into a true art atelier.

He became one of the leading European figures in public and chronicle photography of the time because he succeeded in following all of the most important Albanian events for nearly 55 years. Kel Marubi was also an ardent patriot and became involved in the movement for the independence of Albania by taking part in founding the “Albanian Language Society” in 1908, and in publishing the newspaper “Zëri i Shkodrës” (The Voice of Shkodër). He was also known beyond Albania’s borders and was often invited to the Court of the King of Montenegro for various works in photography.|$|E

40|$|A {{key problem}} in {{indexing}} technical information is {{the interpretation of}} technical words and word senses, expressions not used in everyday language. This is important for captions on technical images, whose often pithy descriptions can be valuable to decipher. We describe the natural-language processing for MARIE- 2, a natural-language information retrieval system for multimedia captions. Our approach is to provide general tools for lexicon enhancement with the specialized words and word senses, and to learn word usage information (both on word senses and word-sense pairs) from a training corpus with a statistical parser. Innovations of our approach are in statistical inheritance of binary co-occurrence probabilities and in weighting of sentence subsequences. MARIE- 2 was trained and tested on 616 captions (with 1009 distinct sentences) from the <b>photograph</b> <b>library</b> of a Navy laboratory. The captions had extensive nominal compounds, code phrases, abbreviations, and acronyms, but few verbs, abstract nouns, conjunctions, and pronouns.

40|$|Purpose]: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} visual changes and retinal vessel attenuation in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). [Design]: A retrospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study. [Methods]: We analyzed 45 eyes from 45 subjects who were followed-up for ≥ 3 years at our clinic. Using the computer-based Interactive Vessel Analysis program, central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE) were determined. Age- and sex-matched controls from normal subjects were selected from our archived fundus <b>photograph</b> <b>library.</b> Visual acuity, visual field area (Goldmann perimetry, V 4 e white test light), mean deviation (Humphrey perimetry, central 10 - 2 program), and central macular thickness (optical coherence tomography) were analyzed for correlations with CRAE and CRVE. [Results]: Both CRAE and CRVE were significantly decreased in RP eyes (94. 9 ± 13. 5 µm and 155. 6 ± 20. 0 µm, respectively) compared with control eyes (138. 1 ± 14. 7 µm and 215. 0 ± 20. 4 µm, respectively, both P< 0. 001). After 3 years of follow-up, visual field area was associated with both CRAE (r= 0. 584, P< 0. 01) and CRVE (r= 0. 500, P= 0. 008). A significant association was also observed between mean deviation and CRAE (r= 0. 298,P= 0. 047). In eyes with RP, a narrower vessel caliber at baseline {{was associated with a}} larger decline in visual acuity over the 3 -year follow-up interval (CRAE: r=- 0. 344,P= 0. 021; CRVE: r=- 0. 314, P= 0. 035).
