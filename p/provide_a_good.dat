5|$|State-run junior lyceums {{and area}} {{secondary}} schools are single-sex. Junior lyceums {{are divided into}} two grade stages. The first stage is an introductory stage, and runs {{for the first two}} years of secondary schooling. Students study essentially the same subjects with very limited curriculum options in order to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> grounding for future studies. Following the two-year introductory cycle, a three-year specialist stage occurs during which students study a common core curriculum as well as a number of elective subjects. This orientation is similar at area secondary schools, although the introductory period is longer, at three years in duration, and the final specialist period is shorter, at two years. The staff-student ratio is set at 1:11, and the school leaving age is 16.|$|E
5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> spread of {{support on the}} ground and safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The {{sides of}} the Tor have seven deep, roughly {{symmetrical}} terraces, or lynchets. Their formation remains a mystery with many possible explanations. They may have been formed {{as a result of}} natural differentiation of the layers of Lias stone and clay used by farmers during the Middle Ages as terraced hills to make ploughing for crops easier. Author Nicholas Mann questions this theory. If agriculture had been the reason for the creation of the terraces, it would be expected that the effort would be concentrated on the south side, where the sunny conditions would <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> yield, but the terraces are equally deep on the northern side, which would provide little benefit. Additionally, none of the other slopes of the island have been terraced, even though the more sheltered locations would provide a greater return on the labour involved. Alternatively, the flattened paths may have been created by the hooves of grazing cattle.|$|E
