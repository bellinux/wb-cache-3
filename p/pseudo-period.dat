For example, considering the periodically varying contact rate as the 'input' of the system one has that the output is a periodic function whose period is a multiple of the period of the input.This allowed to give a contribution to explain the poly-annual (typically biennial) epidemic outbreaks of some infectious diseases as interplay between the period of the contact rate oscillations and the <b>pseudo-period</b> of the damped oscillations near the endemic equilibrium.Remarkably, in some cases the behavior may also be quasi-periodic or even chaotic.|$|E

Best-effort scheduling {{is easy to}} use, provides a reasonable trade-off between fairness and responsiveness, and imposes no overhead for specifying resource demands. However, best-effort schedulers provide no resource guarantees, limiting their ability to support processes with timeliness constraints. Reacting to a need for better support of soft real-time multimedia applications while recognizing that the best-effort model permeates desktop computing for good reason, we have developed a technique for inferring soft-real time behavior from executing processes. We have created two schedulers based on this technique, the Best-Effort scheduler enhanced for Soft Real-Time (BEST) and a rate-controlling scheduler (BEST-RATE), that combine desirable aspects of both best-effort and soft real-time scheduling. BEST provides the well-behaved default characteristics of best-effort schedulers while significantly improving performance of periodic soft real-time processes. BEST schedules using estimated deadlines based on the dynamically detected periods of processes, and assigns <b>pseudo-periods</b> to non-periodic processes to allow for good response time. BEST-RATE, developed to overcome lack of fairness in BEST, provides timely allocation to periodic processes while providing equal resource allocation among all processes. This paper discusses a Linux implementation of the BEST and BEST-RATE schedulers and presents results demonstrating that they outperform the Linux scheduler in handling soft real-time processes, and outperform realtime schedulers in handling mixed workloads of soft real-time and best-effort processes...|$|R

We show how the size of the attractor or the time scale (the <b>pseudo-period)</b> can be varied without affecting the underlying dynamics. This is demonstrated for the Rossler and the Lorenz systems. We also consider the case when two Rossler systems are unidirectionally coupled and when a Lorenz system is driven by a Rossler system. In both cases, the dynamics of the coupled system is affected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Starting from a description of individual speculative behaviours, we build and study a second order Markov process, which after simple transformations {{can be viewed as}} a turning two-dimensional Gaussian process. Then, our main problem is to ob- tain some bounds for the persistence rate relative to the return time to a given price. In our main results, we prove with both spectral and probabilistic methods that this rate is almost proportional to the turning frequency ω of the model and provide some explicit bounds. In the continuity of this result, we build some estimators of ω and of the <b>pseudo-period</b> of the prices.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of population dynamics, we start from the logistic equation describing the evolution of one species with limited food supply. A split device allows us to consider the population as two sub-populations x and y evolving analogously. The dynamical system has a one-parameter family of equilibria which is structurally unstable. Then small perturbations of the system (describing functional or ethological differentiations between the sub-species) lead in general to a new system involving a fast and a slow dynamics with {{a finite number of}} equilibria. In simple situations where the differentiation is clearly either an advantage or an inconvenience for one of the subspecies, the stable equilibrium amounts to extinction of the disadvantaged subspecies (elementary Darwinism). Oppositely more complex differentiations (involving both advantages and inconveniences) often lead to stable equilibria with well-defined non zero proportions of the sub-populations (preservation of the biodiversity). Other examples are concerned with symbiosis-like differentiations, leading to preservation, whereas the opposite case (mutual nuisances) has an unstable equilibrium and lead to extinction of one or the other subspecies according to the initial conditions. The case of a scission into three subspecies is more rich in consequences. In certain cases, predator-prey relations lead to auto-organization phenomena with stable diversity-preserving diversity. Cases of instability are also possible, leading to orbits tending towards a poly-cycle. This implies some kind of pseudo-extinction: this amounts to "pseudo-periodic-like" orbits with "pseudo-periods" larger and larger, tending to infinity; each <b>pseudo-period</b> contains parts where one of the sub-populations practically vanish. Other non-linear perturbations lead to stable orbits...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: In gait analysis, {{walking is}} assumed to be {{periodic}} for the sake of simplicity, despite the fact that, strictly speaking, it can only approximate periodicity and, as such, may be referred to as pseudo-periodic. This study aims at: 1) quantifying gait pseudo-periodicity using information concerning a single stride; 2) investigating the effects of walking pathway length on gait periodicity; 3) investigating separately the periodicity of the upper and lower body parts movement; 4) verifying the validity of foot-floor contact events as markers of the gait cycle period. Methods: Ten young healthy subjects (6 males, 23 ± 5 years) were asked to perform various gait trials, first along a 20 -m pathway that allowed reaching a steady-state condition, and then along an 8 -m pathway. A stereophotogrammetric system was used to reconstruct the 3 D position of reflective markers distributed over the subjects' body. Foot contact was detected using an instrumented mat. Three marker clusters were used to represent the movement of the whole body, the upper body (without upper limbs), and the lower body, respectively. Linear and rotational kinetic, and gravitational and elastic potential "energy-like" quantities were used to calculate an index J(t) that described the instantaneous "mechanical state" of the analysed body portion. The variations of J(t) in time allowed for the determination of the walking <b>pseudo-period</b> and for the assessment of gait aperiodicity. Results: The suitability of the proposed approach was demonstrated, and it was shown that, for young, healthy adults, a threshold of physiological pseudo-periodicity of walking at natural speed could be set. Higher pseudo-periodicity values were found for the shorter pathway only for the upper body. Irrespective of pathway length, the upper body had a larger divergency from periodicity than the lower body. The error that can be made in estimating the gait cycle duration for the upper body from the heel contacts was shown to be significant. Conclusion: The proposed method can be easily implemented in gait laboratories to verify the consistency of a recorded stride with the hypothesis of periodicity. </p...|$|E
40|$|The general {{tendency}} for {{the occurrence of}} convective cloudiness and rainfall anomalies of opposite sign over the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) and the Southeastern portion of South America (SESA) has been extensively documented and described in previous studies. This behaviour has been related to specific circulation anomalies along the eastern margin of the continent {{that seem to be}} part of quasi-barotropic Rossby wave trains stretching from the South Pacific domain. Intraseasonal variability in rainfall and convective cloudiness over SACZ has also been related to the Madden-Julian oscillation in the Indian Ocean. In this study different techniques (Spectral Analysis, Wavelet Analysis and Singular Spectrum Analysis) are used to characterize the dipolar structure in the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomaly over SACZ and SESA. Particular attention was given to the interannual variability and persistence of this behaviour throughout the summer season semester (Oct - Mar). Daily OLR indices for both regions were analyzed from 1 October to 31 March during the period 1974 - 2002. The spectral characteristics of opposite - in -phase OLR anomalies over SACZ and SESA exhibit a considerable interannual and intraseasonal variability. A dipolar behaviour was particularly well defined in 10 out of the 26 considered seasons, {{with a wide range of}} associated quasi-periodicities (20 - 50 days). However, the dipolar structure associated to variability of OLR anomalies in the range 30 - 50 days seems to be the most commonly observed. The length of the period when the dipolar behaviour is observed during a single season changes considerably from season to season, but the phenomenon seems to be more prevalent during the austral summer quarter (DJF). No conclusions were found regarding the mechanisms determining the interannual variability in the dipolar structure of OLR anomalies in SACZ and SESA. Although El Niño conditions prevailed in 6 out of the selected 10 seasons with a well defined dipolar structure, it is not clear that ENSO is a key factor. In fact the dipolar behaviour was quite contrasting during the most intense 1982 - 83 and 1997 - 98 El Niño episodes, being very weak during the 1982 - 83 event but well defined from December 1997 to February 1998 when opposite - in -phase OLR anomalies were observed over SACZ and SESA, with an associated <b>pseudo-period</b> of 30 days.
