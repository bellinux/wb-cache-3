The Commission was meant to address many of the inequalities women face, specifically rape, family and guardianship. However, the slow <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in the judicial system and the aforementioned cultural norms have prevented the full adoption of policies meant to promote equality between men and women.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} de-Stalinization in Czechoslovakia had begun under Antonín Novotný {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the Eastern Bloc. Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the {{completion}} of socialism, and the new constitution, accordingly, adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but {{did not take place}} until 1967.|$|E
5|$|The quick <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> {{meant that}} many ships were {{obsolete}} {{as soon as}} they were finished, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo, which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers.|$|E

25|$|In the main, {{experience}} in the introduction of wholesale and retail competition has been mixed. Many regional markets have achieved some success and the ongoing trend continues to be towards deregulation and introduction of competition. However, in 2000/2001 major failures such as the California electricity crisis and the Enron debacle caused a slow down in the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and in some regions an increase in market regulation and reduction in competition. However, this trend {{is widely regarded as}} a temporary one against the longer term trend towards more open and competitive markets.|$|E

25|$|The 1970s {{and early}} 1980s were {{a time of}} {{transition}} for typewriters and word processors. At one point in time, most small-business offices would be completely 'old-style', while large corporations and government departments would already be 'new-style'; other offices would have a mixture. The <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> was so rapid that it was common for clerical staff {{to have to learn}} several new systems, one after the other, in just a few years. While such rapid change is commonplace today, and is taken for granted, this was not always so; in fact, typewriting technology changed very little in its first 80 or 90 years.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, progressivism became the {{dominant}} political force in Santa Monica. Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights (SMRR) formed in 1978 and {{was led by}} Ruth Yannatta Goldway, Derek Shearer, Dennis Zane, and Reverend James Conn with support from Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda. Conn's Ocean Park Community Organization (OPCO) was formed in 1979 {{as an adjunct to}} the Church in Ocean Park, partly in reaction to the rapid <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> along Main Street. It was the first of what became nine community organizations that serve as neighborhood advocates. A strict rent control ordinance passed in 1979 and SMRR achieved a council majority in 1981.

25|$|Reflecting {{the rapid}} <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> makes shared parts {{with one another}} so larger {{production}} volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.|$|E
25|$|The Klan grew {{after that}} due to white peoples' anxieties and fears over the rapid <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> {{economic}} and social competition; it promoted itself as a fraternal organization for whites in new urban environments. Both white and black rural migrants were moving into rapidly industrializing cities of the South. In addition, many Southern white and African American migrants moved north in the Great Migration. This change resulted in labor shortages {{in some of the}} South and added to rapid population change in major northern and midwestern industrial cities. They were also receiving greatly increased immigration from southern and eastern Europe. The Klan grew rapidly and became most successful and strongest in those cities that had a rapid pace of growth from 1910 to 1930, such as Atlanta, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; Dallas, Texas; Detroit, Michigan; Indianapolis, Indiana; Chicago, Illinois; Portland, Oregon and Denver, Colorado. It reached a peak of membership and influence about 1925. In some cities, leaders' actions to publish names of Klan members and override its secrecy provided enough publicity to sharply reduce membership.|$|E

25|$|The traffic {{problems}} that had blighted Potsdamer Platz for decades {{continued to be}} a big headache, despite the new lights, and these led to a strong desire to solve them once and for all. By now Berlin was a major centre of innovation in many different fields including architecture. In addition, the city’s colossal <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> (compared by some to that of Chicago), had caused its chief planner, Martin Wagner (1885–1957), to foresee the entire centre being made over totally as often as every 25 years. These factors combined to produce some far more radical and futuristic plans for Potsdamer Platz in the late 1920s and early 1930s, especially around 1928-9, when the creative fervour was at its peak. On the cards was an almost total redevelopment of the area. One design submitted by Wagner himself comprised an array of gleaming new buildings arranged around a vast multi-level system of fly-overs and underpasses, with a huge glass-roofed circular car-park in the middle. Unfortunately the worldwide Great Depression of the time, triggered by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, meant that most of the plans remained on the drawing board. However, in Germany this depression was virtually a continuation of an economic morass that had blighted the country since the end of World War I, partly the result of the war reparations the country had been made to pay, and this morass had brought about the closure and demolition of the Grand Hotel Belle Vue, on the corner of Bellevuestraße and Königgrätzer Straße, thus enabling one revolutionary new building to struggle through to reality despite considerable financial odds.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to understand why the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> technical <b>change</b> has been slower in the defense and space industries than in semiconductors. To answer this question, we adopt an inductive method that exploits historical facts and patent statistics to provide empirical data. Basing our rationale on the appropriation and structural inertia arguments, we show that the constraints imposed by reliability in the defense and space industries impedes the appropriation of supra profits from innovation and thus slows the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> technical <b>change.</b> The main managerial implication of this result is that technical inertia contributes to competitive success when the reliability constraint reaches high levels.
