5|$|At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud {{did much}} to reclaim his {{position}} as a leading Shakespearean. His cold, unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook's production of Measure for Measure (1950) showed the <b>public</b> <b>a</b> new, naturalistic manner in his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.|$|E
5|$|Brown and the Labour {{party had}} pledged {{to allow a}} {{referendum}} on the EU Treaty of Lisbon. On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty. Brown's opponents {{on both sides of the}} House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British <b>public</b> <b>a</b> referendum on the original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E

Unfortunately the home defeat (0–1) against Costa Rica buried the hopes of qualifying for the national team. Juan de Dios Castillo was removed from office in November 2012 and replaced on December 17 by the Peruvian Agustín Castillo, five national champion with C.D. FAS.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{months after}} the release of Grove's book, Titan Books, in {{association}} with Sparkplug Press, released a detailed history on the Friday the 13th series. Peter M. Bracke released Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th on October 24, 2005. The book chronicles the creation of the series up to the release of Freddy vs. Jason. Bracke spent three years researching the series and collecting more than 200 interviews from the cast and crew of each of the films. Bracke's extensive work for the book prompted Sean S. Cunningham to provide a foreword. Crystal Lake Memories also includes images, storyboards, concept art, and publicity material that had not been released to the <b>public.</b> <b>A</b> private party was held on October 22, 2005 at Universal Studios CityWalk Hollywood for the book's premiere.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-40, {{formerly}} known as KOI-428, is an F-type star in the constellation Cygnus. Kepler-40 is known to host at least one planet, Kepler-40b. The star is approximately 1.5 times more massive than the Sun, and is over two times its size; it was, at upon its discovery, the largest yet discovered with a transiting planet in its orbit. Kepler-40 was first noted as home to a possible transiting object by the Kepler spacecraft; the data on the system was released to the <b>public.</b> <b>A</b> team of French and Swiss scientists used follow-up data to determine {{the existence of the}} Hot Jupiter planet Kepler-40b, and later had their results published in a scientific journal on January 4, 2011.|$|E

Universities, government agencies such as the National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and <b>public,</b> <b>a</b> chief entity being the National Science Foundation. The pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the wind, pressure, and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "public" [...] {{originates}} {{with the}} Latin [...] (also [...] ), from , {{related to the}} English word 'populace', and in general denotes some mass population ("the people") in association with some matter of common interest. So in political science and history, <b>a</b> <b>public</b> is <b>a</b> population of individuals in association with civic affairs, or affairs of office or state. In social psychology, marketing, and <b>public</b> relations, <b>a</b> <b>public</b> has <b>a</b> more situational definition. John Dewey defined [...] <b>a</b> <b>public</b> as <b>a</b> group of people who, in facing a similar problem, recognize it and organize themselves to address it. Dewey's definition of <b>a</b> <b>public</b> is thus situational: people organized about a situation. Built upon this situational definition of <b>a</b> <b>public</b> is the situational theory of publics by James E. Grunig , which talks of nonpublics (who have no problem), latent <b>publics</b> (who have <b>a</b> problem), aware <b>publics</b> (who recognize {{that they have a}} problem), and active publics (who do something about their problem).|$|R

5|$|Thorpe and the Liberals were {{deflated}} by {{the outcome}} of the October 1974 election. Wilson's majority, albeit slim, denied Thorpe the role of kingmaker, leaving the Liberals without a clear role; as Dutton observes, apart from being neither Conservative or Labour, the Liberals lacked a distinctive identity and their policies were largely unknown to the <b>public.</b> <b>A</b> further problem for the party was the divergence between its activists, who were radicals well {{to the left of the}} official party, and a large section of its recent supporters who were disgruntled Conservatives. Thorpe, whose personal majority in North Devon had fallen to under 7,000 in October, confided to an associate that, unless the party were soon to make a significant impact, his days as leader might be numbered.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{continued}} to be dogged by controversy about not holding {{a referendum on the}} EU Treaty of Lisbon. On the morning of 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband stood in for Brown at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty, which was attended by all other European heads of government. At the time, Brown was appearing before the Liaison Committee; he went to Portugal to sign the treaty that afternoon. Brown was criticised by opponents {{on both sides of the}} House and in the press. His critics said that neither Brown nor Labour had a mandate to ratify the treaty without public consent. Conservative leader David Cameron pointed to Labour's 2005 manifesto, which had pledged to give the British <b>public</b> <b>a</b> referendum on the original EU Constitution. Brown said the Treaty differed on significant points from the Constitution and was no longer a constitution but an ordinary treaty, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, {{and he had been}} talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might {{be on the verge of}} transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar <b>public.</b> <b>A</b> test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E
