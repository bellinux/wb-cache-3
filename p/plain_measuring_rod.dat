Most <b>measuring</b> <b>rods</b> are round or square sectioned, however they can be flat boards. Some have markings at regular intervals.

"We {{suppose that}} the {{circumference}} and diameter of a circle have been measured with a standard <b>measuring</b> <b>rod</b> infinitely small compared with the radius, {{and that we have}} the quotient of the two results. If this experiment were performed with <b>measuring</b> <b>rods</b> at rest relatively to the Galilean system K′, the quotient would be π. With <b>measuring</b> <b>rods</b> at rest relatively to K, the quotient would be greater than π. This is readily understood if we envisage the whole process of measuring from the [...] "stationary" [...] system K′, and take into consideration that the <b>measuring</b> <b>rods</b> applied to the periphery undergoes a Lorentz contraction, while the ones applied along the radius do not. Hence Euclidean geometry does not apply to K." ...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for fast {{diameter}} measurement of coaxial holes is studied. The paper describes a multi-layer <b>measuring</b> <b>rod</b> that installs a single laser displacement sensor (LDS) on each layer. This method {{is easy to}} implement by rotating the <b>measuring</b> <b>rod,</b> and immune from detecting the <b>measuring</b> <b>rod’s</b> rotation angles, so all diameters of coaxial holes can be calculated by sensors’ values. While revolving, the changing angles of each sensor’s laser beams are approximately equal in the rod’s radial direction so that the over-determined nonlinear equations of multi-layer holes for fitting circles can be established. The mathematical model of the <b>measuring</b> <b>rod</b> is established, all parameters that affect the accuracy of measurement are analyzed and simulated. In the experiment, {{the validity of the}} method is verified, the inner diameter measuring precision of 28 μm is achieved by 20 μm linearity LDS. The <b>measuring</b> <b>rod</b> has advantages of convenient operation and easy manufacture, according to the actual diameters of coaxial holes, and also the varying number of holes, LDS’s mounting location can be adjusted for different parts. It is convenient for rapid diameter measurement in industrial use...|$|R

50|$|The Roman <b>measuring</b> <b>rod</b> was 10 Roman feet long, {{and hence}} called a decempeda, Latin for ‘ten feet’.

Together with the groma and Dioptra the decempeda formed the basic kit for the Roman surveyors.
