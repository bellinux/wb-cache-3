50|$|A {{possible}} {{interpretation of}} large values of couplings {{in a model}} fitted to a MSA of a protein family is the existence of conserved contacts between positions (residues) in the family. Such a contact can lead to molecular coevolution, since a mutation {{in one of the}} two residues, without a compensating mutation in the other residue, is likely to disrupt protein structure and negatively affect the fitness of the <b>protein.</b> <b>Residue</b> pairs for which there is a strong selective pressure to maintain mutual compatibility are therefore expected to mutate together or not at all. This idea (which was known in literature long before the conception of DCA) has been used to predict protein contact maps, for example analyzing the mutual information between protein residues.|$|E
50|$|The {{archaeological site}} {{is known for}} its {{well-defined}} stratigraphic horizons that exhibit numerous cultural sequences.

Investigations at Blackwater Draw have recovered <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> found on Clovis weapons. This leads to the evidence of human occupation in association with Late Pleistocene fauna, including Columbian mammoth, camel, horse, bison, saber-toothed cat and dire wolf. Towards the end of the Pleistocene period, the climate began to change, which brought warmer and drier weather causing the water flow in the region to dramatically decrease. This decrease caused small seasonal lake basins called playas to form. These areas became popular hunting locations for early North Americans.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{coupling}} analysis or DCA is {{an umbrella}} term comprising several methods for analyzing sequence data in computational biology. The common idea {{of these methods}} is to use statistical modeling to quantify {{the strength of the}} direct relationship between two positions of a biological sequence, excluding effects from other positions. This contrasts usual measures of correlation, which can be large even if there is no direct relationship between the positions (hence the name direct coupling analysis). Such a direct relationship can for example be the evolutionary pressure for two positions to maintain mutual compatibility in the biomolecular structure of the sequence, leading to molecular coevolution between the two positions.DCA has been used in the inference of <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> contacts, RNA structure prediction, the inference of protein-protein interaction networks and the modeling of fitness landscapes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{central point}} of DCA is to {{interpret}} the [...] (which can be represented as a [...] matrix if there are [...] possible symbols) as direct couplings. If two positions are under joint evolutionary pressure (for example to maintain a structural bond), one might expect these couplings to be large because only sequences with fitting pairs of symbols should have a significant probability. On the other hand, a large correlation between two positions {{does not necessarily mean}} that the couplings are large, since large couplings between e.g. positions [...] and [...] might lead to large correlations between positions [...] and , mediated by position [...] In fact, such indirect correlations have been implicated in the high false positive rate when inferring <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> contacts using correlation measures like mutual information.|$|E

Compared with <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> networks with randomized links, {{the probability of a}} walk being successful is lower and the length of successful walks shorter in (non-randomized) <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> networks. Fewer successful walks and shorter successful walks point to higher communication specificity between protein residues, a conceivably favourable attribute for proteins to have. The use of random walks instead of shortest paths also produced lower node centrality, lower edge betweeness and lower edge load for (non-randomized) <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> networks than in their respective randomized counterparts. The implications of these properties for <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> networks are discussed in terms of communication congestion and network vulnerability. The randomized <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> networks have lower network clustering than the (non-randomized) <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> networks. Hence, our findings also shed light on a hitherto neglected aspect: the importance of high network clustering in <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> networks.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of the protein tertiary structure from solely its residue sequence (the so called Protein Folding Problem) {{is one of}} the most challenging problems in Structural Bioinformatics. We focus on the <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> contact map. When this map is assigned it is possible to reconstruct the 3 D structure of the protein backbone. The general problem of recovering a set of 3 D coordinates consistent with some given contact map is known as a unit-disk-graph realization problem and it has been recently proven to be NP-Hard. In this paper we describe a heuristic method (COMAR) that is able to reconstruct with an unprecedented rate (3 - 15 seconds) a 3 D model that exactly matches the target contact map of a protein. Working with a non-redundant set of 1760 proteins, we find that the scoring efficiency of finding a 3 D model very close to the protein native structure depends on the threshold value adopted to compute the <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> contact map.

40|$|Residues {{present on}} the surface of the {{proteins}} are involved in a number of functions, especially in ligand-protein interactions, that are important for drug design. The residues present in the core of the protein provide stability to the protein and help in maintaining protein structure. Hence, there is a need for a binary characterization of <b>protein</b> <b>residues</b> based on their surface accessibility (surface accessible or buried). Such a classification can aid in the directed study of either residue type. A number of methods for the prediction of surface accessible <b>protein</b> <b>residues</b> have been proposed in the past. However, most of these methods are computationally complex and time consuming. In this thesis, we propose a simple method based on protein sequence homology parameters for the binary classification of <b>protein</b> <b>residues</b> as surface accessible or “buried”. To aid in the classification of <b>protein</b> <b>residues,</b> we chose three highly conservative homology-based parameter filter thresholds. The filter thresholds predicted and evaluated are: residue sequence entropy ≥ 0 : 15, fraction of strongly hydrophobic residues 3 ̆c 0 : 5 and fraction of small residues 3 ̆c 0 : 15. The application of these filter thresholds to the residues, is expected to predict the “buried residues” with a better percentage accuracy than that of the surface accessible residues. These filter thresholds were selected from the frequency distributions and the aggregate correlation plots of the various homology-based parameters. An analysis of the plots suggests the presence of a strongly hydrophobic core between packing density 14 – 22 where the presence of strongly hydrophobic residues is maximum and the presence of small and non-strongly hydrophobic residues is minimum. However, the densest portion of the protein (density 26 – 35) is indicated to be occupied by a combination of small and non-strongly hydrophobic residues with a negligible presence of strongly hydrophobic residues...|$|R

40|$|Background: A protein {{annotation}} database, {{such as the}} Universal Protein Resource (UniProtKB), is {{a valuable}} resource for the validation and interpretation of predicted 3 D structure patterns in proteins. Previously, results have been on point mutation extraction methods from biomedical literature {{which can be used}} to support the consuming work of manual database curation. However, these methods were limited on point mutation extraction and do not extract features for the annotation of proteins at the residue level. Results: This work introduces a system that identifies <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> sites in abstract texts and annotate them with features extracted from the context. The performances of all text mining modules were evaluated against a manually annotated corpus. The identified annotation features can be attributed to at least one of six tar-geted categories, e. g. enzymatic reaction. Extracted results were cross-validated against UniProtKB and for 13 annotations of residues that have not been confirmed in the UniProtKB a manual assessment was performed. Conclusions: This work proposes a solution for the automatic extraction of <b>protein</b> <b>residue</b> annotation from biomed-ical articles. The presented approach is an extension to other existing systems in that a wider range of residue entities are considered and that features of residues are extracted as annotations. Backgroun...|$|E

We show that amino acids 16 – 36 near the N-terminus of the HCV core protein interact specifically with DDX 3 X both in vitro and in vivo.
