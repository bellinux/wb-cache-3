5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in her mouth and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The <b>porno</b> causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the <b>porno,</b> heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E

When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a <b>porno</b> movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church-tower, jump out of the turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{appearing}} in Nikkatsu's first {{experiment in the}} pink film in 1968, Tokyo Bathhouse (Onna Ukiyo Buro), which featured over 30 sex-film stars in cameo appearances, Tani's first official Roman <b>porno</b> for Nikkatsu was in a minor role as a nurse in Sensuous Beasts (1972). Unlike her starring roles for smaller studios, she played a supporting role in this film. Preferring to continue starring in lower-budget films rather than playing supporting roles for Nikkatsu's leading Roman <b>Porno</b> actresses, she did not stay with Nikkatsu at this time.|$|E

25|$|When {{ownership}} of VCRs first became {{widespread in the}} early 1980s, adult videos made their appearance, and quickly became highly popular. As early as 1982 the AVs had already attained an approximately equal share of the adult entertainment market with theatrical erotic films. In 1984, new government censorship policies and an agreement between Eirin (the Japanese film-rating board) and the pink-film companies added to Nikkatsu's difficulties by putting drastic new restrictions on theatrical films. Theatrical pink movie profits dropped 36% within a month of the new ruling. Eirin dealt a serious blow to the pink film industry in 1988 by introducing stricter requirements for sex-related theatrical films. Nikkatsu responded by discontinuing their Roman <b>Porno</b> line. Bed Partner (1988) was the final film of the venerable 17-year-old Roman <b>Porno</b> series. Nikkatsu continued to distribute films under the name Ropponica, and pink films through Excess Films, however these were not nearly as popular or critically respected as the Roman <b>Porno</b> series had been in its heyday. By {{the end of the}} 1980s, adult videos had become the main form of adult cinematic entertainment in Japan.|$|E

25|$|In a very {{successful}} effort to avoid bankruptcy, Nikkatsu, Japan's oldest major film studio, had entered the pink film, or soft-core pornography, genre three years earlier, in 1971, with its popular and critically praised Roman <b>Porno</b> series.

25|$|According to some sources, Mukai's Sexy Partners (1967) was {{the first}} S film. It {{was the first}} to use the subject as its primary theme. He worked with his wife, actress Takako Uchida, in several of his early films such as Nightly Pleasure (Yoru No Yorokobi, 1967), Stories of Adultery (Aru Mittsu, 1967), and Spring of Ecstasy (Kokotsu No Izumi, 1968). Stories of Adultery was a three-part omnibus film, with other two {{segments}} directed by Kōji Wakamatsu and Shinya Yamamoto. Mukai's section was titled Beauty and Ugliness (Bi To Shu). Takako Uchida later starred in Nikkatsu's big-budget pre-Roman <b>Porno</b> venture into the pink arena, Story Of Heresy In Meiji Era (1968). Mukai gave future first Nikkatsu Roman <b>Porno</b> star, Kazuko Shirakawa, her film debut with the 1967 film Girls' Dormitory. Until that studio's reorganization in 1967, Mukai's films were released principally through Kanto Films. In 1968, Mukai founded his own studio, and , was the first film released by Mukai Studios.|$|E

50|$|Jasper Sharp judges Pink Tush Girl to be arguably Ohara's best film. He {{writes that}} the film's road movie structure, catchy theme song, and longer running length make it a more fully rounded {{cinematic}} experience than many contemporary Nikkatsu Roman <b>Pornos.</b> He speculates that, because of the wider popularity of this film, Nikkatsu would have been wise to pursue the lighter tone of this film rather than the dark S&M films that they concentrated on producing at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Black viewed John Kricfalusi's website and, after {{watching}} The Ren & Stimpy Show, decided {{to ask him}} to produce the video. The total costs amounted to $40,000.The video was animated by John Kricfalusi's studio Spümcø. Gabe Swarr directed and co-wrote the video. Ben Jones was the layout artist and Derrick Wyatt designed the characters. It features cartoon versions of band members Jack Black and Kyle Gass as nude cherubim sent from Heaven to teach the Devil, who'd been having frantic sex with a female devil, to be loving in his relations with women. While at first concisely taking notes, Devil becomes enraged when he realizes that the cherubim are now pleasuring the she-devil instead, and moves to attack them. It's a public service announcement, we’re saying, ‘Don't always slam genitalia as hard as you can.’ I've seen <b>pornos</b> where the guys are ramming away, and the girls are pretending to enjoy it because they're getting paid. That’s a bad message being sent to kids watching those <b>pornos.</b> And this is our way of counteracting it. — Jack Black on the music video for [...] "Fuck Her Gently".|$|R
