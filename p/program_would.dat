5|$|The Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{estimated}} that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the existing fleet, and later implementing a successor <b>program</b> <b>would</b> cost $14–$21billion. It was reported {{not only that}} a new fleet would not be available until 2024 (at which point the existing helicopters would have remained in service while being over 50 years old), but that terminating the existing <b>program</b> <b>would</b> waste more than $3billion in sunk VH-71 costs. Following the President’s decision to terminate the program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded {{it would be more}} cost effective and less time consuming to continue with a variation of the existing VH-71 program.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{announced}} in May 2016 {{that the free}} upgrade offer would be extended to users of assistive technologies; however, Microsoft did not implement any means of certifying eligibility for this offer, which some outlets thereby promoted as being a loophole to fraudulently obtain a free Windows 10 upgrade. Microsoft said that the loophole {{is not intended to}} be used in this manner. In November 2017, Microsoft stated that this <b>program</b> <b>would</b> end December 31, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Starting from December 2007, the {{organization}} demanded that CBS cancel {{its plan to}} rebroadcast an edited version of the Showtime drama Dexter, whose title character was a serial killer and police forensics analyst, because it felt that the <b>program</b> <b>would</b> glorify murder even with the edits.

5|$|After the incident, Bågenholm {{became a}} subject of fiction and medical textbooks, and her case has been {{discussed}} in the leading British medical journal The Lancet. On 25 October 2009 her story was featured on CNN's television program Another Day: Cheating Death. Hosted by Sanjay Gupta, the program features stories {{from people who have}} survived severe conditions against all odds. Bågenholm hoped the <b>program</b> <b>would</b> give the people watching it more knowledge of hypothermia. The story is also included in Gupta's companion book, Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Lives Against All Odds. On 30 October 2009, Bågenholm and Gilbert appeared together on the popular Norwegian NRK talk show Skavlan, hosted by Fredrik Skavlan.|$|E
5|$|At a 29 March 1965 Southeast Asia Coordinating Committee {{meeting at}} Udon Thani, Thailand {{attended}} by Ambassador Sullivan, {{representatives from the}} 2nd Air Division, MACV, and Air America, responsibilities within the Barrel Roll operational area were ironed out. Command {{and control of the}} air <b>program</b> <b>would</b> remain in the ambassador's hands. Operational control of U.S. air assets devolved from the commander-in-chief, Pacific Forces (CINCPAC) in Honolulu through his air deputy at Pacific Air Forces or PACAF, to the 2nd Air Division (after 1 April 1966, the Seventh Air Force). Targets could be requested by the Royal Lao government, the CIA, or by MACV.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{eventually}} estimated at $100million, and many countries {{responded to the}} emergency with donations of blankets, tents, clothing, and food. Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris. The destruction around the earthquake's epicenter was, in places, almost total; this {{has been attributed to}} poor construction practices in rural areas, and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building codes for earthquake-safe buildings. With 1 in 3,000 deaths in Iran attributable to earthquakes, a US geophysicist has suggested that a country-wide rebuilding <b>program</b> <b>would</b> be needed to address the ongoing public safety concerns.|$|E

5|$|It {{became clear}} that {{managing}} the Apollo <b>program</b> <b>would</b> exceed the capabilities of Robert R. Gilruth's Space Task Group, which had been directing the nation's manned space program from NASA's Langley Research Center. So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center, the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC). A site was chosen in Houston, Texas, on land donated by Rice University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961. It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch facilities in Florida, so a new Mission Control Center would {{be included in the}} MSC.|$|E
5|$|Jo-ha-kyū is {{incorporated}} in traditional five-play program of Noh. The first play is jo, the second, third, and fourth plays are ha, and the fifth play is kyū. In fact, the five categories discussed below were created so that the <b>program</b> <b>would</b> represent jo-ha-kyū when one play from each category is selected and performed in order. Each play can be broken into three parts, the introduction, the development, and the conclusion. A play starts out in a slow tempo at jo, gets slightly faster at ha, then culminates in kyū.|$|E
5|$|Muren {{found both}} stop motion and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The <b>program</b> <b>would</b> then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E

5|$|On October 15, 1976, an {{arsonist}} lit a fire on {{a subway}} train at Christie station. The fire destroyed four subway cars and some wall tiles, and resulted in {{a section of the}} subway being closed for a few days. On September 19, 2007, the station modernization program was started. This <b>program</b> <b>would</b> result in making the subway system more accessible, add new bus and streetcar platforms, and improve the connections to regional buses and GO trains.|$|E
5|$|Once in orbit, Big G {{would have}} docked with space {{stations}} using an Apollo docking probe {{mounted on the}} rear of the cargo module, which was in turn mounted on {{the rear of the}} re-entry module. The re-entry module itself would have been enlarged to accommodate the larger crew, and the modifications made to the spacecraft for the MOL <b>program</b> <b>would</b> have been incorporated, including the hatch in the heat shield, which would have been used to provide access to the cargo module. In the event of a launch failure, the launch escape system developed for the Apollo spacecraft would have been used to propel the re-entry module clear of the rocket.|$|E
5|$|The bad {{economic}} times had continued, and strengthened {{the hand of}} forces for free silver. The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party; President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard, but {{an increasing number of}} rural Democrats wanted silver, especially in the South and West. The silverites took control of the 1896 Democratic National Convention and chose William Jennings Bryan for president; he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech. Bryan's financial radicalism shocked bankers—they thought his inflationary <b>program</b> <b>would</b> bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy. Hanna approached them for support for his strategy to win the election, and they gave $3.5 million for speakers and over 200million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions.|$|E

5|$|The launch, which {{occurred}} in pre-dawn darkness, {{was the first}} American night launch since Apollo 17, and was watched by several thousand spectators. The unusual launching time was due to tracking requirements for the primary payload, INSAT-1B; the <b>program</b> <b>would</b> not have another night launch until STS-61-B in 1985. The crew had attempted to prepare for it by training in darkened simulators so as to keep their night vision, but in practice {{it was discovered that}} the light of the solid-fuel rocket boosters made the immediate area around the launchpad virtually as bright as a day launch.|$|E
5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said {{it would be impossible to}} lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the <b>program</b> <b>would</b> be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E
5|$|All {{students}} {{enroll in}} one of five magnet programs. The High School University (HSU) magnet offers a traditional college preparatory curriculum with electives. The Math/Science/Technology (MST) magnet specifically prepares students for college programs in engineering, science and math. Minimal requirements for MST students include courses in algebra, trigonometry, calculus (including mandatory AP Calculus), biology, chemistry and computer programming. The Journalism & Communication (J) magnet focuses on journalism, publishing, and media production. To earn class credit, J students can participate in production of the school's national award-winning yearbook (The Crimson), student newspaper (The Crimson Record), award-winning literary magazine (One Blue Wall), multimedia website (RedEye) or a weekly morning television show called Manual AM, which is broadcast to all classrooms. The J program was formerly known as CMA (Communications and Media Arts), but the name was changed so that the Manual <b>program</b> <b>would</b> stand out from others in the district with similar names.|$|E

5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a waiting list. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks <b>program</b> <b>would</b> reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Captain Lyman Hall was {{appointed}} Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor, {{a position he}} held until his appointment as the school's second president in 1896. Hall had a solid background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his coursework. He had an energetic personality and quickly assumed a leadership position among the faculty. As president, Hall was noted for his aggressive fundraising and improvements to the school, including his special project, the A. French Textile School. In February 1899, Georgia Tech opened the first textile engineering school in the Southern United States, with $10,000 from the Georgia General Assembly, $20,000 of donated machinery, and $13,500 from supporters. It named the A. French Textile School after its chief donor and supporter, Aaron S. French. The textile engineering <b>program</b> <b>would</b> move to the Harrison Hightower Textile Engineering Building in 1949.|$|E
5|$|While Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and a newly {{returned}} Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) head to Galactica, {{the advancing}} Cylons destroy one ship and damage others, {{killing at least}} 600. After discovering their true identities, Cylons Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan), Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma), Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) continue their jobs.
