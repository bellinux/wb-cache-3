25|$|The U.S. Army {{continued}} to use Hercules as a front-line air defense weapon in Europe until 1983, when <b>Patriot</b> <b>missile</b> batteries were deployed. NATO units from West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Norway, Greece and Turkey {{continued to}} use the Hercules for high-altitude air defense until the late 1980s. With {{the collapse of communism}} in Eastern Europe, the units were deactivated in 1988. The last Hercules missile was launched in the Sardinian range of Capo San Lorenzo in Italy on November 24, 2006.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the Department of Defense {{recommended}} that the U.S. 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment be relocated to Fort Carson, Colorado. Efforts to consolidate units from another post with those units that remained at Fort Bliss were overruled by the Base Realignment and Closing Commission, leaving Fort Bliss without any armored vehicles. Units operating the US Army's MIM-104 <b>Patriot</b> <b>Missile</b> Defense System relocated to Fort Bliss during the 1990s. The Patriot system {{played an important role}} in the Persian Gulf War/Operation Desert Storm in 1991.

25|$|In January 2006, the ROCAF {{announced}} {{interest in}} procuring planes with VSTOL capability, especially the F-35. The ROCAF also sought next-generation upgrades {{to its current}} F-16s and Mirage 2000-5s and, in mid-2006, announced plans to buy 66 F-16 C/D Block 52 aircraft from the US for $3.1 billion USD. Later that year, however, the U.S. delayed the purchase; according to sources cited by National Defense Minister Lee Jye, the American stance was that, until a long-stalled arms purchase package consisting of six <b>Patriot</b> <b>Missile</b> Batteries, 12 P-3C Orion anti-submarine aircraft and 8 conventional submarines cleared the legislature, it {{did not see the}} ROC as having a consistent military procurement plan.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Royal Air Force Tornados from 9 and 617 Squadrons {{attacked}} the radar defence systems protecting Baghdad, but lost a Tornado on 22 March {{along with the}} pilot and navigator (Flight Lieutenant Kevin Main and Flight Lieutenant Dave Williams), shot down by an American <b>Patriot</b> <b>missile</b> as they returned to their airbase in Kuwait. On 1 April, an F-14 from USS Kitty Hawk crashed in southern Iraq reportedly due to engine failure, and a S-3B Viking plunged off {{the deck of the}} USS Constellation after a malfunction and an AV-8B Harrier jump jet went into the Gulf while it was trying to land on the USS Nassau.|$|E
25|$|Phased array radars {{have been}} in use since the {{earliest}} years of radar in World War II (Mammut radar), but electronic device limitations led to poor performance. Phased array radars were originally used for missile defence (see for example Safeguard Program). They are {{the heart of the}} ship-borne Aegis Combat System and the <b>Patriot</b> <b>Missile</b> System. The massive redundancy associated with having a large number of array elements increases reliability at the expense of gradual performance degradation that occurs as individual phase elements fail. To a lesser extent, Phased array radars have been used in Weather Surveillance. As of 2017, NOAA plans to implement a national network of Multi-Function Phased array radars throughout the United States within 10 years, for meteorological studies and flight monitoring.|$|E

25|$|The {{news that}} El Paso had been {{selected}} to receive major elements of the 1st Armored Division was met with joy, {{but at the same}} time many expressed surprise at the panel's recommendation to transfer the Air Defense Artillery School, 6th ADA Brigade, and its accompanying equipment (including the MIM-104 <b>Patriot</b> <b>Missile</b> Anti-Aircraft/Anti Missile defense system) to Fort Sill. On 25 August officials representing Fort Bliss went before the BRAC Commission to plead their case for maintaining the ADA school and its accompanying equipment at Fort Bliss, citing among other thing the size of Fort Bliss and the history of the ADA school in the region. The BRAC Commission ultimately ruled against Fort Bliss, and the roughly 4,500 affected soldiers were transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The entire transfer of soldiers to and from Fort Bliss was completed no later than 15 September 2011.|$|E
500|$|In January 2003, {{components}} of the 45th Infantry Brigade were deployed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Approximately 230 light infantry soldiers from A Company and B Company, 1st Battalion, 179th Infantry Regiment comprised Task Force Ironhorse under the United States Army Central Command (ARCENT). [...] Their primary mission {{leading up to the}} invasion of Iraq was to provide security for <b>Patriot</b> <b>missile</b> sites defending the respective countries from impending SCUD missile attacks. [...] In March 2003, Company A was ordered from the area in and around Riyadh to the northern border cities of Tabuk and Arar, Saudi Arabia in defense of Iraqi retaliation and security of strategically redeployed <b>Patriot</b> <b>Missile</b> sites. Company B was ordered to advance into Iraq from the Kuwaiti border to provide security for ammo caches and forward operating <b>Patriot</b> <b>missile</b> sites. Task Force Ironhorse was the first deployment of Oklahoma National Guard infantry soldiers to a combat zone since the Korean War (members of the Oklahoma National Guard deployed during Desert Storm as Field Artillery units). Task Force Ironhorse completed their mission and returned in August 2003.|$|E
500|$|On 23 March 2003, a Tornado GR4 {{was shot}} down over Iraq by {{friendly}} fire from a US <b>Patriot</b> <b>missile</b> battery, killing both crew members. In July 2003, a US board of inquiry exonerated the battery's operators, observing the Tornado's [...] "lack of functioning IFF (Identification Friend or Foe)" [...] {{as a factor in}} the incident. Problems with Patriot were also suggested as a factor, multiple incidents of mis-identification of friendly aircraft have occurred, including the fatal shootdown of a US Navy McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet {{a few weeks after the}} loss of the Tornado. Britain withdrew the last of its Tornados from Iraq in June 2009.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the war, <b>Patriot</b> <b>missiles</b> {{attempted}} {{engagement of}} over 40 hostile ballistic missiles. The {{success of these}} engagements, and in particular {{how many of them}} were real targets, is still controversial. Postwar video analysis of presumed interceptions by MIT professor Theodore Postol suggests that no Scud was actually hit; this analysis is contested by Peter D. Zimmerman, who claimed that photographs of the fuselage of downed SCUD missiles in Saudi Arabia demonstrated that the SCUD missiles were fired into Saudi Arabia and were riddled with fragments from the lethality enhancer of <b>Patriot</b> <b>Missiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pakistan {{claims to}} have {{developed}} the Babur in response to alleged reports that India was planning to acquire <b>Patriot</b> <b>missiles</b> from the US, in order {{to set up a}} ballistic missile defense system to counter Pakistan's arsenal of ballistic missiles.|$|R
500|$|The Arrow {{program was}} {{launched}} {{as a response}} to the acquisition by Arab states of long range surface-to-surface missiles. The United States and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding to co-fund it in 1986, and in 1988 the United States Department of Defense Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) placed an order with Israel Aircraft Industries for the Arrow 1 technology demonstrator. Over the years SDIO was renamed to Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), and later to Missile Defense Agency (MDA), while Israel Aircraft Industries was renamed to Israel Aerospace Industries. The Gulf War, which exposed the controversial performance of the <b>Patriot</b> <b>missile</b> against Iraqi [...] "Al Hussein" [...] missiles, gave further impetus to the development of the Arrow. It was initially designed to intercept missiles such as the SS-1 [...] "Scud", its [...] "Al Hussein" [...] derivative, the SS-21 [...] "Scarab" [...] operated by Syria, and the CSS-2 operated by Saudi Arabia. The Arrow evolved also with an eye on the advanced missile programs of Iran.|$|E
500|$|The {{group was}} unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit visa because customs {{believed}} that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts. As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, [...] "The craziness was this: {{they were not the}} regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner...when you're doing what we do with them—that makes a world of difference". During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he [...] "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided <b>Patriot</b> <b>missile,</b> right towards the disco ball high above the crowd...The bottle nailed the disco ball, and... came falling down... on top of some English kid's head.... We must've knocked fifteen or twenty people flat-out cold on that tour...Shaggy and I both had black eyes and several injuries and bruises ourselves from them things hittin' us".|$|E
500|$|The 45th Infantry Brigade {{was formed}} from {{existing}} {{elements of the}} disbanded 45th Infantry Division which had seen action during World War II and the Korean War. Concurrently, the 45th Field Artillery Group (today's 45th Fires Brigade) and 90th Troop Command, were also formed in the same way. The 45th Infantry Brigade was activated in 1968 and assigned to training duties for active duty army units until 1994 when the 45th was selected as one of 15 [...] "enhanced brigades". The brigade deployed {{as part of the}} UN peacekeeping force {{in the wake of the}} Bosnian War, with C Company, 1-179th Infantry being among the first National Guard units to see duty there. In 2003, A Co 1-179 deployed to Saudi Arabia while B 1-179 deployed to Kuwait to provide security for <b>Patriot</b> <b>missile</b> sites. During the invasion of Iraq, B Co 1-179 pushed North of Baghdad establishing a foothold in Taji Iraq. Later that year, the 45th deployed to Afghanistan to train soldiers of the Afghan National Army which was followed by a deployment to Iraq to assist in the turning over of American military bases to Iraqi forces. A second brigade deployment to Afghanistan in 2011 assigned the brigade to full-spectrum operations for the first time since the 1950s.|$|E

Later, on February 4, 1991, at a male-only sports banquet in Stamford, Connecticut, Kiam told the attendees a crude joke about the incident. Referring to the United States military's use of <b>Patriot</b> <b>missiles</b> during the then-ongoing Gulf War, Kiam said to the audience: [...] "What do the Iraqis {{have in common with}} Lisa Olson? They've both seen <b>Patriot</b> <b>missiles</b> up close." [...] After criticism, Kiam apologized for the joke two days after he had told it.|$|R
