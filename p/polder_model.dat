For centuries, people inhabiting the Dongting Lake area have been {{reclaiming}} land and constructing dams for flood resistance, agricultural production, and rural settlement, forming geographical entities known as polders. In this study, the regional spatial distributions of polders in the Dongting Lake area in 1949, 1998, and 2013 were obtained using historical maps and modern remotely sensed data, revealing changes since {{the establishment of the}} People's Republic of China. Nanxian County was then selected to demonstrate polder changes at the county level, because it has undergone the most dramatic changes in the area. Different <b>polder</b> change <b>models</b> for the Datonghu, Yule, and Renhe polders were analyzed for eight periods: 1644 (the early Qing Dynasty), 1911 (the late Qing Dynasty), 1930 (the Republic of China), 1949 (the People's Republic of China), 1963, 1970, 1998, and 2013. Three resulting <b>polder</b> evolution <b>models</b> are: 1) reclaiming polders from lakes, 2) integrating polders by stream merging, and 3) abandoning polders for flood release. The <b>polder</b> evolution <b>models</b> demonstrate the wisdom of local people in using land resources according to the specific regional conditions. Throughout their long-term historical evolution, the spatial distribution of polders in the Dongting Lake area tended to be homogeneous, and the degree of human disturbance tended to be stable. However, a shift occurred, from pure polder area growth or removal to more comprehensive management and protection of the regional environment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{searches}} for {{the origins of the}} relatively successful performance of Hoogovens, the only sizeable steel firm in the Netherlands. It is suggested that Hoogovens has at critical moments benefited substantially from both strategic and financial support, but was basically left to decide its own policies. Luckily, it mostly opted for 'right' policies so that the industry's decline hit less hard in the Netherlands than elsewhere thus making it less necessary to develop emergency programmes. More specifically, Hoogovens chose to diversify into the aluminium market at a relatively early stage, and it broke up its merger with Germany's Hoesch. However, Hoogovens also benefited from the <b>Polder</b> <b>Model's</b> emphasis on wage restraint as much of the firm's output is exported. Moreover, corporatist welfare arrangements allowed Hoogovens to shed labour without causing extraordinary unrest. It is concluded that the success of 'laissez-faire intervention' heavily depends on the qualities of the supported firm's management. Polder-type governance in terms of wages and labour has beneficial effects in the short run, may but retard innovation. industrial policy;Dutch Miracle;steel industry...|$|R

Focusing here on a line of causation running from collective bargaining to trust, the design features of collective bargaining systems that could potentially help build up trust would include built-in incentives to continue bargaining rather than walking away in the case of failure, government involvement, and long-term contracting. On this basis, we would (also) adduce support for the <b>polder</b> or Dutch <b>model.</b>|$|R

40|$|The POLDER- 1 {{instrument}} {{was able to}} measure aerosol and cloud properties for eight months in 1996 – 1997. We use these observational data for aerosol concentration (the aerosol index), cloud optical thickness, and cloud droplet effective radius to establish statistical relationships among these parameters in order to analyze {{the first and second}} aerosol indirect effects. We also evaluate the representation of these effects as parameterized in the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique–Zoom (LMDZ) general circulation model. We find a decrease in cloud top droplet radius with increasing aerosol index in both the model and the observations. Our results are only slightly changed if the analysis is done at fixed cloud liquid water path (LWP) instead of considering all LWP conditions. We also find a positive correlation between aerosol index and cloud liquid water path, which is particularly pronounced over the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. This may be interpreted as observational evidence for the second aerosol indirect effect on a large scale. The model-simulated relationship agrees well with that derived from <b>POLDER</b> data. <b>Model</b> simulations show a rather small change in the two relationships if preindustrial rather than present-day aerosol distributions are used. However, when entirely switching off the second aerosol indirect effect in our model, we find a much steeper slope than we do when including it...|$|R

40|$|A {{spatially}} explicit {{dynamic model}} was developed that combines water {{quantity and quality}} processes for an average Dutch peat <b>polder.</b> The <b>model</b> {{has been used to}} calculate the consequences of climate change for surface water level, groundwater level and nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes, based on time series (2036 - 2065) of the two most extreme climate change scenarios for the Netherlands (G and W+) developed by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute. It was calibrated using measured data from two existing polders. The results suggest that surface water levels will not change much in both scenarios. Hence, the current practice of letting extra water in during dry summer periods to maintain sufficient water levels will probably remain a viable solution to temporary summer droughts in the near future as the required water volumes are not likely to increase greatly. Late summer groundwater levels decrease substantially in the W+ scenario but not in the moderate G scenario. This drop in groundwater level would accelerate the on-going process of peat oxidation, resulting in increased soil subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient release from mineralisation. The W+ scenario also led to higher nitrogen concentrations and lower phosphorus concentrations in the ditch network. Probably the reduced stream velocity in the W+ scenario results in an increased sedimentation of (adsorbed) phosphate. Sedimentation is a less important process in the nitrogen cycle, and the increased nitrogen concentrations anticipated in summer according to the W+ scenario are therefore probably the consequence of a reduced outlet of water due to increased evaporation. Additionally, an increased delivery of nitrogen through mineralisation could also contribute to the increased nitrogen concentrations in summer. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|Plans {{are made}} to enlarge the tidal flat area around the Zwin estuary which is silting up and {{situated}} around the Dutch-Belgian border. First, {{the evolution of the}} fresh-salt water flow and fresh-salt water distribution is simulated in this area and the surrounding polder area for a period of 50 years taking into account the forecasted sealevel rise.

MOCDENS 3 D is used to simulate the 3 D groundwater flow. After this first simulation the evolution of the fresh-salt water distribution and flow is simulated for a period of 50 years taking into account the expansion of the estuary and its surrounding tidal flats with a surface of 120 hectare. This action results in an increase of the salt water seepage area in the adjacent <b>polder</b> area.

40|$|Polarization is more {{sensitive}} than intensity to cloud microstructure such as the particle size and shape, and multiple scattering does not wash out features in polarization as effectively {{as it does in}} the intensity. Polarization measurements, particularly in the near IR, are potentially a valuable tool for cloud identification and for studies of the microphysics of clouds. The POLDER instrument is designed to provide wide field of view bidirectional images in polarized light. During the ASTEX-SOFIA campaign on June 12 th, 1992, over the Atlantic Ocean (near the Azores Islands), images of homogeneous thick stratocumulus cloud fields were acquired. During the EUCREX' 94 (April, 1994) campaign, the POLDER instrument was flying over the region of Brittany (France), taking observations of cirrus clouds. This study involves model studies and data analysis of <b>POLDER</b> observations. Both <b>models</b> and data analysis show that POLDER can be used to detect cloud thermodynamic phases. Model results show that polarized reflection in the Lamda = 0. 86 micron band is sensitive to cloud droplet sizes but not to cloud optical thickness. Comparison between model and data analysis reveals that cloud droplet sizes during ASTEX are about 5 microns, which agrees very well with the results of in situ measurements (4 - 5 microns). Knowing the retrieved cloud droplet sizes, the total reflected intensity of the POLDER measurements then can be used to retrieve cloud optical thickness. The close agreement between data analysis and model results during ASTEX also suggests the homogeneity of the cloud layer during that campaign...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Geometrical optical (GO) {{models have}} been widely used in remote sensing {{applications}} because of their simplicity and ability to simulate angular variation of remote sensing signals from the earth’s surface. GO models are generally accurate in the vis-ible part of the solar spectrum, but less accurate in near-infrared (NIR) part in which multiple scattering in plant canopies is the strongest. Although turbid-media radiative transfer (RT) methods have been introduced to GO models to cope with the second-order and higher order scattering, the problem of canopy geometrical ef-fects on multiple scattering still remains and becomes the main ob-stacle in GO model applications. In this paper, we propose and test a multiple scattering scheme to simulate angular variation in mul-tiply scattered radiation in plant canopies. This scheme is based on various view factors between sunlit and shaded components (both foliage and background) in the canopy and allows the geo-metrical effects to propagate to the second-order and higher order scattering simulations. As the view factors depend on the canopy geometry, the scheme is particularly useful in GO models. This new scheme is implemented in the 4 -Scale Model [4], which previ-ously used band-specific multiple scattering factors. After the use of the scheme, these factors are removed and the multiple scatt-tering at a given wavelength and angle of observation can be au-tomatically computed. Improvements made with this scheme are shown in comparison with the top-of-canopy (i. e., PARABOLA) and airborne (i. e., <b>POLDER)</b> measurements with <b>modeled</b> results with and without the scheme. Examples of canopy-level hyperspec-tral signatures simulated using the scheme are also shown.

40|$|Polder {{areas as}} typical in the Netherlands require real time {{control on the}} water levels. Efficient pumping is a subject with {{increasing}} interest due to a required use of 20 % green energy by 2020 set by the government. In 2010, the energy requirements already exceeded 175 GWh per year. For optimal control, water level predictions are important. However, they are uncertain due to errors in model structure, parameter estimation, initial states and observed forcing data. Especially the rainfall was found to contribute to water level prediction uncertainty. The uncorrected radar rainfall forcing data available in real time underestimate the corrected radar rainfall measurement over 100 %, worsening with increasing rainfall intensities. The {{aim of the research}} was to asses whether data assimilation can reduce the uncertainty on the water level predictions in a Delfland polder. The <b>polder</b> is <b>modelled</b> with a conceptual rainfall-runoff model in Sobek RR, while the data assimilation is implemented as an ensemble Kalman filter in OpenDA. In order to manipulate the states in Sobek RR for data assimilation, the model was extended by a black-box wrapper that was newly created in Java for this research. To asses the theoretical applicability of data assimilation in a polder area, four twin experiments were carried out, which differed only in the model components to which noise was applied. The four set-ups included the use of a rainfall multiplier, additive noise on the model states, additive noise on the groundwater state and a single multiplier for all states. The results were compared visually and objectively through the probabilistic Nash Sutcliffe, a model efficiency coefficient. All set ups for the twin experiment generated good results for the assimilated water level, mimicking the observed water levels closely with probabilistic Nash Sutcliffe values ranging between 0. 92 to 0. 97. However, only the set up with the rainfall multiplier exhibited good score measures for the hidden states, with an average of 0. 6, showing a significant improvement over the case without assimilation. The other twin experiments failed to represent the hidden states, with average score measures below zero. The data assimilation set-up with the rainfall multiplier was then applied using water level observations from Tedingerbroek polder. The pump pattern and magnitude of water levels of the modelled and observed water level differed significantly. The influence of the different model components on the modelled water level was assessed, from which was concluded that these could not account for the difference in modelled and observed values. Possible explanations are due to a non-representative measurement point in the polder or additional unknown water fluxes coming into the polder. Recommended further research should focus on creating a larger observation network; implementing multiple water level observation locations, collecting pump discharges and taking measurements of the storage in greenhouse basins. The last could give a method to validate the assimilation of the hidden states, whereas the pump discharges should be used as additional observation in the data assimilation. <br/...|$|R

40|$|In {{the flower}} bulb area, {{phosphorus}} leaching from agricultural soils poses an important barrier for reaching water quality goals. In this research project, a model {{was built to}} estimate {{the contributions of the}} hydrological sources seepage and agriculture to the phosphorus load of the surface water, in particular the Leidse Vaart. This should ultimately help to estimate the potential effects of measures on surface water quality. Main question answered is: How is the phosphorus concentration in the Leidse Vaart influenced by the sources seepage and agriculture? The start model was the already existing SOBEK model from the Water Board of Rijnland, which models the contribution by agriculture with the rainfall runoff (RR) module and the main waterways (Dutch: ‘boezemkanalen’) with the channel flow (CF) module. Chosen was to change and extend this model to a SOBEK-Delwaq model. Delwaq is the water quality module of SOBEK that makes it possible to model different substances (e. g. nitrogen, phosphorus) and different processes (e. g. adsorption, mineralization, biological activity). Besides that, Delwaq makes it possible to distinguish between sources of these substances (e. g. seepage, sewage treatment plants). Chosen was to only model the sources seepage and agriculture, only model the substance ortho-phosphate (PO 4), and only model the processes advection (by mass balance equation) and adsorption (by Langmuir isotherm). For 2 polders (that were actually not located in the flower bulb area), of which one experiences seepage and one experiences infiltration, a sensitivity analysis was done with a reference scenario that has a PO 4 concentration of 3 g PO 4 /m 3 for the source seepage or agriculture. The influence of changes in initial concentration, source concentration, water volume in the polder, and residence time of the substances was tested. As check for adsorption, also the conservative tracer chloride was modeled. From this sensitivity analysis it is concluded that the concentration in the main waterways is especially influenced by the source agriculture: a lot of PO 4 is added to the polder channels {{at the same time in}} combination with a fast discharge to the main waterways. Therefore PO 4 at the top of the water column does not come in contact with the sediment, disallowing adsorption to take place. Because seepage is a continuous source with low concentrations, there is much more mixing in the water column and more interaction of PO 4 with the sediment. For the Leidse Vaart, every polder in the flower bulb area (consisting of 69 <b>polders)</b> was <b>modeled</b> with the reference scenario to get an indication of the contributions of seepage and agriculture. A polder was assigned to belong to the flower bulb area when flower bulbs were included in the agricultural crop list, and the polder was located in the west of Rijnland. The results are only meant as a basis for future modeling because of the limited processes included in the model. The results indicate that seepage potentially is a big contributor. However, additional research and modeling is necessary to give definite numbers of its contribution...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{modelling}} partially magnetised linear 3 -port junction circulator, which is non-uniformly biased, depends chiefly on the precise {{representation of the}} strength of the intrinsic magnetic field in the axial direction across the ferrite material placed at the centre of the junction. The inadequateness of using conventional Polder tensor, which is established with the assumption that the ferrite material is saturated by a constant uniform magnetic field, in modelling partially and non-uniformly magnetised 3 -port ferrite junction circulators is presented. It is proposed that the combination of static and microwave finite element (FE) solver overcomes the limit of <b>Polder</b> tensor in <b>modelling</b> partially and non-uniformly magnetised ferrite junction circulator. The proposed combination method requires the generation of the steady magnetic field in a magnetostatic solver, where the magnetic state of the ferrite material is determined, and the information of the static magnetic field of ferrite junction is transferred to the microwave solver for use in the microwave permeability tensor of the partially magnetised ferrite junction. Using the coupling method, the reflection coefficient responses of the 3 -port ferrite junction circulator are determined in the low field loss region which coincides with the partially magnetised region and accompanies a few undesirable problems in communication systems, such as the reduction of bandwidth, and intermodulation product interference. The determined reflection coefficient is used to obtain the split frequencies which are important in designing and analysing the performance of a 3 -port ferrite circulator in partially magnetised region. The main modelling factors considered are the effects from the number of mesh, the type of the magnetic field, the biasing configurations and the value of the dielectric constant. In each case, various split frequencies are obtained and, by considering all factors step by step, optimal modelling conditions are decided. The modelling results are compared with the experiment and show good agreement. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Breaching is {{the most}} {{frequent}} form of embankment failure in the world. Due to overtopping, an embankment starts to breach when part of the embankment actually breaks away, leaving an opening for water to flood the land protected by the embankment. A breach can be a sudden or gradual failure that is caused by surface erosion and/or headcut erosion in the embankment. The magnitude and extent of the losses depend highly on the rate of breaching of the embankment, which determines the discharge through the breach and the speed and rate of inundation of the valley or <b>polder.</b> Therefore, <b>modelling</b> of the breach evolution in embankments is of significant interest for damage assessment and risk analysis. It is also important {{for the development of}} early warning systems for dike and dam failures and of evacuation plans for people at risk. The breach flow {{plays an important role in}} the embankment breaching process, coupling the hydraulic process and the sediment transport process. During the breaching process, the flow overtops the entire embankment crest and generates the breach channel in the initial phase of the breach development. As the breach further develops, the breach flow goes only through the breach channel due to the decrease of the upstream water level. The breach flow can thus be classified as compound weir flow and weir flow, each having own special characteristics. In a breach, the helicoidal flow accelerates the sediment undermining at the toe of the breach slopes and widens the breach in the lateral direction of the embankment. A triangular hydraulic jump happens when the breach flow changes from supercritical flow into subcritical flow, with a triangular critical area at the toe of the breach. The triangular hydraulic jump works as a driving force to the headcut erosion in the breaching process and the scour hole development at the toe of embankment. According to the hydraulic energy loss in the breach, the discharge coefficients are deducted for both weir flow condition and compound weir flow condition. The resulting discharge coefficients can be used in the calculation of the breach discharge in a breach model. In the present study, five runs of breach experiments were conducted in a relative large laboratory flume. The experimental results clearly expose the hydrodynamic process and the erosion process in the breaching of the cohesive embankment. The breaching starts with the initial erosion of the embankment surface washing away the embankment surface. Due to the surface erosion at the toe of the embankment, the headcut erosion is stimulated on the embankment slope. While headcut migration stimulates the breach to develop in longitudinal direction, the lateral erosion triggers the breach to widen in lateral direction. Three types of erosion (surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion) contribute to the breach erosion process in the embankment, however, the breach flow is the driving force for the erosion. Sediment deposition in the breaching process, generally ignored in the embankment breaching studies, is also of importance. A mathematical model has been developed that couples weir flow and erosion (surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion). The breaching process is simplified into initial development, deepening development and widening development, corresponding with surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion, respectively. As the link between flow and embankment material, erosion plays a key role in the embankment breach model. Mathematical descriptions of the headcut migration and the lateral migration rate have been developed to simulate the breaching process in cohesive embankments. The headcut erosion and the lateral erosion are considered to occur in the form of clay blocks instead of in the form of individual clay particles.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of present atmospheric transport processes from Southern Hemisphere (SH) landmasses to Antarctica {{can improve the}} interpretation of stratigraphic data in Antarctic ice cores. In addition, long range transport can deliver key nutrients normally not available to marine ecosystems in the Southern Ocean and may trigger or enhance primary productivity. However, there is a dearth of observational based studies of dust transport in the SH. This work aims to improve current {{understanding of}} dust transport in the SH by showing a characterization of two dust events originating in the Patagonia desert (south end of South America). The approach {{is based on a}} combined and complementary use of satellite retrievals (detectors MISR, MODIS, GLAS, <b>POLDER,</b> OMI), transport <b>model</b> simulation (HYSPLIT) and surface observations near the sources and aerosol measurements in Antarctica (Neumayer and Concordia sites). Satellite imagery and visibility observations confirm dust emission in a stretch of dry lakes along the coast of the Tierra del Fuego (TdF) island (~ 54 ° S) and from the shores of the Colihue Huapi lake in Central Patagonia (~ 46 ° S) in February 2005. Model simulations initialized by these observations reproduce the timing of an observed increase in dust concentration at the Concordia Station and some of the observed increases in atmospheric aerosol absorption (here used as a dust proxy) in the Neumayer station. The TdF sources were the largest contributors of dust at both sites. The transit times from TdF to the Neumayer and Concordia sites are 6 – 7 and 9 – 10 days respectively. Lidar observations and model outputs coincide in placing most of the dust cloud in the boundary layer and suggest significant deposition over the ocean immediately downwind. Boundary layer dust was detected as far as 1800 km from the source and $sim $ 800 km north of the South Georgia Island over the central sub-Antarctic Atlantic Ocean. Although the analysis suggests the presence of dust at ~ 1500 km SW of South Africa five days after, the limited capabilities of existing satellite platforms to differentiate between aerosol types do not permit a definitive conclusion. In addition, the model simulations show dust lifting to the free troposphere as it travels south but it could not be confirmed by the satellite observations due to cloudiness. This work demonstrates that complementary information from existing transport models, satellite and surface data can yield a consistent picture of the dust transport from the Patagonia desert to Antarctica. It also illustrates the limitation of using any of these approaches individually to characterize the transport of dust in a heavily cloudy area...|$|R
40|$|Historically the Netherlands {{have always}} {{had to deal with}} the threat of flooding, both from the rivers and the sea as well as from heavy rainfall. The country {{consists}} of a large amount of polders, which are low lying areas of land protected from flooding by embankments. These polders require an extensive water storage and drainage system to discharge excess water to the surrounding ‘outside water’. Through a large system of ditches water is pumped onto large storage canals which in turn drain in to the ‘outside water’: in the sea or in rivers. In Dutch these drainage canals are called ‘Boezems’. The embankments which enclose the storage canals inside the polders are called Regional Flood Defences. The objective is to determine whether or not the flood risk approach can be applied to a system of regional flood defence systems, given the existing data and ‘state of the art’ methods. The proposed methodology will provide a basis for more thorough assessment of the regional flood defences, not only based on the safety standards, but including the failure probabilities of all relevant geotechnical failure mechanisms and corresponding consequences of flooding. The project focuses on ‘Boezemkaden’, which will be addressed as regional flood defences in the remainder of this document. These flood defences typically retain lower hydraulic heads than primary flood defences. Risk assessment methodology Flood risk is assessed by the annual expected damage due to flooding, which is estimated by multiplying the probability of flooding with the consequences of flooding. The largest knowledge gaps exist in the calculation of probabilities, because several ‘state of the art’ models are available to determine the flood consequences due to breaches in a flood defence system. Probability of flooding The probability of failure of a system of flood defences is determined based on a schematization of the system, which divides it in sections with similar strength properties. Probabilistic methods are used to determine the probability of failure of one section. Flood scenarios are defined as groups of sections which have similar consequences during a flood: these are chosen such that every breach in this group, regardless of its location, will lead to the same flood consequences. To obtain the probability of one flood scenario, the failure probabilities of individual dike sections are combined. The probability of flooding of the whole system can be determined by combining the scenario probabilities. The manner in which the failure probabilities are combined depends on the occurrence of relief in the system: 9 ̆ 5 Relief: if failure of one section results in lower loads on the other sections relief is taken in to account. This can be done in two ways: by assuming that the weakest section fails first or by assuming that the first loaded section fails first; 9 ̆ 5 No relief: if failure of one section does not have any effect on the loads of other sections, no relief is taken in to account. The occurrence of relief strongly depends on the volume of water inside the canal compared to the size of the inundated area after a breach. The extent of relief in canal systems requires careful investigation for every case study. With relief, we can assume only one breach is possible within one canal system. However, when there is no relief multiple breaches are possible. This is an important part of the schematization of the system, as the occurrence of relief has large effect on flood risk. Flood consequences It is assumed that floods resulting from a breach in a regional flood defence system only have inundation depths in the order of decimetres, except for the occasional deeper polders. Due to the low expected inundation depths no loss of life is taken in to account. The economic consequences are determined with HIS SSM and WSS. The HIS SSM model provides an estimate of the economic consequences and loss of life for large floods, with inundation depths of several meters. A disadvantage of the model is that it is inaccurate for low inundation depths.

40|$|Historically the Netherlands {{have always}} {{had to deal with}} the threat of flooding, both from the rivers and the sea as well as from heavy rainfall. The country {{consists}} of a large amount of polders, which are low lying areas of land protected from flooding by embankments. These polders require an extensive water storage and drainage system to discharge excess water to the surrounding ‘outside water’. Through a large system of ditches water is pumped onto large storage canals which in turn drain in to the ‘outside water’: in the sea or in rivers. In Dutch these drainage canals are called ‘Boezems’. The embankments which enclose the storage canals inside the polders are called Regional Flood Defences. The objective is to determine whether or not the flood risk approach can be applied to a system of regional flood defence systems, given the existing data and ‘state of the art’ methods. The proposed methodology will provide a basis for more thorough assessment of the regional flood defences, not only based on the safety standards, but including the failure probabilities of all relevant geotechnical failure mechanisms and corresponding consequences of flooding. The project focuses on ‘Boezemkaden’, which will be addressed as regional flood defences in the remainder of this document. These flood defences typically retain lower hydraulic heads than primary flood defences. Risk assessment methodology Flood risk is assessed by the annual expected damage due to flooding, which is estimated by multiplying the probability of flooding with the consequences of flooding. The largest knowledge gaps exist in the calculation of probabilities, because several ‘state of the art’ models are available to determine the flood consequences due to breaches in a flood defence system.

The probability of flooding of the whole system can be determined by combining the scenario probabilities. The manner in which the failure probabilities are combined depends on the occurrence of relief in the system:  Relief: if failure of one section results in lower loads on the other sections relief is taken in to account. This can be done in two ways: by assuming that the weakest section fails first or by assuming that the first loaded section fails first;  No relief: if failure of one section does not have any effect on the loads of other sections, no relief is taken in to account.

Both methods are used and compared in this report; the difference between both estimators can reach up to 20 %. No clear distinction can be made of which estimator provides an upper or lower limit. Uncertainties in loads on regional flood defences To determine failure probabilities, insight is required in the statistical distribution of the governing loads, which for regional flood defences are: 1) Hydraulic loads: water levels inside the canals and resulting groundwater level; 2) Traffic loads: vertical loads on top of the flood defence; Waves in these canals are neglected. Currently a research program is undergoing on the stability of peat dikes during droughts. This load is not taken in to account at this stage, because the results of this research are expected to largely influence the assessment of regional flood defences. Furthermore, a case study is chosen for a region where earthquake loading is not present. Hydraulic loads We consider the volume of water in the canals being governed by the inflow from the polder drainage stations and the outflow to the outside water; neglecting rainfall, seepage and local wind set up. These water levels are regulated by the water boards. During extreme rainfall events, the canals have a certain storage volume available for storage of excess water out of the polders pumped on to the canals, which is determined by the difference between the target water level and the ‘drain stop level’; the maximum allowed water level on the canals. Once the ‘drain stop level’ is reached, the polder drainage stations are not allowed to keep pumping water on to the canals. This event may only occur with a probability of 1 / 100 per year. Whether or not the drain stop is successful depends on the way these are managed. During heavy rainfall events, water boards may have to choose between having to exceed the ‘drain stop level’ on the canals to keep polders dry, or vice versa. The drain stop may fail due to factors which cannot be influenced by the waterboard, or because a certain part of a polder needs to remain dry. The event where the water levels exceed the drain stop level is defined as ‘failure of the drain stop’. Water level observations are used to determine the water level statistic of the regulated system. A Generalized Pareto Distribution is fitted through independent peaks of water levels in the canals. This distribution is modified, to account for the regulation of water levels in the system, by making a distinction successful and unsuccessful drain stop, see Figure 21. Traffic loads The combination of hydraulic loads (high water levels) and traffic loads is governing for the stability of the flood defence. Expert ellicitation was used to determine the statistical distribution of traffic loads. Water board employees responsible for the assessment of the regional flood defences were asked to provide estimates of the 5 th, 50 th and 95 th quantiles of the statistical distribution of the traffic loads. Furthermore, they were asked to provide an estimate of the correlation between the traffic load and water level. The resulting traffic load distribution is shown in Figure 25, for green and grey flood defences. No correlations between the traffic load and water levels was expected with average water levels; the experts all agreed on this point. However, they did not agree on the correlation between the traffic load and the extreme water levels, which was either positive or negative. Different combinations of hydraulic and traffic loads are possible, which depend on the management of the water board. Specifically the policy regarding traffic loads on a regional flood defence determines which combinations of loads are most likely to occur. We determined the probability of failure of the regional flood defences with and without traffic loads. Using this methodology, we showed the influence of the traffic loads on the failure probability and risk of regional flood defences, which is significant. Uncertainties in strength of regional flood defences The following failure mechanisms are governing for regional flood defences: Overflow, Piping and Instability of the inner slope. FORM reliability calculations are used to determine the probability of failure for each mechanism. Overflow will occur when the water levels in the canal exceed the retaining height of the surrounding flood defence. The limit state function of overflow is based on a critical overflow amount, which can lead to erosion of the inner slope and breaching. The stability for piping is calculated with the updated Sellmeijer formula. ‘Hydraulic short circuiting’ is required for piping to develop under regional flood defences. Recent research has shown that hydraulic short circuiting is likely to occur when there is an aquifer below the canals. The response of the water pressure behind the dike to intrusion of water from the canal in the aquifer depends on the thickness of the aquifer. Field tests are required to determine the reduced hydraulic head over the flood defence, due to reduced infiltration of water from the canal to the aquifer. D-Geo Stability is used to determine the probability of failure for inner slope instability. The failure probability of critical slip circles is calculated with Bishop, for several combinations of water levels, piezo metric lines and traffic loads. Only slip circles which will lead to breaching of the|$|R
