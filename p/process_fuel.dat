40|$|CO 2 {{emission}} {{estimation of}} cement production is an underlying tool {{to identify the}} CO 2 sources, to evaluate the reduction efforts and to set prospective reduction targets for the Chinese cement industry. However, lack of domestic data has limited the reliability and accuracy of CO 2 emission estimation for Chinese cement industry. To develop an accurate and comprehensive CO 2 emission factor for Chinese cement industry, this study established a factory-level database of 197 cement production lines from 21 provinces covering various capacity scales. On {{the basis of this}} database, <b>process,</b> <b>fuel,</b> electricity and synthesized emission factor were computed. Furthermore, bootstrap simulation and Monte Carlo simulation were applied to evaluate the uncertainty of these factors. After corrections for cement kiln dust (CKD), incomplete decomposition, organic carbon and inorganic carbon, the medians of <b>process,</b> <b>fuel</b> and direct emission factors are 525, 369, and 919 kg CO 2 /t clinker, respectively. Electricity emission factor is 74. 9 kg CO 2 /t clinker. The final synthesized emission factor for cement product is 761 kg CO 2 /t cement with uncertainties of [- 34. 8 %, + 31. 69]. In this study, two revised calculation methods for the process emission factor are applied. Two calculation methods for the fuel emission factor are adopted as well. These practices seek to improve the reliability and accuracy of cement CO 2 emission factor. The simulated results indicate that the revised output method produces more accurate estimation for the process emission factor than the revised input method and unrevised output method. For fuel emission factor, the CC (carbon content) method is more accurate than the NCV (net calorific value) method. Simulated results are also compared with other authoritative estimation to validate the reliability of the CO 2 emission factors calculated in the present study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background: The {{availability}} of feedstock options {{is a key}} to meeting the volumetric requirement of 136. 3 billion liters of renewable fuels per year beginning in 2022, as required in the US 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. Life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of sorghum-based ethanol need to be assessed for sorghum {{to play a role in}} meeting that requirement. Results: Multiple sorghum-based ethanol production pathways show diverse well-to-wheels (WTW) energy use and GHG emissions due to differences in energy use and fertilizer use intensity associated with sorghum growth and differences in the ethanol conversion processes. All sorghum-based ethanol pathways can achieve significant fossil energy savings. Relative to GHG emissions from conventional gasoline, grain sorghum-based ethanol can reduce WTW GHG emissions by 35 % or 23 %, respectively, when wet or dried distillers grains with solubles (DGS) is the co-product and fossil natural gas (FNG) is consumed as the <b>process</b> <b>fuel.</b> The reduction increased to 56 % or 55 %, respectively, for wet or dried DGS co-production when renewable natural gas (RNG) from anaerobic digestion of animal waste is used as the <b>process</b> <b>fuel.</b> These results do not include land-use change (LUC) GHG emissions, which we take as negligible. If LUC GHG emissions for grain sorghum ethanol as estimated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included (26 g CO 2 e/MJ), these reductions when wet DGS is co-produced decrease to 7 % or 29 % when FNG or RNG is used as the <b>process</b> <b>fuel.</b> Sweet sorghum-based ethanol can reduce GHG emissions by 71 % or 72 % without or with use of co-produced vinasse as farm fertilizer, respectively, in ethanol plants using only sugar juice to produce ethanol. If both sugar and cellulosic bagasse were used in the future for ethanol production, an ethanol plant with a combined heat and power (CHP) system that supplies all process energy can achieve a GHG emission reduction of 70 % or 72 %, respectively, without or with vinasse fertigation. Forage sorghum-based ethanol can achieve a 49 % WTW GHG emission reduction when ethanol plants meet process energy demands with CHP. In the case of forage sorghum and an integrated sweet sorghum pathway, the use of a portion of feedstock to fuel CHP systems significantly reduces fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions. Conclusions: This study provides new insight into life-cycle energy use and GHG emissions of multiple sorghum-based ethanol production pathways in the US. Our results show that adding sorghum feedstocks to the existing options for ethanol production could help in meeting the requirements for volumes of renewable, advanced and cellulosic bioethanol production in the US required by the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard program...|$|E
