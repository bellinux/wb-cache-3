5|$|The German {{occupation}} administration repressed <b>political</b> <b>dissent</b> {{and launched}} numerous unpopular measures, including the deportation of Belgian workers to Germany and forced labour on military projects. It also supported the radical Flemish Movement by making numerous concessions {{as part of}} the Flamenpolitik in an attempt to gain support among the country's Flemish population. As a result, numerous resistance movements were founded which attempted to sabotage military infrastructure, collect intelligence for the Allies or print underground newspapers. Low-level expressions of dissent were common although frequently repressed.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, some {{societies}} have systematically removed intellectuals from power, sometimes assassinating them, to expediently end public <b>political</b> <b>dissent.</b> During the Cold War (1945–1991) in Eastern Europe, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1948–1990) ostracized the philosopher Václav Havel as a politically unreliable man unworthy of ordinary Czechs' trust; the post-communist Velvet Revolution (17 Nov. – 29 Dec. 1989) elected Havel president for ten years.|$|E

In the Communist state of Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979), the Khmer Rouge régime of Pol Pot condemned most of the non–Communist intelligentsia to death in the Killing Fields.|$|E

25|$|The 1850s were {{a period}} of extreme <b>political</b> reaction. <b>Dissent</b> was vigorously suppressed, and many Germans emigrated to America {{following}} {{the collapse of the}} 1848 uprisings. Frederick William IV became extremely depressed and melancholy during this period, and was surrounded by men who advocated clericalism and absolute divine monarchy. The Prussian people once again lost interest in politics. Prussia not only expanded its territory but began to industrialize rapidly, while maintaining a strong agricultural base.|$|R
25|$|The new PDPA government, led by {{a revolutionary}} council, did not enjoy {{the support of the}} masses.

The first communist leader in Afghanistan, Nur Muhammad Taraki, was assassinated by his fellow communist Hafizullah Amin. Amin was known for his independent and nationalist inclinations, and was also seen by many as a ruthless leader. He has been accused of killing tens of thousands of Afghan civilians at Pul-e-Charkhi and other national prisons. 27,000 politically motivated executions reportedly took place at Pul-e-Charkhi prison alone.|$|E
25|$|The state {{security}} police (the KGB and its predecessor agencies) {{played an important}} role in Soviet politics.

Under Yuri Andropov, KGB chairman in 1967–1982 and General Secretary from 1982 to 1984, the KGB engaged in the suppression of <b>political</b> <b>dissent</b> and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure, culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Tipu Sultan's {{image in}} India is complex. He {{was one of}} the few South Indian kings to provide stiff {{resistance}} to British imperialism, along with Hyder Ali and Kerala Varma Pazhassi.

But the rise of Hindu-Muslim tensions in recent decades has led to an alternative Hindu nationalist view which sees him as a Muslim tyrant, controversial for suppressing <b>political</b> <b>dissent</b> among Hindus, Christians, and Mappla Muslims.|$|E
5000|$|In some <b>political</b> systems, <b>dissent</b> may be {{formally}} {{expressed by}} way of opposition politics, while politically repressive regimes may prohibit any form of dissent, leading to suppression of dissent and the encouragement of social or political activism.

25|$|Salazar {{is often}} described, from a right-wing viewpoint, {{as a model}} of competence, conservatism, rigor, and public service devotion, despite the {{authoritarianism}} of his regime, its suppression of <b>political</b> <b>dissent,</b> and repressive state police.

RTP itself commissioned a simultaneous poll, conducted by Eurosondagem, which ranked Salazar 7th, with 6.6% of the vote, and Afonso I 1st with 21%. The difference of these statiscally representative polls to the final result suggest that the voting, consisting of voluntary telephone calls, may have been skewed by groups with vested interests.|$|E
