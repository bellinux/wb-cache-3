5|$|A 2003 study {{claimed the}} Stanley's {{renovation}} brought <b>positive</b> economic effects to the theatre's local area, bounded by 8th Street and 17th between Fir and Hemlock. According to the study, this area became {{more of a}} leisure/recreation destination, with many new culturally related businesses, retail stores and service-related businesses opening. An increase in overall sales was noted and 76% of surveyed residents responded that the theatre's reopening had a <b>positive</b> effect on the community.

Two athletes tested positive; judoka Shokir Muminov on November 19, 2010 and Greco-Roman wrestler Jakhongir Muminov on November 24, 2010, both from Uzbekistan, tested <b>positive</b> for methylhexanamine. On January 24, 2011, the OCA {{announced}} another two doping failures, Qatari's Ahmed Dheeb who tested <b>positive</b> for exogenous testosterone metabolites and Palestinian Awajna Abdalnasser who tested <b>positive</b> for 19-Norandrosterone.|$|E

30|$|Errors of S 3 {{come from}} false <b>positives</b> and false negatives. S 3 seeks to achieve higher {{performance}} than prior work by reducing false <b>positives</b> and false negatives. However, {{to choose the}} optimal threshold in the trade-off of false <b>positives</b> and false negatives, we seek less false negatives than false <b>positives.</b> This is because false <b>positives</b> identify normal data as sensitive, and thus cause over protection, while false negatives leave sensitive data unprotected, and cause more serious consequences, e.g., data exposed to attackers. In statistics, Recall can reflect the measure of false negatives and Precision reflects false <b>positives.</b> Therefore we seek higher recall value than precision value in this paper.|$|R
30|$|To {{calculate}} {{recall and}} precision, we considered that true <b>positives</b> are instances (classes or methods) {{present in the}} code smell reference list that are also reported by the tool being assessed. False <b>positives</b> are instances that are not present in the reference list, but they were reported by the tool. False negatives are instances present in the reference list that were not reported by the tool. Finally, true negatives are instances that are not present in the reference list and were also not reported by the tool. Therefore, recall {{is the number of}} true <b>positives</b> divided by the number of instances in the reference list (true <b>positives</b> + false negatives), while precision in the number of true <b>positives</b> divided by the number of instances reported by the tool (true <b>positives</b> + false <b>positives).</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{historical}} convention, a <b>positive</b> {{current is}} defined as having the same direction of flow as any <b>positive</b> charge it contains, or to flow from the most <b>positive</b> part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed <b>positive</b> in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E

40|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of static code analysis tools {{is the high}} rates of false <b>positives</b> they produce. Users may need to manually analyze {{a large number of}} warnings, to determine if these are false or legitimate warnings, reducing the benefits of automatic static analysis. Our long term goal is to significantly reduce the number of false <b>positives</b> that these tools report. A learning system could classify the warnings into true <b>positives</b> and false <b>positives</b> by means of features extracted from the program source code. This work implements and evaluates a technique to reduce the source code producing false <b>positives</b> into code snippets that are simpler to analyze. Results indicate that the method considerably reduces the source code size and it is feasible to use it to characterize false <b>positives...</b>|$|R

In that regard, burglar alarms miss very few true <b>positives</b> but {{have a very high}} false alarm rate even in the controlled indoor environment. Motion detecting cameras miss some true <b>positives</b> but are plagued with overwhelming false alarms in an outdoor environment. Rule-based analytics reliably detect most true <b>positives</b> and have a low rate of false <b>positives</b> but cannot perform in active environments, only in empty ones. Also they are limited to the simple discrimination of whether an intruder is present or not.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} compares eight models for {{analyzing}} count data: {{ordinary least squares}} (OLS), OLS with a transformed dependent variable, Tobit, Poisson, overdispersed Poisson, negative binomial, ordinal logistic, and ordinal probit regressions. Simulation reveals the extent that each model produces false <b>positives.</b> Results suggest that, despite methodological expectations, OLS regression does not produce more false <b>positives</b> than expected by chance. The Tobit and Poisson models yield too many false <b>positives.</b> The negative binomial models produce fewer than expected false <b>positives...</b>|$|R
50|$|These numbers {{can then}} be totaled, {{yielding}} both a grand total and marginal totals. Totaling the entire table, the number of true <b>positives,</b> false negatives, true negatives, and false <b>positives</b> add up to 100% of the set. Totaling the rows (adding horizontally) the number of true <b>positives</b> and false <b>positives</b> add up to 100% of the test <b>positives,</b> and likewise for negatives. Totaling the columns (adding vertically), the number of true <b>positives</b> and false negatives add up to 100% of the condition <b>positives</b> (conversely for negatives). The basic marginal ratio statistics are obtained by dividing the 2×2=4 values in the table by the marginal totals (either rows or columns), yielding 2 auxiliary 2×2 tables, {{for a total of}} 8 ratios. These ratios come in 4 complementary pairs, each pair summing to 1, and so each of these derived 2×2 tables can be summarized as a pair of 2 numbers, together with their complements. Further statistics can be obtained by taking ratios of these ratios, ratios of ratios, or more complicated functions.|$|R

5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} <b>positive</b> confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in <b>positive</b> confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so <b>positive</b> confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. <b>Positive</b> confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E
30|$|During the {{retrospective}} visual {{investigation of the}} false <b>positives,</b> the appearance of unilateral and bilateral false <b>positives</b> in the CNN outputs (Table  2, Figs.  2 and 3) was linked with the age-related periventricular white matter hypoattenuation (see Fig.  3 b, c).
