40|$|Abstract Introduction Mato Grosso {{is one of}} the Brazilian {{states with}} the highest {{agribusiness}} growth, which is accompanied by deforestation and an increase in occupational injuries. Objective To assess some factors associated with agribusiness-related severe occupational injuries in Mato Grosso. Method Occupational injury notifications were provided by the System of Information of Notifiable Injuries (SINAN). The production sectors, considered the dependent variables, were classified as forestry/wood industry, animal husbandry, and <b>plant</b> <b>husbandry.</b> Some sociodemographic, care, and type of injury-related variables were selected and considered the independent variables. We conducted a spatial analysis of the density of occupational injury. The associations were identified by calculating the proportion ratio (PR) by the chi-square test and considered significant when p-value < 0. 05. Results and conclusion The highest rates of severe occupational injuries occurred in municipalities with intense plant and animal husbandry, and forestry/wood industry activities. In <b>plant</b> <b>husbandry</b> severe occupational injuries were more common in men, adults, non-whites, illiterates, and rural areas.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} prehistoric subsistence and {{the development}} of <b>plant</b> <b>husbandry</b> in northeastern Tohoku (northern Honshu). Archaeobotanical sampling was carried out at two sites in eastern Aomori Prefecture. Tominosawa is a Middle Jomon village site which produced a spectrum of nut and weedy plant species similar to that recovered from contemporary sites in southwestern Hokkaido. At the Kazahari site, pithouses from two phases of occupation were sampled for archaeobotanical remains: Tokoshinai IV (c. 1000 B. C.) and Fukurashima (c. 150 B. C.). The pithouse deposits produced evidence for Late Jomon rice, foxtail millet, and broomcorn millet dating to the first millennium B. C. Sampling of later Fukurashima contexts produced evidence of rice, foxtail and broomcorn millet, Japanese barnyard millet, and hemp. These data demonstrate that rice and millets have been present in northeastern Tohoku since c. 1000 B. C., and that farming systems were in place during later Fukurashima occupations. Ecological and ethnographic evidence is used to postulate that <b>plant</b> <b>husbandry</b> was possible in the area during Tokoshinai IV. It is concluded that the northward dispersal of rice was more rapid than was previously thought, and consequently that this movement may not have been greatly affected by cultural and ecological constraints. In addition, rice cultivation dispersed into northeastern Japan independently of wet-paddy technology. KEYWORDS: Japan, Tohoku, Jomon, subsistence, cultivation...|$|E

40|$|Survey {{along the}} margins of the Helan Mountains in the Ningxia Hui and Nei Mongol Autonomous Regions {{discloses}} variability in the distribution and assemblage composition among 47 archaeological localities, and suggests a reduction in hunter–gatherer residential mobility through time. Late Palaeolithic tool assemblages are less frequent, smaller, and relatively uniform from site to site. They tend to be found near canyon mouths on the mountain front, or around springs in the middle to upper reaches of fans, suggesting limited variation in both length of stay and subsistence strategies. In contrast, early Neolithic sites, more abundant and variable in size and complexity, are located near fan toes or lower fan springs where water could be more easily diverted. Larger more diverse assemblages suggest long-term residential bases, while smaller specialized assemblages, devoid of microliths, indicate short-term camps and resource processing locations. This helps confirm a similar pattern identified in materials collected by the Sino-Swedish expedition, in the northern Alashan. Together they suggest that the trend towards decreased residential mobility is associated with increasingly intensive and specialized use of seed resources that {{may be related to the}} early development of <b>plant</b> <b>husbandry.</b> ? 1996 Academic Press Limite...|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} of ethnographic with ethnohistoric and Mission Register data has clarified {{the analysis of}} Kumeyaay political structure by confirming {{the fact that the}} Kwaaypaay was not a "born" member of his band. He was not the head of the largest shiimull in a band, but was normally the only adult male of that sib in the band. This structure contrasts with that of the Cahuilla and the San Luiseno where the "Captains" were the heads of the largest lineages. The crosscutting of the shiimull organization by the territorial band organization increased the tribal or national level of Kumeyaay integration. Ethnohistoric data noting rapid communication of information between the Colorado River and the coast supports the ethnographic description of a nationally organized relay runner or courier system. This national organization of the shiimull/hands, with alliance leaders or Kuuchult kwataay, facilitated the shifting of population under erratic climatic conditions that were almost constantly affecting local resource availability. Furthermore, this complex structure integrated movement between ecological zones which required a variety of food-resource acquisition techniques.

40|$|As {{is often}} remarked, the Bible attests a higher social rank {{of the stock}} farmer or {{pastoralist}} compared to the agriculturalist, expressed by God’s higher apprecia-tion of meat offerings (1. Mose 4, 5). Social rank is subject to political change, and while nomads today are often considered as belonging to the fringes of society, in the Bronze Age {{they seem to have}} been part of a system of mutual exchange with states. The basic assumptions and preconditions regarding the potential of ar-chaeobotanical analyses of prehistoric and historic Near Eastern nomadic socie-ties on which this paper will be based are the following:- Nomadism {{is a way of life}} with a producing economy adapted to specific eco-logical niches, and has always been a viable alternative to sedentism and agri-culture in the Old World dry belt. - Nomadism was an important factor in the cultural and environmental devel-opment during the Near Eastern Late Bronze and Iron Age. - Nomadic economy is related to a transhumant, migratory lifestyle. - Nomads in the Near East usually are and were pastoral nomads. - Most modern pastoral nomads are semi-nomadic. - There are no features of culture or of social organization that are exclusive to nomadic groups. Ethnographic and written evidence for <b>plant</b> <b>husbandry</b> in nomadic and semi-nomadic societies The available information on nomads in the Bronze Age is considerable.

The cultural levels that yielded carbonised plant remains date from the Early Bronze Age (3000 - 2000 BC), Middle Bronze Age (2000 - 1500 BC) and Medieval period (11 th — 13 th centuries AD). The plant assortment in the Bronze Age did not differ essentially from that during the Medieval period. The major crop plant of the farmers was Hordeum L. (barley, hulled). Other cereal crops included Triticum dicoccum Schbl. (emmer wheat), T. monococcum L. (einkorn wheat) and T. aestivum L. /T. durum Desf. (bread wheat/macaroni wheat) (naked wheat). The latest became important and replaced the hulled wheats in Medieval times. Hulled barley was also favoured by the visitors to Gre Virike, which {{was used as a}} common sanctuary of the KarkamÝß area in the Early Bronze Age, in ritual ceremonies and probably in food preparation. Domesticated legumes recorded in the study area are Lens culinaris Medik. (lentil), Lathyrus sativus L. /L. cicera L. (grass pea) and Pisum sativum L. (garden pea), Vicia ervilia (L.) Willd.

40|$|The Australian {{macadamia}} industry faces {{two significant}} challenges; {{high levels of}} fruit abscission during early fruit development, and declining average yields from orchards. The decline in average yield is occurring despite the maturing of an industry where production and <b>plant</b> <b>husbandry</b> methods have been considerably refined {{since the early days}} of macadamia farming in Australia. In terms of the high early fruit drop, it has previously been estimated that approximately 1 to 3 percent of the initial fruit set reaches maturity. Plant reproduction imposes significant resource costs to trees; these include water, carbohydrates and nutrients. The potential causes of the declining yield or the high fruit drop are likely to be complex and involve many factors. The research presented in this thesis is based on a physiological understanding of reproductive water relations and within tree interactions. The primary aim of the research was to identify factors other than soil water content that influence reproductive water relations under field conditions, and whether these factors affect reproductive success and yield in macadamia. Research was undertaken at two locations in the Bundaberg region; a commercial macadamia orchard and research blocks of macadamia trees (DAFF Research Station) managed in the same way as a commercial orchard. Tree water status was assessed through water potential and transpiration measurements. Trees and branches were manipulated to investigate reproductive and vegetative interactions, reproductive water relations, and vascular hydration pathways. A small number of detached stem experiments were also undertaken to investigate water relations and reproductive interactions. The interaction discovered between leaves and racemes in macadamia is perhaps the most significant in terms of future research and the potential to increase commercial macadamia production. The interaction identified means that as floral or fruit load increases, leaf stomatal conductance in macadamia declines. This is in contrast to many other tree crops, which increase leaf stomatal conductance and photosynthesis in response to fruit presence and load. The potential effect in macadamia is to limit photosynthesis and carbohydrate production, which imposes a significant limit on reproductive development and therefore fruit set. Results from this study provide a mechanism that explains why macadamia have such a high level of early fruit drop. This reproductive load response in macadamia could be related to the maintenance of plant water relations and conservation of limited soil water under natural forest conditions and seasonally dry periods. Another important interaction was the source-sink ratio, that is, changing the ratio in favour of the sink (flowers and fruit) lowered the leaf stomatal conductance rate. This response is counter-intuitive as many plants typically increase leaf stomatal conductance and photosynthesis as the number of fruit increase. However, macadamia appear to be unusual and the reverse occurs as fruit load increases. Results from this part of the study showed that fruit drop will increase and yield will be significantly lower when the source-sink ratio favours fruit. Branch angle in macadamia trees also appears to be important, with the angle of branches influencing floral load and density, leaf stomatal conductance, and leaf water potential. Horizontal branches had the most positive influence on floral load in macadamia. An important aspect of branch angle was the influence of flushing and the potential for vertical branches to dominate the canopy. Flushing resulted in a significantly lower leaf stomatal conductance rate on horizontal branches compared with vertical branches. This is likely to lead to lower vegetative growth on horizontal branches and comparatively more on vertical branches. The other aspect of flushing was a lower leaf stomatal conductance (indicative of a lower photosynthesic rate in macadamia), which has already been shown to negatively impact on fruit set. This thesis also investigated reproductive hydration pathways by measuring water potential gradients, cincturing and histology studies. Xylem hydration of flowers and fruit appears important in macadamia, however results indicate that water entering flowers and fruit via the phloem ranges between 5 and 13 percent. Results also indicated that macadamia florets have a diurnal transpiration pattern. Floral transpiration varies throughout the day and appears to follow a similar pattern to leaves. The final area investigated in this thesis was the effect of vapour pressure deficit on fruit set under field conditions. The microclimate surrounding macadamia racemes appears to be important, with a small change in the mean daily vapour pressure deficit significantly decreasing the initial fruit set (1. 6 kPa compared with 1. 3 kPa). The findings from this PhD project identified a number of important physiological interactions between leaves and racemes in macadamia. One of these interactions was a lower leaf stomatal conductance rate in response to reproductive load, which potentially explains the high level of early fruit drop in macadamia...|$|E
