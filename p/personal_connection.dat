5|$|By mid-September, Grant warned Boutwell {{to be on}} {{his guard}} as the gold price {{continued}} to rise, while the conspirators bought ever more and the rising price affected the wider economy. Grant, seeing that the increase was unnatural, told Boutwell to sell gold, which reduced its price. Boutwell did so the next day, on September 24, 1869, later known as Black Friday. The sale of gold from the Treasury defeated Gould's scheme as the gold price plummeted, relieving the economic tension. This caused a mild recession, but by January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery. Gould and Fisk managed to escape without much harm to themselves. A Congressional investigation followed, chaired by James A. Garfield and cleared Grant of wrongdoing, but excoriated Gould and Fisk for their manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his <b>personal</b> <b>connection</b> to Grant.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a <b>personal</b> <b>connection</b> named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E
5|$|Team Staal won {{the first}} pick in the draft, and Eric Staal chose {{longtime}} teammate Cam Ward with his first pick. With the fifth pick in the draft, Team Staal selected Daniel Sedin. His twin brother Henrik was taken with the next pick by Team Lidstrom. The All-Star Game {{marked the first time}} the two have ever played against each other in an organized game. Throughout the draft, Eric Staal selected players that had a <b>personal</b> <b>connection</b> with him. He selected his brother, Rangers defenceman Marc Staal, in the seventh round, fellow Thunder Bay native Patrick Sharp in the eighth round, and teammate Jeff Skinner in the 11th round. The last player selected was Toronto's Phil Kessel. As a reward for being the last selection, he was given a new car and $20,000 was given to the charity of his choice. Kessel stated he would put the money toward a cancer charity he became involved with in 2006 when he was battling testicular cancer. When the time came for the rookies to decide which team they would participate in the skills competition, Taylor Hall, who won the right via a puck flip, chose Team Lidstrom for his group. All players were allowed to wear the numbers they use in their respective teams. For Team Lidstrom, Henrik Sedin and Dustin Byfuglien both wore number 33, while Brad Richards and Steven Stamkos wore number 91. Team Staal had three pairs having same number: Patrick Sharp and Corey Perry with number 10, Daniel Sedin and Dan Boyle with number 22 and Paul Stastny and Patrik Elias with number 26. The complete team rosters are listed below with players appearing in the order in which they were chosen.|$|E

This means it's far easier for us to remember stories than hard facts.|$|E
30|$|The {{importance}} of <b>personal</b> <b>connections</b> in China has two implications.

Second, and perhaps more importantly, this usefulness of <b>personal</b> <b>connections</b> in China implies that the self-employed will intentionally build and maintain a large network. Thus, it is necessary to develop an identification strategy to solve the reverse-causation problem.|$|R

25|$|For basic training, Louis was {{assigned}} to a segregated cavalry unit based in Fort Riley, Kansas. The assignment was {{at the suggestion of}} his friend and lawyer Truman Gibson, who knew of Louis's love for horsemanship. Gibson had previously become a civilian advisor to the War Department, in charge of investigating claims of harassment against black soldiers. Accordingly, Louis used this <b>personal</b> <b>connection</b> to help the cause of various black soldiers with whom he came into contact. In one noted episode, Louis contacted Gibson in order to facilitate the Officer Candidate School (OCS) applications of a group of black recruits at Fort Riley, which had been inexplicably delayed for several months. Among the OCS applications Louis facilitated was that of a young Jackie Robinson, later to break the baseball color barrier. The episode spawned a personal friendship between the two men.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, {{there has been a}} high degree of interest paid to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is transformational leadership, which posits that there are certain leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities. The second is transactional leadership, which is most concerned with keeping subordinates in-line with deadlines and organizational policy. This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around empathy and a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a <b>personal</b> <b>connection</b> and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they are sure to receive continued attention as the field of I/O psychology matures.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his friends}} was the Irish writer Thomas Crofton Croker (1798–1854) who moved to London from Ireland in 1818. Croker, who was almost the same age at Ryan, {{is known for his}} {{extensive}} research into ancient Irish folklore. Croker helped Ryan with contacts and accommodation when Ryan lived in Croker's hometown of Cork in 1822 and 1823. Ryan maintained a friendship with him for more than 30 years. Ten letters from Richard Ryan and one from Elizabeth Ryan to Croker written between 1822 and 1845 are in Cork Library Archives. They show a <b>personal</b> <b>connection</b> with Croker's family in Cork and also of Croker with Ryan's family in Camden Town. The first letters from Richard, posted from Cork to London, written in June 1822 - March 1823, referred to the recent wedding in London in May 1822. In 1827 Elizabeth, Richard's mother, sold her late husband's extensive collection of books about Ireland to Croker for £50, and wrote to him following the sale. When Ryan was gaoled in 1835 for debt he continued to write poetry and prose for publication from the prison, sending articles to Croker and asking him to forward them to Fraser's Magazine. He also asked for advice about applying to the Literary Fund as Croker {{was a member of the}} Fund's board.|$|E

We find that firms with better-connected CEOs invest more in R&D and receive more and higher quality patents.

First, <b>personal</b> <b>connections</b> increase the CEO’s access to relevant network information, which encourages innovation by helping the CEO to identify, evaluate, and exploit innovative ideas. Second, <b>personal</b> <b>connections</b> provide the CEO with labor market insurance that facilitates investments in risky innovation by mitigating the career concerns inherent in such investments...|$|R
