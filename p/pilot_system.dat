25|$|From 1899 the {{competitive}} <b>pilot</b> <b>system</b> was abolished {{and a new}} piloting law was introduced, establishing the Naval Pilot Authority. By 1910 {{there was only one}} pilot left at Fedje. This was dramatically changed during the First World War, when series of British convoys traveled up and down the coast. Soon there were four pilots stationed at Fedje, and when needed experienced fishermen were also used. After {{the end of the war}} in 1918 things settled down and from 1920 there was only a single pilot working out of Fedje. This was further increased to two in 1927. During the 1930s each of them had an average thirty missions per year. Pilots were required to have a house with a good view of the open sea towards the direction of the sea lane. Of this reason placing houses at Hesthaugen was popular amongst the pilots. There was a new boom in pilot demand during the Second World War, with an average 69 missions per year.|$|E
500|$|American Airlines Flight 1 was a domestic, {{scheduled}} passenger {{flight from}} New York International (Idlewild) Airport (now John F.

On March 1, 1962, the plane [...] having just taken off two minutes earlier [...] {{rolled over and}} crashed into a swamp, killing all 87 passengers and eight crew members aboard. A Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigation determined that a manufacturing defect in the automatic <b>pilot</b> <b>system</b> led to an uncommanded rudder control system input, causing the accident.

In November, 2010 the U.S. Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) awarded Lockheed Martin a US$4.4 million contract modification to develop critical system components and designs for the plant, adding to the 2009 $8.1 million contract and two Department of Energy grants totaling over $1 million in 2008 and March 2010.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{part of the}} European Detect and Avoid project MIDCAS three {{human-in-the-loop}} simulation campaigns {{were conducted}} with remotely <b>piloted</b> aircraft <b>system</b> equipped with a Detect and Avoid system flying according to instrument flight rules in an air traffic control environment. Situation awareness for remotely <b>piloted</b> aircraft <b>system</b> <b>pilots</b> and air traffic controllers was studied {{as part of an}} evaluation of the operational concept. Experienced pilots and air traffic controllers participated. Data was collected for qualitative analysis including observer logs, questionnaires, and notes from debriefings/workshops. In general the situation awareness was good however there were also examples of lost situation awareness during the simulations, reported in this paper. Lessons learned include how the system could further support remotely <b>piloted</b> aircraft <b>system</b> <b>pilots</b> situation awareness by highlighting if intruder is transponder equipped or not and semi-static or frozen information regarding traffic avoidance and standardized phraseology should be used to further support shared situation awareness between remotely <b>piloted</b> aircraft <b>system</b> <b>pilot</b> and air traffic controller. Given that remotely <b>piloted</b> aircraft <b>systems</b> are new in this kind of setting the result from this simulations are promising in that there were no major concerns found concerning situation awareness that would risk significantly affect the operational concept...|$|R
