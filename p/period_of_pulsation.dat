40|$|Abstract—Periodic vortex {{shedding}} in pulsating flow inside wavy channel {{and the effect}} it has on heat transfer are studied using the finite volume method. A sinusoidally-varying component is superimposed on a uniform flow inside a sinusoidal wavy channel and the effects on the Nusselt number is analyzed. It was found that a unique optimum value of the pulsation frequency, represented by the Strouhal number, exists for Reynolds numbers ranging from 125 to 1000. Results suggest that the gain in heat transfer {{is related to the}} process of vortex formation, movement about the troughs of the wavy channel, and subsequent ejection/destruction through the converging section. Heat transfer is the highest when the frequencies of the pulsation and vortex formation approach being in-phase. Analysis of Strouhal number effect on Nu over a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulsation</b> substantiates the proposed physical mechanism for enhancement.

The un-steady motion is generated impulsively from rest in the fluid due to half rectified sine pulses sub-jected on the plate in its own plane in presence of an external magnetic field. It is assumed that no external electric field is acting on the system and the magnetic Reynolds number is very small. The operational method is used to obtain exact solutions for the fluid velocity and the shear stress on the wall.

40|$|Axions are {{the natural}} {{consequence}} of {{the introduction of the}} Peccei-Quinn symmetry to solve the strong CP problem. All the efforts to detect such elusive particles have failed up to now. Nevertheless, it has been recently shown that the luminosity function of white dwarfs is best fitted if axions with a mass of a few meV are included in the evolutionary calculations. Our aim is to show that variable white dwarfs can provide additional and independent evidence about the existence of axions. The evolution of a white dwarf is a slow cooling process that translates into a secular increase <b>of</b> the <b>pulsation</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> some variable white dwarfs, the so-called DAV and DBV types. Since axions can freely escape from such stars, their existence would increase the cooling rate and, consequently, the rate of change <b>of</b> the <b>periods</b> as compared with the standard ones.

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{characteristics}} of pulsating or cyclic flow of bulk solids during gravity discharge in bins and silos. The dynamic load phenomenon {{is often referred to}} as "silo quaking" and is known to occur in silos of various geometrical shapes, operating under different flow patterns.

The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulsations</b> during flow is influenced by various factors, such as, particle size and size distribution, silo wall material and wall roughness, internal friction, moisture content and discharge flow rate.

This analysis covers the two spring equinox months (March and April) in two sunspot minimum years, 1975 - 76, and in two maximum years, 1979 - 80.
