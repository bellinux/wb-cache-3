40|$|Underwater {{shock waves}} (SWs) {{generated}} by underwater electrical wire explosions (UEWEs) {{have been widely}} studied and applied. Precise measurement {{of this kind of}} SWs is important, but very difficult to accomplish due to their high peak pressure, steep rising edge and very short pulse width (on the order of tens of μs). This paper aims to analyze the signals obtained by two kinds of commercial <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>probes,</b> and reconstruct the correct pressure waveform from the distorted one measured by the <b>pressure</b> <b>probes.</b> It is found that both PCB 138 and Müller-plate probes can be used to measure the relative SW pressure value because of their good uniformities and linearities, but none of them can obtain precise SW waveforms. In order to approach to the real SW signal better, we propose a new multi-exponential pressure waveform model, which has considered the faster pressure decay at the early stage and the slower pressure decay in longer times. Based on this model and the energy conservation law, the pressure waveform obtained by the PCB 138 probe has been reconstructed, and the reconstruction accuracy has been verified by the signals obtained by the Müller-plate probe. Reconstruction results show that the measured SW peak pressures are smaller than the real signal. The waveform reconstruction method is both reasonable and reliable...|$|R

Using fast response <b>pressure</b> <b>probes</b> is an effective and well documented turbulence measurement method; however, there is little literature about <b>pressure</b> <b>probes</b> capable of measuring turbulence in low mean velocity air flows (0 - 12 m/s).

When care was taken to prevent dehydration when working with the <b>pressure</b> <b>probe,</b> and diffusive resistance and dilution errors with the psychrometer, both methods gave similar values of turgor whether the plants were dehydrating or rehydrating. This finding, together with the previously demonstrated similarity in turgor measured with the isopiestic psychrometer and a pressure chamber, indicates that the <b>pressure</b> <b>probe</b> provides accurate measurements of turgor despite the need to penetrate the cell.

Here we describe a simple modification of the pressure-probe technique that permits the controlled microinjection of fluor-escent probes into plant cells while simultaneously measuring cell turgor pressure. Using the <b>pressure</b> <b>probe,</b> less than lnl of the membrane-impenneant fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow CH was introduced into micropipettes and subsequently injected into leaf trichome cells of Nicotians clevelandli. Disrup-tion of cell contents could be minimized by raising the hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> in the <b>probe</b> prior to impalement to a value approaching the anticipated cell turgor pressure. Injections to the cytosol resulted in intercellular symplastic transport of the dye in both acropetal and basipetal directions. In contrast, no symplastic transport was observed following an injection of dye into the vacuole. As measured with the <b>pressure</b> <b>probe,</b> cell turgor <b>pressures</b> were in the range 0. 18 to 0. 36 MPa; the half-time for water exchange across the cell boundary was approxi-mately 10 s.

40|$|Detailed flow {{measurements}} {{are essential for}} analysing flow structures found in confined spaces, particularly in various automotive applications. These measurements will be extremely helpful in solving flow dependent complexities.

40|$|Gun chamber {{pressure}} {{is an important}} parameter in proofing of ammunition to ensure safety and reliability. It can be measured using copper crushers or <b>piezoelectric</b> sensor. <b>Pressure</b> calculations in copper crusher method are based on linear plastic deformation of copper after firing. However, crusher pressure deformation at high pressures deviates from the corresponding values measured by <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pressure</b> transducers due to strain rate dependence of copper. The nonlinear deformation rate of copper at high pressure measurements causes actual readings from copper crusher gauge to deviate from true pressure values. Comparative analysis of gun {{chamber pressure}} was conducted for 7. 62 × 51 [*]mm ammunition using Electronic Pressure, Velocity, and Action Time (EPVAT) system with <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>pressure</b> transducers and conventional crusher gauge. Ammunitions of two different brands were used to measure chamber pressure, namely, NATO standard ammunition and non-NATO standard ammunition. The deformation of copper crushers has also been simulated to compare its deformation with real time firing.

30|$|Taking {{the merits}} of Hevea brasiliensis, a novel phloem turgor <b>pressure</b> <b>probe</b> based {{on the state of}} the art cell <b>pressure</b> <b>probe</b> was developed. Our field {{measurements}} showed that the phloem turgor <b>pressure</b> <b>probe</b> can sensitively measure the real-time variation of phloem turgor pressure in H. brasiliensis but the calculation of phloem turgor pressure with xylem tension, xylem sap osmotic potential and phloem sap osmotic potential will under-estimate it. The measured phloem turgor pressure gradient in H. brasiliensis is contrary to the Münch theory. The phloem turgor pressure of H. brasiliensis varied from 8 – 12  bar as a consequence of water withdrawal from transpiration. Tapping could result in a sharp decrease of phloem turgor pressure followed by a recovery from 8 – 45  min after the tapping. The recovery of phloem turgor pressure after tapping and its change with xylem sap flow suggest the importance of phloem water relationship in the phloem turgor pressure regulation.|$|R
