In the United States, the storm cut off the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> within the Gulf of Mexico, and caused severe damage in parts of Louisiana. Lili was also responsible for severe damage to the barrier islands and marshes in the southern portion of the state. Total damage amounted to $925million (2002USD), and the storm killed 15people during its existence.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} report aims {{to identify the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> towards economic growth in Malaysia. The increasing demand <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> has contributing to the economic growth in Malaysia. However, <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> in Malaysia has to compete with Indonesia and <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybeans <b>oil</b> that are capable in producing more products. Thus, factors that most influence the economic growth in Malaysia need to be identified. The objectives {{of this study are}} to study the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> in Malaysia, to study the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybean <b>oil</b> in Malaysia and to determine whether capital or labor is the most factors influence the economic growth in Malaysia. The study used descriptive research design. It focused on the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> in Malaysia scope. It involved the selection and analysis of secondary data, journals and related write-up that are relating to <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> in Malaysia that includes the factors that affecting <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil,</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybeans <b>oil,</b> capital and labor <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil.</b> From the analysis <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> {{it can be seen that}} the total production is increasing year by year. There are constant increase in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> and thus concluded that there is positive growth in the palm oil industry and the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybean is one factors that have contributed to the increasing the economic growth in Malaysia. On the other hand, the regression analysis clearly shows that the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> has positive relationship with the economic growth in Malaysia, and also positive relationship between <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybeans <b>oil,</b> capital and labor <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil.</b> Among all the factors. <b>Production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> and capital <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> has been identified as the factors that contribute the most economic growth in Malaysia...|$|R

5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale is a source for production of synthetic crude oil and it is seen as a solution towards increasing domestic <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E

Only 26 countries other than the United States have a {{gross domestic}} product exceeding Houston's regional gross area product (GAP). In 2010, mining (which consists almost entirely of exploration and <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and gas in Houston) accounted for 26.3% of Houston's GAP up sharply in response to high energy prices and a decreased worldwide surplus of oil production capacity, followed by engineering services, health services, and manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|Under the Kingdom of Madagascar, {{plantations}} {{were established}} {{for the production of}} crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France. Cloves were imported and planted in 1803, and coconuts—which had been relatively sparse on the island—were cultivated on plantations for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> Similarly, coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19thcentury, when more intensive cultivation for export began. Vanilla, later to become one of Madagascar's premiere export crops, was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 and planted in eastern coastal rainforests. The technique of hand pollination, critical to higher vanilla yields, was introduced 30years later. Nonetheless, vanilla remained a marginal crop {{until the end of the}} monarchy.|$|E

5|$|Petronas, a Malaysian {{national}} {{oil and gas}} company, {{was formed}} in 1974. As a result, a concession system was changed into production sharing contract system (PSC) between Shell and Petronas. All the foreign oil companies including Shell required to obtain licenses from Petronas. The first two PSCs were signed on 30 November 1976. Foreign oil companies are required to keep not more than 41% of the oil produced until their original costs are recovered. After a return of their investments, the oil companies will keep 30% of the revenue after all operating costs and oil royalties are deducted. Petronas also formed a company named Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd which was {{directly involved in the}} exploration, development, and <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and gas in the country. Petronas also initiated the Baram Delta Gas Gathering (Bardegg) project which involves the collection and compression of gas from five fields, namely Betty, Bekor, Baram, Baronia, and West Lutong, located 10km to 45km offshore from Miri. This is to ensure the minimisation of gas loss during oil production. Petronas and Shell are also involved in educational outreach activities such as awarding scholarships to deserving students. Both companies are also involved in Malaysian first rig-to-reef project, in an effort to preserve bio-marine life in the sea offshore Miri. In this project, an abandoned offshore platform was made {{to become part of the}} Siwa reef. Both companies also started to establish Piasau Nature Reserve in 2014.|$|E

He added that the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> had reached 1.55 {{million barrels per day}} the previous week, almost pre-war levels. However, by September 2013, armed groups were blockading oilfields, cutting production to about 100,000 barrels per day, leading to some fuel shortages and blackouts. Many in the armed groups were current and former employees of units set up to secure the oilfields, reacting to corruption and low pay.|$|E

Even during the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974), a counterinsurgency war against independentist guerrilla and terrorism, {{the overseas}} territories of Angola and Mozambique (Portuguese Overseas Provinces at the time) had continuous economic growth rates and several sectors of its local economies were booming. They were internationally notable centres of <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> coffee, cotton, cashew, coconut, timber, minerals (like diamonds), metals (like iron and aluminium), banana, citrus, tea, sisal, beer, cement, fish and other sea products, beef and textiles.|$|E
25|$|According to the Hirsch report {{prepared}} for the U.S. Department of Energy in 2005, a global decline in oil production would have serious social and economic implications without due preparation. Initially, an unmitigated peak in oil production would manifest itself as rapidly escalating prices and a worldwide energy crisis. While past oil shortages stemmed from a temporary insufficiency of supply, crossing Hubbert's Peak means that the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> continues to decline, so demand must be reduced to meet supply. If alternatives or conservation (orderly demand destruction) are not forthcoming, then disorderly demand destruction will occur, with the possible effect that the many products and services produced with oil become scarcer, leading to lower living standards.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{exploitation}} {{began in}} 1872, {{and by the}} beginning of the 20th century the Baku oil fields were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century skilled workers and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> industry equipment before World War II. The World War II Battle of Stalingrad was fought to determine who would have control of the Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Malaysia {{is a very}} {{well-known}} {{country in}} the oils and fats sector especially palm oil {{because it is the}} world’s biggest producer and exporter of the commodity. This study was conducted to analyze the relationship between total area planted and palm <b>oil</b> price with <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> in terms <b>of</b> magnitude and direction using the time series analysis method. Johansen cointegration technique, error correction model and Granger causality tests were used to estimate those relationships. The findings showed that the total area planted and palm oil price have negative relationship towards <b>production</b> <b>of</b> Malaysian palm <b>oil.</b> On the other hand, there is no causality relationship between total area planted and <b>production</b> <b>of</b> Malaysian palm <b>oil</b> in the short run. However, there is a unidirectional causality relationship between palm <b>oil</b> price and <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> in Malaysia. For future recommendation, it is suggested that other researchers will supplement this research by integrating other factors that might affect the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm <b>oil</b> such as climate change and geographical area...|$|R
