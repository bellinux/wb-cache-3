50|$|Its main {{regions of}} {{production}} are Paraguay and France, with the former's product being of higher odour tenacity. <b>Petitgrain</b> (fr. little grain) gains {{its name from}} the fact that it used to be extracted from the unripe small green fruits of the plant. The oil has a greenish woody orange smell that is widely used in perfumery and found in colognes.Though distilled from the same botanical species as neroli and bitter orange essential oil, <b>Petitgrain</b> bigarade oil possesses its own characteristically unique aroma. The oil is distilled from the leaves and sometimes the twigs and branches of the tree, whereas neroli is distilled from the blossoms and bitter orange oil is typically cold pressed from the rinds of the fruits. <b>Petitgrain</b> mandarin (Petit grain Mandarine) distilled from leaves and branches of trees producing mandarin fruit.|$|E

5000|$|Eau de Cologne ( [...] ; German: Kölnisch Wasser meaning “Cologne Water”), {{or simply}} cologne, is a perfume {{originating}} from Cologne, Germany. Originally mixed by Johann Maria Farina in 1709, {{it has since}} come to be a generic term for scented formulations in typical concentration of 2%-5% and also more depending upon its type essential oils or a blend of extracts, alcohol, and water. In a base of dilute ethanol (70%-90%), eau de cologne contains a mixture of citrus oils including oils of lemon, orange, tangerine, clementine, bergamot, lime, grapefruit, blood orange, and bitter orange. It can also contain oils of neroli, lavender, rosemary, thyme, oregano, <b>petitgrain</b> (orange leaf), jasmine, olive, oleaster, and tobacco.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous crops {{were grown}} {{partially}} or entirely for their value as exported processed oils. Oilseeds represented one of Paraguay's largest agro-industries. One of Latin America's largest oilseed exporters, Paraguay processed cottonseed, soybean, peanut, coconut, palm, castor bean, flaxseed, and sunflower-seed oils. [...] Industrial countries in particular consumed oilseeds as a lower-priced substitute for more traditional oils, which also were higher in cholesterol. Some oil was used locally as well. Paraguay also produced {{a number of}} nonvegetable oils, such as tung oil and <b>petitgrain</b> oil. Tung oil, derived from tung nuts, {{was used as a}} drying agent in paints. Petit-grain oil, derived from Paraguay's bitter oranges, was used in cosmetics, soaps, perfumes, and flavorings. In the 1980s Paraguay remained one of the world's leading exporters of petit-grain oil.|$|E
40|$|International audienceChemical {{compositions}} {{of essential}} oils from 17 citron cultivars were studied using GC and GC/MS. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, chemical compositions of peel and <b>petitgrain</b> oils from seven of them were reported for the first time. Combined analysis of peel and <b>petitgrain</b> essential oils led to the identification of 37 components (amounting to 98. 2 - 99. 9 % of the total oil) and 42 components (97. 0 - 99. 9 %), respectively. Statistical analysis was applied to identify possible relationships between citron cultivars. The levels of seven components, i. e., limonene, -pinene, -terpinene, neral, geranial, nerol, and geraniol, indicated that the cultivars could be classified in four main chemotypes for peel and <b>petitgrain</b> oils. Chemotaxonomic investigations were carried out to establish relations between the morphological characteristics of citron cultivars and their corresponding oil compositions...|$|E

40|$|The {{volatile}} {{constituents of}} the essential oils of the peel, flower (neroli) and leaves (<b>petitgrain)</b> of bitter orange (Citrus aurantium L.) growing in Greece were studied by GC-MS. The analytical procedures enabled the quantitative determination of 31 components. More specifically, the components {{of the essential}} oils identified were: twelve in the peel, twenty-six in the flowers, and twenty and sixteen in old and young leaves, respectively. The major constituents of the different parts of Citrus aurantium L. essential oils were: β-pinene (0. 62 %– 19. 08 %), limonene (0. 53 %– 94. 67 %), trans-β-ocimene (3. 11 %– 6. 06 %), linalool (0. 76 %– 58. 21 %), and α-terpineol (0. 13 %– 12. 89 %). The DPPH test demonstrated that the essential oils in the old leaves had the maximum antioxidant activity, followed by the flowers, young leaves and the peel in that order. This study updates the data in the literature on the essential oils of bitter orange, and provides information on the composition of the oils for a further evaluation of this product...|$|E
40|$|Research on the {{biological}} effects of essential oils on human skin cells is scarce. In the current study, we primarily explored {{the biological}} activities of 10 essential oils (nine single and one blend) in a pre-inflamed human dermal fibroblast system that simulated chronic inflammation. We measured levels of proteins critical for inflammation, immune responses, and tissue-remodeling processes. The nine single oils were distilled from Citrus bergamia (bergamot), Coriandrum sativum (cilantro), Pelargonium graveolens (geranium), Helichrysum italicum (helichrysum), Pogostemon cablin (patchouli), Citrus aurantium (<b>petitgrain),</b> Santalum album (sandalwood), Nardostachys jatamansi (spikenard), and Cananga odorata (ylang ylang). The essential oil blend (commercial name Immortelle) {{is composed of}} oils from frankincense, Hawaiian sandalwood, lavender, myrrh, helichrysum, and rose. All the studied oils were significantly anti-proliferative against these cells. Furthermore, bergamot, cilantro, and spikenard essential oils primarily inhibited protein molecules related to inflammation, immune responses, and tissue-remodeling processes, suggesting they have anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. Helichrysum and ylang ylang essential oils, as well as Immortelle primarily inhibited tissue remodeling-related proteins, suggesting a wound healing property. The data {{are consistent with the}} results of existing studies examining these oils in other models and suggest that the studied oils may be promising therapeutic candidates. Further research into their biological mechanisms of action is recommended. The differential effects of these essential oils suggest that they exert activities by different mechanisms or pathways, warranting further investigation. The chemical composition of these oils was analyzed using gas chromatographyâmass spectrometry. Keywords: Anti-proliferation, Bergamot, Cilantro, Anti-inflammatory, Spikenard, Wound healin...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{pheromone}} attractants, host-plant volatiles offer the most likely means of improving capture levels of ACP with sticky cards {{and other types of}} visual traps.   However, developing scent lures that can compete with the attractiveness of actual host-plants, especially those in flush, is challenging.   We are developing a new class of synthetic scent lures that may enhance the attractiveness of naturally-occurring host-plant volatiles.   These compounds are synthetic ligands that bind to chemosensory proteins (CSPs) found in the olfactory sensilla of target insects.   These ligands may mimic naturally-occurring odorants and function as super-stimuli because of their strong affinity to CSPs. In our study, CSPs from ACP antennae were identified based on their reactivity to <b>petitgrain</b> oil (an essential oil extracted from sour orange leaves), an ACP attractant.   Two behavioral assays were used to assess the biological activity of several candidate ligands.   One assay measured ACP probing frequency into a line of emulsified wax (SPLAT®, ISCA Technologies) containing a test ligand, the other assay measured the retention time of psyllids in an airstream carrying the ligand.   One ligand, nicknamed ‘Titan’, was more stimulatory than limonene, a common citrus volatile, while a mixture of Titan and limonene was significantly more stimulatory than either alone.   Subsequent assays showed that Titan was as stimulatory to ACP as the odor emitted by flushing sprigs of orange jasmine, a favored host-plant. These results indicate that CSP ligands may synergize the attractiveness of naturally-occurring citrus volatiles and boost their effectiveness as scent lures for ACP...|$|E
40|$|Six Amazonian <b>petitgrain</b> {{samples from}} C. nobilis Lour., C. aurantium L., C. limon L. and mixture of Citrus spp. (Rutaceae), named CN, CA, CL 1, CL 2, C 1 and C 2, were {{chemically}} characterized by GC-MS and 13 C NMR and evaluated for antioxidant acitivity (DPPH and beta-carotene bleaching tests), for antimicrobial properties (disk diffusion method) and for antifungal capacity (agar vapour assay). CN, C 1, C 2 samples evidenced {{the most interesting}} results: CN (alfa-terpinene/linalool chemotype: 14. 3 %/ 41. 6 %, with {{a considerable amount of}} thymol: 9. 0 %), and C 1 (linalool, 18. 3 %; sabinene, 11. 6 %; thymol, 5. 5 %), showed relevant antioxidant activity with both DPPH (IC 50 = 3. 52 and 5. 48 mg/ml, respectively) and beta-carotene (IC 50 = 0. 387 and 0. 491 mg/ml, respectively). Antibacterial properties of CN and C 1 against P. mirabilis (MIC = 0. 61 mg/ml for both) and B. subtilis (MIC = 0. 61 and 0. 44 mg/ml, respectively) were most probably due to thymol. C 2 (geranial: 34. 7 %, neral: 33. 1 %) evidenced a valuable bioactivity against Candida albicans (MIC = 0. 44 mg/ml). The 50 % growth inhibition (IC 50) of the dermatophytes T. mentagrophytes and N. cajetani was reached with amounts of C 1, C 2 and CN less than 4 microl/plate. Bioactivity of Amazonian Citrus spp. CN, C 1 and C 2 essential oils suggests their potential use as food preservatives or additives in cosmeceuticals as preventive against dermatophytic fungal infections...|$|E
