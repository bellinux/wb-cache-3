In the Half Blood Prince, Harry and Hermione jokingly suspect that he is in a relationship with Irma <b>Pince,</b> the librarian at Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final book, when the school starts preparing itself for the Battle of Hogwarts, Filch is seen yelling that students are out of bed.

40|$|Musical wind {{instruments}} are interesting examples of nonlinear vibrating systems. The {{way in which}} a self-sustained oscillation is formed is surprisingly complex, even for a simplified model. In short, a wind instrumentconsists of a resonator and a generator. The resonator is the air column inside the instrument, and is usuallycharacterized by the linear wave equation. The generator consists of some kind of pressure controlled valve, wherethe relationship between air flow and pressure is starkly non-linear. A simplistic model of sound generation can bebased {{on the assumption that the}} pressure controlled valve functions as a negative resistance at one of the resonancefrequencies of the resonator. Such a model, however, neglects the modal coupling due to the non-linearities that areultimately the primary reason why different wind instument sound so different. The aim of this paper is to studyhow limit cycles of a clarinet-like instrument can be treated in the framework of nonlinear normal modes (NNM). The reason for persunig this subject is to ultimately be able to derive models of reduced complexity, which are ofinterest for sound synthesis.

Repeating the reaction in pyridine instead of dioxane gives the mixed pyridine-carbene complex trans-[PdBr(2) (calix-carbene) (pyridine) ] (15) in 75 % yield. Treatment of the bis-imidazolium salt 3 a with [Pd(OAc) (2) ] affords a chelate complex, trans-[PdI(2) {calix-bis(carbene) }] (16), in which a metallo-(bis-carbene) fragment caps the upper rim of the calixarene basket. Complex 16, as well as its analogue 17, obtained from 3 b, display apparent C(s) -symmetry in solution. This is not the case in the solid state, a single X-ray diffraction study carried out for 16 revealing a <b>pinced</b> cone structure for the calixarene skeleton, which reduces the symmetry to C(1). The chelate complex 17 shows poor activity in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of phenyl boronic acid and p-tolyl halides, an observation that suggests the presence of a strained metallocyclic unit preventing easy stereochemical rearrangement to an active species. Unlike 17, complexes 14 and 15 show good activities in cross-coupling. A comparative study using the carbene precursor 1 -butyl- 3 -(2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) imidazolium bromide (18), which is devoid of the receptor fragment, strongly suggests that the carbene ligands of 14 and 15 operate typically as bulky NHC-ligands. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Single-molecule {{techniques}} {{allow to}} following biomolecular reactions with unprecedented resolution. Particularly, optical tweezers {{can be used}} to manipulate and apply forces to individual molecules tethered between plastic beads that are optically-trapped. Optical trapping is achieved by using highly focused laser beams that exert a gradient force onto the micrometer-sized dielectric particles that become confined close to the focal position of the laser. By specifically attaching the ends of the molecule under study to two optically-trapped beads, it is possible to manipulate and apply forces to an individual molecule. Typical experiments with optical tweezers consist in manipulating nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) or proteins one at a time. For instance DNA molecules can be stretched to measure its elastic properties, or unzipped to measure their base-pairing energies. Many small anticancer drugs target nucleic acids to exert their cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. To understand their mechanism of action {{it is important to know}} in which positions, how strong, and how fast do they bind to different specific sites in DNA. Single-molecule optical tweezers experiments {{can be used to}} unravel the binding thermodynamics and kinetics of many of these ligands, especially those difficult to characterize with bulk techniques. Thiocoraline is one of such drugs, and binds DNA through bis-intercalation. Experiments with optical tweezers show that the kinetics of intercalation are very slow (hours) and strongly force-dependent: force facilitates binding but slows down unbinding. Experiments performed in different conditions also reveal that the binding pathway proceeds through a mono-intercalated intermediate that causes the observed slow kinetics. In this sense, we present a three-state model that offers a theoretical framework from which the kinetic rates of the reaction can be extracted, and that could be useful to characterize other bis-intercalators. We also show that DNA unzipping experiments can be used to determine the preferred binding sequences of Thiocoraline, finding that it preferentially clamps CpG steps. This methodology is potentially very useful as it provides direct access to the preferred binding sites of small ligands due to its thermodynamic stability with one base pair resolution and without the requirement of restriction enzymes or radioactive labeling. This single-molecule footprinting technique is also adapted to a magnetic tweezers instrument in order to perform parallelized measurements. The fact that bis-intercalation does not modify the persistence length of dsDNA is also found in the pulling experiments. From the elasticity measurements, we also extract equilibrium quantitates of the interaction by using classic statistical models. This combination of DNA stretching and unzipping assays can also be used to follow how the anticancer agent Kahalalide F self-assembles and compacts DNA. Kahalalide F forms nanometric particles that are positively charged able to bind and condense DNA. The binding reaction shows to phases: an initial compaction of electrostatic origin, and its subsequent stiffening due to the hydrophobic collapse of the complex. The combination of quantitative force-spectroscopy measurements with AFM images of the complexes and other bulk tech- niques (DLS, EM) provides a consistent picture of the compaction and aggregation process. Modeling of the experiments provides the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction that are complemented with kinetic measurements. A simple technique to study ssDNA with optical tweezers is also presented and used to study how the stiffness of the polyanion affects the compaction process. We exploit this methodology to understand how the stiffness of the polyanion affects the compaction kinetics, and later on, we also show its utility to study the elasticity of ssDNA under varying ionic conditions. Finally, the utility of this methodology to study self-assembly and aggregation is explored with amyloidogenic peptides involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Les tècniques de molècula individual permeten seguir les reaccions biomoleculars amb una resolució sense precedents, proveint als científics d’una sèrie d’instruments per a mesurar magnituds físiques i investigar sistemes experimentals difícilment accessibles amb les tradi­cionals mesures en volum (és a dir a on les mesures es realitzen amb mols de reactiu). Particularment, les <b>pinces</b> òptiques permeten manipular i aplicar forces a molècules individuals i determinar-ne així les seves propietats elàstiques i termodinàmiques. L’atrapament òptic es basa en l’ús d’un feix làser focalitzat per exercir una força òptica a les microesferes (diàmetre ~ 3 µm), que queden confinades a prop del punt focal a causa de la conservació del moment lineal. Els experiments de micromanipulació es realitzen unint els extrems de la molècula que es vol estudiar a la superfícies de dues microesferes diferents, podent així aplicar forces a la molècula quan desplacem una microesfera respecte de l’altra. Per ancorar les molècules a la superfície de les microesferes s’utilitzen unions moleculars que tenen una alta a. nitat (p. ex. enllaç biotina-estreptavidina). Típicament els experiments amb <b>pinces</b> òptiques consisteixen en la micromanipulació d’àcids nucleics (ADN, ARN) o proteïnes de forma individual. Per exemple, una molècula d’ADN pot ésser estirada per a estudiar-ne les propietats elàstiques, o oberta mecànicament (separant les dues cadenes que formen la doble hèlix) per a mesurar les energies lliures d’aparellament entre bases. Un gran nombre d’agents anticancerígens tenen com a diana els àcids nucleics, a on s’hi uneixen afi i efecte de dur a terme la seva acció citotòxica (p. ex. interferint amb processos cel·lulars essencials com són la replicació, la transcripció o els mecanismes de reparació). Per entendre el seu mecanisme d’acció és important conéixer en quines posicions, amb quina a. nitat, i amb quina cinètica s’uneixen a diferents seqüències d’ADN. Els experiments de molècula individual amb <b>pinces</b> òptiques permeten determinar la termodinàmica i cinètica d’unió de molts d’aquests lligands, especialment aquells difícils de caracteritzar mitjançant mesures en volum.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{manuscript}} {{is to determine the}} influence of proteic factors on cytoskeleton dynamics using a micromanipulation tool. We have determined the microrheological response of the actin network for individual cells. We applied with an optical tweezer oscillating forces to a micrometric bead specifically bound to the actin network of C 2 myoblasts, and measured the amplitude and phase shift of the induced cell deformation. For a non-perturbated single cell, we have shown that the elastic and loss moduli G' and G" behave as power laws fΑ et fΒ of the frequency f (0. 01 < f < 50 Hz), Α and Β being in the range 0. 15 - 0. 30. This demonstrates that the dissipation mechanisms in a single cell involve a broad and continuous distribution of relaxation times. After adding blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin II activity, the exponent of G' decreases to about 0. 10, and G" becomes roughly constant for 0. 01 < f < 10 Hz. The actin network appears less rigid and less dissipative than in the control experiment. This is consistent with an inhibition of ATPase and reduction of the gliding mobility of myosin II on actin filaments. In this frequency range, the actomyosin activity appears as the principal mechanism allowing the cell to adapt to an external mechanical stress. The goal of this work is to put in agreement both structural and behaviour cell mechanical models by the mean of microrheological measurements on adherent living cells in normal and disturbed conditions.
