25|$|The Supreme Court has {{developed}} a four-part analysis to evaluate the constitutionality of time, place and manner (TPM) restrictions. To <b>pass</b> <b>muster</b> under the First Amendment, TPM restrictions must be neutral with respect to content, narrowly drawn, serve a significant government interest, and leave open alternative channels of communication. Application of this four-part analysis varies with the circumstances of each case, and typically requires lower standards for the restriction of obscenity and fighting words.|$|E
25|$|As {{proud as}} Waramaug was of his {{imposing}} palace, {{he was even}} prouder of the light of his life, his lovely daughter, Lillinonah. Taught from birth to cultivate those virtues most revered by her father -- compassion for one's fellow man, loyalty to family and tribe and sensitivity to the beauties of Nature -- Lillinonah was, {{at the age of}} eighteen, a young woman whose humanity matched her grace and beauty. From near and far the young braves came, as moths to the flame, to pay homage to Lillinonah -- and perhaps win her hand in marriage. But first, of course, each had to <b>pass</b> <b>muster</b> with old Waramaug, and that was no simple matter.|$|E
500|$|In an {{academic}} paper discussing the bog bodies {{which was published}} in 1995, C.S. Briggs criticised Glob for jumping to conclusions that were not supported by the evidence, exclaiming [...] "Can Glob's book today actually <b>pass</b> <b>muster</b> as responsible popular scholarship?". In particular, they highlighted that he ascribed many bodies to the Iron Age when they had not been securely carbon dated and that he overconfidently proclaimed the Drumkeeragh Lady from Medieval Ireland to be a Danish Viking despite a lack of supporting evidence.|$|E

5000|$|William Howard Russell, war {{correspondent}} for The Times describes the rebel yell as follows: [...] "..the Southern soldiers cannot cheer, and what <b>passes</b> <b>muster</b> for that jubilant sound is a shrill ringing scream {{with a touch}} of the Indian war-whoop in it."

500|$|A mixed {{review was}} given by Andy Gill of The Independent who said that [...] "the vocal editing on 'Start Over' is far too sloppy, {{confirming}} again that a series of individual flourishes doesn't <b>pass</b> <b>muster</b> as a performance." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters also gave a mixed review for [...] "Start Over" [...] and [...] "Countdown" [...] saying that they [...] "just don't seem to be listening to themselves, and will get by on listenability more than lyrical wizardry if they get by at all." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song, saying: [...] "While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an opportunity {{to try something new}} in some way or another, 'Start Over' just kind of sits there at the middle of the disc not doing much of anything." [...] He also noted that [...] "Start Over" [...] was an [...] "inoffensive ballad that doesn't do much for the record aside from break its momentum at the halfway point." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics have}} {{described}} the 21st-century televised editions of the show as pornographic, [...] while others have described it as both [...] "outright commercialism" [...] and an infomercial. The Federal Communications Commission has received complaints regarding the broadcast, but no fines have been imposed, with the FCC, following the 2001 airing, citing the First Amendment and stating that [...] "sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium" [...] were not broadcast. [...] In the initial 2001 airing ABC blurred the screen on particularly sheer lingerie. [...] This enabled the show to <b>pass</b> <b>muster</b> with its internal Broadcast Standards and Practices department and to achieve the TV-14 rating. [...] In 2002, the National Organization for Women protested the show calling it a [...] "soft-core porn infomercial." [...] They were joined in protest by the Parents Television Council and other watchdog organizations. [...] CBS has given past shows TV-14 ratings, which is a warning that the show may contain material unsuitable for children age 14 and under. [...] Nonetheless some affiliates {{have chosen not to}} air the show in past years including Fisher Broadcasting affiliates in Idaho. [...] In 2009, the American Decency Association organized email letters of protests to sponsors of the show including AT, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Netflix, Nikon, and Reebok. CBS has described the event to as [...] "the Super Bowl of fashion".|$|E
2500|$|After Minister and People's Progressive Party President M. Kayveas raised {{concerns}} about local governments in late 2005, some suggested reviving local government elections. However, in an opinion column, the New Straits Times (owned by the United Malays National Organisation or UMNO, leading party of the Barisan Nasional) quoted a professor from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia as saying that such elections would not be brought back because [...] "policymakers know from experience worldwide that the Opposition tends to dominate such councils {{as part of the}} electorate's desire for checks-and-balances." [...] The professor also stated that due to required constitutional changes, {{it would be difficult for}} such amendments to <b>pass</b> <b>muster</b> in Parliament. The column also quoted a government ministry as saying that [...] "holding elections are expensive affairs".|$|E
60|$|As for Cynthia, {{she was no}} less {{astonished}} than Mrs. Duncan by {{the fact}} that these rich and powerful gentlemen were so excited over a little thing like the postmastership of Brampton.

50|$|But emotion must be {{put aside}} as the ladettes face their weekly challenge: {{to make and}} serve {{afternoon}} tea to the aristocratic mothers {{of some of the}} bachelors.

2500|$|Lacking the $200 {{needed for}} musicians' union fees, Mitchell managed a few gigs at the Half Beat and the Village Corner in Toronto's Yorkville neighbourhood, but mostly played {{non-union}} gigs [...] "in church basements and YMCA meeting halls". Rejected from major folk clubs, she resorted to busking, while she [...] "worked in the women's wear {{section of a}} downtown department store to pay the rent." [...] During this era, {{she lived in a}} rooming house, directly across the hall from poet Duke Redbird. Without a lot of name recognition, Mitchell also began to realize each city's folk scene tended to accord veteran performers the exclusive right to play their signature songs—despite not having written the songs—which Mitchell found insular, contrary to the egalitarian ideal of folk music. She found her best traditional material was already other singers' property and would no longer <b>pass</b> <b>muster.</b> She said, [...] "You'd come into a town and you'd be told, you can't sing that, you can't sing that." [...] She resolved to write her own songs.|$|E
2500|$|The Nazis {{kept an eye}} out for Polish {{children}} who possessed Nordic racial characteristics. An estimated total of 50,000 children, majority taken from orphanages and foster homes in the annexed lands, but some separated from their parents, were taken into a special Germanization program. Polish women deported to Germany as forced laborers and who bore children were a common victim of this policy, with their infants regularly taken. If the child passed the battery of racial, physical and psychological tests, they were sent on to Germany for [...] "Germanization". At least 4,454 children were given new German names, forbidden to use Polish language, and reeducated Nazi institutions. Few were ever reunited with their original families. Those deemed as unsuitable for Germanization for being [...] "not Aryan enough" [...] were sent to orphanages or even to concentration camps like Auschwitz, where many perished, often killed by intercardiac injections of phenol. For Polish forced laborers, in some cases if an examination of the parents suggested that the child might not be [...] "racially valuable", the mother was compelled to have an abortion. Infants who did not <b>pass</b> <b>muster</b> would be removed to a state orphanage (Ausländerkinder-Pflegestätte), where many died from the lack of food.|$|E

60|$|The chief walked gravely round him two {{or three}} times, and then {{pronounced}} that he would <b>pass</b> <b>muster.</b> A bandolier for cartridges, of native make, was slung over his shoulder, and with a rifle {{in one hand and}} a spear in the other, and {{two or three}} necklaces of brass beads round his neck, Ronald would, at a short distance, <b>pass</b> <b>muster</b> as a Kaffir warrior. In order to test his appearance, he strolled across to where Mr. Nolan was inspecting the serving out of rations.|$|E

60|$|Her words fell on deaf ears. Mr. Chalk, gazing {{through the}} window, heard without comprehending a long {{account of the}} capture of a new housemaid, which, {{slightly}} altered as to name and place, would have <b>passed</b> <b>muster</b> as an exciting contest between a skilful angler and a particularly sulky salmon.

Then I shivered. By way of answer to his second question, I handed him a revolver with either hand.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} was mixed. Gene Seymour of Newsday commented, [...] "The new giant screen {{contribution to}} the stallion's legend is a 45-minute story, which, at best, plays {{as if it could}} have barely <b>passed</b> <b>muster</b> as an installment of the old 1960s Disney TV series, The Wonderful World of Color." [...] Megan Lehmann of the New York Post stated, [...] "A visual treat diminished by lifeless dialogue and self-conscious acting." ...|$|R

60|$|It {{was well}} that the Pomeranian dialect {{differed}} so widely from the Bavarian, so Malcolm's German had consequently <b>passed</b> <b>muster</b> without suspicion.
