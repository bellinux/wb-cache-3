As word got around, other families requested the same assistance, and she was soon sending all her daughters' classmates out to collect food, then filling colorful plastic shopping baskets for the weekly delivery.

40|$|Chemical {{absorption}} using aqueous amine {{is one of}} {{the most}} feasible options for post-combustion CO 2 capture. One of the main challenges of this technology is its high energy requirements. Absorber intercooling was considered as a viable method to offer benefits in terms of solvent absorption capacity and mass transfer efficiency in CO 2 absorption processes. However, the effectiveness of absorber intercooling on overall energy requirements depends on other factors such as lean loading and liquid to gas ratio. This study evaluates the benefits of using two different configurations of absorber intercooling, i. e. “in-and-out” and “recycled” intercooling when using 30 wt% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) to capture 90 % CO 2 from a natural gas fired turbine with 4 mol% CO 2. The Lean CO 2 loading was varied from 0. 15 to 0. 42 (mol CO 2 /mol MEA) to determine the lean loading at which the application of intercooling is most significant. Absorber intercooling provides the most benefit at lean loading from 0. 30 to 0. 34. The use of in-and-out and recycle intercooling at 0. 34 lean loading, provided 15. 6 and 15. 8 % reduction in the total equivalent work associated with 32. 0 % and 36. 6 % reduction in required <b>packing</b> <b>area</b> when using 1. 2 times the minimum liquid flow rate. At lean loading greater than 0. 34, the benefit of absorber intercooling is a trade-off between reduction of solvent flow rate and total energy requirement and the drawback of greater <b>packing</b> <b>area</b> in the absorber. The greatest saving in total equivalent work, 17 %, was observed at the 0. 36 lean loading associated with nearly 60 % more <b>packing</b> <b>area</b> when using 1. 2 times the minimum solvent flow rate. At very low lean loading and very high lean loading absorber intercooling does not offer significant benefit...|$|E

40|$|Bistable [2]rotaxanes display {{controllable}} switching {{properties in}} solution, on surfaces, and in devices. These phenomena {{are based on}} the electrochemically and electrically driven mechanical shuttling motion of the ring-shaped component, cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT^(4 +)), between a monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (mpTTF) unit and a 1, 5 -dioxynaphthalene (DNP) unit located along a dumbbell component. The most stable state of the rotaxane (CBPQT^(4 +) @mpTTF) is that in which the CBPQT^(4 +) ring encircles the mpTTF unit, but a second less favored metastable co-conformation with the CBPQT^(4 +) ring surrounding the DNP (CBPQT^(4 +) @DNP) can be formed experimentally. For both co-conformations of an amphiphilic bistable [2]rotaxane, we report here the structure and surface pressure−area isotherm of a Langmuir monolayer (LM) on a water subphase {{as a function of the}} area per molecule. These results from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) studies are validated by comparing with experiments based on similar amphiphilic rotaxanes. For both co-conformations, we found that as the area per molecule increases the thickness of the LM decreases while the molecular tilt increases. Both co-conformations led to similar LM thicknesses at the same <b>packing</b> <b>area.</b> From the simulated LM systems, we calculated the electron density profiles of the monolayer as a function of area per molecule, which show good agreement with experimental analyses from synchrotron X-ray reflectivity measurements of related systems. Decomposing the overall electron density profiles into component contributions, we found distinct differences in molecular packing in the film depending upon the co-conformation. Thus we find that the necessity of allowing the tetracationic ring to become solvated by water leads to differences in the structures for the two co-conformations in the LM. At the same <b>packing</b> <b>area,</b> the value of the overall tilt angle does not seem to be sensitive to whether the CBPQT^(4 +) ring is encircling the mpTTF or the DNP unit. However, the conformation of the dumbbell does depend on the location of the CBPQT^(4 +) ring, which is reflected in the segmental tilt angles of the mpTTF and DNP units. Using the Kirkwood−Buff formula in conjunction with MD calculations, we find the surface pressure−area isotherms for each co-conformation in which the CBPQT^(4 +) @mpTTF form has smaller surface tension and therefore larger surface pressure than the CBPQT^(4 +) @DNP at the same <b>packing</b> <b>area,</b> differences that decreases with increasing area per molecule, which is verified experimentally...|$|E
