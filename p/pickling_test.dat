40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of the corrosion behaviour of CN 108 alloy in sea water by means of surface analysis (SEM, EDS and XPS). The results with samples with different surface finishes (as-received or <b>pickled),</b> <b>tested</b> in natural or artificial sea water, are discussed. The chemical composition and the morphology of the corrosion products were established and related to the corrosion behaviour of the alloy. In highly chlorinated sea water the growth of a cathodic film, strongly enriched in manganese, and pitting initiation at the grain boundaries, were observed on both as-received and pickled samples. The occurrence of general uneven corrosion in unchlorinated sea water is related to the presence of a surface film, strongly enriched in iron, which was neither protective nor homogeneous. The good performance of the alloy in intermediate chlorination conditions is related to the growth of a very compact, protective film, characterized by a balanced enrichment of both Fe and Mn...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that various chemical treatments may enhance the corrosion resistance of a magnesium alloy (containing rare earths, WE 43 alloy) has been investigated. Cerium(III) conversion coatings and silanic coatings, {{with and without}} acid <b>pickling,</b> were <b>tested</b> in 0. 1 N Na 2 SO 4 solution. Silanic coatings were obtained by dipping WE 43 specimens in diluted hydroalcoholic silanic solutions and successively cured at 100 8 C for 1 h. A silanic compound with a long aliphatic chain (e. g. n-octadecyltrimethoxysilane, OctadecS) produced a very protective and relatively persistent coating, while that with a mercapto group (3 -mercapto-propyl-trimethoxysilane, PropS-SH) formed less protective layers. Treatments with cerium salts (cerium(III) sulphate or cerium(III) chloride+hydrogen peroxide) did not produce encouraging results. Under no conditions did acid pickling improve {{the performance of the}} coatings...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Research {{has been}} done to study the effects of treated wetland water {{utilization}} in Sitimulyo on the making of pickled sheepskin. The treated wetland water on the making of pickled sheepskin was done by using three variable ratio of wetland water: water that is 100 : 0; 75 : 25; 50 : 50. Used as a comparison was control or without any additional water wetland. Skin that was used as much as 12 pieces of sheepskin divided into 4 groups and 3 pieces of leather for each treatment. Quality parameters observed include skin moisture content, salinity, pH, and organoleptic observation.

40|$|The {{formation}} of “bloaters” (hollow stock) in cucumbers brined for salt-stock purposes at 5 to 10 % salt {{has been associated}} with gaseous fermentation caused chiefly by yeasts. Recently, serious early bloater damage, not attributable to yeasts, has been observed in commercial-scale experiments on control of bloaters in overnight dill pickles brined in 50 -gal barrels at 3. 0 to 4. 5 % salt. Growth of fermentative species of yeasts was effectively controlled by the addition of 0. 025, 0. 05, and 0. 1 % sorbic acid or its sodium salt. In contrast to this, the fermenting brines showed extremely high populations of acid-forming bacteria, identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, and Pediococcus cerevisiae. The gas-forming species (i. e., L. brevis) constituted a high proportion of the total populations. Representative isolates from 36 barrels of overnight dill <b>pickles</b> were <b>tested</b> for their ability to produce bloaters in 1 -quart jars of pasteurized cucumbers equilibrated at 4 to 5 % salt, 0. 25 % lactic acid, and pH 4. 0. Bloaters, identical with those made by yeast cultures, were produced in all jars inoculated with L. brevis. No bloaters were produced by L. plantarum and P. cerevisiae. These results suggest that the control of bloater damage in cucumber fermentations, particularly at low salt concentrations, may necessitate inhibition of gas-forming lactic acid bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{resistant}} alloys (CRAs) used in subsea pressure-retaining components must {{be compatible}} with production fluids and resistant to pitting and crevice corrosion in seawater. Whereas materials selection in production environments is governed by well-established international standards such as ISO 15156, much debate still exists as of how to determine the seawater localized corrosion resistance of higher grade CRAs such as duplex super duplex stainless steels (DSS and SDSS, respectively). While most industry specifications rely on the ASTM G 48 standard to determine localized corrosion resistance, for duplex and super-duplex stainless steels {{there is no consensus}} on surface finish prior testing (e. g. polishing or <b>pickling)</b> and <b>test</b> temperature (e. g. 50 &# 176;C in NORSOK 630 versus 40 &# 176;C in ASTM A 923). Moreover, it is unclear whether existing procedures are sensitive enough to determine the onset of deleterious phases such as &# 963;-phase and chromium nitrides. The objective of this investigation was to quantify the seawater pitting corrosion resistance of a type 25 Cr SDSS (UNS S 32750) and its correlation with microstructure and surface finish before testing. Cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) testing was used to determine the effect &# 963;-phase on the corrosion response of the system. CPP results were then compared against industry standard practices based on the ASTM G 48 Method A test. In addition, CPP tests were conducted at various temperatures, ranging from 25 to 90 &# 176;C, to determine the effect of deleterious phases on critical pitting temperature (CPT) and overall localized corrosion resistance. The results from this project indicate that the Critical Pitting temperature for standard solution annealed Super Duplex Stainless Steel is 60 - 70 &# 176;C. It is also shown that the corrosion resistance is reduced for material that contains sigma phase showing a Critical Pitting Temperature of 40 - 50 &# 176;C. The surface treatments seem to have less effect on the values, but pickled surfaces gave a more repeatable result. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{large amount}} of cheese is lost every year due to mold contamination. Biopreservation, which {{is the use of}} {{biological}} entities (microbes) and their metabolites to suppress microbial spoilage instead of chemical preservatives has lately gained increasing interest. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have the potential for use in biopreservation, because they are safe to consume and naturally exist in many foods. In this study, fifteen strains of lactobacilli isolated from dairy products, vegetables, and fermented <b>pickles</b> were <b>tested</b> by agar overlay assay for their anti-mold activity. Six strains grown on MRS agar showed strong inhibitory activity against a target mold (Penicillium sp. at 105 spores/ml) isolated from the surface of Cheddar cheese. The isolates were identified by biochemical tests using API CHL 50 strips. Five strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, and one strain as Pediococcus pentasaceus. Well-diffusion method was used to demonstrate anti-mold activity in concentrated cell-free supernatants. Supernatants from all strains showed inhibition of the target mold (indicator). The anti-mold compound(s) produced by all the strains was heat-resistant (100 o C for 15 min). Supernatants from 5 strains retained the anti-mold activity when the pH was adjusted to 6. 8 ± 0. 2, while one strain DC 2 isolated from cheese lost its anti-mold activity at that pH. Temperature of incubation of cultures affected anti-mold activity. The optimum was 37 o C. Very little or no inhibition was noted when cultures were incubated at either 10 or 55 °C. A preliminary study of applying anti-mold lactobacilli in Cheddar cheese was completed. Anti-mold LAB was added to the cheese milk as an adjunct to give 105 cfu/ml. After 1 -week and 1 -month ripening, mold (10 ~ 20 spores) was added on to the surface, and the cheese was wrapped loosely. The appearance of the mold on cheese surface was monitored. Mold was not present on the 1 -week old cheese “NB in milk” until the 6 th day after the control cheese (made without strain NB) showed signs of mold. The 1 -month old cheese “NB in milk ” extended the shelf life 17 days longer than the control cheese...|$|R
40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were to study about the growth and diversity of moulds in the cucumber pickle and the influences of acetic acid concentration and long storage as well as additional of onion on the growth of moulds. Cucumber pickle was treated in different acetic acid concentrations (0, 8 %, 1, 4 %, 2, 0 %), long storage and with or without additional of onion. The used method to isolate of mould was dilution planting. For enumerating moulds, 0, 1 ml samples were blended and diluted after that inoculated on to potato sucrose agar (PSA) medium and then incubated at 270 C for 7 days. To identify the moulds, the colony was transferred on to CDA and PSA media, and then incubated at 270 C for 7 days. The moulds were identified according to their macroscopic and microscopic characters. To know the degrees of taste, the cucumber <b>pickle</b> was <b>tested</b> to 25 people with hedonic scale method. The results showed that, there was 12 different kinds of moulds {{can be found in}} cucumber pickle without additional of onion. There were Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger, A. ochraceus, A. tamarii Kita, Cochliobolus sp, Botrytis, Penicillium chrysogenum, P. expansum, P. citrinum, Rhizopus oligosporus, Trichoderma sp, and Monilia. On the other hand, experiment with onion, P. expansum and A. niger could not be observed. The highest varieties of moulds can be found in cucumber pickle with acetic acid concentration 1, 4 %. In experiment without onion, on nil (0) day, with acetic acid concentration of 1, 4 %, the amount of moulds is lower than in the pickle with acetic acid concentration 0, 8 %. The diversity of moulds in the cucumber pickle with additional of onion is lower than that of without onion. The additional of onion showed decreasing the diversity and growth of moulds in cucumber pickle with acetic acid concentration of 0, 8 % on nil (0) day. In experiment with acetic acid concentration 2, 0 % in 10 - 1 dilution on nil (0) day until 6 th day, the moulds could not be observed...|$|R
40|$|Since {{stainless}} steel must be rinsed with water after pickling operation with mixtures of nitric and hydrofluoric acids, {{the present investigation}} was undertaken to define a major step towards the close loop circulation of water in steel plant. This {{can be done by}} a new procedure for removing also nitrates from rinse water {{in such a way that}} clean water can be recycled back to rinsing use. The concentrated part of used rinse water will be fed to pickling acid regeneration plant, where nitric and hydrofluoric acids can be separate and recycled back to the <b>pickling</b> use. The <b>tests</b> were carried out mainly in one of Outokumpu’s production plants in Sweden. Membrane technique was used for rinse water treatment. A filtering system based on reverse osmosis was developed to separate the acids and metals from the rinsing water. A pre-filtering method necessary for reverse osmosis was tested. Since the composition of permeate is not applicable for direct reusage in the rinsing zone, post-treatment methods were examined. Amberlite IRA 67 ion exchange resin was tested for treatment of reverse osmosis filtrate (pH adjustment). For the recovery of the mixed acids, the concentrate of reverse osmosis was further treated with electrodialysis. On the basis of these results, a regeneration concept was developed, in order to close the rinse water loop. The proposed rinse water recycling concept reduces the overall usage of water.
