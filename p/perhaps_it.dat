5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> is not {{surprising}} that the cure for political injustices is identical to the cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{returns to}} the problem of fraud and the {{detection}} of false gems using several tests, including the scratch test, where counterfeit gems can be marked by a steel file, and genuine ones not. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> refers to glass imitations of jewellery gemstones. He refers to using one hard mineral to scratch another, presaging the Mohs hardness scale. Diamond sits {{at the top of the}} series because, Pliny says, it will scratch all other minerals.|$|E
5|$|Radau {{returns to}} food, {{describing}} sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.|$|E
50|$|A flourishing metropolis, {{the crowd}} bustling about, each one conjecturing a {{beautiful}} wish {{to wait for}} his or her fate. A beautiful story can take place anywhere, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> in the mall, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> in the cafe, or <b>perhaps,</b> <b>it's</b> in the subway.....|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] said he. [...] "If {{others had}} obeyed theirs as well!--But you are right, Captain Leigh, right. You will prosper, whoever else does not. Now, sir, good-night, {{if you will}} let me {{be the first to}} say so. My old eyes grow heavy early now-a-days. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> old age, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> sorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{takes the}} form of visions, as I fear [...] you'll quickly know; [...] Perhaps a string o' monkeys, all a-sittin' in [...] a row, [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> frogs or beetles, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> [...] rats or mice, [...] There are many sorts [...] of visions and [...] there's none of 'em is nice." ...|$|R
5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} stick to one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it and looked for another opportunity. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was due to this lukewarmness that Władysław {{was never able to}} inspire those he ruled to support, at least in any {{significant}} manner, any of his plans. Władysław Czapliński in his biography of the king is more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{states that}} Northanger Abbey looks exactly as she {{imagined}} {{it and she}} becomes intrigued by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her that <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> is possible to read too many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother {{has no intention of}} marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do no such thing.|$|E

60|$|MRS. G. (Aside.) And {{he never}} asked for the name! How funny men are! But <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> as well.|$|R
60|$|I don't deny you're plump, but I {{never did}} like a scrag. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> {{the last chance}} we shall ever have.|$|R
5|$|Jolin was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for the architectural and aesthetic preservation of the capital, as is written in his draft for a pamphlet called Mot strömmen (Against the Tide). According to him, Stockholm had become an ugly town, by insensitive mixing of styles, densification, and centuries of eager renovation. Jolin wanted {{to bring out the}} beautiful and the genuine in the cityscape, as well as restore, what he considered to be distorted parts of the city, to their former glory. According to Palmgren, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was that dream Jolin expressed in his depictions of Stockholm. At the end of the 19th century, and during some decades into the 20th century, artists depicted Stockholm in a variety of ways, each according to his own mind and individualism. Traditionalists worked side by side with Modernists, old with young, seasoned pursuers of the established view of the city and young enthusiastic individuals, such as Jolin. By the middle of the 20th century, his focus shifted from the cityscape to other motifs such as chinoiserie settings, but in his youth, he and his friends from his years in Paris found inspiration in Stockholm and its surroundings.|$|E
25|$|The {{user can}} also {{introduce}} farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> {{will be useful}} first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses {{will be in the}} view of the user.|$|E
25|$|Historians have {{commented on}} her {{reluctance}} {{to write about}} slavery. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was because she had conflicting feelings about the institution. In the poem above, critics have said that she praises slavery because it brought her to Christianity. But, in another poem, she wrote that slavery was a cruel fate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Satisfied?" [...] said Mrs. Austin. [...] "Oh, well, I know you're frank. Frankness has advantages, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> {{not always}} necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! no; not necessarily. There is a {{sincerity of}} effort {{that leads to}} lasting and {{beautiful}} work, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> not common." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charnock {{looked hard}} {{at her and}} nodded. [...] "Well, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> a good plan. Meddling is {{sometimes}} dangerous, but one can trust you." ...|$|R
25|$|Indianapolis-style single-car {{qualifying}} {{was introduced}} for the 1969 Race of Champions, but it {{simply did not}} catch on – <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> {{did not have the}} glamour of the Indy 500; Jackie Stewart won the race in the Matra MS80 owned by Ken Tyrrell and went on to win his first World Championship with it.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, {{the same}} year that he began his writing career as Yogi Ramacharaka, Atkinson was {{admitted}} to the Bar of Illinois. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was a desire to protect his ongoing career as a lawyer that led him to adopt so many pseudonyms—but if so, he left no written account documenting such a motivation.|$|E
25|$|The system {{provides}} sounds {{not found in}} the known Elven languages of the First Age, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was designed for notating a variety of languages. However, the consonants seem to be, more or less, the same found in Welsh phonology, a theory supported by the fact that Tolkien was heavily influenced by Welsh when creating Elven languages.|$|E
6000|$|... "D'you know, you're {{extraordinarily}} queer," [...] she said. [...] "Every {{one seems}} to me a little queer. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> the effect of London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you don't}} think it's an answer, eh? Well! <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> not. Settled? You mean, do I {{feel as if}} I were {{settling}} down?" ...|$|R

25|$|Unitarianism is {{also known}} for the {{rejection}} of several other Western Christian doctrines, including the doctrines of original sin, predestination, and the infallibility of the Bible. Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell, but few do today. Mostly excluded, Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism depending on one's stance or viewpoint; <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> is more accurate {{to call it a}} part of Nontrinitarianism, or of both.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Jinnah's speech, the All-India Jamhur Muslim League (AIJML) {{was formed to}} counter the move of Jinnah on his support for Sir Syed's two-nation theory and to oppose the creation of Pakistan. The Raja of Mahmoodabad was elected its president and Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi was its first general secretary. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was the first split of Muslim League on ideological ground. This party however merged with Indian Congress latter on to strengthen its views on partition.|$|E
25|$|This wall (Muralla is the {{protective}} perimeter wall) is emphasized, by its dimensions (four metres high by three metres thick) {{as well as}} by its location on edges of the cliffs surrounding the north and northeast parts of the site. Apparently this structure was constructed {{towards the end of the}} occupation of La Quemada and, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>it</b> represents one of the best indicators of the problems faced by city residents as well as their perseverance to remain there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Christie musingly; [...] "but <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> {{just as well}} if we kept {{a little}} more to {{ourselves}} for a while." ...|$|R
6000|$|Festing {{was silent}} a moment, {{and when he}} looked up his eyes were soft. [...] "Thank you, Bob! Or <b>perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> Sadie I ought to thank?" ...|$|R

25|$|The {{argument}} thus {{claims that}} if we find the inverted spectrum plausible, we must admit that qualia exist (and are non-physical). Some philosophers find it absurd that an armchair argument can prove something to exist, and the detailed argument does involve a lot of assumptions about conceivability and possibility, which are open to criticism. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> is not possible for a given brain state to produce {{anything other than a}} given quale in our universe, and that is all that matters.|$|E
25|$|The hexagram {{does appear}} {{occasionally}} in Jewish contexts since antiquity, apparently as a decorative motif. For example, in Israel, {{there is a}} stone bearing a hexagram from the arch of a 3rd–4th century synagogue in the Galilee. Originally, the hexagram may have been employed as an architectural ornament on synagogues, as it is, for example, on the cathedrals of Brandenburg and Stendal, and on the Marktkirche at Hanover. A pentagram in this form is found on the ancient synagogue at Tell Hum. In the synagogues, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>it</b> {{was associated with the}} mezuzah.|$|E
25|$|Deepak's {{works are}} characterised by their tragic, dark endings. His {{characters}} find {{death as a}} constant companion, and often succumb to it. Often, critics have suggested that Deepak walks alongside his characters with a loaded gun—recoiled and ready to fire. Maybe, one can trace the beginnings of Deepak's present mental ordeal to the dark stories that he was writing even in the early 1970s. <b>Perhaps,</b> <b>it</b> {{is no coincidence that}} Deepak's favourite authors are Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf, who succumbed to mental agony themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mean!' replied Wardle. 'Why, I {{think the}} girls are all running mad; that's no news, you'll say? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> not; but it's true, for all that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{what does}} it matter?" [...] inquired the other, staring. [...] "Why shouldn't <b>it?</b> <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it's</b> the music that's {{affected}} you; some of those old hymns--" ...|$|R
