[...] Though if his early work had been mild attempts to use technology, Cyberpunk itself, Robbins wrote, was [...] "the sound of science gone too far." [...] The ideology of futurism Idol adopted was panned by Robbins, while the music itself was hardly different from his previous work.

He also stated that the album is about a lot of different topics, and was quick to point out that most of them were pre-"Jerk" [...] stating they were fifteen songs in before 'You're a Jerk'.

Sklar spent a year researching and writing a 550 triple-spaced page {{screenplay}} and then Stone rewrote it and condensed it closer to normal screenplay length. Stone and Sklar used composite characters, most notably the [...] "Mr. X" [...] character played by Donald Sutherland. This was a technique that would be criticized in the press. He was a mix of Richard Case Nagell and retired Air Force colonel Fletcher Prouty, another adviser for the film and who was a military liaison between the CIA and the Pentagon.

500|$|In 2007, Ronald Oxburgh {{suggested}} in The Courier-Mail that production of biofuels could be either responsible or irresponsible and had several trade-offs: [...] "Produced responsibly {{they are a}} sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment; they can also help {{solve the problems of}} the waste generated by Western society; and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none.

What was there either aesthetic or intelligent in cloaking the offices of a modern democracy as the temple of a classic tyrant, the gallery of a Renaissance prince, or the palace of a French monarch? ...we have learned quite a lot about the principles of modern architecture, just as we have learned a lot about some other things; and today, after so short a time, it looks <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> a relic out of the dim past."

[...] Writer Mark Evanier and artist Dan Spiegle avoided all the racial and ethnic stereotypes that had previously defined Chop-Chop’s character except one. [...] They put him back in the coolie outfit that the character had worn for a large part of his existence. [...] This was a deliberate move so they could examine why Chop-Chop was not treated like a full member of the team in a story titled [...] "What’s the Matter with Chop-Chop?" [...] (#265, December 1983). The story has the other Blackhawks examine their attitudes and feelings and, at the end, Wu Cheng gets respect and a uniform.|$|E
