25|$|The Massed Band, {{consisting}} of the Brass and Reed, Pipes and Drums, and Highland Dancers, perform at parades, public relation trips and recruit shows. The Brass and Reed Band is a multi-purpose section, used primarily as a parade march and concert band. The <b>Pipe</b> <b>Section</b> and the Drum Section perform at mess dinners; parades; sporting events; ceremonies (official or squadron); weddings; funerals; public relations; wing events; Christmas Ball (RMC) & Graduation Balls; private events; and holidays. The Highland Dance Section perform at {{many of the same}} functions with the exception of parades and funerals. The Choir performs the Canadian national anthem; sings at mess dinners; and accompanies the Stage Band on selected pieces including: folk, jazz, traditional music, French music, show tunes, African music and Christmas songs. The Stage Band is versatile, performing dinner music followed by marches at college mess dinners. The Cheer Band, a subsidiary of the Brass and Reed, performs music for RMC sporting events, such as the Carr-Harris Cup and the Westpoint Weekend.|$|E

40|$|Gravel packing is a {{well-known}} method in sand control where stabilizing the formation with gravel prevents the production of formation sand. Longer and more complex completion operations are making the business of completing wells continually changing with new challenges, new technology and new methods. The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the gravel placement in nearly vertical openhole systems with blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> between the screens. In vertical openhole completions with long blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> slurry and gravel settling regimes will occur differently compared to a conventional gravel pack operation without blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections.</b> The {{reason for this is}} when a lower screen section is packed with gravel and the overlying section is with blank pipe, the carrier fluid can no longer flow through the lower screen. The gravel in the blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> is mainly settling due to gravitational forces and therefore displaces the carrier fluid, which flows upwards to the upper screen section. By simulating gravel pack operations with blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> in Halliburton’s laboratory scale model in Tananger it has recently been shown (with continuous pumping) that with a higher inclination on the well (less vertical), a better packing is achieved in the blank pipe section; a higher gravel pack efficiency is achieved. By analyzing and calculating theoretically how the gravel settles with regards to physical laws in fluid dynamics will give a better view on how to optimize the packing of gravel in the blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> in nearly vertical wells. How to optimize the packing in these blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> without the use of extensive expensive rig-time was one of several challenges that had {{to be taken into account}} during the work with this thesis. The combination of solids and fluid in one flow resulted in complex calculations, and certain parameters were therefore predetermined and assumptions like fluid loss and particle interaction were set to zero to simplify the calculations. The parameters in this thesis take the basis in ta field located in the Norwegian sector...|$|R

These <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> had nominally identical manufacturing, construction, coating and operational conditions. Some sections were unaffected by stress corrosion cracking (SCC), whereas surrounding sections were affected by SCC. Slight differences in mechanical and microstructural properties were found between the two types of section. Residual stress/strain and hardness close to the outer surface of the pipes and high angle boundary fraction values were lower for the non-cracked <b>pipe</b> <b>sections.</b> Predominant 〈 1 1 0 〉//ND texture was also found at the outer surface of the non-cracked <b>pipe</b> <b>sections.</b> These characteristics lead to a lower crack growth rate in laboratory SCC experiments. These features being mainly a result of the line pipe steel manufacturing operations, appropriate metallurgical processes leading to low residual stress (6. 2 %YS), relatively low fraction of high angle boundaries (about 0. 75) and predominant { 1 1 0 }〈 1 1 0 〉 texture in the material (or in the near surface) are expected to greatly improve the stress corrosion cracking resistance of line pipe steels on the field. © 2014, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Results show that horizontal load-displacement curves change slowly and horizontal bearing capacity of valiable <b>section</b> <b>pipe</b> piles will be higher than constant <b>section</b> <b>pipe</b> piles with equal average diameters. Comparing with constant <b>section</b> <b>pipe</b> piles 1 # and 2 # with equal average diameters, unit volume horizontal critical bearing capacity of 3 # and 4 # are improved 8. 7 % and 34. 2 % respectively and which have different degrees of increse with improvement of valiable section ratio. Moreover,there are two maximum bending moment to valialble <b>section</b> <b>pipe</b> piles insteard of one to constant <b>section</b> <b>pipe</b> piles.
