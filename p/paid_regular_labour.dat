40|$|The paper {{examines}} both theoretically and empirically {{the factors}} determining {{the demand for}} <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> in seasonal agriculture. In an implicit contract framework {{it is argued that}} there are ‘hoarding costs’ of <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> in the slack period when there is not much work to be done. Consequently, the number of <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> employed is constrained by the hoarding cost where larger employment-intensive farms tend to hire more <b>regular</b> <b>labour.</b> Evidence from the ICRISAT villages in India, too, show that though the marginal costs of <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> are zero, there are significant hoarding costs of <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> among small farms so that larger farmers are the major demanders of <b>regular</b> <b>labour.</b> Estimates of the double-hurdle model jointly determining the probability of hiring <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> and demand for regular labour-hours (if a <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> is hired) are shown to be an improvement over univariate tobit estimates of the demand for regular labour-hours only...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the {{theoretical and empirical}} validity of task-based segmentation of rural labour contracts in seasonal agriculture. <b>Regular</b> <b>labour</b> is hired to perform tasks {{that are difficult to}} supervise for which casual labour is not incentive-compatible, and a regular wage above the reservation wage ensures no shirking in these tasks. It is argued that there is a hoarding cost of <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> which is the cost when productivity is low during the slack season. This implies that minimization of supervision costs necessitates the employment of <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> in certain tasks, but enhances hoarding cost. Results from the ICRISAT villages in India suggests that daily regular wages are lower than daily casual wages, adjusted by the probability of unemployment. Estimates of a tobit selection model suggest that (a) task characteristics are not significant even among the farms hiring <b>regular</b> <b>labour,</b> (b) larger employment-intensive farms tend to hire more <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> irrespective of the choice of crop, and (c) there is a significant substitutability between <b>regular</b> and family <b>labour.</b> These results seem to question the very basis of task-based segmentation and strengthen the hoarding cost argument: farms hiring <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> use it indiscriminately in both non-monitorable and monitorable tasks and, if possible, they may substitute family <b>labour</b> for <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> with a view to minimizing hoarding cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper offers}} an {{explanation}} of labour tying commonly observed in seasonally agricultural economies. Employers may either hire regular labourers in the slack season to satisfy {{all or most of}} the labour demand in the high season but have underutilised labour in the low-demand season or rely on casual labourers only. Thus farmers hiring <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> may also hire some casual labour as and when needed to minimise the hoarding costs of <b>regular</b> <b>labour.</b> Secondly, daily <b>regular</b> wages are usually lower than daily casual wages, but regular labourers usually get some wage-advance as well. Thus asset-poor workers have incentives to choose <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> with interest-free wage advance because they face high marginal costs of credit in the segmented credit markets. The optimum hoarding costs decrease with increase in farm size, but increase with increase in spot market wages. However with improved availability of alternative employment opportunities and/or cheaper credit facilities to the asset-poor labourers, the supply of <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> is likely to decline. Empirical evidence from the ICRISAT villages in south India seems to be consistent with the primary propositions of the model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} long-run price (wage) elasticities {{of demand}} for <b>regular</b> farm <b>labour</b> in South Africa using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and a Two-stage Least Squares (2 SLS) simultaneous-equation model for the period 1960 - 2002. Both models include a piecewise interactive slope dummy variable with 1991 as the threshold year to reflect South African (SA) commercial farmers' expectations that farm labour costs would increase as new labour legislation was introduced from the early 1990 s onwards. The long-run price (wage) elasticity {{of demand for}} <b>regular</b> farm <b>labour</b> in South Africa during 1960 - 1990 was estimated as - 0. 25 for OLS and - 0. 23 for 2 SLS regression, respectively. For the period 1991 - 2002, this elasticity estimate rose to - 1. 32 and - 1. 34 for OLS and 2 SLS regression, respectively. These results suggest that a marked structural decline in the demand for <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> has occurred since 1991 that {{raises questions about the}} appropriateness of labour laws and minimum wage legislation that have increased the cost of <b>regular</b> farm <b>labour</b> in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} choice between casual and <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> contracts in Indian agriculture. In particular, it deals with two relevant decision problems: (i) how an employer chooses between casual and regular contracts and (ii) how a labourer chooses between casual and regular contracts. Several models of contractual choice are developed. In the implicit contract model, <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> contracts are a means through which risk-neutral employers offer some insurance against the wage and employment fluctuations to labourers, in return for lower wages. In the shirking model, regular contracts are used to perform non-monitorable tasks for which casual contracts are not incentive compatible: regular contracts with wages above the reservation wage act as a device to induce the workers not to shirk in non-monitorable tasks. In the collateral model, regular contracts with advance wage payments provide labourers with a means of using their labour services as a collateral substitute. The time constraint model shows that landless labourers have a comparative advantage in <b>regular</b> <b>labour</b> contracts, because the opportunity cost of precommitting labour time tends to be lower for them. In each of these models, it is shown that casual and regular contracts may coexist in equilibrium. Empirical evidence bearing on these different theories is examined using data from three South Indian villages. The evidence {{is consistent with the}} implicit contract model, the collateral model and the time constraint model. However, we find no support for the shirking model. Other relevant aspects of labour contracts are also investigated, including labour force participation decisions, unemployment rates, the relative levels of casual-labour and regular-labour wages, the links between labour and credit contracts, and the determinants of labour demand. The thesis concludes with a discussion of recent trends in the incidence of casual and regular contracts in rural India. The incidence of regular contracts has steadily declined in recent years. We argue that this decline primarily reflects a decline in supply (due, inter alia, to an improvement of credit facilities and an expansion of alternative employment opportunities) rather than a decline of demand...|$|R
