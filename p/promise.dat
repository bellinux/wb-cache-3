5|$|Since Louis had fathered no sons, the {{expectation}} that he would bequeath Hungary, Poland, and his claims to the Kingdom of Naples and Provence to his daughters made them desirable spouses {{for members of the}} European royal families. Before Mary's first birthday, her father made a <b>promise</b> to Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, that Mary would marry the emperor's second son, Sigismund of Luxembourg. Louis confirmed his <b>promise</b> in a deed in June 1373. Mary and Sigismund were closely related, because her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth of Poland, was the sister of his great-grandfather, Casimir III of Poland. Pope Gregory XI issued the dispensation necessary for their marriage on 6December 1374. The leading Hungarian and Polish lords confirmed Louis's <b>promise</b> of Mary's and Sigismund's marriage on 14April 1375.|$|E
40|$|Both vote {{buying and}} tax-cut <b>promises</b> are {{attempts}} to manipulate voters through cash incentives {{in order to}} win elections, but only vote buying is illegal. Should we extend the ban on vote buying to tax-cut <b>promises?</b> This article will argue for three conclusions. The first is that tax-cut <b>promises</b> should be understood as a form of vote buying. The second is that campaign <b>promises</b> are a form of vote buying. The third conclusion is that campaign <b>promises,</b> including tax-cut <b>promises,</b> should not be banned. An important distinction is drawn between enforceable wrongful incentives and unenforceable wrongful incentives. The difference between vote buying and tax-cut <b>promises</b> is not wrongfulness but enforceability...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a unique perspective}} to the milk market relative to previous studies. While there is rich literature on the various sectors of the milk market, a contribution to this literature was made by providing a specific econometric analysis of the <b>Promised</b> Land brand. Previous work conducted by Capps and Salin (2010) provided the foundation for this thesis. The purpose of this thesis was threefold: 1. Estimate household demand functions for <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk using Nielsen homescan data. The demand functions were estimated using a tobit model to estimate the conditional and unconditional own-price and cross-price effects of <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk. 2. Assess the impacts of household demographic drivers of demand for <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk. 3. Use the empirical results derived from the tobit model to identify substitutes and complements of <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk and provide a profile of households that purchase <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk. The study concluded that households who purchased <b>Promised</b> Land white were insensitive {{to changes in the}} price of <b>Promised</b> Land white milk. The price of private label milk was the only cross-price that was significant in the quantity of <b>Promised</b> Land white milk purchased. The estimated elasticities showed that <b>Promised</b> Land white milk and private label white milk were substitutes. From the estimated elasticities, it was found that households that purchased <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk were largely insensitive to changes in the price of <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk. It was also found that the prices of Nesquick, Oak Farms, and private label chocolate milk had a significant effect on the quantity of <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk purchased. Of these significant prices, private label and Oak Farms chocolate milk were substitutes for <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk. The price of Nesquick chocolate milk demonstrated a complementary relationship with <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk...|$|R
