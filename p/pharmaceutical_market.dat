40|$|Common People and {{government}} authorities are usually {{concerned about the}} unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan, therefore the researcher examines the unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan, and selected Karachi City as Case study for this purpose and analyze the impact of unethical <b>marketing</b> practices in <b>pharmaceutical</b> industry. This study not only evaluates the responsible variables for the unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices but also compare who is more responsible for these unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan. This study also examines, who has initiated these unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan and {{who is responsible for}} the continuation of these practices in Pakistan. In this study researcher focuses six variables that can be a major cause of unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan i. e. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> and Sales personnel, doctorsâ€™ community, retail and whole sales pharmacies, government and private hospitals personnel, government officials and patients or their attendantsâ€™. All these six variables have been taken and gathered the data through survey questionnaire, compile and analyze through Statistical tools like descriptive and inferential Statistics both and conclude the main cause of unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan. In the under taken study four different hypotheses were developed and tested through Z and F test and also analyze the data through descriptive Statistics, for the descriptive Statistics four different parameters were developed and presented in the form of graphs and tables. The conclusion of the study was that initially pharmaceutical industry was responsible to introduce the unethical marketing practices to their customers i. e. doctors community, and hospitals and later on unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices became the norm of the pharmaceutical industry. Now the doctors are the main cause or reason for the continuation of these unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan. It is further concluded in the study that foreign visits are more common tools in order to get maximum output from the doctor community and now doctors have become more demanding and they ask themselves regarding the foreign and local tours and conferences. Cash incentive and home appliances are another form of unethical practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Clinic and home decoration are also the findings of unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in the under taken study. However, it is also found that some demands from the doctorsâ€™ community or the offers by the pharmaceutical companies are quite ethical genuine regarding the scientific meeting and local & international scientific conferences. It is further concluded that all the stakeholders are agreed that these unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices can be stopped. They are also agreed non-qualified doctorâ€™s practice should be eradicated. Pharmaceutical companies should strictly abide the rules and regulations, which are already mentioned and given in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> code of ethics, at the same time Pakistan Medical Association and Pakistan Medical and Dental Association should restrict to the doctors community to practice in the limit of ethical and moral grounds. Governmental agencies are also responsible to enforce the prevailing laws with their true spirit on pharmaceutical companies. If any further legislation is required in order to stop these unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices then further legislation should be taken place and strict laws should be made and implemented...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the current extent {{and type of}} <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> in nursing homes (NHs) in one state and to provide preliminary evidence for the potential influence of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> {{on the use of}} atypical antipsychotics in NHs. DESIGN: Nested mixed-methods, cross-sectional study of NHs in a cluster randomized trial. SETTING: Forty-one NHs in Connecticut. PARTICIPANTS: NH administrators, directors of nursing, and medical directors (n = 93, response rate 75. 6 %). MEASUREMENTS: Quantitative data, including prescription drug dispensing data (September 2009 -August 2010) linked with Nursing Home Compare data (April 2011), were used to determine facility-level prevalence of atypical antipsychotic use, facility-level characteristics, NH staffing, and NH quality. Qualitative data, including semistructured interviews and surveys of NH leaders conducted {{in the first quarter of}} 2011, were used to determine encounters with <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing.</b> RESULTS: Leadership at 46. 3 % of NHs (n = 19) reported <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> encounters, consisting of educational training, written and Internet-based materials, and sponsored training. No association was detected between level of atypical antipsychotic prescribing and reports of any <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> by at least one NH leader. CONCLUSION: NH leaders frequently encounter <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> through a variety of ways, although the impact on atypical antipsychotic prescribing is unclear.

2500|$|A recent {{proposal}} from the European Senlis Council hopes {{to solve the}} problems caused by the large quantity of opium produced illegally in Afghanistan, most of which is converted to heroin and smuggled for sale in Europe and the United States. This proposal is to license Afghan farmers to produce opium for the world <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>market,</b> and thereby solve another problem, that of chronic underuse of potent analgesics where required within developing nations. Part of the proposal is to overcome the [...] "80–20 rule" [...] that requires the U.S. to purchase 80 percent of its legal opium from India and Turkey to include Afghanistan, by establishing a second-tier system of supply control that complements the current INCB regulated supply and demand system by providing poppy-based medicines to countries who cannot meet their demand under the current regulations.

The nature of existing regulations is diverse, as they serve {{a number of}} purposes: guaranteeing safety, efficacy and security of drug usage; but also ensuring patients access to treatment, preserving affordability and fostering pharmaceutical innovation. A number of regulatory interventions are purposely designed to bring about more efficient <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>markets.</b> These interventions are ultimately intended to increase welfare for patients today and patients tomorrow. Welfare today requires ensuring patients access to existing pharmacological treatment at an affordable cost. Welfare tomorrow requires ensuring a continued effort {{on research and development}} to produce pharmaceutical innovations that respond to currently unmet medical needs. The chapters of this thesis focus on a number of regulatory interventions that attract notable attention due to their effect on access, affordability and innovation. These include the regulation of pharmaceutical parallel trade, direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs and off-patent <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>markets.</b> By assessing the impact of public interventions on market outcomes and patients welfare, this thesis aims at contributing to the debate about optimal regulation of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>markets.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the impact of the new regulation concerning entry of pharmacies into the Norwegian <b>pharmaceuticals</b> <b>market</b> in 2001 on cost and availability of pharmaceutical products. Methods In order to study costs, a translog cost function is estimated using data from the annual reports of a sample of Norwegian pharmacies before and after the deregulation of the market. Linear regression models for the number of pharmacies in each region in Norway are also estimated. Results The results show that the costs of the individual pharmacies have not decreased as a consequence of the deregulation of the Norwegian <b>pharmaceuticals</b> <b>market.</b> The deregulation of the market did, however, increase the availability to pharmacy services substantially. Conclusions Increased availability of pharmacy services can be achieved by deregulating <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>markets</b> as in Norway, but at the expense of increased costs for the pharmacies. ...|$|R
