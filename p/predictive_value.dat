These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the value of four MR imaging criteria for evaluating unstable meniscal lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Criteria for unstable meniscal lesions were {{the presence of a}} displaced meniscal fragment, visibility on more than three 3 -mm-thick coronal and two 4 -mm-thick sagittal images, having more than one orientation plane or more than one pattern (contour irregularity, peripheral separation, tear), and having intrameniscal high signal intensity on T 2 -weighted spin-echo images. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative <b>predictive</b> <b>values</b> for recognition of instability among all meniscal lesions were determined for the presence of each individual criterion and for the presence of at least one criterion in 50 consecutive patients (mean age, 46 years) who underwent MR imaging and subsequent arthroscopy. RESULTS: Sensitivities and specificities of these four criteria ranged between 18 % and 54 % and between 94 % and 100 %, respectively. Positive and negative <b>predictive</b> <b>values</b> ranged between 92 % and 100 % and between 39 % and 52 %, respectively. The presence of at least one criterion enabled recognition of unstable lesions with a sensitivity and specificity of 82 % and with positive and negative <b>predictive</b> <b>values</b> of 90 % and 70 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: The four MR imaging criteria have high specificities and positive <b>predictive</b> <b>values</b> and low sensitivities and negative <b>predictive</b> <b>values</b> when evaluating unstable meniscal lesions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To assist clinicians {{and other}} health-care {{providers}} {{to understand the}} terms {{used to describe the}} accuracy of diagnostic tests. Methodology: This paper reviews the calculation and interpretation of sensitivity, specificity, <b>predictive</b> <b>values,</b> receiver operating characteristic curves and likelihood ratios. Results: Sensitivity and specificity are measures of the accuracy of a diagnostic test. There is a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that is dependent on the cut-off level chosen for a positive diagnosis. <b>Predictive</b> <b>values</b> are measures of the usefulness of a test once the test results are known. <b>Predictive</b> <b>values</b> depend on the prevalence of the disease, {{as well as on the}} sensitivity and specificity of the test. Sensitivity, specificity and <b>predictive</b> <b>values</b> are easily calculated by the construction of a two-by-two table. Multiple testing, either in parallel or in series, can alter the sensitivity, specificity and <b>predictive</b> <b>values.</b> Receiver operating characteristic curves plot the relationship between sensitivity and specificity at various cut-offs, facilitating the comparison of accuracy among tests. Likelihood ratios are an alternative measure of accuracy and have the advantage of being able to assess multiple test outcomes, rather than simply assessing dichotomized positive or negative results. Conclusion: An understanding of how the measurements that are used to describe the accuracy of diagnostic tests are calculated is essential to the interpretation of test results...|$|R
