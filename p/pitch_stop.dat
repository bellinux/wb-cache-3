50|$|After {{years of}} {{continuous}} work in promoting Romanian cinema and welcoming international guests to meet national productions and their filmmakers, in 2015, the festival rounded up its industry activities under one umbrella. TIFF - Industry {{is open for}} talents from Romania and Moldova and is gathering Transilvania Talent Lab (TTL) - the hands-on programme dedicated to emerging talents, and Transilvania <b>Pitch</b> <b>Stop</b> (TPS) - a tailor made workshop for feature fiction films wrapping up with a public presentation and one-to-one meetings. TIFF - Industry hosts a series of masterclasses, lining-up experts in audience development, and script writing, film directors, documentarist and personalities. TIFF Industry also means closed screenings for industry members and special screenings of the newest Romanian films, {{in the presence of}} their filmmakers.|$|E
40|$|A HPT- 32 {{aircraft}} {{was involved in}} an accident during an engine idling exercise. The {{aircraft was}} powered by a twin blade propeller engine. The blades had bent backwards. One of the blades had fractured at a location one third from the tip. The blade pitch angle was at the fine <b>pitch</b> <b>stop.</b> The rearward bending of the blades and the fine pitch of the blade angle indicate propeller rotation {{at the time of}} impact, with low or no power. It was learnt that the engine had problems of cutting off at idling speed on several occasions in the past. As the sortie involved an engine idling exercise, it could well be possible that it had cut off...|$|E
500|$|The {{label on}} a stop knob or rocker tab {{indicates}} the stop's name and its <b>pitch</b> in feet. <b>Stops</b> that control multiple ranks display a Roman numeral indicating {{the number of}} ranks present, instead of its <b>pitch.</b> Thus, a <b>stop</b> labelled [...] "Open Diapason 8 [...] " [...] is a single-rank diapason stop sounding at 8 <b>pitch.</b> A <b>stop</b> labelled [...] "MixtureV" [...] is a five-rank mixture.|$|R
500|$|To {{facilitate}} a large range of timbres, organ stops exist at different <b>pitch</b> levels. A <b>stop</b> that sounds at unison pitch when a key is depressed {{is referred to}} as being at 8 (pronounced [...] "eight-foot") pitch. This refers to the length of the lowest-sounding pipe in that rank, which is approximately eight feet. For the same reason, a stop that sounds an octave higher is at 4 pitch, and one that sounds two octaves higher is at 2 <b>pitch.</b> Likewise, a <b>stop</b> that sounds an octave lower than unison pitch is at 16 pitch, and one that sounds two octaves lower is at 32 <b>pitch.</b> <b>Stops</b> of different <b>pitch</b> levels are designed to be played simultaneously.|$|R
25|$|The ensuing public protests polarised New Zealand. While rugby fans {{filled the}} {{football}} grounds, protest crowds filled the surrounding streets, {{and on one}} occasion succeeded in invading the <b>pitch</b> and <b>stopping</b> the game.|$|R

5000|$|In modern organ building, an {{accepted}} standardized scheme {{is used for}} the layout of the stops and pistons on the console. The stops controlling each division (see Keyboards) are grouped together. Within these, the standard arrangement is for the lowest sounding stops (64′ or 32′ or 16′ or 8′) to be placed {{at the bottom of the}} columns, with the higher <b>pitched</b> <b>stops</b> placed above this, (5′ 4′, 2′, 2′, 1′, 1′ etc.); the 'mixtures' are placed above this (II, III, V or 12.19, 15.19.22.26, 1.8.12.15.17 etc.). The stops controlling the reed ranks are placed collectively above these in the same order as above, often with the stop engraving in red; For example, Trumpet 8′, Posaune 16′ or Clarinet 8′ ...|$|R

5000|$|The game's story {{originally}} {{began as}} a pitch for a role-playing game that was delivered to Munisix {{at some point in}} the 2000s; it included the premise of a princess defeating an enemy that had devastated her homeland, as well as character names and personalities, and asked Munisix to write a story. Munisix found the pitch underwhelming, but still worked on it, attempting to make it more interesting; while he was working on it, the person who had delivered the <b>pitch</b> <b>stopped</b> contacting him. Not wanting to abandon the work he had put into the project, Munisix kept working on it: he made several changes, to the point where it according to him no longer resembled the original pitch. Among these were additions to the game world and cast, including the creation of Ritona and the Outer- and Inner-Poles, the concept of pathdown, and a motivation for the game's antagonist; he also changed the structure of the story so that it could work as a manga or as [...] "a better game than it was intended to be".|$|R

5000|$|Their ascent closely {{followed}} the 1970 first ascent by Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell, completed with a heavy-handed reliance on bolts - {{a method that}} offended Robbins and other clean climbing advocates. Harding had left all his bolts in the rock; Robbins and Lauria used the bolts to repeat the climb; and Robbins then chopped the heads off the bolts behind them. After two <b>pitches,</b> Robbins <b>stopped</b> chopping the bolts because (according to Lauria) [...] "the quality of the aid climbing was much higher {{than he had ever}} expected of Harding or Caldwell and, of course, it was also taking us an awful long time to chop all those goddam bolts." ...|$|R
50|$|Set about 300 {{years after}} the book series, the film tells a story about Guardians Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and the Sandman, who enlist Jack Frost to <b>stop</b> <b>Pitch</b> Black from engulfing the world in darkness. The film was {{nominated}} for the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. This was the final DreamWorks Animation film to be distributed by Paramount Pictures.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the twentieth}} century German horn makers devised further {{variations}} on the double-horn pattern. One of these was the [...] "omnitonic" [...] horn invented by Hermann Prager in 1918 and built by Knopf of Markneukirchen, but its complicated mechanism made the instrument very heavy. A more successful model which added a valve to lower {{both sides of the}} instrument by a semitone (from B to A and from F to E) was patented by Paul Geyer of Schwerin in 1924. The extra valve not only made playing difficult passages in sharp keys easier, but also acted as a [...] "compensating" [...] mechanism for the otherwise sharp <b>pitch</b> of <b>stopped</b> notes on the B side.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lander beckoned {{and called}} to the man, who had <b>stopped</b> <b>pitching</b> hay and now stood leaning on the handle of his fork. At the signs and sounds she made, he came {{actively}} forward to the road, bringing his fork with him. When he arrived within easy conversational distance, he planted the tines {{in the ground and}} braced himself at an opposite incline from the long smooth handle, and waited for Mrs. Lander to begin.|$|R
50|$|In late 1914 Méndez {{developed}} arm {{trouble and}} {{cut back on}} his <b>pitching,</b> eventually <b>stopping</b> altogether. A slick fielder, Méndez moved to shortstop and joined J. L. Wilkinson's All Nations. He played with several other teams, including the Chicago American Giants and the Detroit Stars, before finally signing on in 1920 as playing manager with J. L. Wilkinson's Kansas City Monarchs in the new Negro National League. He continued to split his time between shortstop and pitching, and under his leadership the Monarchs won pennants in 1923, 1924, and 1925. He gradually adjusted and became a very effective pitcher again, albeit with lighter pitching loads than he had carried during his 1908-14 pitching prime. In 1923 Méndez had a 12-4 record, followed by 4-0, 2-0, and 3-1 {{in the next three}} seasons.|$|R
5000|$|In England and France, {{the word}} [...] "regal" [...] was {{sometimes}} applied to reed {{stops on the}} organ; Mersenne (1636) states that the word was applied {{at that time to}} the vox humana stop. According to Praetorius, the reed stops of pipe organs required constant tuning; he emphasized the fact that the <b>pitch</b> of the <b>stop</b> fell in summer and rose in winter. The pitch of the other stops rose in summer and fell in winter.|$|R
40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 format, 65 : 32 in length. Elliot Carter, Eight pieces for Four Timpani, Saeta: Associated Music Publishers, 1968. This piece uses a technique of dampening which involves striking the drum {{in the center}} of the head thereby creating a sound which has no distinct <b>pitch.</b> The <b>stopped</b> notes, or dead strokes, provide a counterpoint to the melody which is played near the edge of the two inner drums. Communicating the phrases in a musical manner involves a transition from a tight grip on the mallet to a loose grip while moving from the center of one drum to the edge of the other. The use of metric modulations, in which a rhythmic figure in one meter eventually becomes the tempo of a new meter, is an integral part of this work. (See more in text. ...|$|R
50|$|In November 1984, {{his name}} was drawn as sixteenth in the annual ballot for twenty MPs to {{introduce}} a Private member's bill; he introduced the Fabric Origin Marking Bill which would require the country of origin to be indicated; his Bill made no progress. After the Bradford City stadium fire, {{he noted that the}} death toll would have been much worse had there been a fence in front of the stand to <b>stop</b> <b>pitch</b> invasions. He asked for money to be made available to build a new stand as quickly as possible.|$|R
50|$|Bell {{ultimately}} made {{a permanent}} move to center field and <b>stopped</b> <b>pitching.</b> Before becoming an outfielder, Bell batted right-handed and threw left-handed. His {{transition to the}} outfield was aided by learning to bat as a switch hitter. When he batted left-handed, his baserunning speed was even more problematic for opponents {{because he was a}} couple of steps closer to first base. Biographer Shaun McCormack points out that Bell did not have a strong throwing arm. However, Bell's speed allowed him to play very shallow in the outfield and to still catch balls that were hit behind him.|$|R
50|$|Parata {{attended}} the University of Waikato, where she {{graduated with a}} Master of Arts degree. While at Waikato, she served as President of the Waikato Student Union in 1980. During the Springbok rugby tour of 1981 Parata took {{an active part in}} protests against the tour, including the protest at Rugby Park in Hamilton, which ended in a <b>pitch</b> invasion that <b>stopped</b> the match. She has stated that was unable to join the pitch invasion due to a plaster cast from the hip following surgery for a netball injury. Parata was a Youth Representative at the first Hui Taumata held in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the next}} few years, Herring {{returned}} to amateur baseball and eventually <b>stopped</b> <b>pitching</b> and converted to first base and the outfield. In 1904, he was batting [...]429 in the Sunday School League when he was signed by the American League's Senators. Herring struggled in 15 major league games that year. He batted just [...]174 and was inconsistent in the field. According to the Post, Herring was [...] "good on handling thrown balls, but forgets {{what to do when}} grounders are hit his way." [...] He played his last game for the Senators on September 3.|$|R
5000|$|The {{wood of the}} bow {{can also}} be drawn across the string — a {{technique}} called col legno tratto ("drawn with the wood"). This is much less common, and the plain marking col legno is invariably interpreted to mean battuto rather than tratto. The sound produced by col legno tratto is very quiet, with an overlay of white noise, but the <b>pitch</b> of the <b>stopped</b> note can be clearly heard. If the sound is too quiet, the bow can be slightly rolled so that a few bow hairs touch the string as well, leading to a slightly less [...] "airy" [...] sound.|$|R
50|$|Noah regains {{consciousness}} {{and tends to}} Pepe before sending him out a porthole to find land. Xiro has been imprisoned directly below and overhears Noah's words of encouragement, mistaking them for a personal message from 'the voice of his lineage.' When his friends free him, Xiro races to confront Dagnino, who has captured the other herbivores. (Xiro's group challenges Dagnino with the Maori ritual known as a haka.) The battle between Dagnino and Xiro ends when the ark, having drifted into the Arctic, runs into an ice floe. The sudden <b>stop</b> <b>pitches</b> Dagnino and his minions through a wall, in which their heads are stuck fast.|$|R
5000|$|For their part, Saladin's {{soldiers}} {{tried to}} disrupt the Crusader formation by raining arrows from their horse archers, by partial attacks and by feigned retreats. [...] "It is likely that {{from time to time}} the Turks came to close quarters, and this has caused some writers to refer to the action as a battle. It is more probable that although there were short episodes in which there was hard fighting, there was no pitched engagement." [...] On this occasion, the Franks could neither be tempted into fighting a <b>pitched</b> battle nor <b>stopped.</b> Unable to make an impression on the Latin host, Saladin broke off the running battle and returned to Damascus.|$|R
5000|$|He made a brief {{return to}} the mound in 1946, with a 2.32 ERA in five games, all complete. He <b>stopped</b> <b>pitching</b> for good that season, having {{compiled}} a 260-230 record, 356 complete games, 1073 strikeouts and a 3.67 ERA. He never appeared in a postseason game, as the generally mediocre-to-poor White Sox were usually far behind the American League leaders during his career. In Lyons' 21 seasons with the Sox, they finished fifth or lower (in an eight-team league) 16 times, and never finished higher than third. New York Yankees manager Joe McCarthy said, [...] "If he'd pitched for the Yankees, he would have won over 400 games." ...|$|R

Talking about this in 2006, he said, [...] "It's never been an issue for me {{in terms of my}} {{football}} although, socially, it can occasionally have a bit of an impact. I think I tend to be a bit more aware of what's going on around me on the football pitch because I am deaf in one ear. Maybe that's led to some of my other senses becoming heightened a bit. It hasn't stopped me from doing anything at all on the football <b>pitch.</b> It didn't <b>stop</b> me developing as a youngster and I'm sure it won't stop me continuing to develop in the future." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{conditions}} {{were so bad}} that when Liverpool coach Bob Paisley came onto the pitch to attend to an injured player, Shankly entered as well. He managed to give instructions to his players before he was spotted by the officials and ordered off the field. Ajax player Wim Suurbier was carried off with a damaged ankle midway through the first half. He returned to the pitch, but suffered from a limp. Ajax extended their lead in the 39th minute. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith fouled Cruyff outside the Liverpool penalty area. The subsequent free-kick taken by Frits Soetekouw was not cleared by the Liverpool defence and the ball rebounded to Nuninga, who scored to give Ajax a 3–0 lead. The conditions did not only affect the Liverpool players. Towards {{the end of the}} first half, the referee blew his whistle. Swart, assuming that he had signalled half-time began to walk off the <b>pitch,</b> was <b>stopped</b> by a steward who pointed out that the match was still ongoing. He re-entered the pitch, received the ball and crossed the ball for Nuninga, who scored to make it 4–0.|$|R
40|$|The teres major muscle has {{attracted}} relatively little at-tention.

5000|$|Ruth's {{performance}} {{that day at}} Whittington Park led {{to a change in}} Ruth's career and a major change in baseball history. As a result of his hitting, the Red Sox began rethinking Ruth's dual abilities during and after 1918. To begin, Ruth would alternate in the 1918 season, pitching less and playing the field often. His dual abilities helped lead the Red Sox to the 1918 World Series Championship. Hitting more regularly in 1918, Ruth hit a league leading 11 home runs to go with a 13-7 record (and two wins in the Series). Eventually Ruth <b>stopped</b> <b>pitching</b> and became a hitter, with results of legend that exploded after his 1920 sale to the New York Yankees: Lifetime, [...]342 average; 714 Home Runs; 2062 RBI'S; 2174 Runs Scored; 1.164 OPS.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of November 11, 2007 26-year-old Lazio fan Gabriele Sandri, a DJ from Rome, {{was killed by a}} shot in his neck while sitting inside a car, by a policeman, after Some other fans of Lazio violently {{assaulted}} with stones a group of Juventus ultras on the A1 Motorway service station of Badia al Pino in Arezzo. Early reports suggested that a stray bullet from a gun, set to distract the group of ultras, hit the Lazio fan in the neck as he sat in a car and killed him. An emergency meeting set up between Lega Calcio president Antonio Matarrese and police chief Antonio Manganelli decided that the game between Inter and Lazio would be called off, {{but the rest of the}} fixtures would go ahead that day, starting at a slightly later time (about 10 minutes later). The Atalanta-Milan game was eventually suspended following unrest caused by local ultras attempting to break off the protection glass in order to invade the <b>pitch</b> and <b>stop</b> the match. Later in the afternoon, the Italian Football Federation chose to postpone also the game between AS Roma and Cagliari, whose kick off was scheduled for 8.30 pm at Stadio Olimpico, Rome. However, this did not prevent violent riots, as hundreds of armed hooligans attacked a police barracks and the CONI (Italian Olympic National Committee) headquarters in Rome.|$|R
