5|$|Al-Balawi was a Jordanian {{doctor and}} {{jihadist}} website writer who was detained and interrogated over three days by the Jordanian intelligence service, the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), in January 2009. The GID and the CIA {{thought they had}} turned al-Balawi to penetrate al-Qaeda in the Pakistani tribal areas to provide intelligence for high-level targets. Instead, al-Balawi used this trust {{to gain access to}} the CIA base in Afghanistan unsearched and perpetrate the attack. The <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Taliban</b> and al-Qaeda claimed responsibility, saying they helped al-Balawi with the attack.|$|E
5|$|The drone attacks {{carried out}} by the CIA in Pakistan rely on local informants, who can cross the border into Pakistan in a way CIA {{officers}} cannot. CIA officers at the base were involved in the coordination, targeting and surveillance of drone strikes aimed at the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Taliban</b> and al-Qaeda. At the time of the attack, they were conducting an aggressive campaign against the Haqqani network, a radical group run by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani.|$|E

5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries with remaining polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake vaccination program {{in order to help}} find Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some people believe that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Taliban,</b> Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the group will continue to keep doing these kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E
25|$|According to the Wall Street Journal, Shahzad {{received}} bomb-making training {{from the}} <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Taliban.</b> The <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{are made up}} overwhelmingly of Pashtun tribesmen.

25|$|Various Taliban {{groups have}} been in {{existence}} in Pakistan since around 2002. Most of these Taliban factions have joined an umbrella organization called Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Although the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Taliban</b> is distinct from Afghan Taliban, they have a similar outlook towards women. The <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Taliban</b> too has killed women accusing them of un-Islamic behavior and has forcibly married girls after publicly flogging them for illicit relations.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the victory}} by the <b>Pakistani</b> army, <b>Taliban</b> militants slowly re-entered Swat over the {{following}} months and started engaging security forces in battles that lasted throughout 2008.

40|$|Pakistan {{today is}} {{confronted with a}} {{volatile}} extremist campaign in the entire country. In particular, the upsurge of religious militancy which began form the FATA (KPK) is now becoming the most challenging phenomenon Pakistan has faced {{in the recent past}} and even today. The emergence of religious militias is neither new nor alien to this strategic frontier area bounded by Afghanistan in the North and the West. However, the religious phenomenon built up momentum during the Soviet-Afghan war in 80 's and attracted international publicity. Since then, the radicalization of religious revivalism in Pakistan has been sporadically in the news. The popular reassertion of religious militias or <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Talibans</b> was seen in the aftermath of events of 9 / 11 and the American-led Western coalition's occupation of Afghanistan.

This latest ambush occurred amid escalating violence, which is drastically effecting this volatile region of the country.|$|R
5000|$|On June 10, Afghan troops, {{coalition}} forces and Taliban militants clashed {{near the border}} with Pakistan. The Pakistan-based Taliban said it had attacked Afghan troops with 60 to 100 of its fighters when they attempted to set up bunkers and outposts on <b>Pakistani</b> soil. <b>Taliban</b> spokesperson Maulvi Umar claimed to have killed 40 Afghan troops, captured several and shot down a NATO helicopter. He also said eight Taliban troops died in the clash. A U.S. military official stated that {{coalition forces}} [...] "were running company- and battalion-sized operations" [...] in Afghanistan's Kunar Province when they were engaged by Taliban forces, who then fled {{across the border into}} Pakistan. Two U.S. Air Force F-15E strike fighters and one B-1 bomber entered Pakistani airspace in pursuit of these fighters and dropped about a dozen 500-pound (225 kg) laser-guided munitions on them.|$|R

50|$|The Second Battle of Swat {{also known}} as Operation Rah-e-Rast, began in May 2009 and {{involved}} the <b>Pakistani</b> Army and <b>Taliban</b> militants in a fight {{for control of the}} Swat district of Pakistan. The first Battle of Swat had ended with a peace agreement, widely criticised in the west, that the government had signed with the Taliban in February 2009. However, by late April 2009 government troops and the Taliban began to clash once again, and in May the government launched military operations throughout the district and elsewhere to oppose the Taliban.|$|R
50|$|Plans for a {{corridor}} {{stretching from the}} Chinese border to Pakistan's deep water ports on the Arabian Sea {{date back to the}} 1950s, and motivated construction of the Karakoram Highway beginning in 1959. Chinese interest in Pakistan's deep-water harbour at Gwadar had been rekindled by 1998 and in 2002 China began construction at Gwadar port which was completed in 2006. Expansion of Gwadar Port then ceased thereafter owing to political instability in Pakistan following the fall of General Pervez Musharraf and subsequent conflict between the <b>Pakistani</b> state and <b>Taliban</b> militants.|$|R
50|$|Director of National Intelligence and United States Navy Admiral, Dennis C. Blair, told U.S. {{senators}} {{that the}} Pakistani state and army meanwhile draw clear distinctions among different militant groups. While links {{exist between the}} <b>Pakistani</b> and Afghan <b>Taliban,</b> the two groups are distinct enough for the Pakistani military {{to be able to}} view them very differently. American officials said that the S Wing of the Pakistani ISI provided direct support to three major groups carrying out attacks in Afghanistan: the Afghan Taliban based in Quetta, Pakistan, commanded by Mullah Muhammad Omar; the militant network run by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar; and a different group run by the guerrilla leader Jalaluddin Haqqani, all considered a strategic asset by Pakistan in contrast to the TTP run by Hakimullah Mehsud, which has engaged the Pakistani army in combat.|$|R

5000|$|After the Soviet {{withdrawal}} from Afghanistan, the rivalry between Iran and Pakistan intensified. After 1989, both state's policies in Afghanistan {{became even more}} divergent as Pakistan, under Benazir Bhutto, explicitly supported Taliban forces in Afghanistan. This resulted in a major breach, with Iran becoming closer to India. Pakistan's support for the Sunni Taliban organisation in Afghanistan became a problem for Shia Iran which opposed a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The <b>Pakistani</b> backed <b>Taliban</b> fought the Iranian backed Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and gained control of 90 percent of that country. As noted by a Pakistani foreign service officer, {{it was difficult to}} maintain good relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Iran at the same time, given Iran's long history of rivalry with these states. In 1995 Bhutto paid a lengthy state visit to Iran, which greatly relaxed relations. At a public meeting she spoke highly of Iran and Iranian society. However, increasing activity by Shia militants in Pakistan strained relations further. This was followed by the Taliban's capture of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, in which thousands of Shias were massacred, according to Amnesty International. [...] The most serious breach in relations came in 1998, after Iran accused Taliban Afghanistan of taking 11 Iranian diplomats, 35 Iranian truck drivers and an Iranian journalist hostage, and later killing them all. Iran massed over 300,000 troops on the Afghan border and threatened to attack the Taliban government, which it had never recognized. This strained relations with Pakistan, as the Taliban were seen as Pakistan's key allies. In May 1998, Iran criticised Pakistan for its nuclear testing in the Chagai region, and held Pakistan accountable for global [...] "atomic proliferation". New Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif acknowledged his country's nuclear capability on 7 September 1997. Before making the announcement, Sharif directed a secret courier to Israel via Pakistan Ambassador to United Nations Inam-ul-Haq and Pakistan Ambassador to the United States Dr. Maliha Lodhi, in which Pakistan gave utmost assurance to Israel that Pakistan would not transfer any aspects of its nuclear technology or materials to Iran.|$|R
2500|$|According to UNESCO Director-General Koïchiro Matsuura, {{a meeting}} of ambassadors from the 54 member states of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) was conducted. All OIC states—including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, three {{countries}} that officially recognised the Taliban government—joined the protest to spare the monuments. Saudi Arabia and the UAE later condemned the destruction as [...] "savage". Although India never recognised the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, New Delhi offered to arrange for the transfer of all the artifacts in question to India, [...] "where they would be kept safely and preserved for all mankind". These overtures were rejected by the <b>Taliban.</b> <b>Pakistani</b> president Pervez Musharraf sent Moinuddin Haider to Kabul {{to try to prevent}} the destruction, by arguing that it was un-Islamic and unprecedented. According to Taliban minister, Abdul Salam Zaeef, UNESCO sent the Taliban government 36 letters objecting to the proposed destruction. He asserted that the Chinese, Japanese, and Sri Lankan delegates were the most strident advocates for preserving the Buddhas. The Japanese in particular proposed a variety of different solutions to the issue, these included moving the statues to Japan, covering the statues from view, and the payment of money. The second edition of the Turkistan Islamic Party's magazine Islamic Turkistan contained an article on Buddhism, and described the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan despite attempts by the Japanese government of [...] "infidels" [...] to preserve the remains of the statues.|$|R
40|$|The use of American {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVS), aka, drones, {{to attack}} targets in Pakistan {{has become a}} source of great controversy in Pakistan. There have been public protests against the drones, the Pakistani parliament has debated the issue and is trying to curtail the use of drones by the United States against targets in Pakistan. The Pakistani government has even forced the US to close an airbase that has been used to launch drone attacks against Pakistani targets. As the United States and Pakistan continue to engage in the process of “re-setting ” their relationship after the accidental killing of 24 Pakistani servicemen by US forces in November of 2011 and the raid that ended in Osama bin Laden’s killing in May 2011, the issue of drone strikes {{is at the center of}} that discussion. The drone strikes have become a very charged political issue in Pakistan and are of central concern to American policy-makers because of their importance to American strategy in the Afghanistan-Pakistan theater of operations. One of the major reasons why the drone strikes have become such a salient issue among so much of the Pakistani general public is that there is a large amount of media coverage of the drone issue. The killing of major Al Qaeda, <b>Pakistani</b> or Afghan <b>Taliban</b> figures gets regular coverage in the Pakistani print media (such as the newspapers Dawn in English and Jang in Urdu), as well as television and radio. But the collateral damage from drone strikes also gets major play in the Pakistani media outlets. Scenes of destroyed vehicles...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{operates}} as an umbrella organization for various Islamist militant groups in Pakistan. These extremist groups have frequently attacked Christians, {{who make up}} 2% of Pakistan's population. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, the perpetrator of the current attack and once a breakaway organisation that reunited in March 2015 have declared their intention to carry out more attacks in the future.|$|E

25|$|By December 2015, some 3,400 <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{and their}} allied fighters were {{killed during the}} first 18 months of the operation, {{according}} to the ISPR. By June 2016, a total of 3,500 militants were killed including 900 terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e-Islam, according to the Director General ISPR. 490 soldiers were also killed in the two-year operation. A kinetic military action was conducted and Shawal valley was cleared of militants.|$|E
25|$|Public opinion {{then turned}} decisively against the Taliban terrorists. This opinion was {{highlighted}} following {{the release of}} a video showing the flogging of a girl by the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>Taliban</b> in the Swat Valley. Similar events and terrorist attacks finally forced the Pakistan Army to launch a decisive attack against the Taliban occupying Swat Valley in April 2009, after having orders received from the political leadership. After heavy fighting, the Swat Valley was largely pacified by July 2009, although isolated pockets of Taliban remained in the area.|$|E
