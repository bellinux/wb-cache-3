5000|$|The Moors Valley Railway is a 7 inch {{narrow gauge}} {{passenger}} railway, in the Moors Valley Country Park at Ashley Heath, Dorset, England near Ringwood in Hampshire. [...] There are 17 steam engines and 2 diesel engines. The railway is fully signalled, with two signal boxes, {{one in a}} Great Western Railway style and one in a British Rail Southern Region style. [...] The latter box also contains a mini lever frame and <b>push</b> <b>button</b> <b>panel,</b> for {{the control of the}} Lakeside area. The railway was constructed at its present location in 1985/86 and opened to the public in July 1986, after the closure in 1985 of its predecessor at Tucktonia in nearby Christchurch, which had run since 1979.|$|E
40|$|Front desk {{customer}} service for queue management {{system is a}} system that help the customer to manage their business when they at the place that provide the {{customer service}}. There are many applications that have been develop base on the service provided by this system in electronic field nowadays such as thermal printer, LCD Touch Screen, <b>push</b> <b>button</b> <b>panel</b> option, high speed system structure without needing and external computer, special display and console design, monitoring system, moving message, and TV units can be adapted to the system, multiple ticket machine supported, WAN, LAN, internet supporting through TCP/IP and according to the customer needs, additional function are supported. The purpose of this project is to develop a Queue Management System model that can display a number display module, a queue module and a sound module. The system was controlled by PIC Microcontroller as a system controller. By using PIC 16 F 877, push button, decoder, latch, LED, seven segment, buzzer and voltage regulator circuit, the operational of this system were programmed using the PIC Basic programming language. As the result, the Queue Management System is operated as the expected operation and be able to achieve the objective of the project...|$|E

With the advancement in computer vision and computing technologies {{we can afford to}} develop a system for visually impaired people, which can give audio feedback of surrounding objects and context. This thesis explore object recognition method to assist visually impaired people. We proposed an object recognition algorithm, and an assistive system which is very useful for their safety, quality life and freedom from other person all the time. Consideration of Gabor-recursive neural network along with convolutional recursive neural network(CRNN) with less number of maps {{have been found to be}} very promising to achieve better accuracy with less time complexity as compare to CRNN, the extracted feature vector is used to train Softmax classifier which is then used to classify query image into one of the trained categories. Our color recognition algorithm is simple and fast, which is the desiderata of color recognition module, we are using HSI color space with observed threshold and random sampling. The second contribution of this thesis is to use above stated methods to assist visually impaired people, the proposed assistive system is ensemble of two modules (i) object and (ii) color recognition, it is implemented using multimedia processor equipped embedded board and OpenCV. Object recognition module recognize objects such as door, chair, stairs, mobile phone etc. and generate an audio feedback to the user. Color recognition module generates audio description about object color in front of the camera, it is useful in recognizing clothing colors, fruits color etc. The system modules and operation can be selected using an on demand <b>push</b> <b>button</b> <b>panel</b> which contains two push buttons. The object recognition algorithm is evaluated on on-line available dataset as well as on our dataset and compared with state of art methods...|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{describes}} an intelligent wiring system especially of one’s home. Modern Foxtrot System from TECO, JSC has been examined and done to work. In {{the first part}} of the thesis the highly diverse options of the intelligent home system are dealt with. The second part of the thesis treats the concept of Foxtrot System in greater detail. The objective is to describe the use of the control system as well as the advanced automation. The larger part of the diploma thesis deals with a sample laboratory Foxtrot system panel, its draft, functions and construction. The budget for the draft and the construction is created and based on the prices of Foxtrot System components. As for the planned integration of the laboratory panel in education, two laboratory manuals are developed and vary in their control functions. In the first manual Foxtrot System, Mosaic software and <b>push</b> <b>button</b> control <b>panel</b> are introduced to the user. The second one describes how to create a more complicated program that is used to control the system via the web interface computer or Smart phone and are also used buttons...|$|R

40|$|Procedures for {{charging}} porous space-charge electrets {{by means}} of a corona discharge or in direct contact were developed. The high surface potentials obtained are stable over time and temperature, e. g. up to around 250 C for porous PTFE. By means of charging in direct contact, a structuring of the electrical properties within the transducer area is possible. Electroluminescence was observed during charging of various porous polymer films. This finding proves micro-discharge phenomena inside the voids of the porous polymer films. Procedures for coating the outer surfaces of porous PTFE films with non-porous polymer layers (such as Teflon "r"e"g"i"s"t"e"r"e"d AF) were developed. As a result, the polymer surfaces could be contacted electrically. High piezoelectric activity was observed in porous PTFE films (with coated outer surfaces), in porous PP films, in specially prepared porous Teflon "r"e"g"i"s"t"e"r"e"d AF films as well as in various layer systems. By means of optimal charging procedures (e. g. in ambient gas atmospheres), the piezoelectric activity can be increased to yield very high transducer coefficients. In cooperation with the SMEs, the transducer materials were successfully integrated in microphones, headphones, in <b>push</b> <b>buttons</b> of control <b>panels,</b> in transducers for ultrasonic applications and in devices for blood-pressure determination.
