40|$|Summary: I. typographus is {{the most}} serious pest of spruce forests in Eurasia. Pheromone traps are usually used in forest {{protection}} against this pest. In this study, two types of pheromone dispensers (ECOLURE CLASSIC and ECOLURE MEGA) were compared in terms of its effi ciency in 2010. ECOLURE CLASSIC were capturing averagely more beetles in compare of all season dispense ECOLURE MEGA during all season. No statistic diff erence was recorded only during fi rst 10 days of the season. In the rest of season (next 123 days) the ECOLURE CLASSIC captured statistically more beetles then ECOLURE MEGA.

40|$|The vine {{mealybug}} (VMB), Planococcus ficus (Signoret), is {{an established}} vineyard pest in California along with almost all other wine grape growing regions. The {{influence of the}} pheromone, [S] lavandulyl senecioate, is expected to form a cost effective mating disruption system across commercial scale vineyard plantings. Proprietary pheromone puffer systems, standard pheromone dispensing cards and delta traps were all used to gather data on infestation level and VMB movement.

Pheromone puffer systems produced significant improvements over insecticide treatments alone with up to 50 % reduction in total damage to the harvested crop. Standard <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispenser</b> cards supported highly effective mating disruption with only 2 % of the total crop affected in any way when cards were deployed at 175 per acre.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of defensive techniques against the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) with a primary focus on pheromone traps and selected factors affecting their efficacy. The factors tested are the setup system of pheromone traps and type of <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispenser</b> baits, {{the effect on the}} efficacy of pheromone traps of increasing evaporated pheromones, a comparison of the biological efficacy of different types of pheromone dispensers and an assessment of their impact on the swarming curve. In addition, an evaluation of non-traditional methods of forest protection against the spruce bark beetle (water spraying of whole landings, efficacy of insecticidal sraying of whole landings, and the use of insecticidal nets) was conducted and the possibility of the spruce bark beetle s sex determination was also examined. When comparing the systems of pheromone traps installation, (1) the standard way was along the stand edge with 20 m space and (2) traps concentrating in the centre of clear cut adjacent to each other with different baiting, the most effective way was found to be the standard trap arrangement and the system with traps installed in line with the dispenser in each pheromone trap. Efficacy decreased with a lower number of pheromone dispensers. The influence of increased amounts of evaporated pheromone on efficacy was tested. Pheromone traps with one, two or three dispensers were compared and it was found that a trap s efficacy was not increased with a higher amount of released pheromone. The Pheagr IT and IT Ecolure Tubus dispensers showed unchanged effectivity throughout the flight activity of spruce bark beetle, but other dispensers need to be replaced according to the instructions since their efficacy decreases, thus affecting the swarming curve.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this paper was to prove that the effect of (-) alpha-pinene on the response of Ips typographus (L.) to its aggregation pheromone depends on the release rates of both pheromone and monoterpene volatiles. Six treatments have been tested in four experimental areas using six replicates for each treatment: V 1 – pheromone + (-) alpha-pinen 200 mg/day, V 2 – pheromone + (-) alpha-pinen 500 mg/day, V 3 – pheromone + (-) alpha-pinen 2000 mg/day, V 4 – pheromone, V 5 – control (blank) and V 6 – 1 / 3 <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispenser</b> with 1 / 3 of normal release rate. In all experimental areas, most captures have been recorded at V 4 (pheromone alone), while alpha-pinene at cca. 200 mg/day, 500 mg/day and 2000 mg/day caused the decrease of the captures by 13. 2 - 43. 9 %, 22 - 55. 2 % and 53. 1 - 70. 2 % respectively. The traps baited with pheromone dispensers which were conditioned to have a release rate equal to only 1 / 3 from the release rate of the commercial dispensers, caught insects representing about 1 / 3 of those recorded at the traps with normal dispensers. The results confirm the hypothesis that the response of Ips typographus beetles to the combination of synthetic pheromone with (-) -alpha-pinene depends on the concentration of volatile substances that are released around the source, respectively on the release rates of the pheromone and monoterpene. They also demonstrate, that at high release rates of the pheromone (cca. 30 mg/day), (-) alpha-pinene released at a rate of 200 - 2000 mg/day has an inhibitory effect, determining the decrease of the number of beetles that are caught in the pheromone traps...|$|E

Although mechanical dispersal techniques require specialized off-the-shelf application technology and/or equipment, once the application system is made to work it allows protection of extensive areas using pheromones, one of the most benign and effective pest management techniques available today.

40|$|Zbog učestalih problema s potkornjacima posljednjih godina u Hrvatskoj, postavlja se pitanje njihovog učinkovitog suzbijanja. U koncept integrirane zaštite šuma sve više se nastoji uvesti ekološki prihvatljive metode zaštite, kakve su primjerice feromonske klopke. U obavljenom istraživanju feromonski pripravak Curviwit®, deklariran kao feromon jelovog krivouzubog potkornjaka Pityokteines curvidens, testiran je u kombinaciji s klopkama Theysohn® i IPM®. Cilj ovog rada bio je dobiti spoznaje o mogućnostima primjene feromonske klopke za ulov jelovih potkornjaka. Rezultati ulova u klopkama ukazuju kako let proljetne generacije P. curvidens ovisi o kretanju srednje dnevne {{temperature}} koja mora postići 10 °C. Rojenje počinje početkom travnja, a glavni let i najveši ulov u klopkama dostignu se krajem travnja i početkom svibnja. Nakon najvećih ulova kukaca sljedi nagli pad, a ulovi nakon tog vrlo su niski i nakon ljetne zamjene feromona. Broj ulovljenih mužjaka u klopkama u početku rojenja višestruko je veći od ženki, ali se pri najvećim ulovima izjednačava na 1 : 1. Because {{of frequent}} {{problems with the}} bark beetle {{over the last few}} years in Croatia, the question of their effective control has been raised. Within the concept of integrated protection of the forests attempts to introduce ecologically acceptable methods of protection have increased, such as for example pheromone traps. In the published investigation the pheromone preparation Curviwit, declared as pheromone of the fir bark beetle Pityokteines curvidens, was tested in combination with Theysohn® and IPM® traps. The aim of this study was to obtain knowledge on the possibilities of applying pheromone traps to catch the fir bark beetle. The experiment was set up in several compartments at Litorić (Forestry Office "Vrbovsko", Forest Administration Branch Office "Delnice") for a period of two years (2004 - 2005). In both experimental years two types of traps were used: Theysohn® and IPM®, and in 2005 a modified version of Theysohn was added. In the experiment a <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispenser</b> was used in all traps under the name Curviwit® (Witasek, Feldkirchen, Austria) declared as pheromone of bark beetle P. curvidens, with active components methylbutenol and ipsenol (2 -methyl- 6 -methylen- 2, 7 -oktadien- 4 -ol) and with evaporation ("ratio rate") 1 mg/day at 24 °. In 2004 the <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispenser</b> was placed on 31 st March and replaced with a new one on 31 st June, and in 2005 placed on the 30 th March and replaced on 7 th June. The traps were controlled and emptied every 7 - 8 days. The bark beetles trapped were conserved in ethanol (50 %) and later analysed in the laboratory. Laboratory analysis included determination of the bark beetles according to species and sex. The results of the catch in the traps indicate that the flight of the spring generation of P. curvidens depends on the daily temperature, which must reach 10 °C. Swarming begins atthe beginning of April and the main flight and greatest catch in the traps is achieved at the end of April and beginning of May. After the greatest catch of insects there follows a sudden decrease and the catch is later very low after the change of pheromones in the summer. The number of male beetles caught in the traps at the beginning of swarming is several times greater than of the females, although during the greatest catches it becomes equal at 1 : 1. From the two-year investigation of pheromone traps for the fir bark beetle, the following conclusions can be made: 1. The traps for the fir bark beetle Pityokteines curvidens germar should be placed at the latest at the beginning of April, because the greatest catch can be expected at the end of April and beginning of May. 2. Of the tested traps in the experiment the best catches were achieved with the modified Theysohn trap. 3. After the sudden decrease in the catches at the end of April or beginning of May pheromone should be removed from the traps in order not to catch undesired insects, particularly useful or rare species. 4. The ratio of the sexes in the traps was initially 3 : 1, and later in the period of the greatest catch it amounted to 1 : 1, which corresponds with the natural ratio of sexes. 5. The investigation should be continued in accordance with the obtained results and comparison of the traps and relevant catch trees...|$|E
40|$|Lobesia botrana (Denis and Schiffermuller) (Lepidoptera:Tortricidae) is {{the most}} serious pest of grape {{cultivation}} in Greece. To help develop an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy for L. botrana, research on mating disruption was undertaken, with the following specific objectives: to evaluate the potential role of' mating disruption approaches for the control of L. botrana in commercial vineyards in Northern Greece using the Quant Lb-R <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispenser?</b> (at high and lowmedium pest population densities) and the ExoSex system (at high pest population densities); to evaluate whether these approaches could be integrated, to useful effect, with selective chemical control strategies and non-chemical control strategies, including Bacillus thuringiensis (Bf); to provide data {{that could be used in}} assembling a data package for the future registration of com. tllercial mating disruption products in Greece. The results revealed that the efficacy of mating disruption using Quant ~b-R dispensers differed with different pest densities. The method worked most effectively where the initial pest pressure was low-medium. However, in a commercial vineyard where the pest population was high, a combination of the mating disruption method, with the insect growth regulator; f 1 ufenoxuron, or Bt, was necessary to provide adequate pest control. The efficacy of the ExoSex method was examined at high pest population densities. The results revealed that treatment with ExoSex dispensers together with f 1 ufenoxuron, provided effective control and performed better than ExoSex alone or f 1 ufenoxuron alone. A survey of predatory mites, and an evaluation of the effects of crop protection practices on their populations were also carried out. Amongst the predatory mites of the family Phytoseiidae that were recorded on the experimental plots, Typhlodromus Perbibus Wainstein & Arutunjian was by far the most frequently-found species. The results of a field trial indicated that f 1 ufenoxuron w~s not directly toxic to T. perbibus at recommended rates. In contrast, the acaricide, propargite, had significantly adverse effects on T. perbibus numbers within 24 hours of application. A field experiment was also undertaken to evaluate the effect of vine cultivation practices (levels of nitrogen application; leaf and shoot pruning; growth regulators) on L. botrana incidence. There were highly significant differences recorded amongst the levels of nitrogen applied, amongst the types of pruning, and amongst the growth regulator treatments on L. botrana infestation levels. The contribution that cultural techniques could make to the management of L. botrana populations is discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The olive {{fruit fly}} Bactrocera oleae Gmelin, is the major pest of the olive {{cultivation}} in the Mediterranean area. The over-use of chemical insecticides for the control of this insect and the consequent damage {{to the environment and}} to the public health is a serious problem. Recently, considerable efforts have been paid worldwide, for the development of alternative control methods, which exploit biological factors (natural enemies, predators, bacteria, viruses, etc) or biochemical factors (hormones, pheromones etc), {{in order to keep the}} insect population under control. From all these methods the most promising results are obtained by the use of the insect’s own pheromone. The more widely used technique is the mass trapping, combining a <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispenser</b> and a food attractant on an entomotoxic surface. Although unsuccessfully several applications were made, of the sexual confusion technique, in which pheromone is diffused in the environment at quantities enough to make matting disruption. For the successful application of the above methods, a prerequisite is the ability to measure rapidly and accurately the amount of pheromone which is present in the dispensers, in the environment or in the insects. These analyses will allow to determine the exact amount of synthetic pheromone required, for a more efficient attraction to the traps (mass trapping) or to compete successfully the natural pheromone released by the insects (matting disruption). Until today pheromone levels have been determined by gas chromatography (GC), since the pheromones are volatile compounds of low molecular weight. The determinations are, however, time consuming and difficult to perform because: a) the sample collection and treatment is difficult, since the samples must be free of all the high molecular weight compounds that coexist with the pheromone and may contaminate the chromatography columns, b) every sample is measured separately and with different protocol, depending on its origin (environmental or biological sample), and c) every measurement takes at least 30 min and many repetitions are necessary in order to avoid random errors. The immunoassay methods, which are based on the use of specific antibodies, are the most appropriate techniques for analyzing large number of samples in the minimum time, with high sensitivity, precision and accuracy. Until today no insect pheromone immunoassay has been developed, because it is extremely difficult to raise specific antibodies against these low molecular weight compounds which have often unusual structure. The objective of the present work was to develop an immunoassay for the determination of the {{olive fruit fly}} pheromone in biological and environmental samples. The development of an immunoassay for this pheromone, which will guarantee high sensitivity and accuracy and in addition, provide the capability of analyzing many samples in short time, may be an invaluable tool for the successful application of alternative methods against this insect pest. Two synthetic derivatives of the olive fruit fly pheromone, the carboxy- derivative (+) -β-[3 -(1, 7 -dioxaspiro[5. 5]undecane] propionic acid (hapten I) and the amine- derivative (+) -δ-[3 -(1, 7 -dioxaspiro[5. 5]undecane] butylamine (hapten II) were used in the development of the pheromone ELISA. The hapten I was conjugated to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin, via the carbodiimide method, for the preparation of a suitable immunogen and was successfully used to raise polyclonal antibodies by immunization of rabbits as well as of laying hens, which is considered an advantageous alternative to the immunization of mammals. In this latter case, the corresponding immunoglobulins Y were isolated at large quantities from the egg yolk. In the case of immunized rabbits, the corresponding antisera were used. The hapten II, on the other hand, after conjugation to a biotin moiety was used for indirect immobilization onto ELISA microwells which had been pre-coated with the glycoprotein avidin. The immunoassay developed was a competitive biotin-avidin ELISA. According to the assay principle, the biotinylated pheromone (hapten II-biotin) is indirectly immobilized on ELISA microwells pre-coated with avidin. [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|Saddle gall midge, Haplodiplosis marginata (von Roser) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is a {{sporadic}} pest of cereals in Northern and Central Europe and is {{of increasing}} {{importance in the}} UK. Recently the major component of the sex pheromone produced by adult female H. marginata {{was reported to be}} 2 -nonyl butyrate. The importance of absolute configuration on attractiveness, the effects on trap catches of the addition of minor <b>pheromone</b> components, <b>dispenser</b> type, and <b>pheromone</b> loading are described in the development of an optimised pheromone lure with which to trap H. marginata males. In analyses of volatiles collected from virgin female H. marginata by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to electroantennographic recording (EAG) from the antenna of a male H. marginata, two EAG responses were observed. Analyses by coupled GC-mass spectrometry (MS) indicated these were due to 2 -nonyl butyrate and a trace amount (1 %) of 2 -heptyl butyrate. A similar trace amount of 2 -nonanol was detected in GC-MS analyses but this compound did not elicit an EAG response when the synthetic compound was tested, whereas while the other two compounds did. These three compounds were not observed in collections of volatiles made from male H. marginata. The 2 -nonyl butyrate was shown to be the (R) -enantiomer, and i. In field trapping tests (R) - 2 -nonyl butyrate was at least ten times 10 × more attractive to male H. marginata than the racemic compound, and while the (S) -enantiomer was unattractive. Addition of the potential minor components individually or together at the naturally -occurring ratios did not increase or reduce the attractiveness of the lure. Polyethylene vials and rubber septa were equally effective as <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispensers,</b> lasting for at least five 5 weeks in the field in the UK, although laboratory tests indicated release from the former was more uniform and more likely to last longer in the field.

In the reference, conventionally treated orchard, 12 - 15 insecticide treatments were applied to control codling moth, leaf miners, leaf rollers, aphids and mites: 10 - 12 of them were aimed at control of CM. In spite of that, the fruit damage reached there 2. 3 and 2. 6 % in successive years. Percentage of damage in plots treated with Ecodian was 0. 5 and 0. 7 %, i. e. below the economical threshold; no outbreak of the pest appearance was noted. So, the MD method, with use of the Ecodian CP dispensers, proved to be an effective means of control. The results obtained may open the possibilities of practical use of the method of mating disruption in Bulgaria. This method should favour preservation of the natural environment and enable production of healthy fruits, not polluted by chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that mating disruption (MD) successfully reduces population densities of stored product moths, for example, the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). However, practical issues, such as finding control plots, replication, and lack of similarity between replicates, often incur problems in full-scale investigations and often draw focus from the added results. We here present results from long-term monitoring of E. kuehniella populations in two similar flourmills in Poland, one treated with pheromone for MD and one left untreated and used as control. Pheromone-mediated MD was applied during 2 years. Thirty <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispensers</b> (one per 100 m(3) factory volume), each releasing about 2 mg (Z,E) - 9, 12 -tetradecadienyl acetate per day, were used. Pheromone-baited traps were used to monitor the moth populations in the MD mill and in a nearby untreated mill. The reduction in trap catch during the MD treatment was about 90 % or more, compared with the untreated mill or pre-treatment periods of the MD mill. The reduction was larger during the 2 nd year of MD than during the 1 st year. These results contribute to the picture that MD is an effective method to control moth species infesting stored products...|$|R

During {{the early stages}} of invasions, eradication is desirable but tactics are lacking that are both effective and have minimal non-target effects. Mating disruption, which may meet these criteria, was initially chosen to respond to the incursion of light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (LBAM; Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), in California. The large size and limited accessibility of the infested area favored aerial application. Moth sex pheromone formulations for potential use in California or elsewhere were tested in a pine forest in New Zealand where LBAM is abundant. Formulations were applied by helicopter at a target rate of 40 g pheromone per ha. Trap catch before and after application was used to assess the efficacy and longevity of formulations, in comparison with plots treated with ground-applied <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispensers</b> and untreated control plots. Traps placed at different heights showed LBAM was abundant in the upper canopy of tall trees, which complicates control attempts. A wax formulation and polyethylene dispensers were most effective and provided trap shut-down near ground level for 10 weeks. Only the wax formulation was effective in the upper canopy. As the pheromone blend contained a behavioral antagonist for LBAM, ‘false trail following...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of synthetic sex pheromones to disrupt mating of agricultural pests {{can be an}} effective and environmentally friendly alternative to pesticide applications. Optimizing mating disruption through examination of multiple interrelated variables may contribute to wider adoption in agriculture, especially in situations where pheromone synthesis is expensive. Simulations and field experiments designed to produce response surfaces by varying the distribution and number of <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispensers</b> suggested procedures whereby understanding optimization might be increased over that resulting from more common experiments focusing on one factor at a time. Monte Carlo simulations of a spatially explicit agent-based model resulted in nonlinear disruption profiles with increasing point source density. Field trials conducted in citrus infested by the leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella varied the amount of pheromone applied at each point source and point source density using attractive and non-attractive disruption blends. Trap catch disruption in the field resulted in nonlinear disruption profiles similar to those observed with simulations. Response surfaces showed an interaction between the amount of pheromone applied and the number of point sources for the attractive blend, but not for the non-attractive blend. Disruption surfaces were combined with cost curves to optimize trap catch disruption under real world cost constraints. The methods used here highlight the importance of experiment design for understanding the underlying biological dynamics governing mating disruption and optimizing its implementation...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} in Niger to compare pheromone-baited trapping systems for monitoring adults of the millet stem borer, Coniesta ignefusalis (Hampson), a pest of pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Brown. A water-oil trap was effective after optimization of various trap parameters. A trap tray of 32 -cm diameter was more effective and easier to handle than other sizes tested. Optimum trap shade size was 8 - 21 cm, positioned 2 - 5 cm above the tray. Motor oil, soap, or liquid detergent were more effective than vegetable oil as surfactants. The experimental trap caught significantly more male moths than four commercial traps. More moths were caught with large, thick polythene vial <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispensers</b> than small, thin vials, but the attractiveness of both declined significantly within 14 d. Trap catches were not greatly affected by {{the height of the}} crop or by the height of the trap above ground level when the traps were placed individually at different sites.

40|$|Abstract: Ips typographus is {{the main}} spruce pest of European forests. In most areas of the Italian Alps there are two generations per year; {{overwintering}} adults fly in May looking for trees suitable for breeding, their offspring emerge in summer, 7 – 8 weeks after tree colonization, and the adults of the second generation emerge in spring of the following year after overwintering under the bark or in the litter. A long-term population monitoring {{was carried out in}} north-east Italy with the aim at developing a prediction model able to estimate the population density of the following year. Between 1996 and 2004, pheromone traps monitored populations of I. typographus annually. Monitoring lasted 4 months (May–August), with replacement of <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispensers</b> after 8 weeks. Insects trapped before dispenser change were called spring captures (May–June), and included both overwintering and re-emerging adults. Beetles caught after dispenser change were called summer captures (July–August), and included the adults of the first generation. The results show a high positive correlation between the ratio of summer and spring captures of one year (Summerx/Springx), and the ratio of total captures of the following year (Yx+ 1) and those of the current year (Yx) (Yx+ 1 /Yx). Summerx/Springx lower than 0. 62 indicate decreasing populations in the following year (Yx+ 1 /Yx 1). The applicability of the model in the study of I. typographus risk of outbreak and in the forest management is discussed. The prediction of the short-time trend of the population allows assessing its density in the following year, and therefore the risk of outbreak...|$|R

In a paired design, trap catches for the mating-disruption treatment with synthetic <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispensers</b> consisting of three polyvinyl chloride rods placed in every tree were compared with the control treatment. Treatments were alternated at intervals of 2 - 3 d. Trap catches of D. amatella were reduced by 91 % when plots were treated with 2. 5 g/ha of Z-l 1 -hexadencenyl acetate. Catches were reduced by 99. 5 % for D. disclusa and by 97 % for D. merkeli when plots were treated with 12. 5 g/ha of Z- 9 -tetradecenyl acetate, whereas catches of D. amatella were unaffected by this mating-disruption treatment. Daily disappearance of Z- 9 tetradecenyl acetate from the dispensers averaged 0. 46 g/ha or less. Manually placing dispensers on nylon lines in the tops of trees was an effective method for releasing synthetic Dioryctria pheromones in the orchard. These data suggest it may be feasible to prevent mating of Dioryctria spp. in pine seed orchards by using synthetic pheromones for mating disruption, but large-scale tests will be required to demonstrate cone protection. ...|$|R
40|$|Wind-felled Norway spruce trees {{left for}} {{conservation}} purposes and spruce stems stored as forest fuel may be colonised by the bark beetles Ips typographus and Pityogenes chalcographus (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). The risk of nearby living trees being attacked {{and killed by}} these species was experimentally investigated at stand edges bordering fresh clearcuts. Attack by I. typographus was studied at edges of mature spruce with one, five or no cut trees. Attack by P. chalcographus was studied within plots on edges of young spruce. The plots contained piles of cut young trees, or no piles. Number of trees killed by I. typographus did not differ between edges with and without cut trees, or between edges with one and five cut trees. Tree-killing was more frequent close (< 20 m) to felled trees than elsewhere on the edges, suggesting that felled trees provide focal points for attacks within edges. The piles increased the risk of P. chalcographus attack, but almost no attacked tree was killed. Attacks were associated with pile colonisation, whereas emergence by the new generation beetles did not {{increase the risk of}} attack. Previous studies have shown a high reproductive success of I. typographus in felled trees after storms and a low success in standing trees killed during outbreaks. Here, the success was compared in pairs of colonised cut trees and standing killed trees at a time with no outbreak and relatively few felled trees available in the landscape. The success in killed standing trees was (a) significantly higher than in cut trees, and (b) high enough to suggest that killed standing trees can contribute substantially to the area-wide production of beetles. The ability of P. chalcographus to kill trees and reproduce in them has previously been little studied. Here, attacks on living trees were induced by baiting trees with <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispensers.</b> The tree-killing ability was low.

In addition, the effect of individual plant volatiles on male responses was investigated by adding to the suboptimal pheromone dose each of the four-compound plant-volatile blends, resulting from eliminating one volatile from the 5 VB at a time, or each plant volatile alone. Flight behaviour and the time to reach the source were recorded. The 5 VB alone was not attractive to G. molesta males, but at a ratio of 1 : 1 000 (Ph: 5 VB) or higher, the attractiveness of the suboptimal pheromone dose increased, to a level {{similar to that of the}} optimal pheromone dose (10 ng). All tested plant volatiles, except BZA, synergized the response to the pheromone when added individually, but only (Z) - 3 -hexenol and BZN did so to a level not significantly different from the Ph: 5 VB blend. Aromatics had a stronger effect than green leaf volatiles (GLVs), because their removal, but not the removal of GLVs, decreased landing responses. The addition of the 5 VB decreased significantly the time males needed to reach the odour source. The observed enhanced male attraction to mixtures of pheromone and plant volatiles will facilitate the development of lures for G. molesta adult flight monitoring...|$|R

40|$|The Guatemalan potato moth, Tecia (Scrobipalpopsis) solanivora, is {{a serious}} potato pest in Central America and {{adjacent}} South American countries. Recently, it has been introduced to the Canary Islands, Spain. Insecticide treatments are not sufficiently effective against eggs and larvae of Guatemalan potato moth, which are protected from sprays in soil crevices and in galleries inside potato tubers, respectively. Deregulation of insecticides and restrictions {{in the use of}} the few available insecticides, parallel to a public demand for reduction of pesticide use in potato production, have increased the interest in biological control techniques. Behaviour-modifying chemicals, including sex pheromones, which target the adult life stage, are a particularly promising alternative to insecticides for control of Guatemalan potato moth. The aim of this study was to study T. solanivora sex pheromone and to investigate the feasibility of pheromone-mediated mating disruption as environmentally safe control technique. Chemical analysis of female pheromone gland extracts confirmed two previously identified compounds (E) - 3 -dodecenyl acetate (E 3 - 12 Ac) and (Z) - 3 -dodecenyl acetate (Z 3 - 12 Ac), plus an additional, saturated compound, dodecyl acetate (12 Ac). These three compounds elicited significant male antennal responses by GC-EAD. Field trapping studies showed that a 100 : 1 : 20 -blend of these compounds formulated at 1000 μg on rubber septa, captured more males than the main compound alone. This trap lure can accordingly be used in field traps for detection and population monitoring. During two years, potato fields were treated with a 100 : 56 : 100 -blend of the three pheromone compounds formulated in polyethylene tube dispensers. Male attraction to E 3 - 12 Ac and Z 3 - 12 Ac is optimal at a 100 : 1 blend ratio, and only few males were attracted to traps baited with a 100 : 50 -blend. Mating disruption <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispensers,</b> containing these two compounds in a 100 : 56 ratio, did not attract males in the wind tunnel or in the field. The application rate of the 100 : 56 : 100 -blend of the three pheromone compounds was 28 g/ha in the first, and 86 g/ha in the second year. In both years, T. solanivora male attraction to synthetic pheromone traps were almost completely suppressed, indicating that sexual communication was disrupted. During the second year, additional tests confirmed that the pheromone treatment prevented mate-finding and mating. Attraction to traps baited with live calling females was reduced by 89 % in the pheromone treatment, during two months. In addition, matings in small field cages were significantly reduced. Visual observations showed that few males were observed in the pheromone-treated, as compared to the control field. At harvest, potato infestation was significantly lower in the treated field, as compared to control. Future studies will aim at the optimization of dispenser formulation, and area-wide implementation of the mating disruption technique for control of Guatemalan potato moth...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{invasive}} species in their introduced range is often influenced by interactions with resident species communities. Chemical communication is one the factors which {{contributes to a}} variety of aspects of a species life cycle, ranging from mating, to food localization and interactions with members of the same and other species. In my thesis, I investigate the effects of venoms and semiochemicals on interactions between the invasive Argentine ant (Linepethima humile) with other resident ant species and demonstrate how pheromones can potentially be utilized as an area wide control mechanism of this species, by disrupting their foraging success. I studied the effects of venom composition, their toxicity and utilization on the outcome of aggressive interactions between the Argentine ant and the four Monomorium species in New Zealand occurring. The toxicity of the venom of the two species co-occurring with Argentine ants was significantly higher than the toxicity of the species which do not. However, no correlation between venom toxicity and Monomorium survival was found. For M. antipodum a significant relationship between venom utilization and its mortality was found, indicating that the way venom is used might be an important aspect of these interactions. Physical Aggression between Monomorium and Argentine ants also had strong effects on Monomorium worker mortality, which provided evidence that a variety of factors and strategies contribute to the ability of interacting organisms to withstand the pressure of a dominant invader at high abundance. I conducted bioassays with food sources and synthetic trail pheromones, providing a proof of concept on disrupting the foraging ability of Argentine ants. Other resident species benefited from the reduced success of Argentine ants, but to a varying degree. Behavioural variations between the resident species provided an explanation for observed differences in foraging success and how much each of these individual competitors was able to increase their foraging. The mechanism for the observed increase in resource acquisition of resident species appeared to be a decrease in aggressive behaviour displayed by Argentine ants. I expanded the usage of the synthetic pheromone to a commercial vineyard, were Argentine ants can have negative effects on crop development by dispersing and tending to homopteran pest species. Argentine ants’ access to the crop canopy could be significantly reduced by placing <b>pheromone</b> <b>dispensers</b> {{at the base of the}} vine plant, while dispensers in the plant canopy had little effect on Argentine ant numbers. Doubling the amount of pheromone did not result in an additional reduction of ant activity. Lastly incorporating the knowledge gained in the previous chapter, I extended the application of the pheromone to a large field trial over a three month period. Argentine ant activity and foraging success was significantly supressed compared to untreated control plots, providing evidence that this form of large scale application might be a possible way to control large invasive ant populations by disrupting their trail following and foraging behaviour for a prolonged period of time. While initial calculations have suggested that the treatment is currently not feasible (13. 3 US$/mg/ha), I found a significant reduction in body fat in workers collected from treated plots compared with untreated plots, suggesting adverse effects on nest fitness. My findings provide new insights into chemical communication between invasive and resident species, support existing dominance hierarchy models in ant populations, and help to establish a target specific potential management technique of wide-spread invasive ant species...|$|R
