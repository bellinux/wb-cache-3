50|$|The plasma would cool to 14,000 °C as it traversed the 25 m {{distance}} to the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and then reheat to 67,000 °C as, at about 300 microseconds, it hits the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and is recompressed. This temperature emits ultraviolet light, which is poorly transmitted through most plasmas. This helps keep the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> cool. The cigar shaped distribution profile and low density of the plasma reduces the instantaneous shock to the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bombs {{had to be}} {{launched}} behind the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> with enough velocity to explode 20-30 meters beyond it every 1.1 seconds. Numerous proposals were investigated, from multiple guns poking {{over the edge of}} the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> to rocket propelled bombs launched from roller coaster tracks, however the final reference design used a simple gas gun to shoot the devices through a hole in the center of the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{potential}} {{problem with the}} <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> is that of spalling—shards of metal—potentially flying {{off the top of}} the plate. The shockwave from the impacting plasma on the bottom of the plate passes through the plate and reaches the top surface. At that point spalling may occur damaging the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate.</b> For that reason alternative substances, plywood and fiberglass, were investigated for the surface layer of the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and thought to be acceptable.|$|R

A {{crossover}} study compared conventional surfaces for a toilet seat, tap handles and a ward entrance door <b>push</b> <b>plate</b> with Cu containing items (Casey et al., 2010). The study showed reduced (> 90 %) bacterial counts on the items containing Cu and no indicator pathogens (e.g. VRE) were isolated during the 5  week study period on the copper whereas they were detected on control surfaces. A further longer study in an {{intensive care unit}} showed a sustained reduction of 83 % in microbial surface counts on six commonly touched Cu containing surfaces and numbers on control surfaces were also reduced (Schmidt et al., 2012). This {{was accompanied by a}} reduction in the rates of infection on the unit (Salgado et al., 2013). Recolonisation of Cu surfaces following cleaning {{has been shown to be}} delayed compared to control surfaces (Mikolay et al., 2010). However, Cu surfaces may become conditioned allowing colonisation following cleaning (Airey and Verran, 2007) possibly by retention and survival of organisms in surface scratches (Verran et al., 2010).|$|E
50|$|True {{engineering}} {{tests of}} the vehicle systems {{were thought to be}} impossible because several thousand nuclear explosions could not be performed in any one place. Experiments were designed to test <b>pusher</b> <b>plates</b> in nuclear fireballs and long-term tests of <b>pusher</b> <b>plates</b> could occur in space. Several of these tests almost flew. The shock-absorber designs could be tested at full-scale on Earth using chemical explosives.|$|R

They claimed that additional impurities enter the liquid housing due to additional particles tumbling in each stage. The problem can be overcome by using a shorter inner basket with smaller diameter between the <b>pusher</b> <b>plates</b> and the basket and enabling pusher movement to take place between the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and the basket {{as well as between}} the inner basket and the outer basket. Compared to single-stage pushers that have pusher movement only between <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and basket, multistage centrifuges have the advantages that the cake height is reduced, filtration resistance is lower and lesser force is required.|$|R
50|$|To {{estimate}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of what could be done using contemporary technology (in 1968), Dyson considered two starship designs. The more conservative energy limited <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> design simply had to absorb all the thermal energy of each impinging explosion (4×1015 joules, half of which would be absorbed by the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate)</b> without melting. Dyson estimated that if the exposed surface consisted of copper with a thickness of 1 mm, then the diameter and mass of the hemispherical <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> would have to be 20 kilometers and 5 million metric tons, respectively. 100 seconds would be required to allow the copper to radiatively cool before the next explosion. It would then take on the order of 1000 years for the energy-limited heat sink Orion design to reach Alpha Centauri.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{scheme was}} developed for base-mounted solid-propellant retro rocket motors to self-penetrate the Orion Crew Module heat shield for configurations with the heat shield retained during landings on Earth. In this system the motors propel impactors into structural push plates, which in turn push through the heat shield ablator material. The push plates are sized such that the remaining port in the ablator material {{is large enough to}} provide adequate flow area for the motor exhaust plume. The <b>push</b> <b>plate</b> thickness is sized to assure structural integrity behind the ablative thermal protection material. The concept feasibility was demonstrated and the performance was characterized using a gas gun to launch representative impactors into heat shield targets with push plates. The tests were conducted using targets equipped with Fiberform(R) and PICA as the heat shield ablator material layer. The PICA penetration event times were estimated to be under 30 ms from the start of motor ignition. The mass of the system (not including motors) was estimated to be less than 2. 3 kg (5 lbs) per motor. The configuration and demonstrations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether microbial contamination of door handles in two busy intensive care units and one high dependency unit {{was related to}} their design, location, and usage. Design: Observational study {{of the number of}} viable bacteria on existing door handles of different design at defined entry/ exit points with simultaneous data collection of who used these doors and how often. Setting: Two busy specialised intensive care units and one high dependency unit in a tertiary referral NHS neurological hospital. Main outcome measures: Surface bacterial density on door handles with reference to design, location, and intensity of use. Results: We found a significant correlation between the frequency of movements through a door {{and the degree to which}} it was contaminated (p =, 0. 01). We further found that the door’s location, design and mode of use all influenced contamination. When compared to <b>push</b> <b>plate</b> designs, pull handles revealed on average a five fold higher level of contamination; lever handles, however, displayed the highest levels of bacterial contamination when adjusted for frequency of use.

40|$|The {{environment}} may {{act as a}} reservoir for pathogens that cause healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). Approaches to reducing environmental microbial contamination in addition to cleaning are thus worthy of consideration. Copper is well recognised as having antimicrobial activity but this property has not been applied to the clinical setting. We explored its use in a novel cross-over study on an acute medical ward. A toilet seat, set of tap handles and a ward entrance door <b>push</b> <b>plate</b> each containing copper were sampled {{for the presence of}} micro-organisms and compared to equivalent standard, non-copper-containing items on the same ward. Items were sampled once weekly for 10 weeks at 07 : 00 and 17 : 00. After five weeks, the copper-containing and non-copper-containing items were interchanged. The total aerobic microbial counts per cm 2 including the presence of ‘indicator micro-organisms’ were determined. Median numbers of microorganisms harboured by the copper-containing items were between 90 % and 100 % lower than their control equivalents at both 07 : 00 and 17 : 00. This reached statistical significance for each item with one exception. Based on the median total aerobic cfu counts from the study period, five out of ten control sample points and zero out of ten copper points failed proposed benchmark values of a total aerobic count of < 5 cfu/cm 2. All indicator micro-organisms were only isolated from control items {{with the exception of one}} item during one week. The use of copper-containing materials for surfaces in the hospital {{environment may}} therefore be a valuable adjunct for the prevention of HCAIs and requires further evaluation...|$|E
50|$|From 1957 to 1964 this {{information}} was used to design a spacecraft propulsion system called Orion, in which nuclear explosives would be thrown behind a pusher-plate mounted {{on the bottom of}} a spacecraft and exploded.

50|$|One {{issue that}} {{remained}} unresolved {{at the conclusion}} of the project was whether or not the turbulence created by the combination of the propellant and ablated <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> would dramatically increase the total ablation of the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate.</b> According to Freeman Dyson in the 1960s they would have had to actually perform a test with a real nuclear explosive to determine this; with modern simulation technology this could be determined fairly accurately without such empirical investigation.|$|R

Door handles in busy, "real life" high acuity clinical environments were variably contaminated with bacteria, and the number of bacteria found related to design, location, mode and frequency of operation. Largely ignored issues of handle and environmental design can support or undermine strategies designed to limit avoidable pathogen transmission, especially in locations designed to define "thresholds" and impose physical barriers to pathogen transmission between clinical areas. Developing a multidisciplinary approach beyond traditional boundaries for purposes of infection control may release hitherto unappreciated options and beneficial outcomes for the control of at least some hospital acquired infections...|$|E

40|$|This study {{offers a}} method applied in {{injection}} mould with automatic thread demoulding by using servo {{control and the}} combination of mechanical structures. In injection moulding, using hydraulic motor to drive gears and cores with thread for automatically taking plastic-injected parts with thread off from the cores is a common method for thread demoulding. The thread demoulding is completed by two movements. One of them is realized by {{the rotation of the}} threaded cores driven by hydraulic motor; the other is to stop the injected plastic part from turning and meanwhile push it out by a <b>pushing</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>pushing</b> <b>plate</b> is usually driven by springs which give forces that vary with the distance the plate travels. Because of this, the displacement of the <b>pushing</b> <b>plate</b> might be different from that of displacement of the core thread goes along the core axis. Thus the parts moulded may be damaged at the thread area on the part when the automatic thread demoulding is proceeding. This technique needs much to be improved hereon in injection moulding. In this study, the author brings up a solution that the hydraulic motor is replaced by a step motor and the <b>pushing</b> <b>plate</b> is driven by a servo motor. And there is a programmable logic controller to synchronize the two movements driven by the motors. Through the improvement the mechanism is substantially enhanced compared with the spring-driven pushing demoulding system...|$|R
50|$|Exposure to {{repeated}} nuclear blasts raises {{the problem of}} ablation (erosion) of the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate.</b> Calculations and experiments indicated that a steel <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> would ablate less than 1 mm, if unprotected. If sprayed with an oil it would not ablate at all (this was discovered by accident; a test plate had oily fingerprints on it and the fingerprints suffered no ablation). The absorption spectra of carbon and hydrogen minimize heating. The design temperature of the shockwave, 67,000 °C, emits ultraviolet light. Most materials and elements are opaque to ultraviolet especially at the 340 MPa pressures the plate experiences. This prevents the plate from melting or ablating.|$|R
