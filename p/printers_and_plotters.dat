40|$|The {{utilization}} {{and application}} of a desk-top micro-computer based system is described for data acquisition and control/or use in the velocity measurements in open channel flow. The technique of mea-suring point velocities along three axes simultaneously is approached in two phases: Firstly, recording of the velocity data, and secondly reproducing the velocity data. The system involves utilization of voltage data recorder which can translate the flow velocities obtained by sensor probes picking up the acoustic interference. A data acquisition control unit, a desk-top computer and peripheral equipments which con-sist of distribution channels, <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>plotter</b> terminals provide the necessary interpretation of the flow behaviour. When fluid flow through a curved open channel, {{there will be a}} steady redistribution of the velocities due to the interaction of the frictional, centrifugal and inertial forces. Secondary currents both in the lateral and vertical directions are pronounced than their existence in the straight channels, thus affecting the magnitude and direction of longstream velocities.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] current development of the rapid prototyping industry in South Africa is characterised by the strong dominance and fast growth in sales of three dimensional printers. Although it reflects the international trend, {{it seems that the}} industrial community lacks a clear appreciation of the real strength of this technology, especially with respect to the large variety of devices available today on the market. This paper surveys the current state and capabilities of three dimensional printing (3 DP). Based on its technical background – the ink-jet printing known from the <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>plotter</b> industry – a classification structure is developed and proposed. Different printing techniques and process concepts, together with their advantages and limitations, are described and analysed. Typical examples from three completely different application areas – manufacturing, medicine, and architecture – are presented and discussed. Some basic considerations for an informed selection of the right technology for a particular application are then presented. Publisher's versio...|$|R

5000|$|The {{microfilm}} printer was originally {{developed for the}} Social Security Administration to handle its large volume of microfilm data. In 1959, Stromberg-Carlson introduced the SC4020, a computer-controlled microfilm <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>plotter,</b> used chiefly for COM (Computer Output Microfilm) applications. The SC4020 utilized a Charactron cathode-ray-tube (CRT) with an internal mask (or stencil) through which the electron beam was deflected to choose an alphanumeric character, and the character-shaped beam was then deflected to a target position on the faceplate of the CRT. A 35 mm or 16 mm shutterless camera, in a lightproof enclosed cabinet along with the CRT, captured the imagery produced on the faceplate. The film was then developed chemically, separate from the SC4020, and could be later enlarged onto paper. The instructions to control the SC4020 were created by a mainframe computer and transferred to the SC4020 on magnetic tape. A “quick-look,” separate from the SC4020, was available using zinc oxide photosensitized paper.|$|R

40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} for locating lightning strikes by developing the coordinates {{of a pair}} of lines, each of which is produced at a reference sensing station. At each station there are a pair of directional antennas which produce analog signals responsive to a lightning stroke.

The analog signals are also fed through a square rooter, a Schmitt trigger circuit, and flip-flops to produce pulses for starting and stopping the integrators. The system at the remote station is similar to that at the central station and is tied to the circuitry at the central station through logic circuits to minimize the chance of error from spurious signals.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{production of}} interpretive soil maps, computer software {{has been developed}} to interface soil boundaries with soil property data. Three Huntington County, Pennsylvania, Soil Survey maps, covering a total of 115 sq. km. at a scale of 1 : 20, 000, were used as a test area. Soil boundaries and mapping unit centroids were digitized using a Tektronix 4954 graphics tablet. Mapping unit symbols were then appended to the centroid data and interfaced with soil property and other data supplied by the Soil Conservation Service. Software was written for line segment cleaning, polygon processing, and final graphic display. A polygon processing program was written to determine {{the left and right}} soil mapping unit for each line segment. This program can also produce area definition files for use with the SYMAP line <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> CALFORM <b>plotter</b> mapping programs.

40|$|FAULT is a {{software}} {{that allows the}} qualitative and quantitative analysis of fault systems, its graphical representation on video and its output on <b>printer,</b> <b>plotter</b> <b>and</b> diffuse standard graphical files. The structural analysis is based on three different methods that is i) the right dihedra method (Angelier & Mechler, 1977), ii) the Conditioned Square Minima Method (Caputo & Caputo, 1988) applied on the right dihedra method and iii) applied on the P/T axes method. For analytical details and {{a better understanding of}} the methodologies, their applicability and limits the reader is referred to the original papers. FAULT allows: - the input of fault systems and their management; - the computation of the areas based on the right dihedra methods; - the computation of the principal stress/strain axes based on the Conditioned Square Minima Method applied on the areas deriving from the right dihedra method; - the computation of the principal stress/strain axes based on the Conditioned Square Minima Method applied on the P/T axes method; - the output of the original data and the obtained results on several devices (video, <b>plotter</b> <b>and</b> <b>printer).</b> It is also possible to create files to send directly to the <b>plotter</b> <b>and,</b> furthermore, it is possible to create standard graphical files readable by most commercial software on the topic (AutoCAD, CorelDraw, FreeHand, PhotoShop and others).

40|$|IMAPS (Interactive Minicomputer Array Processing System) is {{a system}} of {{minicomputer}} software for processing large, two-dimensional arrays of gridded data such as those employed in the earth sciences, particularly remote sensing of the environment. IMAPS was designed to have wide applicability based on {{the flexibility of the}} software and its modest hardware requirements. Written in Fortran and operating in an interactive, single-user mode, the system provides a variety of array processing functions. These functions presently include routines for reading and calibrating LANDSAT and NOAA satellite data tapes, statistically summarizing array regions and transects, generating contrast-enhanced images via line <b>printer</b> or electrostatic <b>plotter,</b> <b>and</b> converting data from contoured to gridded format. Users having specialized needs can add their own functions to the system; this can be done without increasing core requirements inasmuch as each function is organized as a separate overlay. The design of new functions is facilitated by the availability of a library of utility subroutines, which perform tasks commonly required in array processing, such as buffering array data to and from disc. The data buffering subroutines are quite flexible, allowing variable array size, processing of from 2 to 10 arrays in parallel, and sequential or random access to individual array elements. IMAPS is currently implemented on Coastal Studies Institute 2 ̆ 7 s Nova 1220 minicomputer in support of programs in deltaic sedimentation and remote sensing of coastal waters. The basic system requires a 16 -bit minicomputer with 32 K words of core memory, console, and disc; optional devices include magnetic tape, line <b>printer,</b> digitizer, <b>and</b> electrostatic <b>plotter...</b>|$|R
