The opinion of Indians in their own affairs was not considered by Britain as important. However, in due course the British Raj began to allow Indians <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>local</b> <b>government.</b> Viceroy Ripon passed a resolution in 1882, which gave a greater and more real share in local government to the people. Further legislation such as the 1892 Indian councils Act and the 1909 [...] "Minto-Morley Reforms" [...] {{eventually led to the}} establishment of the Madras Legislative Council. The non-cooperation movement started under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership led the British government to pass the Government of India Act (also known as Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms) of 1919.

Both {{the director of the}} Institute of Central Asia at the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences and Chinese counter-terrorist expert Li Wei alluded to the influence of foreign terrorist organizations in the attack [...] without mentioning any specific country, which the Times of India claimed referred to Pakistan. However, the Chinese government, which has good relations with Pakistan, and the WUC, did not give any remarks on the alleged connection to terrorists based in Pakistan.

On September 14, the Xinjiang Legal Daily reported that six men were tried for their involvement in the Hotan and Kashgar attacks. Four were given death sentences, and two were given 19-year jail terms, for charges including [...] "leading and organizing a terror group, manufacturing illegal explosives, intentional homicide, [...] arson".
