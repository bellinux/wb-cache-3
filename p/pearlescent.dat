5|$|Music Touch was {{launched}} in January 2013 in France. Created through a partnership with Samsung and Universal Music Group, the C3 Picasso Music Touch comes with a free white Samsung Galaxy Tab 16 GB. The obvious styling differences are the additional chrome trims and mirror covers, and white <b>pearlescent</b> paint. The Music Touch special series was also added to the C4 Picasso, C4 Aircross and Berlingo Multispace vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive <b>pearlescent</b> finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.|$|E
25|$|Some {{grades of}} {{titanium}} based pigments {{as used in}} sparkly paints, plastics, finishes and <b>pearlescent</b> cosmetics are man-made pigments whose particles have two or more layers of various oxides – often titanium dioxide, iron oxide or alumina – {{in order to have}} glittering, iridescent and or <b>pearlescent</b> effects similar to crushed mica or guanine-based products. In addition to these effects a limited colour change is possible in certain formulations depending on how and at which angle the finished product is illuminated and the thickness of the oxide layer in the pigment particle; one or more colours appear by reflection while the other tones appear due to interference of the transparent titanium dioxide layers. In some products, the layer of titanium dioxide is grown in conjunction with iron oxide by calcination of titanium salts (sulfates, chlorates) around 800°C or other industrial deposition methods such as chemical vapour deposition on substrates such as mica platelets or even silicon dioxide crystal platelets of no more than 50µm in diameter.|$|E
25|$|The Audi V8 came {{standard}} with a {{range of}} features, including a BOSE audio system with eight speakers, walnut wood trim, leather interior, and heated seats.

25|$|In 1954, the Futura {{prototype}} {{was built}} entirely by hand by the Ghia Body Works in Turin, Italy, at a reported cost of US$250,000—the equivalent of approximately US$2 million in 2009. It {{made its debut}} in <b>pearlescent</b> Frost-Blue white paint on 8 January 1955 at the Chicago Auto Show. In 1959, sporting a fresh red paint job, the Futura was featured in the film It Started with a Kiss, starring Debbie Reynolds and Glenn Ford.|$|E

500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a <b>pearlescent</b> quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E

2500|$|P. aeruginosa {{is often}} preliminarily {{identified}} by its <b>pearlescent</b> appearance and grape-like or tortilla-like odor in vitro. Definitive clinical identification of P. aeruginosa often includes identifying {{the production of}} both pyocyanin and fluorescein, {{as well as its}} ability to grow at 42°C. P. aeruginosa is capable of growth in diesel and jet fuels, where it is known as a hydrocarbon-using microorganism, causing microbial corrosion. It creates dark, gellish mats sometimes improperly called [...] "algae" [...] because of their appearance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{endangered}} Mission blue has a wingspan around [...] [...] Larvae {{are extremely}} small and rarely seen. The males' top wing grades from ice {{blue in the}} center to deep sky blue (misregistered as turquoise/cyan to violet by most photographic equipment, the wing color carries no hint of green or purple, strictly capturing an enthralling spectrum of purest, clearest, richest, brightest blue) exhibiting a dazzling iridescent fluctuation in range under direct, full sunlight. Black margins on the upper wing sport [...] "long, white, hair-like scales". A constellation of jet-black dots (misregistered as dull gray by most photographic equipment) frames the extremities of the ventral surface, its pattern adroitly complimenting the wing shape thrown into spectacular relief against the shimmering silvery <b>pearlescent</b> background, with a fascinatingly muted hint of dark ice blue bleeding faintly up from the body and permeating the veins throughout for the palest, most delicate of emphases. Body shape, eyes, antennae, and appendages possess it of a uniquely exquisite poise. [...] The males' bodies are dark-blue/brown. [...] Females' upper wings are dark brown, but otherwise mirror males'.|$|E
2500|$|The 1991–92 [...] "Fantastic Faces" [...] {{edition of}} the mask used in Scream is made of thin, white rubber with {{blackened}} eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being portrayed by Ulrich and Lillard, the costume is mostly worn by stuntman Dane Farwell who gave the character many of its mannerisms including the ritualistic cleaning of the knife blade following a kill. In the first film, Craven wore the costume during the opening murder scene where the character is struck by a phone and by Ulrich only once during a finale scene where the character prepares to murder Randy. Despite Stu wearing the costume in the film, actor Lillard never actually wore the outfit. Scream 2 features a slightly redesigned version of the mask from the [...] "Fearsome Faces" [...] line, possessing slightly-altered eyes and an indented chin. Following Scream 2, the Ghostface mask {{became part of the}} [...] "Ghostface" [...] line of masks featuring several variations of the design including glow-in-the-dark models. The plain, white version of the Ghostface line mask is used in Scream 3 by Bridger. Another {{edition of the}} mask was developed, dubbed [...] "The Deluxe Edition Mask" [...] for use by Ghostface in Scream 4, again similar to the original Ghostface design but constructed of thicker rubber with a <b>pearlescent</b> finish.|$|E
