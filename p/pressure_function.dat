Core samples taken through the unsaturated zone allow for the acquisition of gravimetrically determined water content data {{as a function of}} elevation at 3  inch intervals. This dense spacing of data provides several measurements of the water content within the capillary fringe, which are utilized to determine capillary <b>pressure</b> <b>function</b> parameters via least-squares calibration. The water content data collected above the capil-lary fringe are used to calculate dimensionless flow as a function of elevation providing a snapshot characterization of flow through the unsaturated zone. The water content at a flow stagnation point provides an in situ estimate of specific yield. In situ determinations of capillary <b>pressure</b> <b>function</b> parameters utilizing this method, together with particle-size distributions, can provide a valuable supplement to data libraries of unsaturated zone hydraulic parameters.
