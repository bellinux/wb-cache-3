[...] For example, in most of the United States, the default priority is to yield to traffic from the right, but this is usually overridden by traffic control devices or other rules, like the boulevard rule. This rule holds that traffic entering a major road from a smaller road or alley must yield to the traffic of the busier road, but signs are often still posted. The boulevard rule can be compared with the above concept of a major and minor <b>road,</b> or the <b>priority</b> <b>roads</b> that may be found in countries that are parties to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} shows that {{repeated}} exposure to a road environment changes eye movement behaviour. In addition, repeated exposure may result in inadequate responses to unexpected changes in the road environment. Participants drove a low-cost simulator while their eye movements were recorded. With repeated exposure participants glances at traffic signs along the route were shorter while having a better recollection of the traffic signs along the route. At the last drive, the priority situation at an intersection was changed (a <b>priority</b> <b>road</b> was changed into a yield situation). Even though drivers glanced at the sign that indicated the new priority situation, they did not sufficiently process the information to show an adequate response. Only two out of 12 drivers showed any response, being a response only after crossing the <b>priority</b> <b>road</b> markings. The current finding that unexpected but relevant information may be missed by drivers is relevant for other monitoring tasks.
