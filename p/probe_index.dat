40|$|Background: With {{the advent}} of the GeneChip Exon Arrays, it is now {{possible}} to extract "exon-level" expression estimates, allowing for detection of alternative splicing events, one of the primary mechanisms of transcript diversity. In the context of 1) a complex trait use case and 2) a human cerebellum vs. heart comparison on previously validated data, we present a transcript-based statistical model and validation framework to allow detection of alternative exon usage (AEU) between different groups. To illustrate the approach, we detect and confirm differences in exon usage in the two of the most widely studied mouse genetic models (the C 57 BL/ 6 J and DBA/ 2 J inbred strains) and in a human dataset. Results: We developed a computational framework that consists of probe level annotation mapping and statistical modelling to detect putative AEU events, as well as visualization and alignment with known splice events. We show a dramatic improvement (~ 25 fold) in the ability to detect these events using the appropriate annotation and statistical model which is actually specified at the transcript level, as compared with the transcript cluster/gene level annotation used on the array. An additional component of this workflow is a <b>probe</b> <b>index</b> that allows ranking AEU candidates for validation and can aid in identification of false positives due to single nucleotide polymorphisms.

To achieve such per-flow QoS measurement, the authors proposed a new technique, called the CoMPACT Monitor, which is based on the change-of-measure framework in probability/measure theory and transforms actively obtained information by using passively monitored data. This technique enables us to concurrently measure one-way delay information about individual users, applications and organizations in detail in a lightweight manner. This paper presents the mathematical formulation for the CoMPACT Monitor and verifies that it works well under some weak conditions.

40|$|Abstract Recent studies {{investigating}} protease-activated receptor type 2 (PAR- 2) {{suggest an}} association between the receptor and periodontal inflammation. It is known that gingipain, a bacterial protease secreted by the important periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis can activate PAR- 2. Previous studies by our group found that PAR- 2 is overexpressed in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of patients with moderate chronic periodontitis (MP). The present study aimed at evaluating whether PAR- 2 expression is associated with chronic periodontitis severity. GCF samples and clinical parameters, including plaque and bleeding on <b>probing</b> <b>indices,</b> <b>probing</b> pocket depth and clinical attachment level, were collected from the control group (n = 19) at baseline, and from MP patients (n = 19) and severe chronic periodontitis (SP) (n = 19) patients before and 6 weeks after periodontal non-surgical treatment. PAR- 2 and gingipain messenger RNA (mRNA) in the GCF of 4 periodontal sites per patient were evaluated by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). PAR- 2 and gingipain expressions were greater in periodontitis patients than in control group patients. In addition, the SP group presented increased PAR- 2 and gingipain mRNA levels, compared with the MP group. Furthermore, periodontal treatment significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) PAR- 2 expression in patients with periodontitis. In conclusion, PAR- 2 is associated with chronic periodontitis severity and with gingipain levels in the periodontal pocket, thus suggesting that PAR- 2 expression in the GCF reflects the severity of destruction during periodontal infection...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{processing}} subgraph queries on a database that consists {{of a set of}} graphs. The answer to a subgraph query is the set of graphs in the database that are supergraphs of the query. In this article, we propose an efficient index, FG*-index, to solve this problem. The cost of processing a subgraph query using most existing indexes mainly consists of two parts, the <b>index</b> <b>probing</b> cost and the candidate verification cost. <b>Index</b> <b>probing</b> is to find the query in the index, or to find the graphs from which we can generate a candidate answer set for the query. Candidate verification is to test whether each graph in the candidate set is indeed a supergraph of the query. We design FG*-index to minimize these two costs as follows. FG*-index consists of three components: the FG-index, the feature-index, and the FAQ-index. First, the FG-index employs the concept of Frequent subGraph (FG) to allow the set of queries that are FGs to be answered without candidate verification. We call this set of queries FG-queries. We can enlarge the set of FG-queries so that more queries can be answered without candidate verification; however, a larger set of FG-queries implies a larger FG-index and hence the <b>index</b> <b>probing</b> cost also increases. We propose the feature-index to reduce the <b>index</b> <b>probing</b> cost. The feature-index uses features to filter false results that are matched in the FG-index, so that we ca...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Multihop {{wireless}} relays {{can extend}} {{the area of}} network connectivity instantly and efficiently. However, due to the spatial dependence of wireless link-quality, the deployment of relay nodes requires extensive, expensive measurement, and management efforts. This paper presents a mobile autonomous router system, (MARS) through which a relay router autonomously seeks and adjusts the best “reception ” position for itself and cooperatively forms a string-type relay network with other neighboring routers. Specifically, MARS 1) accurately characterizes spatial link-quality through a new measurement technique, 2) effectively probes/ optimizes node positioning via a spatial probing algorithm, and 3) maintains error-tolerant position information via an inexpensive positioning algorithm. MARS has been prototyped with both a commodity mobile robot and a wireless router with IEEE 802. 11 cards. Our experimental evaluation of both the MARS prototype and ns- 2 -based simulation show that MARS achieves an average of 95 percent accuracy in link-quality measurements, and reduces the measurement effort necessary for the optimization of a node’s location by two-thirds, compared to exhaustive spatial <b>probing.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Wireless relay networks, robot-based wireless router, wireless link-quality measurement, IEEE 802. 11 Ç...|$|R

Periodontal clinical examinations were performed, and the {{subjects were asked to}} complete a set of questionnaires measuring Type A personality, anxiety, depression, dental anxiety, hopelessness, emotional intelligence, stress, self-esteem, optimism and satisfaction with life. In a bivariate analysis, overweight individuals presented higher levels of smoking exposure, anxiety and depression and lower levels of optimism and satisfaction with life. They were mainly females, with a higher number of sites and teeth with probing depth (PD) > 6 mm and clinical attachment level (CAL) > 5 mm. Patients with a mean PD exceeding 3 mm and a bleeding on <b>probing</b> <b>index</b> of> 25 % presented higher values of dental anxiety and lower levels of self-esteem. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that dental anxiety was positively associated with the number of teeth with a PD of> 6 mm and with reasons for visiting a dentist, while satisfaction with life was associated with flossing frequency. We conclude that there is an association between several psychological determinants, periodontitis, and body mass index. (J Oral Sci 52...|$|R
40|$|Relationships between {{oral health}} status in {{children}} with disability and their mothers’ depressive symptoms Aim. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the relationships between oral health status {{in children with}} chronic medical conditions and their mothers’ depressive symptoms. Methods. Fifty-one children (25 male and 26 female, ranging from 2 to 18 years) affected by chronic systemic diseases followed at the Sant’Orsola-Malpighi Hospital in Bologna,,and, were referred with their mothers at the Dental Department of Bologna. Children were subclassified in 3 groups according to the ASA classification and orally examined for hygiene status, gingival condition and dental caries. The indexes used were O’Leary plaque Index (PI), bleeding on <b>probing</b> <b>index</b> (BOP), dmft/DMFT. Mothers were interviewed on knowledge about oral diseases prevention for their children and daily management (hygiene habits, sugared aliments consumption). Statistical analysis was performed through the use of linear regression. Results. The relationships between ASA and IP as well as between ASA and BOP are statistically significant (α = 0, 01). Seventy percent of patients and their relatives in ASA groups 3 and 4 never received information on oral health and prevention of oral diseases by paediatricians and/or dentists. The 53...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{periodontal}} health of the lower anterior teeth retained with the use of removable and fixed retainers. Fifty four cases receiving comprehensive orthodontic treatment in between 10 to 30 years were randomly selected and divided into 2 groups of 27 each. One group was given removable retainers and other was given fixed retainers. The periodontal status of the patients was accessed with bleeding on <b>probing</b> <b>index,</b> Plaque index and Calculus index. The mean plaque index in case of removable retainers at 1 st, 3 rd and 6 th month were 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 7 where as in case of fixed retainers that were 1. 8, 3. 0 and 4. 5. The mean dental calculus index in case of removable retainers at 1 st, 3 rd and 6 th month were 0. 0, 0. 1 and 0. 1 where as in case of fixed retainers that were 0. 1, 0. 9 and 1. 8. In conclusion, removable retainers are superior in oral hygiene maintenance, yet the use of fixed retainers cannot be denied. </p...|$|R
