25|$|A beta Stirling has {{a single}} <b>power</b> <b>piston</b> {{arranged}} within the same cylinder on the same shaft as a displacer piston. The displacer piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the <b>power</b> <b>piston.</b> When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the <b>power</b> <b>piston</b> the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the <b>power</b> <b>piston</b> is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E
25|$|The <b>power</b> <b>piston</b> {{is pushed}} {{outwards}} by the expanding gas thus doing work. Gravity plays {{no role in}} the cycle.|$|E
25|$|The beta {{configuration}} has {{a single}} cylinder with a hot end and a cold end, containing a <b>power</b> <b>piston</b> and a 'displacer' that drives the gas between the hot and cold ends. It is typically used with a rhombic drive to achieve the phase difference between the displacer and power pistons, {{but they can be}} joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.|$|E
25|$|The alpha {{configuration}} has two <b>power</b> <b>pistons,</b> {{one in a}} hot cylinder, one in a cold cylinder, and the gas {{is driven}} between the two by the pistons; it is typically in a V-formation with the pistons joined {{at the same point}} on a crankshaft.|$|R

25|$|A gamma Stirling {{is simply}} a beta Stirling in which the <b>power</b> <b>piston</b> is mounted in a {{separate}} cylinder alongside the displacer piston cylinder, but is still connected to the same flywheel. The gas in the two cylinders can flow freely between them and remains a single body. This configuration produces a lower compression ratio because {{of the volume of}} the connection between the two but is mechanically simpler and often used in multi-cylinder Stirling engines.|$|E
25|$|Thermoacoustic {{devices are}} very {{different}} from Stirling devices, although the individual path travelled by each working gas molecule does follow a real Stirling cycle. These devices include the thermoacoustic engine and thermoacoustic refrigerator. High-amplitude acoustic standing waves cause compression and expansion analogous to a Stirling <b>power</b> <b>piston,</b> while out-of-phase acoustic travelling waves cause displacement along a temperature gradient, analogous to a Stirling displacer piston. Thus a thermoacoustic device typically does not have a displacer, as found in a beta or gamma Stirling.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{follows the}} {{behaviour}} {{described by the}} gas laws, which describe how a gas's pressure, temperature and volume are related. When the gas is heated the pressure rises (because {{it is in a}} sealed chamber) and this pressure then acts on the <b>power</b> <b>piston</b> to produce a power stroke. When the gas is cooled the pressure drops and this drop means that less work needs to be done by the piston to compress the gas on the return stroke; the difference in work between the strokes yields a net positive power output.|$|E

There is also a cafe and maze at the entrance and exhibits such as steam <b>power</b> <b>pistons</b> can be seen, which were restored by Fred Dibnah. Many fairs are held in Glynllifon Park carpark, especially steam and craft fairs.|$|R
5000|$|These {{types of}} fuels {{typically}} use {{the regulation of}} gas production and flow to <b>power</b> <b>pistons</b> in an engine. The large increases in pressure are controlled and directed toward the engine's pistons. The pistons move due to the mechanical power transformed from the monitored production of gaseous fuel. A notable example {{can be seen in}} Peter Dearman's liquid air vehicle. Some common inert fuels include: ...|$|R
50|$|Increasing quality {{requirements}} made {{it necessary to}} increase the mold stability by applying steadily higher squeeze pressure and modern compaction methods for the sand in the flasks. In early fifties the high pressure molding was developed and applied in mechanical and later automatic flask lines. The first lines were using jolting and vibrations to pre-compact the sand in the flasks and compressed air <b>powered</b> <b>pistons</b> to compact the molds.|$|R
25|$|Very {{low-power}} engines {{have been}} built that run on a temperature difference of as little as 0.5 K. A displacer type stirling engine has one piston and one displacer. A temperature difference is required between {{the top and bottom}} of the large cylinder to run the engine. In the case of the low-temperature difference (LTD) stirling engine, the temperature difference between one's hand and the surrounding air can be enough to run the engine. The <b>power</b> <b>piston</b> in the displacer type stirling engine is tightly sealed and is controlled to move up and down as the gas inside expands. The displacer, on the other hand, is very loosely fitted so that air can move freely between the hot and cold sections of the engine as the piston moves up and down. The displacer moves up and down to control the heating and cooling of the gas in the engine.|$|E
2500|$|A hybrid between piston and rotary {{configuration}} is {{a double}} acting engine. This design rotates the displacers {{on either side of}} the <b>power</b> <b>piston.</b> In addition to giving great design variability in the heat transfer area, this layout eliminates all but one external seal on the output shaft and one internal seal on the piston. Also, both sides can be highly pressurized as they balance against each other.|$|E
2500|$|Figure 2 {{shows the}} streaklines which {{indicate}} how gas flows through a real Stirling engine. [...] The vertical colored lines delineate the {{volumes of the}} engine. [...] From left to right, they are: the volume swept by the expansion (<b>power)</b> <b>piston,</b> the clearance volume (which prevents the piston from contacting the hot heat exchanger), the heater, the regenerator, the cooler, the cooler clearance volume, and the compression volume swept by the compression piston.|$|E
30|$|The {{low-temperature}} differential Stirling engine (LTD-SE) {{is a kind}} of Stirling {{engine that}} can run with a small temperature difference between the hot and the cold sources. In 1983, Kolin [6] demonstrated the first LTD-SE. Senft [6, 7] developed the Ringbom engine using Kolin's conclusions. Many other prototypes of LTD-SE were manufactured and tested. In 2006, Kongtragool and Wongwises [8] constructed twin <b>power</b> <b>pistons</b> and four <b>power</b> <b>pistons,</b> gamma-configuration LTD Stirling engines. In 2007, Martaj et al. [9] presented a thermodynamic analysis of a low-temperature Stirling engine at steady state operation. In 2012, Boutammachte and Knorr [10] studied a γ-type LTD-SE. They presented several experimental measurements made under laboratory and field-test conditions in Morocco [11]. Measurements with flat plate cooler and discontinuous motion of the displacer were conducted to verify some recommendations of Kolin in expectation of power output improvement. They concluded that the assumption of Kolin related to the proportionality of speed to temperature difference is justified, but the expectation about improvement of the machine performance with discontinuous motion of the two pistons needs to be reviewed.|$|R
5000|$|As {{turbocharged}} or supercharged engines {{produce more}} power {{for a given}} engine size as compared to naturally aspirated engines, attention must {{be paid to the}} mechanical design of components, lubrication, and cooling to handle the <b>power.</b> <b>Pistons</b> are usually cooled with lubrication oil sprayed {{on the bottom of the}} piston. Large [...] "Low speed" [...] engines may use water, sea water, or oil supplied through telescoping pipes attached to the crosshead to cool the pistons.|$|R
50|$|These large {{piston engines}} {{resemble}} automobile engines, only much larger. Commonly known as “recips,” these engines are fueled by natural {{gas from the}} pipeline. Reciprocating pistons, located in cylinder cases {{on the side of}} the unit, compress the natural gas. The compressor <b>pistons</b> and the <b>power</b> <b>pistons</b> are connected to a common crankshaft. The advantage of reciprocating compressors is that the volume of gas pushed through the pipeline can be adjusted incrementally to meet small changes in customer demand.|$|R
50|$|The Atkinson {{differential}} {{engine was}} a two piston, single cylinder four-stroke engine that also used a displacer piston {{to provide the}} fuel air mixture {{for use by the}} <b>power</b> <b>piston.</b> However, the <b>power</b> <b>piston</b> did the compression.|$|E

The displacer piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers.

50|$|The {{high-density}} solids pumps {{which can}} be used in the widest range of situations is the hydraulically <b>powered</b> <b>piston</b> (or reciprocating) pump. It can be realized as single-cylinder or two-cylinder pump. In the latter case, power is transferred to the material via delivery pistons working in push-pull-mode.While one delivery piston sucks material from the feed hopper into the cylinder, the second piston simultaneously pushes the material in the other delivery cylinder and into the delivery line.|$|R

50|$|The {{compression}} space is located between the power-piston hub and the displacer, and this space is cooled by direct conduction through the <b>power</b> <b>piston.</b> A developmental {{model of the}} TMG contained a double articulated diaphragm containing cooling water, which was pumped by a thermosyphon. The depth of the {{compression space}} varies from 0.2 to 2.7 mm, as governed by the 2 mm displacer stroke and the 1.5 mm <b>power</b> <b>piston</b> stroke moving 90 degrees out of phase.|$|E
5000|$|When {{heading towards}} the heat, the {{displacer}} piston is shuttling air inside {{the engine to}} the cold side, cooling and contracting the air, which in turn pulls on the <b>power</b> <b>piston.</b>|$|E
