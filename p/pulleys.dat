5|$|The {{concept of}} {{broaching}} {{can be traced}} back to the early 1850s, with the first applications used for cutting keyways in <b>pulleys</b> and gears. After World War I, broaching was used to rifle gun barrels. In the 1920s and 30s the tolerances were tightened and the cost reduced thanks to advances in form grinding and broaching machines.|$|E

He {{was also one of}} the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, founding hydrostatics and statics, including an explanation of the principle of the lever. He is credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump, compound <b>pulleys,</b> and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion.|$|E
30|$|In the {{mechanical}} part, the float moves {{up and down}} driven by waves, pulling <b>pulley</b> 2 and <b>pulley</b> 3 to rotate in opposite directions. During the wave falling period, only <b>pulley</b> 2, ratchet wheel 1 and driving <b>pulley</b> 4 work to drive the driving <b>pulley</b> 6. If the rotating speed of <b>pulley</b> 2 is {{equal to that of}} driving <b>pulley</b> 4 and the wave keeps falling, the connection between <b>pulley</b> 2 and driving <b>pulley</b> 4 is maintained by ratchet wheel 1. Similarly, during the wave rising period, only <b>pulley</b> 3, ratchet wheel 2 and driving <b>pulley</b> 5 work to drive the driving <b>pulley</b> 6. When <b>pulley</b> 3 keeps pace with driving <b>pulley</b> 5 through ratchet wheel 2 and the driving force is continually on <b>pulley</b> 3, the SRG rotating speed will increase. Through this process, the wave energy is captured and converted into mechanical energy. One thing to be noted is that two ratchet wheels ensure the rotor of SRG rotates in single direction during the whole process. The torque applied on the rotor is always negative, whether wave rises or falls. The work efficiency is greatly improved, compared with that of a single-direction driven float-type wave power system, which works only when the wave is rising, or only when it is falling.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig. 10 a, {{in most of}} cases axes of the output <b>pulley</b> and the input <b>pulley</b> are {{arranged}} in parallel. In this configuration the whole mechanism needs to expand in both direction, radial direction of the output <b>pulley</b> and axial direction of the input <b>pulley,</b> as the reduction ratio is increased. Additionally, when the input <b>pulley</b> is rotated, {{the point where the}} wire separates from the input <b>pulley</b> moves in the axial direction, and thus the output <b>pulley</b> must have equivalent length in the axial direction.|$|R

5|$|Tension {{forces can}} be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be {{combined}} with ideal <b>pulleys,</b> which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object {{is accompanied by a}} force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object {{through the use of a}} set-up that uses movable <b>pulleys,</b> the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles {{built in}} 1940 (only) were fitted with {{removable}} loading ramps, cable rollers {{to act as}} <b>pulleys,</b> and a reinforced tail gate to allow a Flak 30, mounted on a Sd.Ah. 51 trailer, to be quickly dismounted. From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks over the front fenders and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as protection from the weather. Flak 38s were mounted on 10/4s beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn't widened until later. As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, <b>pulleys,</b> and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
30|$|Therefore {{we choose}} another <b>pulley</b> arrangement, where the input <b>pulley</b> and output <b>pulley</b> are {{arranged}} {{at right angles}} as shown in Fig. 10 b. In this configuration, the axial direction length of the input <b>pulley,</b> which increases as the reduction ratio increases, is matched with the radial direction of the output <b>pulley,</b> and this conserves space.|$|R

5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and <b>pulleys,</b> with small electric motors to overcome friction. The new lift was built {{over the top of the}} old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.|$|E
5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from tower cranes, {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. Counterweights and <b>pulleys</b> were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Edison {{introduced}} a new cylinder-based synch-sound apparatus known, just like his 1895 system, as the Kinetophone; instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the Kinetoscope cabinet, they were now projected onto a screen. The phonograph was connected by an intricate arrangement of <b>pulleys</b> to the film projector, allowing—under ideal conditions—for synchronization. However, conditions were rarely ideal, and the new, improved Kinetophone was retired after {{little more than a}} year. By the mid-1910s, the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided. Beginning in 1914, The Photo-Drama of Creation, promoting Jehovah's Witnesses' conception of mankind's genesis, was screened around the United States: eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both slides and live action were synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} {{different}} component of conveyor <b>pulley</b> (shell, end disk, hub, and shaft) failure and the stresses generated on them are discussed.

40|$|Objective: Sharp {{division}} of the A 1 <b>pulley</b> is a time-honored technique {{for the treatment of}} flexor tendon entrapment; however, this procedure is not without complications. The anatomy of the A 1 <b>pulley</b> system has been carefully investigated. Knowledge of superficial anatomic landmarks can assist with demarcating the distal edge of the A 1 <b>pulley</b> and prevent damage to the critical A 2 <b>pulley.</b> Methods: Nine fresh cadaveric hands were dissected with the aid of loupe magnification. On the basis of known anatomic landmarks of the proximal portion of the cruciate (C 0) <b>pulley,</b> percutaneous placement of a 25 -gauge needle 5 mm proximal to the palmar digital crease marked the distal extent of the trigger finger release. Sharp {{division of}} the A 1 <b>pulley</b> was performed with a scalpel until the needle was encountered, thus completing the release. Results: A complete release of the <b>pulley</b> was achieved in all specimens with preservation of the A 2 <b>pulley.</b> No digital nerve or artery injuries were noted with open inspection of the flexor sheath. Conclusion: Percutaneous marking of the distal extent of the A 1 <b>pulley</b> is a safe and reliable method that not only ensures complete release of the A 1 <b>pulley</b> but also preserves the A 2 <b>pulley.</b> The placement of a small gauge needle adds no morbidity to this minimally invasive technique...|$|R
5|$|The {{builders}} {{would have}} made extensive use of cranes and block and tackle <b>pulleys</b> to lift the stones into place. Much of the work {{could have been done}} using simple sheers operated by a windlass. For the largest blocks, a massive human-powered treadmill would have been used; such machines were still being used in the quarries of Provence until as late as the start of the 20th century. A complex scaffold was erected to support the bridge as it was being built. Large blocks were left protruding from the bridge to support the frames and scaffolds used during construction. The aqueduct as a whole would have been a very expensive undertaking; Émile Espérandieu estimated the cost to be over 30 million sesterces, equivalent to 50 years' pay for 500 new recruits in a Roman legion.|$|E
5|$|The {{pulling power}} of the Trait du Nord made it popular for use during the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry, {{including}} mining. In mines, steam engines and internal combustion engines {{could not be used}} due to the possibility of a gas explosion. The first horses were used in the mines in 1821 and the Trait du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in the mines and operating the <b>pulleys</b> used to lift coal to the surface. Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements, and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads. Good horses were able to pull , usually around twelve cars worth, along a railway. As early as 1920, the usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use, and in 1969 the last horse was removed from the mines.|$|E

They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and <b>pulleys,</b> Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E

5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of <b>pulleys</b> as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E

5|$|The Maya {{built their}} cities with Neolithic technology; they built their {{structures}} from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available. The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety {{in the quality}} of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality. Volcanic tuff was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed sandstone. In Comalcalco, where suitable stone was not available locally, fired bricks were employed. Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco. Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing <b>pulleys.</b>|$|E

50|$|Regarding the {{previous}} paragraph, {{the chain of}} an iCVT forms an open loop on its variator <b>pulley</b> that partially covers its variator <b>pulley</b> such that an open section, which is {{not covered by the}} chain, exist. This is similar to a sprocket of a bicycle where there is a section of the sprocket that is covered by its chain, and a section of the sprocket that is not covered by its chain. During one complete rotation, the toothed section of the variator <b>pulley</b> of an iCVT passes by the open section and re-engages with the chain. Here if the transmission diameter of the variator <b>pulley</b> does not represent an integer number of teeth, improper re-engagement between the teeth of the variator <b>pulley</b> and its chain will occur. Also, the transmission diameter of the variator <b>pulley</b> cannot be changed while the toothed section of the variator <b>pulley</b> is covering the entire open section of its chain loop. Since this is similar to where a plate is glued across the open section of a chain loop, which does not allow expansion or contraction of the chain loop as required for transmission diameter change of the variator <b>pulley.</b> Therefore, the transmission diameter of the variator <b>pulley</b> has to be changed one increment during an interval where the variator <b>pulley</b> rotates from an initial position where a portion of the toothed section of the variator <b>pulley</b> is positioned at the open section of the chain loop but not covering the entire open section, to the final position where the toothed section of the variator <b>pulley</b> passes by the open section of the chain loop and is about to re-engage with the chain. Since it takes less than one full rotation to rotate the variator <b>pulley</b> from its initial position to its final position mentioned in {{the previous}} sentence, the transmission diameter of the variator <b>pulley</b> has to be changed one increment within less than one full rotation.|$|R
50|$|Also, a choking <b>pulley</b> is {{very small}} so that its moment arm {{is very small}}.

5|$|As {{far back}} as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had {{screened}} films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; {{in the style of the}} Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of The Great Train Robbery (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal <b>pulleys.</b> While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.|$|E

30|$|One {{problem of}} this wire driven {{mechanism}} with right-angle type is that, as the output <b>pulley</b> rotates {{the point of}} separation of the wire on the input <b>pulley</b> moves up and down because of the winding of the wire as shown in Fig. 11. This motion changes the path length of the wire and adds extra tension on the wire. Theoretically speaking in order to solve this problem, an input <b>pulley</b> or an output <b>pulley</b> must have sliding degree of freedom along its axis to absorb {{the up and down}} motion, but this makes the mechanism large and complicated. Therefore, we examined the elongation of the wire in right-angle type wired driven mechanism. In Fig. 11, L is the length of the wire between the input <b>pulley</b> and the output <b>pulley</b> in the standard posture where theoretically the wire is perpendicular to the input <b>pulley.</b> Now assuming the output <b>pulley</b> rotates θ, and the input <b>pulley</b> rotates ϕ = reduction ratio ×θ. Then the point of separation of the wire is moved distance dl = d ×ϕ / 2 π, where d is diameter of the wire. Along with the moving of the point of separation of the wire, the length of wire between the input <b>pulley</b> and the output <b>pulley</b> is changed to L'. This new wire length L' can be expressed as √(dl^ 2 + L^ 2). As a result, wire elongation L'-L can be calculated. Since Axis 2 has larger reduction ratio of 8.46 than Axis 3 we will check elongation of Axis 2. Considering L is 40  mm and output <b>pulley</b> rotates ± 90 °, estimated elongation L'-L is only 0.06  mm. Thus we consider this elongation is sufficiently tolerable and does not need a complicated mechanism.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The correct {{diagnosis}} of an A 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture is challenging for musculoskeletal radiologists. An A 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture should in theory influence {{the shape of}} the proximal interphalangeal joint volar plate (VP) and the amount of bowstringing at level of the VP during finger flexion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform MRI with metric analysis of the VP configuration and VP bowstringing in cadaver fingers in the crimp grip position and to determine cut points for A 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI in the crimp grip position was performed in 21 cadaver fingers with artificially created flexor tendon <b>pulley</b> tears (fingers with A 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture n[*]=[*] 16, fingers without A 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture n[*]=[*] 5). The distances of the translation of the VP relative to the middle phalanx base, the distances between the flexor tendons and the VP body, and the distances between the flexor tendon and bone (TB) were measured. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed significantly lower VP translation distances and significantly higher VP tendon distances if the A 3 <b>pulley</b> was ruptured. A 2 TB and A 4 TB distances did not differ significantly in specimens with and without A 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture. The optimal cut points for A 3 <b>pulley</b> rupture were a VP translation distance 1. 4  mm.
