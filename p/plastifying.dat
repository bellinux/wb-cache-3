40|$|This article investigates {{experimentally}} {{the application}} of health monitoring techniques to assess the damage on {{a particular kind of}} hysteretic (metallic) damper called web <b>plastifying</b> dampers, which are subjected to cyclic loading. In general terms, hysteretic dampers are increasingly used as passive control systems in advanced earthquake-resistant structures. Nonparametric statistical processing of the signals obtained from simple vibration tests of the web <b>plastifying</b> damper is used here to propose an area index damage. This area index damage is compared with an alternative energy-based index of damage proposed in past research that is based on the decomposition of the load?displacement curve experienced by the damper. Index of damage has been proven to accurately predict the level of damage and the proximity to failure of web <b>plastifying</b> damper, but obtaining the load?displacement curve for its direct calculation requires the use of costly instrumentation. For this reason, the aim {{of this study is to}} estimate index of damage indirectly from simple vibration tests, calling for much simpler and cheaper instrumentation, through an auxiliary index called area index damage. Web <b>plastifying</b> damper is a particular type of hysteretic damper that uses the out-of-plane plastic deformation of the web of I-section steel segments as a source of energy dissipation. Four I-section steel segments with similar geometry were subjected to the same pattern of cyclic loading, and the damage was evaluated with the index of damage and area index damage indexes at several stages of the loading process. A good correlation was found between area index damage and index of damage. Based on this correlation, simple formulae are proposed to estimate index of damage from the area index damage...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} nanodiscs {{stabilized}} with polymers order and pile up on a surface upon drying. The resulting surface films {{with an average}} thickness of one micron are made of collapsed cohesive layers with smectic long-range order. This occurs with and without <b>plastifying</b> stabilizing polymer and produces crevasses. The stacked discs undergo a two-to-three-dimensional crystallization while bottom layers {{close to the surface}} fuse and produce infinite bilayers. Small angle X-ray scattering experiments demonstrate that excess polymer is segregated from the crystalline stack. Water adsorption isotherms show that reversible swelling of the excess polymer does not destroy the compact stack of partially fused nanodiscs collapsed parallel to the surface. In the absence of chemical binding, the stacks of layered nanodiscs can be removed by simple washing with pure water. AFM, TEM and SEM experiments demonstrate that presence of crevasses is quenched by the presence of a <b>plastifying</b> polymer. © Elsevie...|$|E

40|$|Relative wavelet energy entropy (RWEE) is {{proposed}} {{to detect and}} quantify damage to hysteretic dampers used for the passive seismic control of building structures. Hysteretic dampers have the role of dissipating most of the energy input of an earthquake. Minor or moderate earthquakes do not exhaust the energy dissipation capacity of the dampers, yet they damage them. For this reason, continuous or periodic damper-health evaluation is required to decide {{if they need to}} be replaced. Such evaluation calls for the application of efficient structural health monitoring techniques (SHM). This paper focuses on the well-known vibration technique, which is applied to a particular type of hysteretic damper called Web <b>Plastifying</b> Damper (WPD), patented by the University of Granada. Vibration signals, properly recorded by piezoelectric sensors attached around the damaged area of the dampers, are decomposed by means of wavelet packet analysis. Then, the relative wavelet energy entropy of these decompositions is used to calculate the proposed index. Validation of RWEE for this particular application involved dampers installed in two different specimens of reinforced concrete structures subjected to earthquake sequences of increasing intensity. When compared with a well-established mechanical energy-based damage index, results demonstrate that RWEE is a successful and low-cost technique for reliable in-situ monitoring of dampers...|$|E
40|$|A concise {{overview}} {{is given}} of various numerical methods {{that can be}} used to analyse localization and failure in engineering materials. The importance of the cohesive-zone approach is emphasized and various ways to incorporate the cohesive-zone methodology in discretization methods are discussed. Numerical representations of cohesive-zone models suffer from a certain mesh bias. For discrete representations this is caused by the initial mesh design, while for smeared representations it is rooted in the ill-posedness of the rate boundary value problem that arises upon the introduction of decohesion. A proper representation of the discrete character of cohesive-zone formulations which avoids any mesh bias can be obtained elegantly when exploiting the partition-of-unity property of finite element shape functions. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated for some examples at different scales. Moreover, examples are shown how this concept can be used to obtain a proper transition from a <b>plastifying</b> or damaging continuum to a shear band with gross sliding or to a fully open crack (true discontinuum). When adhering to a continuum description of failure, higher-order continuum models must be used. Meshless methods are ideally suited to assess the importance of the higher-order gradient terms, as will be shown. Finally, regularized strain-softening models are used in finite element reliability analyses to quantify the probability of the emergence of various possible failure modes...|$|E
