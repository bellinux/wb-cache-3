25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem. Though {{we think that the}} <b>problem</b> <b>identification</b> is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Hence, {{it is very important that}} the definition of the problem is the same among all group members. Only then is it possible for the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner.|$|E

All three finalist teams also receive a LEGO Mindstorms Education EV3 Robot Set. All submissions are reviewed by a panel of judges consisting of experts from engineering and industrial fields as well as experts in the challenge theme for that year. Teams are judged on <b>problem</b> <b>identification,</b> innovation, implementation, and effective use of STEM principles. From all of the teams nominated by every FIRST LEGO League region, twenty teams are selected as semi-finalists and are invited to attend the Global Innovation Award Celebration in Washington, D.C.
