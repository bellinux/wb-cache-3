5|$|As {{part of a}} {{contractual}} {{agreement with}} Hasbro, Gameloft developed a mobile game based on the show. Released {{in the same year}} the show premiered, on November 22, the game is of the city-building genre. The game, Littlest Pet Shop, is freemium software—microtransactions allows users to speed up the <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. The game provides over 150 animal companions for users to collect; minigames allow players to take care of these pets. Its initial release was for the iOS platform. An Android port was released shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Five {{medications}} {{are currently}} {{used to treat}} the cognitive problems of AD: four are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil) and the other (memantine) is an NMDA receptor antagonist. The benefit from their use is small. No medication has been clearly shown to delay or halt the <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease.|$|E

5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the somatostatin analog {{class of}} medications, such as octreotide, {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman {{has written}} and co-written {{a series of}} books which {{summarize}} his work. These publications include raw data from various studies, their statistical interpretation, and possible conclusions presented with necessary background material. The books also include first-hand accounts of schizophrenic patients and relatives tending to them, giving an insight into jumbled thoughts, the disorder's primary symptom. Gottesman and Shields have built models to explain the cause, transmission, and <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disorder, which is controlled by many genes acting {{in concert with the}} environment, with no cause sufficient by itself.|$|E
5|$|Meher Baba's teachings can roughly {{be divided}} into two main categories: his metaphysics {{on the nature of the}} soul and the Universe, and {{practical}} advice for the spiritual aspirant. The two are interrelated. His metaphysics is mostly found in his principal book on the subject, God Speaks. It contains detailed statements on his cosmology and the purpose of life as well as the <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul, while his elucidations on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in Discourses, although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying God Speaks.|$|E

5|$|On 10 January 2016, {{two days}} after his 69th {{birthday}} {{and the release of}} the album Blackstar, Bowie died from liver cancer in his New York City apartment. He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier but had not made the news of his illness public. The Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove, who had worked with the singer on his Off-Broadway musical Lazarus, explained that Bowie was unable to attend rehearsals due to the <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. He noted that Bowie had kept working during the illness.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} (ROP) {{in infants}} frequently regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years. Where {{the disease has}} progressed to the stages requiring surgery, the outcomes are generally good {{for the treatment of}} stage 3 ROP, but are much worse for the later stages. Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision. The presence of other complicating diseases also reduces the likelihood of a favourable outcome.|$|E
5|$|The Touchet {{beds are}} one element {{in a chain}} of {{evidence}} which helped identify and define the <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Missoula Floods, which occurred around 16,450 to 13,750 yearsBCE. During the floods, flow through the Wallula Gap was slow enough such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis. Lake Lewis back-flooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River Valleys. In these relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters deposited the suspended materials eroded from the scabland regions north of Lake Lewis, and redeposited them in pronounced layers before receding.|$|E

5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced {{her in that}} direction and she ended up getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that the <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, 120–130 tammar {{wallabies}} {{died suddenly}} in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months. No treatment has been attempted due to the rapid <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century {{continental}} builders {{are known to have}} been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. Compared with after the Reformation, the interiors of churches were often elaborate, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, depicting the <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven deadly sins, were created in the mid-fifteenth century. They are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style. Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas.|$|E

5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
5|$|Justified {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics; {{most of them}} complimented the mature <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singer's material, while some criticized its lyrical content. The album earned Timberlake four Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year, and won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Justified debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart and sold 439,000 copies in its first week. It was certified three-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) denoting shipments of three million copies in the US. As of 2012, the album has sold over ten million copies worldwide.|$|E

5000|$|... "When You Gonna Learn" [...] was not {{the first}} single written and issued by Jay Kay, though it is the first single as Jamiroquai.

Kiss 100 FM was the first radio station to play the single. <b>The</b> chord <b>progressions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song bear a striking resemblance to <b>the</b> chord <b>progressions</b> <b>of</b> a Johnny [...] "Hammond" [...] Smith's track called [...] "Los Conquistadores Chocolatés", taken from his 1975 album Gears. <b>The</b> booklet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Acid Jazz Records release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single bears a [...] "special thanks" [...] note to Smith, who gave permission to Kay to use the composition's structure. It is unknown whether Hammond received any royalties. <b>The</b> chord <b>progressions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cantè Hondo Mix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song bear even more resemblance to [...] "Los Conquistadores Chocolatés". The Cantè Hondo Mixes also uses the wind sound effect from Hammond's song. The cover used by Acid Jazz Records is completely different from the cover on Sony's release, although a Spanish promo issued by Sony bears the Acid Jazz Records cover. There have been legal disputes between Acid Jazz Records and Epic Records because Epic re-released the single without Acid Jazz Records' consent.|$|R
