The Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation has submitted a detailed <b>project</b> <b>proposal</b> to the government. Because of the merger, however, it is unlikely the Rail Link will be built and operated by the KCRC.|$|E
25|$|In 1977 the {{libraries}} of the faculties of Sciences, Economic Sciences, and Engineering, {{all three}} {{located within the}} same campus, were merged into the Integrated Library of Sciences, Economics and Engineering (BIECI for its acronym in Spanish). This was the first unification of different library services that took place within the University. A <b>project</b> <b>proposal</b> for taking this initiative {{to a higher level}} was put forth the University Council a couple of years later. The project submitted the comprehensive integration of all the university’s library services into a greater single one. It was swiftly approved on March 6, 1980 and the resulting body was simply named University of Los Andes Library Services (SERBIULA). SERBIULA had and still has the responsibility of integrating all the existing library services and keeping them up-to-date with the University demands. Additionally, SERBIULA created and manages the university’s Library System, whose coordination follows a decentralized approach as a consequence of having the University campuses scattered all around the city. Another goal is improving the efficiency of human, technical and financial resources.|$|E

500|$|Mother was {{developed}} by Ape and published by Nintendo. While visiting Nintendo for other work, copywriter Shigesato Itoi pitched his idea for a role-playing game set in contemporary times to the company's Shigeru Miyamoto. He thought the setting would be unique for its incongruence with role-playing genre norms, as daily life lacked the pretense for magic powers and they could not simply give the child characters firearms as weapons. Itoi's <b>project</b> <b>proposal</b> suggested how the natural limitations could be circumvented. Miyamoto met with him and praised the idea, though {{he was not sure}} whether Itoi [...] "could pull it off". As an advertiser, Itoi was used to concept proposals preceding the staffing process, but Miyamoto explained that video game concepts needed people who signed on to [...] "make" [...] the product. Itoi was overcome with [...] "powerlessness".|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{proposal for}} a light rail station at South Lander Street in SODO came from the Puget Sound Council of Governments in 1986, {{as part of a}} north–south line from Lynnwood to Federal Way, following the Duwamish River from Downtown Seattle to the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. The station was omitted from the 1993 Regional Transit <b>Project</b> <b>proposal,</b> and the two Sound Transit proposals in 1995 and 1996, with the latter being approved to follow Interstate 90 toward the Rainier Valley. Sound Transit added several alternative routes to Central Link in 1998, including [...] "Route C1" [...] consisting of an at-grade segment parallel to the existing SODO Busway and a tunnel under Beacon Hill, with stations at South Royal Brougham Way, South Lander Street and under Beacon Hill. [...] "Route C1" [...] was selected as the final route for Central Link in 1999, with a station at South Lander Street being approved ahead of the deferred Royal Brougham and Beacon Hill stations.|$|E

500|$|Urobuchi {{attributed}} {{his past}} experience working on projects with screenwriters Ichiro Itano and Yōsuke Kuroda {{as a major}} influence in his writing for Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and has referred {{to both of them}} as his mentors. To set the initial pacing of the series, Urobuchi used a technique he credited as originally from Kuroda. The first episode would throw the viewer into a specific part of the story with unknown context, the second episode would then define the particular rules governing the story's setting, and the third episode would be responsible for divulging the revelation in the plot so as to hook the viewer. The twist in the third episode was determined during the <b>project</b> <b>proposal</b> stage and involved the death of Mami, a main character figure. This decision was controversial, and Urobuchi recalled production staff members continually approaching him and asking him to reconsider due to their own fondness for the character. However, he refused and the plot remained unchanged during production. Nevertheless, Urobuchi realized that this progression could be very hard for viewers to accept and might hurt the overall series' success with some audiences, commenting: [...] "I always thought this is an age where entertainment basically is about soothing and healing, like adopting a style where unchanging day-to-day life is to continue forever." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} skyscrapers in Baltimore {{began with the}} {{completion}} in 1889 of the Equitable Building at {{the southwest corner of}} North Calvert and East Fayette Streets across from the Beaux Arts/Classical Revival architecture of the Baltimore City Courthouse of 1894-1900 and the landmark Battle Monument in Battle Monument Square, commemorating the fallen in the defense of the City against the British attack in the 1814 Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. [...] "The Equitable" [...] as it became known replaced the earlier landmark from 1825, Barnum's City Hotel and was the first steel cage framed building with outside surface panels of stone hung on the frame, a new technique pioneered by Chicago architects like Louis Sullivan and Daniel Burnham. Shortly after, the 1893 construction of the Fidelity Building, of which both are regarded as the first high-rises in the City. The building originally rose eight floors, but an additional seven stories with a terra cotta panels façade designed to match the original earlier grey granite rough-cut stone base, were constructed between 1912 and 1915, bringing the structure's total height to , making it the first building in Baltimore over [...] Baltimore went through an early high-rise construction boom from the late 1890s to the Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904, when a half-dozen of new skyscrapers' so-called [...] "fire-proof" [...] but their interiors were burned out. Most were later judged by inspecting engineers/architects as structurally sound with their steel I-beam cage framing and masonry facades and were reconstructed and rehabilitated {{in the next five years}} in a flurry of downtown rebuilding. The next period from the 1910s to the late 1920s, during which time the iconic Baltimore Trust Company Tower (now the Bank of America Building) were constructed. The City's central business district then experienced a long fallow period due to the Great Depression of the 1930s and the defense industrial efforts of World War II where very few skyscrapers were constructed and the downtown remained relatively stable. But with the proposals by the major business, commercial and industrial interests of the area with the release of the Charles Center <b>project</b> <b>proposal</b> by the recently organized Greater Baltimore Committee and the local Chamber of Commerce with the leadership of several mayoral administrations in 1958 continuing into the early 1970s, followed by a parallel soon-to-be nationally famous [...] "Inner Harbor" [...] redevelopment around the old waterfront piers, wharves, warehouses, offices and businesses of the former [...] "Basin" [...] along the Baltimore Harbor at the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River continued another major building boom from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, during which the City saw the completion of 18 of its 24 tallest buildings, including the 1973 United States Fidelity and Guarantee Company's new iconic headquarters (later the Legg Mason Building, now the Transamerica Tower) at the corner of the harbor at Pratt and Light Streets and the five-sides/pentagonal high-rise centerpiece of the harbor, the Baltimore World Trade Center for the Maryland Port Administration in 1977. The City is the site of two completed buildings that are at least [...] high, with one more under construction and two proposed for construction. As of June 2008, there are 163 completed high-rises in the city. The most recently completed skyscraper in Baltimore is 414 Water Street, which rises [...] and 33 floors. Currently under construction, as of July of 2017, 414 Light Street Apartment tower will rise to over 500 feet tall and 44 floors. Construction of this tower will be complete in early 2018.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} other major road {{developments}} {{proposed by the}} Strategic Transport Study. Emersons Green, a rapidly expanding business and industrial suburb with a £300 million [...] "science park" [...] currently in development, could {{be connected to the}} M4, with a new junction where the motorway crosses the dismantled Midlands railway (ST689779) and a new road following the route of the railway to the A4174 roundabout (ST675771). [...] When St Philip's Causeway was built by Bristol Development Corporation in the 1980s, connecting the M32 in St Pauls to the A4 at Arno's Vale, it was originally intended {{to be part of a}} larger road scheme. A proposed Callington Road Link would extend the road along the route of the dismantled Radstock railway line to the A4174, with a junction on the A4. Bristol Airport has also been attracting increasing levels of transport to roads south of Bristol, and an Airport link has been discussed for several years. [...] Two schemes are suggested in the STS, both entirely new roads. [...] One route connects Junction 20 of the M5 at Clevedon to the west end of the Long Ashton bypass as a new [...] "Nailsea Bypass", coupled with an [...] "Orange Route" [...] link from the Long Ashton bypass, approximately one kilometre from its west end, to the A38 at the B3130 junction. [...] The other route would run from the A38 just south of the airport, north of Wrington and south of Congresbury to the M5 at Weston-super-Mare. [...] The final major <b>project</b> <b>proposal</b> is a second Avonmouth Bridge. [...] This would be a lower level to the M5 bridge, with a swing or lifting mechanism, to the West of the existing bridge, and would relieve the motorway of the local traffic it carries.|$|E
