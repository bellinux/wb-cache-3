40|$|Metallic {{structures}} of long-term operation life {{in oil and}} gas industry are exposed to such factors as the cyclic loads, temperature changes, pressure pulsations, aggressive medias, etc. For example, the operation of pipelines under the influence of residual internal <b>pressure</b> <b>steel</b> pipeline withstands tensions that are close to the normative strength characteristics of metal pipes. Such situation relates with a complicated scheme of pipeline interaction with the soil, presence of deviations from regulatory requirements during construction of the pipeline, presence of flaws in metal, weldments and failuring modes of technological operations. Moreover, âaging â of pipelines has been reported from many operators based on their performance experience. In oil and gas pipeline steels most common failures are caused by strain ageing. This is mostly due to not only cyclic nature of the loading, but also due to some specific alloying elements. Availability of the atomic hydrogen in the soil electrolytes, hydrogen sulfide oils, its generation during cathodic reactions leads to a significant growth of embrittlement of tube steels in case of prolonged cyclic loading. Combination of these processes cause change of the microstructure and physical-mechanical properties of steel, i. e. ageing [1]. Thus aging of the pipeline steels during operation can be associated with changes at the level of crystalline structure of metal and with redistribution of impurity atoms and dislocations...|$|E

The geometry of the structure and the soil {{is assumed to be}} invariant in the longitudinal direction, allowing for a Fourier transform of the longitudinal coordinate y along the structure to the wavenumber ky and leading to an efficient 2. 5 D methodology. The dynamic soil-structure interaction (SSI) problem is solved by means of a 2. 5 D coupled finite element-boundary element (FE-BE) method using a subdomain formulation. The numerical model is applied to assess the dynamic response of a buried pipeline to an incident wave field. First, plane harmonic Por SV-waves are considered to verify the 2. 5 D coupled FE-BE method by means of results available in the literature. Second, the response of a buried high <b>pressure</b> <b>steel</b> natural gas pipeline and a buried concrete sewer pipe to the vibrations generated by the operation of a pavement breaker during the rehabilitation of concrete pavements is evaluated with the 2. 5 D coupled FE-BE method in order to assess the risk of damage. It is observed that stresses on the steel pipeline due to the operation of the pavement breaker are much lower than those induced by the operating internal pressure. The steel pipeline behaves in the linear elastic range under the combined effect of the nternal pressure and vibrations generated by the operation of the pavement breaker. On the other hand, the maximum principal stress developed on the concrete sewer pipe is slightly lower than the tensile strength of concrete. The peak particle velocities (PPV) induced on the pipelines are below the maximum allowable vibration levels for buried pipelines defined in vibration guidelines. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{innovative}} methods {{proposed in}} this thesis provide effective and efficient solutions to the reliability problems of burst and collapse of tubes with random geometric imperfections under internal or external <b>pressure.</b> <b>Steel</b> tubes have broad applications in petroleum offshore engineering and must be designed to a safe but yet economical standard. The variation of imperfections from tube to tube necessitates a statistical characterization in which the burst and collapse pressures become random variables. In order to evaluate the burst and collapse pressure of a pipe with deterministic geometric imperfections, the finite element method is employed with a cylindrical shell element based on classical nonlinear shell theory. This element implements the return mapping algorithm for an elastic/plastic material and includes the effects of shell thinning and geometric imperfections. Incorporation of this finite element program into a reliability program developed for this study provides an effective numerical tool for the probabilistic analyses of the burst and collapse problems. For these analyses, the pipe thickness is modeled as an axially homogeneous and circumferentially inhomogeneous Gaussian random field based on measured data from two groups of pipes. Using the developed shell finite element program, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) {{can be applied to}} the burst/collapse reliability problems. However, the enormous computational effort makes MCS infeasible except as a check for selected cases. Unfortunately, the system reliability method does not apply to the present problems because there are an infinite number of design points due to the special structure of the imperfections. Thus, a new approximate method is developed for the burst problem based on the correlations between the minimum thickness and burst pressure. The probability distribution of minimum thickness is obtained through an innovative homogenization procedure. Similarly, the collapse reliability problem is solved through introduction of a homogenized collapse function whose minimum correlates with the collapse pressure. The proposed reliability methods are applied to selected cases and verified by MCS. The effect of length on reliability in burst and collapse is investigated. Compared to MCS, the efficiency of the new methods makes them especially applicable to engineering problems, such as pipeline design and manufacturing quality control...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the post-yield true stress vs true strain {{behavior}} of irradiated <b>pressure</b> vessel <b>steels</b> and iron-based alloys to reveal differences in strain-hardening behavior associated with different irradiating particles (neutrons and electrons) and different alloy chernky. It {{is important to understand}} the effects on mechanical properties caused by displacement producing radiation of nuclear reactor <b>pressure</b> <b>steels.</b> Critical embrittling effects, e. g. increases in the ductile-to-brittle-transition-temperature, are associated with irradiation-induced increases in yield strength. In addition, fatigue-life and loading-rate effects on fracture can be related to the post-irradiation strain-hardening behavior of the steels. All of these properties affect the expected service life of nuclear reactor pressure vessels. We address the characteristics of two general strengthening effects that we believe are relevant to the differing defect cluster characters produced by neutrons and electrons in four different alloys: two <b>pressure</b> vessel <b>steels,</b> A 212 B and A 350, and two binary alloys, Fe- 0. 28 wt%Cu and Fe- 0. 74 wt%Ni. Our results show that there are differences in the post-irradiation mechanical behavior for the two kinds of irradiation and that the differences are related both to differences in damage produced and alloy chemistry. We find that while electron and neutron irradiations (at T {le} 60 C) of <b>pressure</b> vessel <b>steels</b> and binary iron-based model alloys produce similar increases in yield strength for the same dose level, they do not result in the same post-yield hardening behavior. For neutron irradiation, the true stress flow curves of the irradiated material can be made to superimpose on that of the unirradiated material, when the former are shifted appropriately along the strain axis. This behavior suggests that neutron irradiation hardening has the same effect as strain hardening for all of the materials analyzed. For electron irradiated steels, the post-yield hardening rate is clearly greater than that of the unirradiated material, and the flow curves cannot be made to superimpose. The binary iron-base model alloys studied here show a less pronounced difference in flow behavior for neutrons and electrons than exhibited by the steels, implicating the effect of alloy chemistry. Our results are analyzed in the context of classical theories dealing with the interaction between the deformation microstructure, i. e. glide dislocations, and irradiation-produced defects. Our findings provide clues about the way different alloy constituents interact with the different kinds of irradiation damage to strengthen the material differently...|$|R
