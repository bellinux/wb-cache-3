50|$|It {{is worth}} noting that fixed assets in {{national}} accounts have a broader coverage than fixed assets in business accounts. Fixed assets are <b>produced</b> <b>assets</b> that are used repeatedly or continuously in production processes for more than one year. The stock of produced fixed assets consists of tangible assets (e.g. residential and non-residential building, roads, bridges, airports, railway, machinery, transport equipment, office equipment, vineyards and orchards, breeding livestock, dairy livestock, draught animals, sheep and other animals reared for their wool). The European System of Accounts (ESA95) explicitly includes produced intangible assets (e.g. mineral exploration, computer software, copyright protected entertainment, literary and artistics originals) within the definition of fixed assets.|$|E

The {{concept of}} ‘genuine ’ saving, the net saving rate in a {{national}} accounting framework encompassing resource depletion and environmental degradation, is extended to include technological change, resource imports, and critical natural capital {{in the form of}} rainforests. In all cases, measuring negative rates of genuine saving on the optimal path implies non-sustainability of the path. Questions of measurement away from the optimum, substitutability, depreciation of <b>produced</b> <b>assets,</b> exogenous versus endogenous technological growth and global preferences for natural assets such as rainforests are explored and clarified. 1...|$|E

40|$|National wealth, {{understood}} as a sum of natural capital, <b>produced</b> <b>assets</b> and human resources, plays a growing role in the globalized economy. Wealth {{at the disposal of}} the country’s subjects is an important condition for the long-term growth and development of individual countries. In the pro-cesses of globalization, the main actors be it multinational corporations or individual countries, are seeking control over those resources to get foothold in the new international division of labour. National wealth is also important for consumption. The feeling of being rich stimulates consump-tion, spending without bothering about the future. Loss of wealth has the opposite consequences in the longer perspective. Transition processes in Central and Eastern Europe brought about important transfers of wealth among different countries. Improved consumption levels thanks to, among others, unemployment and foreign debt {{are just some of the}} consequences of transition. The paper investigates the effects of transition processes on national wealth and speculates about long-term sustainability of the pre-sent Polish human resources-related policies.

40|$|Policy context 1. The {{concept of}} {{sustainable}} development is concerned both with the quality and the quantity of economic growth and encompasses three dimensions of welfare — economic, environmental and social. It refers first to “needs ” in a broad sense, not only economic needs but also needs for a clean environment, for a secure and cohesive society and for ample employment opportunities. Second, explicit in the concept is a focus on “inter-generational” equity, implying that the next generation should be secured opportunities similar to those available to the current one. Third, it puts an emphasis on equity that applies both across and within countries. 2. Progressing towards sustainable development implies that the objectives of increasing economic efficiency and material wealth {{must take into account}} social and environmental objectives and must be placed in an inter-temporal framework. It also implies that the capital or asset base of our economies and societies is preserved; this is a key determinant of the potential to satisfy the needs of the present and the next generation. It includes natural assets (natural resources and environmental assets); <b>produced</b> <b>assets</b> and financial assets; and human and social assets (health, education, social institutions, networks and norms). 3.

40|$|According to {{the concept}} of "weak" sustainability, {{exploited}} natural capital should be replaced with other <b>produced</b> <b>assets,</b> such as social capital, to ensure non-declining welfare dynamics. One way to promote the accumulation of social capital is to use revenues from the exploitation of natural resources for social welfare policies. Better ex-ante and ex-post assessment of policies is needed in order to optimize the use of resources, especially when revenues from the use of a non-renewable natural resource such as oil are used to foster development in poor countries and lagging regions. The aim of this work is to assess the impact on income distribution of a social card funded by oil royalties to support the income of poor families in the Basilicata region, Italy. The direct and indirect distributive effects of this policy are assessed by combining microeconomic information from the European Survey on Incomes and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) with a multi-sector model of the regional economy based on a two-region social accounting matrix (SAM). The analysis has shown that the EU-SILC data sample, combined with a SAM multisector model, can be used to support the study of regional policies, and this is a promising result for the future development of research...|$|E

Documents like India as a Knowledge Superpower have prolifer-ated and we continually hear the mantra of investing in and harnessing of human capital. There are, however, several strands of human capital in India and not all of them harness knowledge and creativity. People on whom drugs are being tested represent one such human capital, which, even though it is being energetically mobilized to provide India with a strategic advantage in the world market, also highlights the contradictions within India’s shifting imaginary, economy and politics. Drug trials in India, in the context of neoliberal globalization, not only challenge and complicate, but also operate within a constellation of divisions – labor/capital, west/non-west, colonial/sovereign, national/global and so on. In this article I analyze how the people on whom drug testing is being done in India are being ‘harnessed ’ as human capital, which leads to politicization of ‘bare life’ through ‘inclusive-exclusion’.

40|$|AbstractToday {{people use}} {{information}} technologies {{in every area}} of their lives; it makes lives more systematic, clear and definite. This phenomenon appears in humanities too, in such sciences like history and social knowledge. Virtual space is developing, which is, certainly, very helpful and it brings every area of life to a new level. Different virtual environments, simulators and educational resources are created. They let people participate, study and train in inaccessible or impossible areas. In this paper we present practical approach of Virtual reconstruction of cultural and historical monuments of the Middle Volga in which we first create landscape, develop key-systems (such as roads and sound filling editors), then create visual content and finish with optimization and implementing <b>produced</b> <b>assets.</b> This project was created to achieve a lot of aims. First of all, we want to contribute in developing of digital history, save and systematize existing culture-historical monuments and information about them, to help form an image of Tatar Republic. Secondly, we want to expand virtual reality use. We {{want it to be}} not only an entertainment, but part of education. Our project expects wide audience of people interested in it. It will be helpful for studying history, because men learn history latently, while they are active in the game. So, this is the benefit of virtual reconstructions: users become part of virtual reality and certain world created in it. They try different roles, do different actions they cannot do in reality. In our educational game “Bolgar XIV” user can try a role of a citizen of ancient city; see defunct architecture and typical activity of that time. This game will attract people, who just want to play a game, {{but at the same time}} they will enrich their knowledge and images of this particular historic place. This makes virtual environment more of current interest and multifunctional. Creating virtual environment of ancient city of Bolgar help to understand and create our own technique of creating such culture-historical reconstructions...|$|E
40|$|The {{relatively}} new concept of "green growth" can be fruitfully connected to concepts and theories in neoclassical economics including market externalities, Ricardian and Hotelling rents, {{and policies that}} would correct externalities such as Pigovian taxes or a cap and trade system set to achieve emissions reductions consistent with cost benefit assessment. Partial equilibrium concepts have been extended to general equilibrium models, including their realization in relatively detailed empirical models that faithfully adhere to theoretical concepts of neoclassical economics. With such models we are then able to see how resource depletion and environmental degradation are affecting the economy, and how efforts to reduce {{the impact of these}} environmental and resource constraints could improve economic growth and performance. The foundation for traditional computable general equilibrium models are the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs), input-output (I-O) tables, and expanded Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs). The basis for extending these to include environmental and resource assets and goods are so called Integrated Economic and Environmental Social Accounts (IEESAs). While environmental effects are often considered to be "non-market," many of the impacts of environment are often reflected in market accounts through damages that might include, for example, less labor (due to environment related health problems), reduced productivity of agroecosystems, or damage to infrastructure and other <b>produced</b> <b>assets.</b> The challenge is to make the environmental connection explicit so as to provide a guide to where changes in policies could provide benefit. However, some damages do not enter the accounts at all, and mainly this is because household labor and leisure time are generally not valued in traditional accounts. Hence the cost of illness in terms of reduced ability to contribute to household activities would be missed in the standard accounts. While the theoretical structure for expanding the accounts has been laid out in various reviews, the empirical challenge of doing so is substantial. Careful attention to expanding NIPA accounts, making it a regular part of government statistical agencies’ efforts would improve the foundation for analysis of potential "green growth" policies and measures.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has {{two main}} objectives. The {{first one is}} to construct historical macroeconomic series for Sweden using a consistent method throughout the relevant periods, and which rely on modern methods of national accounting. The second objective is to investigate patterns of economic growth, accumulation and crisis in Sweden 1800 - 2000, based on the constructed data series. New annual data series of Gross Domestic Product and its division into activities (type of production) and expenditures (consumption, investment and foreign trade), Net Domestic Product, stocks of <b>produced</b> <b>assets</b> and consumption of fixed assets are constructed for the period 1800 - 2000; series of employment, wages, imputed labour income of self employed and surplus for the period 1850 - 2000; and series of worked hours for the period 1950 - 2000. Summary tables of the main aggregate variables are presented {{at the end of}} the dissertation. The intent is to make the data material available online (also at a more disaggregated level) at: [URL] Although the present study criticises the somewhat deterministic vision of many long cycle theories, it also demonstrates that the concept of long cycle can be applied when studying long-term fluctuations in GDP per capita, provided that the notion of a fixed periodicity of long cycles is abandoned. Long-term economic fluctuations are irregular, but so is also the short-term business cycle. Different historical tendencies and trends are investigated. The decline of the relative size of industrial activities in the last half of 20 th century was not as dramatic, if unpaid household labour is considered and that many services are industry-related. The Marxist theory of a Tendency for the Rate of Profit to Fall is partly confirmed as a secular process up to the 1970 s, but profitability has rebounded in the last two decades of the 20 th century. During the 1990 s, the investment ratio declined to historically low levels and the volume value of the net stock of buildings and structures fell for the first time since the 1830 s. A comparison is also made of depressions in Sweden since 1850. During the 19 th century, depressions were largely induced by the agricultural sector, and during the 20 th century by industrial activities. However, the transition to the modern business cycle was not sudden but rather protracted. Another finding is that the 1990 s depression was somewhat deeper than the 1930 s depression in terms of GDP contraction...|$|E
