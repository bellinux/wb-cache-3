5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b> The racers smash the looking glass with the <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E
5|$|The men torment the {{bound and}} gagged Sally while Leatherface, now {{dressed as a}} woman, serves dinner. Leatherface and the {{hitchhiker}} bring down Grandpa (John Dugan), one of the desiccated bodies from upstairs. He is revealed to be alive when he sucks blood from a cut on Sally's finger. They decide that Grandpa, the best killer in the old slaughterhouse, should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer but is too weak. In the ensuing confusion, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and flees to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing truck. Armed with his chainsaw, Leatherface attacks the truck when the driver stops to help; the driver knocks down Leatherface with a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> causing the chainsaw to cut his leg. The driver flees, and Sally escapes {{in the back of}} a passing pickup truck as Leatherface dances maniacally in the road with his chainsaw.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench,</b> or Stillson wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. The <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> was invented by Daniel C. Stillson in 1869.|$|E

25|$|On July 13, 1991, Bruce Hamill {{went to a}} {{hardware}} store, bought a plumber's wrench, hatchet, knives and a sleeping bag, {{then went to the}} Brockville hospital and signed out Krueger on his first publicly escorted day pass. During the first hour of his first weekend pass (unsupervised release) in 34 years, Krueger arranged to meet Dennis Kerr in the woods near Brockville where Krueger would loan Kerr five hundred dollars. When Dennis Kerr arrived as instructed, Krueger struck him in the head with the <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> and continued to beat him into unconsciousness. Krueger and Hamill then seized the hatchet and knife they had hidden in the bushes while waiting for Kerr's arrival and hacked and stabbed Kerr, mutilating his body, cutting it open, and nearly severing his head. Drenched in Kerr's blood, they then stripped themselves naked and sodomized the corpse. Krueger then left the scene, walked to a police station about two miles away, and turned himself in.|$|E

50|$|Steel pipe is {{sometimes}} joined using threaded connections, where tapered threads (see National Pipe Thread) are {{cut into the}} end of the tubing segment, sealant is applied in the form of thread sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape), and it is then threaded into a corresponding threaded fitting using two <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches.</b> Beyond domestic or light commercial settings, steel pipe is often joined by welding, or by use of mechanical couplings made by companies such as Victaulic or Anvil International (formerly Grinnell) that hold the pipe joint together via a groove pressed or cut (a rarely used older practice), into the ends of the pipes.|$|R

5000|$|The plumber wrench {{was invented}} in the year 1888 by Swedish {{inventor}} Johan Petter Johansson. His wrench shares some principles with both the Stillson-pattern <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> and the rigid <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench.</b> Nevertheless, it is a decidedly different and improved tool. It allows plumbers to use the wrench rather than a pair of tongs to separate or join pipes. It is not widely known in North America. It is common in Europe, where it may be called a [...] "pipe wrench", [...] "Swedish wrench", or [...] "Swedish pattern wrench".|$|E

50|$|As a child, Miriello {{was fascinated}} with globes. A sculptor, he {{produced}} 100 sculptures {{inspired by the}} metaphor of the world globe which culminated in the 100 Worlds Project exhibit. The exhibit incorporated craftspeople and makers as collaborators, reconnecting the arts with the guild tradition of craft. For this exhibition Miriello produced fifty interpreted globes, using a variety of materials that included antique <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches,</b> bowling balls, the propellers of boats and corrugated cardboard. The globes were then given to forty San Diego based photographers who spent a week with each sculpture and documented it through personal photography. Their original photographic prints were displayed at the Jett Gallery and included in an exhibition book. In 2016 the globes were exhibited at San Diego's Lindbergh field in Terminal 2.|$|R

50|$|Ma chanson leur a pas plu...:(They didn't like my song...) This {{parody of}} his fellow French pop stars is a hard-edged rock number as an {{imaginary}} autobiographical narration of Renaud's difficulties coming up with new tunes. Each verse is about a new number he has just written, but every time, upon hearing it, his close friends point out to him that this one is not of his usual style, {{and that he should}} forget it and start again. The songwriter then figures he can sell his failed composition to this one contemporary singer (a different one at each verse, namely Jean-Patrick Capdevielle, Bernard Lavilliers, and Francis Cabrel), but he never manages to convince them, even though each time the song in question is of the style of the given artist in turn. Persistent, he goes back to writing yet another, better song, and so on to the next song-artist combination until at the end, fed up, he fiercely sets off to write one for his very own self, one with mopeds and motorbikes and leather jackets and <b>pipe</b> <b>wrenches</b> and all, along with cheap word puns. This final verse is where Renaud did not forget to parody himself as well, as he has at other times in his career.|$|R

5000|$|The {{length of}} the nipple is usually {{specified}} by the overall length with threads. It may have a hexagonal section in the center for wrench to grasp (sometimes {{referred to as a}} [...] "hex nipple"), or it may simply be made from a short piece of pipe (sometimes referred to as a [...] "barrel nipple" [...] or [...] "pipe nipple"). A [...] "close nipple" [...] has no unthreaded area; when screwed tightly between two female fittings, very little of the nipple remains exposed. A close nipple can only be unscrewed by gripping one threaded end with a <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench</b> which will damage the threads and necessitate replacing the nipple, or by using a specialty tool known as a nipple wrench (or known as an internal <b>pipe</b> <b>wrench)</b> which grips the inside of the pipe, leaving the threads undamaged. When the ends are of two different sizes it is called a reducer or unequal nipple.|$|E
