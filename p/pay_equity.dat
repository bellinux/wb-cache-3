40|$|Almost {{everyone}} agrees that equity-based incentive compensation {{can play an important}} role in increasing shareholder value, but there is considerable disagreement as to what that role should be and how <b>equity</b> <b>pay</b> should be packaged. What's more, there has been a backlash against <b>equity</b> <b>pay</b> that has compensation committees, investors, and corporate watchdogs on full alert. The authors of this article provide some basic guidelines for <b>equity</b> <b>pay</b> that could help to restore confidence in this useful element of compensation-guidelines that encompass the type of equity instrument, the level of equity-based pay, the extent to which <b>equity</b> <b>pay</b> is performance based, and the structure of the equity package in terms of vesting, exercise, and expiry. They start by acknowledging that the role of <b>equity</b> <b>pay</b> is limited by the extent to which shareholder value can be affected by the manager in question. They recommend building steadily to a constant level of stock price exposure and then gradually reducing this level after retirement. For most companies, equity-based pay should be significant only for a handful of employees; performance based cash bonuses provide better "line-of-sight," especially for operating managers who are somewhat removed from corporate-wide decisions. And disclosure-both internal and external-is perhaps the most important aspect of equity-based pay plans. 2004 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R
