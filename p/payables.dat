5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future <b>payables</b> or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
25|$|A {{remarkable}} {{example of}} a wax tablet book are the servitude records which the hospital of Austria's oldest city, Enns, established in 1500. Ten wooden plates, sized 375 x 207mm and arranged in a 90mm stack, are each divided into two halves along their long axis. The annual <b>payables</b> due are written on parchment or paper glued to the left sides. <b>Payables</b> received were recorded for deduction (and subsequently erased) on the respective right sides, which are covered with brownish-black writing wax. The material is based on beeswax, and contains 5-10% plant oils and carbon pigments; its melting point is about 65°C. This volume is the continuation of an earlier one, which was begun in 1447.|$|E
25|$|Sensing {{that its}} could be abolished, in 1937–1938, Rytas {{transferred}} its archives and movable property to the Lithuanian Scientific Society, which was headquartered {{in the same}} Vileišis Palace. The move did not help as both Rytas and the Scientific Society, as well as seven other Lithuanian organizations, were suspended by the starosta of Vilnius in January 1938. Rytas appealed the decision to voivode Bociański, but received a negative response on 25 February and was officially closed on 28 February. Rytas' property {{was taken over by}} attorney Stefan Wilanowski and the last school in Dainava was closed. After the Polish ultimatum of March 1938, diplomatic relations were established between Poland and Lithuania and Rytas was allowed to operate again on 20 May 1939. In June, it received its property back – Vileišis Palace, now subject to a 60,000 złoty mortgage to the Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, 33,303 złoty receivables, and 7,745 złoty <b>payables.</b>|$|E
50|$|Accrued {{liabilities}} are liabilities {{that reflect}} expenses on {{the income statement}} {{that have not been}} paid or logged under accounts <b>payable</b> during an accounting period; in other words, obligations for goods and services provided to a company for which invoices have not yet been received. Examples would include accrued wages <b>payable,</b> accrued sales tax <b>payable,</b> and accrued rent <b>payable.</b>|$|R
50|$|A more {{complete}} definition is that current liabilities are obligations {{that will be}} settled by current assets or by {{the creation of new}} current liabilities. Accounts <b>payable</b> are due within 30 days, and are paid within 30 days, but do often run past 30 days or 60 days in some situations. The laws regarding late payment and claims for unpaid accounts <b>payable</b> is related to the issue of accounts <b>payable.</b> An operating cycle for a firm is the average time that is required to go from cash to cash in producing revenues. For example, accounts <b>payable</b> for goods, services or supplies that were purchased for use in the operation of the business and <b>payable</b> within a normal period would be current liabilities. Amounts listed on a balance sheet as accounts <b>payable</b> represent allbills <b>payable</b> to vendors of a company, whether or not the bills are less than 31 days old or more than 30 days old. Therefore, late payments are not disclosed on the balance sheet for accounts <b>payable.</b> There may be footnotes in audited financial statements regarding age of accounts <b>payable,</b> but this is not common accounting practice. Lawsuits regarding accounts <b>payable</b> are required to be shown on audited financial statements, but this is not necessarily common accounting practice.|$|R

25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either accrual or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available to pay bills, and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. Accrual basis accounting matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about your business. The accrual basis allows you to track receivables (amounts due from customers on credit sales) and <b>payables</b> (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The accrual basis allows you to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports.|$|E
2500|$|A {{business}} will most often {{have more than}} one asset account. An essential asset account in any business is the business's bank account (see: [...] "Accounts pertaining to the five accounting elements" [...] below for more examples) The same applies to liability accounts i.e. if I have borrowed money from two sources (called creditors or <b>payables),</b> then I must open two accounts to represent this present liability, called 'Creditor/Payable A' and 'Creditor/Payable B'. In this manner I may have multiple, different accounts. However all these accounts are all classified as one of the five types of accounts, therefore my entire business can be described in terms of its assets, expenses, liabilities, income and equity/capital (see extended accounting equation). This is the extent of [...] "my" [...] business in relation to accounts, regardless of the business' practices (the business may be a retail franchise, furniture shop, restaurant, etc.). With respect to my business, each of the five accounting elements will have a monetary value, and this can be used to assess the financial position of my business at any time (my success, failure, or any other attributes that I might need to know).|$|E

50|$|An {{accounts}} payable is {{recorded in the}} Account Payable sub-ledger at the time an invoice is vouched for payment. Vouchered, or vouched, means that an invoice is approved for payment and has been recorded in the General Ledger or AP subledger as an outstanding, or open, liability because {{it has not been}} paid. <b>Payables</b> are often categorized as Trade <b>Payables,</b> <b>payables</b> for the purchase of physical goods that are recorded in Inventory, and Expense <b>Payables,</b> <b>payables</b> for the purchase of goods or services that are expensed. Common examples of Expense <b>Payables</b> are advertising, travel, entertainment, office supplies and utilities. A/P is a form of credit that suppliers offer to their customers by allowing them to pay for a product or service after it has already been received. Suppliers offer various payment terms for an invoice. Payment terms may include the offer of a cash discount for paying an invoice within a defined number of days. For example, 2%, Net 30 terms mean that the payer will deduct 2% from the invoice if payment is madewithin 30 days. If the payment is made on Day 31 then the full amount is paid.|$|E
