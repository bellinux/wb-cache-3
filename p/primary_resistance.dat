5|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>resistance</b> {{occurs when}} a person becomes {{infected}} with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid.

It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E

40|$|Goal: {{to study}} the structure, profile of <b>primary</b> drug <b>resistance</b> and {{viability}} of mycobacteria in tuberculosis patients with concurrent HIV infection. Materials and methods. Structure, profile of <b>primary</b> drug <b>resistance</b> and viability of mycobacteria were studied in 67 pulmonary tuberculosis patients with concurrent HIV infection.

25|$|The Communist regime {{solved the}} problem {{of a lack of}} film theaters by {{building}} mobile projection units which could tour the remote regions of China, ensuring that even the poorest could have access to films. By 1965 there were around 20,393 such units. The number of movie-viewers hence increased sharply, partly bolstered by the fact that film tickets were given out to work units and attendance was compulsory, with admissions rising from 47 million in 1949 to 4.15 billion in 1959. In the 17 years between the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Cultural Revolution, 603 feature films and 8,342 reels of documentaries and newsreels were produced, sponsored mostly as Communist propaganda by the government. For example, in Guerrilla on the Railroad (铁道游击队), dated 1956, the Chinese Communist Party was depicted as the <b>primary</b> <b>resistance</b> force against the Japanese in the war against invasion. Chinese filmmakers were sent to Moscow to study the Soviet socialist realism style of filmmaking. In 1956, the Beijing Film Academy was opened. One important film of this era is This Life of Mine (1950), directed by Shi Hu, which follows an old beggar reflecting on his past life as a policeman working for the various regimes since 1911. The first widescreen Chinese film was produced in 1960. Animated films using a variety of folk arts, such as papercuts, shadow plays, puppetry, and traditional paintings, also were very popular for entertaining and educating children. The most famous of these, the classic Havoc in Heaven (two parts, 1961, 4), was made by Wan Laiming of the Wan Brothers and won Outstanding Film award at the London International Film Festival.|$|E

Total RNA isolated from the index subject's mononuclear leukocytes was used to produce first strand hGR cDNAs, and the entire hGR cDNA was amplified in segments and sequenced. At nu-cleotide 2, 317 we identified a homozygous A for G point muta-tion that predicts an isoleucine (ATT) for valine (GT 1) substi-tution at amino acid 729. When the wild-type hGR and hGR-Ile 729 were expressed in COS- 1 cells and assayed for 13 H 1 -Dexamathasone binding, the dissociation constants were 0. 799 ± 0. 068 and 1. 54 ± 0. 06 nM (mean±SEM) (P < 0. 01), respectively. When the wild-type hGR and hGR-Ile 729 were expressed in CV- 1 cells that were cotransfected with the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat fused to the chlor-amphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene, the hGR-Ile 729 conferred a fourfold decrease in apparent potency on dexameth-asone stimulation of CAT activity.

Second-generation drugs offer improved potency and a greater likelihood of success in resistant patients.

5000|$|In {{the case}} when {{there is little or}} no <b>primary</b> <b>resistance</b> and little or no switch resistance, the {{increase}} of the magnetizing current Im is a [...] "linear ramp" [...] defined by the formula in the first paragraph. In {{the case when}} there is significant <b>primary</b> <b>resistance</b> or switch resistance or both (total resistance R, e.g. primary-coil resistance plus a resistor in the emitter, FET channel resistance), the Lp/R time constant causes the magnetizing current to be a rising curve with continually decreasing slope. In either case the magnetizing current Im will come to dominate the total primary (and switch) current Ip. Without a limiter it would increase forever. However, in the first case (low resistance), the switch will eventually be unable to [...] "support" [...] more current meaning that its effective resistance increases so much that the voltage drop across the switch equals the supply voltage; in this condition the switch is said to be [...] "saturated" [...] (e.g. this is determined by a transistor's gain hfe or [...] "beta"). In the second case (e.g. primary and/or emitter resistance dominant) the (decreasing) slope of the current decreases to a point such that the induced voltage into the secondary is no longer adequate to keep the switch closed. In a third case, the magnetic [...] "core" [...] material saturates, meaning it cannot support further increases in its magnetic field; in this condition induction from primary to secondary fails. In all cases, the rate of rise of the primary magnetizing current (and hence the flux), or the rate-of-rise of the flux directly in the case of saturated core material, drops to zero (or close to zero). In the first two cases, although primary current continues to flow, it approaches a steady value equal to the supply voltage Vb divided by the total resistance(s) R in the primary circuit. In this current-limited condition the transformer's flux will be steady. Only changing flux causes induction of voltage into the secondary, so a steady flux represents a failure of induction. The secondary voltage drops to zero. The switch opens.|$|E
