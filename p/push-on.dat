5|$|Józef Piłsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, {{determined}} that regaining control of Vilnius, whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, {{should be a}} priority of the renascent Polish state. He {{had been working on}} plans to take control of Vilnius since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a push in that direction—and counter an expected Soviet westward <b>push—on</b> March 26. One of Piłsudski's objectives was to take control of Vilnius before Western diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given to. The action was not discussed with Polish politicians or the government, who at that time were more concerned with the situation on the southern Polish–Ukrainian front. By early April, when members of the Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kresów) Michał Pius Römer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz Świtalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied Vilnius and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Piłsudski was ready to move.|$|E
60|$|The {{troops had}} taken {{four hours to}} do the eight miles; but the commissariat animals, as I have stated, were more than double that time upon the road. Both at Musgee and here {{there is a great}} lack of grain for the animals. One pound of grain was all they got yesterday, and to-day at twelve there is to be a similar large issue. If this sort of thing continues, the animals must inevitably break down. The drivers, after their day’s work was over, did go up into the hills and cut some grass; but the coarse grass {{contains}} very little nourishment, and the horses refuse to eat it. The mules eat it, indeed, but it can do them very little good. I have all along in my calculations of the probable duration of the campaign argued that we must expect to come to places where forage was not procurable, and that if we came to a place where for four days’ marches we could get no grain and but little grass, that we must come to a standstill and form dépôts. Of course the difficulty will be proportionately greater when we have the whole advance force, with its thousands of cavalry-horses and baggage-animals with us. We were to have started this morning at seven o’clock; but a messenger arrived at two this morning with a letter from the Commander-in-chief to General Staveley, saying that the road was so bad that we must halt for a day to enable the pioneer force to smooth some of the most impracticable places. We have also news of the head-quarters and three companies of the 33d who had pushed on by the “Phayre” road to Attala. They had a distance of fourteen miles to go, four of which they had comparatively cleared. They started early, and they got in the following day at twelve o’clock, having been twenty-eight hours on the road. The pioneer force is hard at work upon the road ahead, and to-morrow morning we start for Attala. It is stated to be an eight-mile march; but I hear that the opinion of those who have gone on is, that it is a good thirteen. At Attala I anticipate that we shall wait some days-that is, if forage is obtainable. Everything must now depend upon this vital point. We must <b>push-on</b> to some place where abundant forage can be obtained, and we must then wait {{for the remainder of the}} force to come up. This must entail a halt of some days, whenever it is; for the 3d Dragoon Guards and the 12th Bengal Cavalry were both some marches’ distance from Antalo when we left, and they will, of course, have to make a halt of a day or two at that place upon their advance, to rest their animals. I hear that in the neighbourhood of Lât there is plenty of forage; in that case Lât will probably be our halting-place, if we find we cannot obtain sufficient grass and grain at Attala. Sportsmen have been looking forward to our arrival at Lake Ashangi, as game is likely to be abundant in that neighbourhood, especially wild-fowl. We have received a letter from Mr. Massinger, which shows that any attempt at wild-fowl shooting either at early dawn or at dusk is likely to be attended with some little danger. It is, he says, very difficult, and even dangerous, to approach the shores of the lake. They are very flat, and the whole surface of the ground has been broken up into chasms and crevasses, which are filled with soft mud, and are not easily distinguishable from the surrounding soil. A long stick plunged into the soft mud found no bottom, and a person falling into one of these would, unless immediate assistance was at hand, be inevitably lost. The natives say that these crevasses were all formed by an earthquake which took place about three years ago. Previous to that time the lake had an outlet through which the overflow water made its way into the Tacazze. This outlet is now stopped, and the water has risen and filled all these chasms made by the earthquake.|$|E

Their early {{material}} {{was influenced by}} Australian rock bands AC/DC, The Angels, Billy Thorpe and Rose Tattoo. They recorded an eight-track extended play, Ready to Rock, which appeared in July 2004 as an independent self-funded release. By that time Jacobson was replaced by Justin Street (born c. 1986) on bass guitar - Ryan had met Street while stumbling home drunk from a party one night. In early 2005, the band relocated to Melbourne and in August, they signed a five album record deal with Capitol Records. According to Joel, while the band {{were living in a}} shared house they threw a party, and during listening to a Krokus CD, Rock the Block, a blown fuse resulted in a fire burning the back part of the house. The group have supported Mötley Crüe, Motörhead, Iron Maiden and The Rolling Stones, as well as performing at summer music festivals.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{silicones}} {{in these}} applications is much related to cable end terminations or silicone rubber connections {{made at the}} end of underground high voltage cables insulated with polyethylene, as well as to silicone insulators for power lines. Key benefits from silicones are their high electrical resistivity, resistance to environmental degradations and to electrical aging as well as their hydrophobicity, which results in lower assembly and maintenance costs [1 - 2]. Silicone Cable End Terminations Modern materials allow pre-assembly and thus avoid problems {{associated with the use of}} molten casting material or mistakes made during manual assembly on the construction site. Today cable accessories are completely built at the supplier. Typically they consist of rubber terminations made of different insulating silicone rubbers.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the performance of}} jointed pipelines subject to ground deformations triggered at a large scale by earthquakes and a construction-related scale by tunneling. Understanding and quantifying jointed pipeline response at these scales allows for better design, operational management, and risk assessment of underground infrastructure, where cast iron (CI) and ductile iron (DI) pipelines in the U. S. account for approximately 75 % of water distribution systems. The thesis covers the response of DI and molecularly oriented polyvinyl chloride (PVCO) pipelines to earthquaketriggered soil movement as well as CI and DI pipeline response to tunneling. A series of specially designed four-point bending experiments and 3 D finite-element (FE) simulations were performed to characterize DI <b>push-on</b> joints commonly used in water distribution systems to develop {{a relationship between the}} rotation and axial pullout at both metal binding and first leakage. The results of uniaxial tension and onedimensional compression tests on the elastomeric gaskets in DI <b>push-on</b> joints were implemented in numerical models that show joint leakage to be independent of load path, with a unique pressure boundary that predicts leakage for many combinations of axial pullout and rotation. The increased circumferential strength, reduced pipe wall thickness, and enhanced cross-sectional flexibility of PVCO pipelines was evaluated through the characterization of PVCO material properties, axial joint tension and compression tests, four-point bending tests, and a full-scale fault rupture experiment. A nominal 150 -mm (6 -in.) diameter PVCO pipeline is able to accommodate significant fault movement through axial tensile and bending strains in the pipe in combination with modest levels of axial slip at the restrained joints. Relatively large levels of axial strain in the low modulus PVCO material, which varies between 1 % and 2 % at pipeline failure, are able to sustain substantial extension and compression from ground movements. Soil/pipeline interaction modeling was performed for vertical and horizontal ground movements caused by tunneling in jointed CI and DI pipelines perpendicular to the tunnel centerline that (1) extend beyond the width of the settlement profile and (2) connect through 90 ° tees with a pipeline parallel to the tunnel. The modeling incorporates the results of large-scale laboratory tests. Guidance is provided for design and the identification before tunneling of potential difficulties. In particular, CI tees are at high risk when subject to tunneling induced soil movement, whereas DI pipelines and tees have sufficient capacity to accommodate high levels of tunneling related ground deformation. i...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} a {{study of}} how vehicle features contribute to CRS installation errors. Thirty-two subjects were recruited based on their education level (low or high) and experience with installing CRS (none or experienced). Each subject was asked to perform four child restraint installations in three vehicles. Each subject first performed a CRS installation with a seatbelt in one vehicle, followed by three CRS installations using LATCH, one in each of three vehicles. One child restraint with a hook-on LATCH connector and one with a <b>push-on</b> LATCH connector were used. All installations were forward-facing, using an 18 -month-old CRABI anthropomorphic test device (ATD). Six vehicles were used in testing, with half of subjects testing with each vehicle. Conditions were selected to provide a range of LATCH locations (visible, above seating surface, buried in bight), buckle stalk types (webbing vs. rigid), and tether locations (package shelf vs. seatback). After each installation, the experimenter evaluated 28 factors for each installation (such as tightness of installation, tether tightness, and LATCH belt attached correctly). Analyses used linear mixed models to identify the CRS installation outcomes associated with vehicle features. For LATCH installations, vehicles requiring higher forces to attach connectors to lower anchorages {{were more likely to}} be attached incorrectly. Vehicle seats with a bightline waterfall (which places the lower anchorage above the seating surface) increased rates of tight CRS installation for both seatbelt and LATCH installs. Seatbelt installations were tight (and locked) more frequently when the buckle stalk was located close to the bight rather than further forward. Subjects used the tether correctly in 30 % of installations. Subjects used the tether more frequently during LATCH installations compared to seatbelt installations. The tether was used more frequently in sedans (with anchorage locations on the package shelf) than in vehicles with the tether anchorage located on the seatback. However, when the tether was used, it was routed correctly more often in vehicles with the tether anchorage on the seatback. A tether wrap around distance of 210 mm was sufficient to allow tightening of the tether with the two CRS tested, but additional testing showed that 5 / 16 CRS could not be tightened sufficiently with this wrap around distance. Installation time decreased with successive trials, but installation time was longer when subjects used the vehicle or CRS manuals. Subjects used the vehicle manual in 38 % of installations, and were more likely to do so when the tether anchorage was located on the vehicle seatback. Subjects used the CRS manual in 88 % of installations. In questionnaire responses, subjects indicated that the head restraints affected installations, and vehicle manuals varied in their ease of understanding. They also noted that tether anchorages on seatbacks were more difficult to locate than those on the package shelf. Results from this study do not fully support SAE and ISO recommendations for LATCH usability in vehicles. Recommendations ar...|$|E
