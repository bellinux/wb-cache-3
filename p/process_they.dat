Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began moving down the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the <b>process.</b> <b>They</b> also had to cross a -wide stream in the retreat, and some drowned in the process.

5|$|Best {{friends who}} are like {{brothers}} Kim Hyun-jun (Lee Byung-hun) and Jin Sa-woo (Jung Joon-ho), were training under the South Korean army's 707th Special Mission Battalion until they were scouted by NSS (National Security Service). The duo was independently scouted by the beautiful NSS agent, Choi Seung-hee (Kim Tae-hee). Unaware they have been scouted, the two were secretly captured and subjected through a simulated torture test, and both passed their test to be worthy NSS agents.

5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the <b>process.</b> <b>They</b> begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, almost 150 {{years after}} the Byne's disease was first {{mentioned}} in the literature, Norman H. Tennent and Thomas Baird published an extensive study on the subject. Their deep analysis, involving many complex and sophisticated techniques such as X-Ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, finally revealed {{the true nature of}} the decaying <b>process.</b> <b>They</b> identified the substances involved (the calcium salts), as well as the chemical reactions that originated them. They concluded that Byne's disease is not actually a disease, and is in fact caused by simple chemical reactions which occur in the presence of acidic vapors originating from the immediate environment in which the specimens are stored.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Panthers {{were moved}} to the NFC South after the NFL realigned their {{divisions}} due to the Houston Texans joining the league as an expansion team. Over their 20 seasons in the NFL, the Panthers have played in over 300 games, winning 6 division titles (one in the NFC West and five in the NFC South) and reaching the NFL playoffs 7 times. The Panthers have never had back-to-back winning seasons, but recorded their first back-to-back-to-back playoff seasons in 2013 and 2014, becoming the first team {{in the history of}} the NFC South to win consecutive division titles in the <b>process.</b> <b>They</b> won a third consecutive division title in 2015, finishing with a league-best 15–1 record and securing homefield advantage in the playoffs for the first time in team history.|$|E

5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture <b>process.</b> <b>They</b> often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|Long-time {{assistant}} coach Brian Schmetzer {{was promoted to}} interim head coach. The same day, the club announced their signing of Uruguayan midfielder Nicolás Lodeiro on a designated player contract, {{as well as the}} return of former designated player Álvaro Fernández. Despite the sluggish start as well as the loss of midfielder Clint Dempsey, who was forced in August to stop playing after evaluations for an irregular heartbeat, the Sounders turned their season around with 8 wins, 2 losses, and 4 draws. In the <b>process,</b> <b>they</b> came back from 9th to 4th in the Western Conference and qualified for the 2016 MLS Cup Playoffs. Schmetzer was named as permanent head coach as a result.|$|E
