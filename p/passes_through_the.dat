5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth <b>passes</b> <b>through.</b> <b>The</b> Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E

50|$|Canaseraga Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Genesee River, and Interstate 390 <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> town. New York State Route 36 parallels the Interstate. The former Genesee Valley Canal <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> town.|$|R
5|$|The road {{begins at}} a remote {{interchange}} with US 101 south of King City in the Salinas River Valley. Leaving US 101, SR 198 <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Priest Valley, climbs the Diablo Range as a two-lane road and crosses over an unnamed pass. It then descends along Warthan Canyon {{to the town}} of Coalinga in the agricultural Central Valley, where it briefly runs concurrently with SR 33. On both sides of Coalinga the road <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> enormous Coalinga Oil Field.|$|E
5|$|Air that <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> phonic lips passes {{into the}} distal sac, then back {{down through the}} left nasal passage. This {{recycling}} of air allows the whale to continuously generate clicks {{for as long as}} it is submerged.|$|E
5|$|As {{the signal}} <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> satellite, it is {{translated}} by—added to—a signal generated by an oscillator in the satellite. Although the oscillator {{is housed in}} a temperature-controlled enclosure, it is subjected to thermal variation throughout the day that results in minor changes {{in the frequency of}} the translation signal. The thermal variation results from the rotation of the satellite relative to the sun over a given 24-hour period, including the time the satellite <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Earth's shadow (which affected the 3:40 and 4:26 handshakes), and is complicated by the use of heaters that run when the oscillator temperature exits pre-determined limits. The variation in the translation frequency was calculated over several days, including the day of Flight 370's disappearance, and could be factored into the BFO measurement.|$|E
50|$|The city is well {{connected}} by roads. The three state highways <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city: SH-12(Jewargi-Sankeshwar), SH-31(Jath-Jambothi), and SH-72 (Nippani-muhanddi). Four major roads <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city.the national highway (vijapur-sankeshwar) is sanctioned.|$|R

50|$|County road 150 <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{parish in}} an east-west direction. Some smaller roads <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> parish as wells. These roads do {{to a large}} extent follow old trade route, given the name Via Regia.|$|R
5|$|Baylis Street in the CBD was a {{thoroughfare}} for the Olympic Highway {{until the}} Gobbagombalin Bridge (referred to locally as the Gobba Bridge and {{is believed to}} be the longest continuous-span viaduct in New South Wales) about 6km northwest of the CBD was opened on 26 July 1997.

5|$|East of Ajax, {{the highway}} <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> second 3.5km (2.1mi) rural gap, and enters Whitby. The stretch of Highway401 through Whitby and Oshawa {{features}} several structures completed {{during the initial}} construction of the highway in the 1940s. Several of these structures are to be demolished, either due to their age, or {{to prepare for the}} planned widening of Highway401 through this area.|$|E
5|$|From {{being the}} largest port in the world, the Port of London is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, {{handling}} 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.

25|$|The bubbles {{which are}} {{small enough to}} <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> lung {{capillaries}} may be small enough to be dissolved due {{to a combination of}} surface tension and diffusion to a lowered concentration in the surrounding blood, though the Varying Permeability Model nucleation theory implies that most bubbles <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> pulmonary circulation will lose enough gas to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> capillaries and return to the systemic circulation as recycled but stable nuclei.|$|R
50|$|Two {{lines of}} Mumbai Metro(Line 2 and Line 7) will <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{neighborhood}} once operational. Line 2 will <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> Link Road {{on the western}} part and Line 7 will <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> main arterial Western Urban road {{on the eastern side}} of the neighborhood.|$|R
5|$|In 2002–2003 Galileo {{spacecraft}} had two <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gossamer rings. During them its {{dust counter}} detected dust {{particles in the}} size range 0.2–5μm. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft's star scanner detected small, discrete bodies (< 1 km) near Amalthea. These may represent collisional debris generated from impacts with this satellite.|$|E
5|$|June 30, 2010– Tropical Storm Alex <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> area {{affected}} by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, causing tarballs from the spill as large as apples to wash onshore portions of the panhandle from high storm tides created by the storm.|$|E
5|$|North of downtown, {{the highway}} {{passes through a}} {{residential}} area {{and out of the}} city. The landscape returns to farm fields as M-83 follows Gera Road due north again.

50|$|While stones can {{frequently}} <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> common {{bile duct}} (CBD) into the duodenum, some stones may be too large to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> CBD and may cause an obstruction. One risk factor for this is duodenal diverticulum.|$|R
