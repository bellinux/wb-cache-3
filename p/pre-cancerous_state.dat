40|$|Background: It is {{frequently}} assumed that pre-invasive lesions are simpler precursors of cancer, and will contain a limited {{subset of the}} genomic changes seen in their associated invasive disease. Driver mutations are thought to occur early, {{but it is not}} known how many of these are present in pre-invasive lesions. These assumptions need to be tested with the increasing focus on both personalised cancer treatments, and early detection methodologies. Methods: We examined genomic copy number changes in 256 pre-invasive and invasive samples from 69 oral cancer patients. Forty-eight samples from 16 patients were further examined using exome sequencing. Results: Evidence of a shared ancestor of both dysplasia and carcinoma was seen in all but one patient. One third of dysplasias showed independent copy number events. The remainder had a similar or simpler copy number pattern to the carcinoma. All dysplasias examined contained somatic mutations absent in the related carcinoma. Previously observed copy number changes and TP 53 mutations were very frequently observed, and almost always shared between dysplasia and carcinoma. Other gene changes were more sporadic. Pathway analysis confirmed that each patient’s disease developed in a different way. Examining the numbers of shared mutations, and the rate of accumulation of mutations showed evidence that all samples contain a population of sub-clones, with little evidence of selective advantage of a subset of these. Conclusions: These findings suggest that most of the genomic changes driving oral cancer occur in the <b>pre-cancerous</b> <b>state</b> by way of gradual random accumulation rather than a dramatic single event...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) are benign forms that require no treatment {{but can be}} considered as a <b>pre-cancerous</b> <b>state.</b> Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is quite frequent, and related to age. The risk of progression to multiple myeloma or another type of malignant lymphoproliferation is estimated at 1 % per year. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is twice as frequent in patients of African descent, and prevalence is higher for men. Diagnosis of MGUS is made on evidence of a monoclonal component < 30 g/L and no CRAB criteria (hypercalcaemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia, bone lesions). Regular monitoring is required for all MGUS because they can develop into other lymphoproliferative disorders such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma and other haematologic malignancies. In view of the genetic, insular and environmental context specificities of Caribbean populations of African descent, and according to haemophilia trends of the French West Indies cancer registry, {{it will be interesting to}} determine incidence and prevalence of MGUS in a country in the Caribbean. No such study has been performed to date. There is a hypothesis for a possible geographic distribution of these blood disorders linked to environmental exposure to pesticides. The expected findings and their potential repercussions will have major public health interest, and should form the basis for a wider prognostic study to determine risk factors for MGUS in the French Caribbean. In a real life exhaustive study, the Martinique Cancer Registry proposes an epidemiological focus on MGUS in Martinique...|$|E
40|$|Isolation of hepatocytes from cirrhotic human livers and {{subsequent}} primary culture are important new tools for laboratory research and cell-based therapeutics {{in the study}} of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using such techniques, we have previously identified different subpopulations of human hepatocytes and among them one is showing a progressive transformation of hepatocytes in HCC-like cells. We have hypothesized that increasing the distance from the neoplastic lesion might affect hepatocyte function and transformation capacity. However, limited information is available in comparing the growth and proliferation of human hepatocytes obtained from different areas of the same cirrhotic liver in relation to their distance from the HCC lesion. In this study, hepatocytes from 10 patients with cirrhosis and HCC undergoing surgical resections from specimens obtained at a proximal (CP) and distal (CD) distance from the HCC lesion were isolated and placed in primary culture. CP hepatocytes (CP-Hep) were isolated between 1 to 3 cm (leaving at least 1 cm margin to avoid cancer cells and/or satellite lesions), while CD hepatocytes (CD-Hep) were isolated from more than 5 cm or from the contralateral-lobe. A statistical model was built to analyze the proliferation rates of these cells and we evaluated expression of HCC markers (Glypican- 3 (GPC 3), αSmooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA) and PCNA). We observed a significant difference in proliferation and in-vitro growth showing that CP-Hep had a proliferation pattern and rate significantly different than CD-Hep. Based on these data, this model can provide information to predict growth of human hepatocytes in primary culture in relation to their <b>pre-cancerous</b> <b>state</b> with significant differences in the HCC markers expression. This model provides an important innovative tool for in-vitro analysis of HCC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It is {{estimated}} that Haiti has the highest incidence of cervical cancer in the Western Hemisphere. There are currently no sustainable and affordable cervical cancer screening programs in Haiti. The current status of screening services and knowledge of health care professionals was assessed through a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices survey on cervical cancer screening and prevention. It was distributed to Project Medishare for Haiti health care workers (n = 27) in the Central Plateau. The majority (22 / 27) of participants <b>stated</b> <b>pre-cancerous</b> cells could be detected through screening, however, only four had ever performed a pap smear. All of the participants felt a screening program should be started in their area. Our data establishes that knowledge is fairly lacking among healthcare workers {{and there is an}} opportunity to train them in simple, cost effective “screen-and-treat ” programs that could have a great impact on the overall health o...|$|R
40|$|Background: Advanced {{diagnostic}} tools stand {{today at}} the heart of successful cancer treatment. CellDetect &# 174; is a new histochemical staining technology that enables color discrimination between normal cells and a wide variety of neoplastic tissues. Using this technology, normal cells are colored blue/green, while neoplastic cells color red. This tinctorial difference coincides with clear morphological visualization properties, mainly in tissue samples. Here we show that the CellDetect &# 174; technology can be deployed to distinguish normal cells from transformed cells and most significantly detect cells in their early <b>pre-cancerous</b> transformed <b>state.</b> Materials and Methods: In tissue culture, we studied the ability of the CellDetect &# 174; technology to color discriminate foci in a number of two stage transformation systems as well as in a well defined cellular model for cervical cancer development, using HPV 16 transformed keratinocytes. Results: In all these cellular systems, the CellDetect &# 174; technology was able to sensitively show that all transformed cells, including pre-cancerous HPV 16 transformed cells, are colored red, whereas normal cells are colored blue/green. The staining technology was able to pick up: (i) early transformation events in the form of small type 1 foci (non-invasive, not piled up small, with parallel alignment of cells), and (ii) early HPV 16 transformed cells, even prior to their ability to form colonies in soft agar. The study shows the utility of the CellDetect &# 174; technology in early detection of transformation events...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{potentially}} malignant lesions (OPMLs) with dysplasia and aneuploidy {{are thought}} to have a high risk of progression into oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). Non-dysplastic “oral distant fields” (ODFs), characterized by clinically normal appearing mucosa sited at a distance from co-existing OPMLs, and non-dysplastic OPMLs may also represent an early <b>pre-cancerous</b> <b>state.</b> ODFs, OPMLs without and with dysplasia and OSCCs were investigated by high resolution DNA content flow cytometry (FCM). ODFs and OPMLs without dysplasia were DNA aneuploid respectively in 7 / 82 (8. 5 %) and 25 / 109 (23 %) cases. “True normal oral mucosa” and human lymphocytes from healthy donors were DNA diploid in all cases and were used as sex specific DNA diploid controls. Dysplastic OPMLs and OSCCs were DNA aneuploid in 12 / 26 (46 %) and 12 / 13 (92 %) cases. The DNA aneuploid sublines were characterized by the DNA Index (DI ≠ 1). Aneuploid sublines in ODFs and in non-dysplastic and dysplastic OPMLs were near-diploid (DI < 1. 4) respectively in all, 2 / 3 and 1 / 3 of the cases. DNA aneuploid OSCCs, instead, were characterized prevalently by multiple aneuploid sublines (67 %), which were commonly (57 %) high-aneuploid (DI ≥ 1. 4). DNA near-diploid aneuploid sublines in ODFs and OPMLs appear as early events of the oral carcinogenesis in agreement with the concept of field effect. Near-diploid aneuploidization is likely to reflect mechanisms of loss of symmetry in the chromosome mitotic division. High DNA aneuploid and multiple sublines in OPMLs with dysplasia and OSCCs suggest, instead, mechanisms of “endoreduplication” of diploid and near-diploid aneuploid cells and chromosomal loss. High resolution DNA FCM seems to enable the separation of subsequent progression steps of the oral carcinogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has significantly increased in Europe {{over the last}} 30 years. The progression from normal mucosa to adenocarcinoma {{has been associated with}} genetic and morphological traits regrouped under the term "intra-epithelial neoplasia" (IEN) according to the Vienna classification. The early detection of such lesions represents {{the first step in the}} identification of high-risk patients. The morphological criteria of IEN are the gold standard to identify such patients. Firstly described by Riddell et al in 1983, IEN is based on morphological criteria including both cytological and architectural alterations and is classified into different stages of severity. However, large studies have clearly demonstrated the lack of reproducibility, with large inter-individual discrepancies for both discrete and severe lesions. Discrepancies between high grade IEN and adenocarcinoma can be minimized by using the Vienna classification, which groups both of these lesions under the "stage IV". Discrepancies between low-grade IEN and uncertain lesions remain too important. Erroneous and overstated diagnosis of low grade IEN induces an unnecessary follow-up of patients with obvious psychological and economic consequences. Recent studies have demonstrated that the reading of the slides by 2 to 3 gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists significantly decreases interpretation mistakes. Because of these interpretation problems, scientists have looked for non-morphological criteria to confirm the <b>pre-cancerous</b> <b>state.</b> The current PubMed literature proposes many putative biomarkers. However, none of these has been correctly validated in large prospective case-control studies, which hampers their use in clinical routine. DNA quantification by flux cytometry and morphometry represent alternative methods of documenting IEN but these techniques are complex and expensive. The use of the proliferation marker Ki 67 needs deep sampling with correct orientation and standardized cell counting. P 504 S has been studied in Barrett's disease and might be a novel tool. The only promising tool thus far is the overexpression of p 53 as shown in prospective studies demonstrating a nice correlation with clinical evolution and is easy to use in clinical routine.

40|$|Cell {{polarity}} is {{an important}} regulator of cellular processes and is vital in helping to prevent metaplasia and tumorigenesis. There are three many polarity complexes that regulate and maintain epithelial cellular polarity. The Par and Crumbs complexes locate to the apical membrane of the cell, while the Scribble complex is located basolaterally. Of the Scribble complex components, the polarity protein Hugl 1, also known as Mgl 1 in mice, is especially important in helping to maintain apical basolateral and planar polarity, and is lost in multiple types of cancer. When Hugl 1 expression is lost in epithelial cells, it results in a mesenchymal phenotype. We now show {{that the loss of}} Hugl 1 fundamentally shifts the cellular phenotype and specifically alters EGFR trafficking and signaling. Loss of Hugl 1 results in the nuclear translocation of Taz and Slug, increased migration, and the mislocalization of EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), driving cellular growth. Hugl 1 regulates the expression of multiple cell identity markers and its loss results in stem cell characteristics, including the increased expression of CD 44, and a decrease of CD 49 f and CD 24 expression. The loss of Hugl 1 also results in increased growth in soft-agar and prolonged survival when transplanted into NOD-SCID mice; its loss also results in EGF-dependent migration which aids in increasing mammosphere survival. Furthermore, isolated EGFR mislocalization via a point mutation (P 667 A) also drives these same phenotypes, including activation of Akt and Taz nuclear translocation, indicating the importance of Hugl 1 in the regulation of EGFR localization and its signaling. In mice, the loss of total Mgl 1 is lethal within days of birth due to hydrocephaly and results in the formation of rosette like structures in the brain that are reminiscent of neuroectodermal tumors. We designed a targeted Mgl 1 knockout in the mammary epithelial cells using the Cre/Lox system to evaluate the effects of Mgl 1 loss in murine mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. The loss of Mgl 1 expression in mice inhibits ductal outgrowth, increases side branching and epithelial layers, and results in the mislocalization of EGFR. While overt mammary tumors did not develop, some individuals did develop hyperplastic nodules that could progress into cancer. The knockdown of Hugl 1 in vitro and Mgl 1 in vivo reveal how the loss of polarity and presence of Hugl 1 results in cancer stem cell characteristics, increased migration, and abnormal signaling due to the mislocalization of EGFR. While these changes result in metaplasia and a potential <b>pre-cancerous</b> <b>state,</b> the loss of Hugl 1 alone is not enough to drive the cancer progression, indicating that other mutations or factors are necessary for the development of breast cancer. Because of the key role polarity plays in the prevention of breast cancer development we investigated if the addition of Hugl 1 back into breast cancer cells could revert the cancerous cells to a normal epithelial phenotype. Most of the breast cancer cells transfected with Hugl 1 expression did not survive, indicating that the re-expression of polarity regulators forces cancer cells to die. The small percentage of cells that did survive re-expression of Hugl 1 had retarded growth in soft agar and a decrease in EGFR expression. Together, these data indicate that Hugl 1 expression and EGFR activity are closely related and that Hugl 1 is required for the proper localization and signaling of EGFR. When Hugl 1 is lost, EGFR is mislocalized and fails to be degraded properly, promoting pre-neoplastic changes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and different cancer states were treated with various agents and compared with lymphocytes from healthy control individuals (HCI) treated {{in the same way}} and measured in the Comet assay. For inflammatory bowel disease, patient¿s responses in IBD patients treated with H 2 O 2 were higher than in HCI and crohn¿s patients (CD) were found to have higher responses than Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. The responses for all IBD and HCI were all reduced in the presence of chaga mushroom extract which behaved in an antioxidant manner. A second group of IBD patients were treated with the heterocyclic amine (food mutagen), IQ and H 2 O 2 and responses were reduced {{in the presence of the}} flavonoids, quercetin and epicatechin and compared with HCI similarity treated. In all cells responses were reduced with flavonoids and again CD had higher responses than the UC patients and IBD patients higher than HCI. The responses with CD and UC were that confirmed in two independent studies with IBD, one with chaga mushroom extract and the other with flavonoids. Peripheral lymphocytes from malignant melanoma and suspected melanoma patients and colon cancer and polyposis patients were compared to the lymphocytes from HCI and treated with UVA. There were differential sensitivities when measured in the micronucleus and Comet assays. The cancer patients had higher responses than those in the precancerous states and they in turn were higher than responses in HCI. In all the studies, untreated baseline DNA damage values were also higher in IBD and cancer patients and pre-cancerous patients than HCIs. This would suggest that baseline frequencies of different diseases compared to controls could be an important biomarker in the diagnosis of pre-cancers and early stage cancers. Also peripheral lymphocytes are a useful surrogate for cancers and <b>pre-cancerous</b> disease <b>states</b> since, blood is present in all organs and tissues and DNA is basically the same in all cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Computational {{analysis}} of tissue structure reveals sub-visual differences in tissue functional states by extracting quantitative signature features that establish a diagnostic profile. Incomplete and/or inaccurate profiles contribute to misdiagnosis. Methods In {{order to create}} more complete tissue structure profiles, we adapted our cell-graph method for extracting quantitative features from histopathology images to now capture temporospatial traits of three-dimensional collagen hydrogel cell cultures. Cell-graphs were proposed to characterize the spatial organization between the cells in tissues by exploiting graph theory wherein the nuclei of the cells constitute the nodes and the approximate adjacency of cells are represented with edges. We chose 11 different cell types representing non-tumorigenic, <b>pre-cancerous,</b> and malignant <b>states</b> from multiple tissue origins. Results We built cell-graphs from the cellular hydrogel images and computed a large set of features describing the structural characteristics captured by the graphs over time. Using three-mode tensor analysis, we identified the five most significant features (metrics) that capture the compactness, clustering, and spatial uniformity of the 3 D architectural changes for each cell type throughout the time course. Importantly, four of these metrics are also the discriminative features for our histopathology data from our previous studies. Conclusions Together, these descriptive metrics provide rigorous quantitative representations of image information that other image analysis methods do not. Examining the changes in these five metrics allowed us to easily discriminate between all 11 cell types, whereas differences from visual examination of the images are not as apparent. These results demonstrate that application of the cell-graph technique to 3 D image data yields discriminative metrics that {{have the potential to}} improve the accuracy of image-based tissue profiles, and thus improve the detection and diagnosis of disease. </p...|$|R
