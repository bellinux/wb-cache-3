The impact and penetration process was observed with five flash X-rays and a 16 -frame high-speed optical camera. A FF propagates from the impact region.

We used Ba-DupLac, a recombinant PRV strain, for the tracing experiments since this virus was demonstrated to exhibit much more restricted transportation kinetics than that of PRV Bartha, and is therefore more suitable for studies of neuronal plasticity. Ba-Duplac injection primarily infected several neurons around the <b>penetration</b> <b>channel,</b> but hardly any transcallosally infected neurons were observed in the contraleral MI. In contrast, after right facial nerve injury, Ba-DupLac was transported from the primarily infected neurons in the left MI to the contralateral side, and resulted in the labeling of several neurons due to a transneuronal infection. These results reveal that a peripheral nerve injury induces changes in the Ba-DupLac infection pattern in the related cortical areas.

Also included in this work {{is an attempt to}} validate mathematical modelling of experimental results {{through the use of a}} computer hydrocode, AUTODYN- 2 D, which allows for the simulation of ballistic penetration/perforation events and possible differentiation of fundamental mechanisms through validation strategies. These targets represent two very different FCC materials. The 7039 aluminum is extremely hard in contrast to a softer, ductile copper. The “failure” mechanisms appear to be different on a macroscopic scale, but may be similar on a microscopic scale. ^ A preliminary investigation of the residual <b>penetration</b> <b>channels</b> in these two targets revealed significant microstructural differences. In the 7039 aluminum target there is a limited extent of microstructural deformation seen through optical microscopy, though numerous shear bands are observed near the channel wall and at the spalled region. Observations of the OHFC target, on the other hand, show a narrow region of recrystallized grains adjacent to the crater wall, beyond which is an extensive area of microband clusters. Similar features have been observed previously in connection with hypervelocity impact cratering in copper. ^ This investigation will attempt to provide clues to the fundamental issues involved in the differing dynamic behavior of the two FCC materials. A detailed analysis of microstructures and their evolution will be conducted through metallography and transmission electron microscopy. Microhardness measurements will be performed to correlate the results of ballistic computer simulations through residual stress and hardness profiles. Computational modeling will be used to simulate the impact behavior of the two target materials and will be corroborated by experimental results to establish a validation of perforation geometry and residual stress mappings which can be related to actual residual hardness maps constructed experimentally. ^ This study is an attempt to correlate microstructural issues with computer simulations and especially validation of these simulations to improve predictive models and general ballistic and hypervelocity perforation behavior in metal targets. ...|$|R

In this paper, the effect of oxygen introduced by the process of conventional furnace annealing in FUSI metal gate is investigated. A 120 nm amorphous Si layer was sputtered on dielectric oxides of various thicknesses grown using a standard oxidation process. Raman spectra showed that the 120 nm thick pre-sputtered amorphous Si recrystallized after annealing in a conventional furnace at 900 °C. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) revealed that the annealed Si film contained traces of oxygen which were incorporated into the film during the furnace annealing process. It is suspected that the oxygen was originated from a few ppm of impurities present in the high-purity annealing gas (N 2). When a 100 nm of Ni was deposited using a DC sputterer on such sample and was rapid thermal annealed (RTA) at 400 °C to form a fully silicide film, the transmission electron micrograph showed the existence of unreacted oxygen-rich Si layer along the interface of the NiSi/SiO 2, leading to areal non-uniformity in the workfunction. It is suggested that the presence of oxygen can effectively retard the Ni diffusion into the Si film during the silicidation process such that the FUSI process is delayed, and the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) increased as shown by capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. The workfunction of Ni-silicided FUSI film determined by C-V measurement on MOS structures was found to increase compared to the as-deposited amorphous Si film (the control sample).
