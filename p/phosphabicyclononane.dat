40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{performances of}} three <b>Phosphabicyclononane</b> (Phoban) -containing ruthenium-based pre-catalysts {{have been evaluated}} for metathesis transformations. A wide screening of substrates in ring-closing metathesis reactions reveals the greater efficiency of pre-catalyst 4. Comparison of the catalytic activities of 4 with Grubbs' first-generation pre-catalyst illustrates the key role of the Phoban ligand. Additionally, a comparative study of three Phoban-containing pre-catalysts has been conducted for the self-metathesis of I-octene at low catalyst loading (25 - 100 ppm) ...|$|E
