40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{document}} is to provide complementary information on psychophysical experiments described in Sections 7 and 8. The experimental methods are described in the main paper, and here missing details concerning <b>participants,</b> materials <b>and</b> <b>apparatus,</b> experimental procedure <b>and</b> statistical data are given. 1. Participants 14 participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision {{took part in the}} „Rating ” and „Artifacts ” experiments. Only a subset of 10 participants took part in the „Game ” and „Stereo Vision ” experiments, as well as additional study over the „Camel ” scene. Subjects were compensated for their efforts with a small fee (14 $). Participants were recruited from the university campus and were mostly students of computer science. Subjects were naïve regarding the goal of the experiment and inexperienced in the field of computer graphics. 2. Materials <b>and</b> <b>Apparatus</b> All stimuli were presented on a 22 inch (diagonal) Samsun...|$|R
