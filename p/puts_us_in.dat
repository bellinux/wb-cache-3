2500|$|Lincoln's {{notification}} {{had been}} made to the governor of South Carolina, not the new Confederate government, which Lincoln did not recognize. Pickens consulted with Beauregard, the local Confederate commander. Soon President Davis ordered Beauregard to repeat the demand for Sumter's surrender, and if it did not, to reduce the fort before the relief expedition arrived. The Confederate cabinet, meeting in Montgomery, endorsed Davis's order on April 9. Only Secretary of State Robert Toombs opposed this decision: he reportedly told Jefferson Davis the attack [...] "will lose us every friend at the North. You will only strike a hornet's nest. ... Legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us to death. It is unnecessary. It <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the wrong. It is fatal." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} Obama never {{mentioned}} the word [...] "terrorism" [...] or [...] "terror" [...] was positively interpreted {{by many in}} the Muslim street, given that many of them see a 'war on terror' interchangeably as a 'war on Islam'. American conservatives also picked up on this and argued that it weakened Obama's overall message. House Republican leader John Boehner also commented after the speech that Obama [...] "seemed to place equal blame on the Israelis and the Palestinians.... I have concerns about that because Hamas is a terrorist organisation". As well, he said, [...] "here he continues to say he will sit down with the Iranians without any preconditions, I just think that that <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> a position where America looks weak in the eyes of their rulers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The website of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) was hacked and defaced with {{a message}} to Håkan Roswall, the {{prosecutor}} in the trial. The website subsequently became inaccessible, possibly owing to a denial-of-service attack. It was shortly brought back online. Peter Sunde, one of the defendants, responded to news of the attack with the comment [...] "Our case is going quite well as most of you have noticed. In the light of that it feels very bad that people are hacking web sites which actually <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> a worse light than {{we need to be}} in." [...] To the perpetrators of the attack he also pleaded, [...] "If anyone involved in the acts going on is reading this—please stop, for our sake. We don’t need that kind of support." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2011, the {{president}} and CEO of Diamond Aircraft Canada, Peter Maurer, indicated that his company's future was in doubt and relied on getting the D-Jet to market, as piston sales remained slow {{since the start of}} the Great Recession in 2007. To get the D-Jet into production the company found $20M in private investment, plus the commitment of an additional $35M from the Government of Ontario. The Ontario government investment was contingent on Diamond also securing an additional $35M from the Government of Canada. If both federal and provincial loans were provided then, combined with funds already provided, the total provincial and federal government investment would have been $100M. Maurer indicated [...] "If we don’t get the funding from the federal government, it <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> a difficult situation. If the D-JET, for example, in a worse case scenario, were not to continue it would have a negative impact on the rest of the company’s operations. [...] at a level that would be very difficult to satisfy out of piston sales,” he said. “I’ll let you do the extrapolation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Summing {{up while}} {{alluding}} to the politically motivated attacks that prevented Hunt's fuller acceptance as a major literary figure in his time, Hazlitt draws a comparison with certain gentleman-poets of an earlier age, integrating this with what he has noted of Hunt's personal vanity: [...] "We have said that Lord Byron is a sublime coxcomb: why should we not say that Mr. Hunt is a delightful one? ... He is the only poet or literary man we ever knew who <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> mind of Sir John Suckling or Killigrew or Carew; or who united rare intellectual acquirements with outward grace and natural gentility. ... A wit and a poet, Mr. Hunt is also distinguished by fineness of tact and sterling sense: he has only been a visionary in humanity, the fool of virtue." [...] And here Hazlitt brings in {{the main reason for}} the hostile politically oriented attacks on him in Tory periodicals, his notorious criticism of the Prince Regent in his own periodical: [...] "What then is the draw-back to so many shining qualities, that has made them useless, or even hurtful to their owner? His crime is, to have been Editor of the Examiner ten years ago ...".|$|E
2500|$|Later that day, Bethmann Hollweg sent {{a message}} to the German {{ambassador}} to Vienna increasing pressure to accept the halt-in-Belgrade proposal, saying that: [...] "If Vienna... refuses... to give way at all, it will hardly be possible to place the blame on Russia for the outbreak of the European conflagration. H.M. has, on the request of the Tsar, undertaken to intervene in Vienna because he could not refuse without awakening an irrefutable suspicion that we wanted war... If these efforts of Britain's meet with success, while Vienna refuses everything, Vienna will prove that it is set on having a war, into which we are dragged, while Russia remains free of guilt. This <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> a quite impossible position in the eyes of our own people. We can therefore only urgently recommend Vienna to accept Grey's proposal, which safeguards its position in every way." [...] Bethmann Hollweg could not go to war in support of Austrian intransigence under such circumstances. But shortly afterwards, [...] "as soon as news of Russia's general mobilization began to arrive in Berlin" [...] the Chancellor instructed the ambassador in Vienna [...] "that all mediation attempts be stopped", and the directive be suspended. Fritz Fischer and some other scholars have maintained the alternative view that Prince Henry's assurances that King George had promised him that Britain would remain neutral accounted for the change. Fischer notes the telegram reporting these [...] "vague" [...] assurances arrived 12 minutes before the dispatch of the suspending telegram and that Bethmann Hollweg himself justified the cancellation that way, while acknowledging that before then Bethmann Hollweg had already prepared, but not yet sent, a telegram to Vienna explaining that he had [...] "cancelled execution of instructions in No. 200, because the General Staff has just informed me that military measures of our neighbors, especially in the east, compel speedy decision if we are not to be taken by surprise".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, decidedly. I was not {{prepared}} for it. I consider it a departure from our agreement and your promise. It <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> a new position, Lady Dedlock. I feel myself under the necessity of saying that I don't approve of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|These things, I say, we readily think of, {{and forget}} them not. Our {{conscience}} <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> mind of these, our guilt <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> mind of these, the devil <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> mind of these, and our reason and sense hold {{the knowledge and}} remembrance of these close to us. All that we forget is, {{that we have an}} Advocate, [...] "an Advocate with the Father"-that is, one that is appointed to take in hand in open court, before all the angels of heaven, my cause, and to plead it by such law and arguments as will certainly fetch me off, though I am clothed with filthy garments; but this, I say, we are apt to forget, as Job when he said, [...] "O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!" [...] (Job 16:21). Such an one Job had, but he had almost at this time forgot it; as he seems to intimate also where he wisheth for a daysman that might lay his hand upon them both (Job 9:33). But our mercy is, we have one to plead our cause, [...] "an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous," [...] who will not suffer our soul to be spilt and spoiled before the throne, but will surely plead our cause.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they settle}} it for themselves," [...] said Dr. May, [...] "that {{sanction}} {{will come in}} to give double value to mine; or if I should see poor Norman hesitating as to the inequality, I might smooth the way; but you see, Ethel, this <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> a most delicate situation towards this pretty little creature. What her father wanted was only to guard her from fortune-hunters, and if she should marry suitably elsewhere--why, we will be contented." ...|$|E

6000|$|... [328] 'A peck of coals a-piece:' our indulgent poet, {{whenever}} {{he has spoken}} of any dirty or low work, constantly <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> mind of the poverty of the offenders, as the only extenuation of such practices. Let any one but remark, when a thief, a pickpocket, a highwayman, or a knight of the post are spoken of, how much our hate to those characters is lessened, if they add a needy thief, a poor pickpocket, a hungry highwayman, a starving knight of the post, &c.--P.|$|E
60|$|Now, my dear friends, be not deceived: God is not mocked. God tempts no man. Man tempts {{himself by}} his own lusts and passions. God does not tempt us when he gives us money, <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the way of earning money, or {{spending}} money. Money is not bad in itself; wealth is not bad in itself. If mammon be unrighteous, we make money into mammon, when we make an idol of it, and worship it more than God's law of right and justice. We make it unrighteous, by being unrighteous, and unjust ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe in}} imagining things {{different}} from what they really are," [...] retorted Marilla. [...] "When the Lord <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> certain circumstances He doesn't mean for us to imagine them away. And that reminds me. Go into the sitting room, Anne--be sure your feet are clean and don't let any flies in--and bring me out the illustrated card that's on the mantelpiece.

6000|$|FRIEDRICH'S SPEECH TO HIS GENERALS. [...] "Gentlemen, I have {{assembled}} {{you here}} for a public object. Most of you, like myself, have often been in arms along with one another, and are grown gray {{in the service of}} our Country: to all of us is well known in what dangers, toils and renown we have been fellow-sharers. I doubt not in the least that all of you, as myself, have a horror of bloodshed: but the danger which now threatens our Countries, not only renders it a duty, but <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the absolute necessity, to adopt the quickest and most effectual means for dissipating at the right time the storm which threatens to break out on us.|$|E
6000|$|But {{there are}} records of Antony which {{represent}} {{him as a}} far more genial and human personage; full of a knowledge of human nature, and of a tenderness and sympathy, which account for his undoubted power over the minds of men; and showing, too, at times, a certain covert and [...] "pawky" [...] humour which <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> mind, as does the humour {{of many of the}} Egyptian hermits, of the old-fashioned Scotch. These reminiscences are contained in the [...] "Words of the Elders," [...] a series of anecdotes of the desert fathers collected by various hands; which are, after all, the most interesting and probably the most trustworthy accounts of them and their ways. I shall have occasion to quote them later. I insert here some among them which relate to Antony.|$|E
6000|$|The {{considerations}} of Section 20 {{show that the}} general principle of relativity <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> a position to derive properties of the gravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose, for instance, that we know the space-time [...] " [...] course [...] " [...] for any natural process whatsoever, as regards {{the manner in which}} it takes place in the Galileian domain relative to a Galileian body of reference K. By means of purely theoretical operations (i.e. simply by calculation) we are then able to find how this known natural process appears, as seen from a reference-body K1 which is accelerated relatively to K. But since a gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of reference K1, our consideration also teaches us how the gravitational field influences the process studied.|$|E

60|$|I {{know nothing}} of Cicero's which so much <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> mind of the struggles of the modern authors {{to make the most}} of every word that has come from them, as do these paradoxes. They remind us of some writer of leading {{articles}} who gets together a small bundle of essays and then gives them to the world. Each of them has done well at its time, but that has not sufficed for his ambition; therefore they are dragged out into the light and put forward with a separate claim for attention, as though they could stand well on their own legs. But they cannot stand alone, and they fall from having been put into a position other than that for which they were intended when written.|$|E
60|$|I now {{began to}} regret that I {{had not seen}} {{a little of the}} town. In 1797, New York could not have had more than fifty {{thousand}} inhabitants, though it was just as much of a paragon then, in the eyes of all good Americans, as it is today. It is a sound patriotic rule to maintain that our best is always the best, for it never <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the wrong. I have seen enough of the world since to understand that we get a great many things wrong-end foremost, in this country of ours; undervaluing those advantages and excellencies of which we have great reason to be proud, and boasting of others that, to say the least, are exceedingly equivocal. But it takes time to learn all this, and I have no intention of getting ahead of my story, or of my country; the last being a most suicidal act.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{the office}} and {{function}} of the imagination to renew life in lights and sounds and emotions that are outworn and familiar. It calls the soul back once more under the dead ribs of nature, and makes the meanest bush burn again, as it did to Moses, with the visible presence of God. And it works the same miracle for language. The word it has touched retains the warmth of life forever. We talk {{about the age of}} superstition and fable as if they were passed away, as if no ghost could walk in the pure white light of science, yet the microscope that can distinguish between the disks that float in the blood of man and ox is helpless, a mere dead eyeball, before this mystery of Being, this wonder of Life, the sympathy which <b>puts</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> relation with all nature, before that mighty circulation of Deity in which stars and systems are but as the blood-disks in our own veins.
