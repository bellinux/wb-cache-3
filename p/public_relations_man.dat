5|$|On {{the advice}} of Roosevelt's secretary, Malvina Thompson, Hickok then sought work in New York with <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> <b>man</b> and {{politician}} Grover Whalen. Shortly after Franklin Roosevelt's 1936 re-election, Hickok was hired by Whalen to do publicity for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Opportunities for female employees of the Fair were limited, and she found the work unrewarding compared to her reporting days. Hickok primarily worked on promoting the fair to young people, including arranging class trips. Because Hickok rented both a country home and an apartment, she often faced financial problems despite her good salary during these years, and Roosevelt occasionally sent her small gifts of money.|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 autobiography, {{the public}} {{relations}} pioneer Harry Reichenbach {{claimed responsibility for the}} controversy surrounding September Morn– and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. The <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> <b>man</b> then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price– from 10 cents to a dollar.|$|E

40|$|The {{first problem}} facing the student of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> is definitional.

That is to say, Raucher includes those who use the term to describe their activities but intentionally ignores people doing similar things without using the label.

This is an important point, for the growth of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> is really the story of the transformation of the attitude of America's business leaders toward the role which public opinion should play in their enterprises.

500|$|The {{popularity}} of The Adventures of Robin Hood brought deHavilland {{a new level}} of fame as a movie star, but this new status was not reflected in her subsequent film assignments at Warner Bros.

While deHavilland was certainly capable of playing these kinds of characters, her personality was better suited to stronger and more dramatic roles, according to Judith Kass. By this time, deHavilland had serious doubts about her career at Warner Bros.|$|E

By creating four focus groups, two with men and two with women, this also enables a comparative study between the gender.   The focus groups were later analyzed and compared to two selected groups of theories on <b>public</b> <b>relations,</b> the theories were positive and critical theories compound in two categories. Critical theories was Habermas on the public sphere (2003), Weaver, Motion och Roper on democratic issues (2006), Jahansoozi on trancparency and dialogue (2006) and Davis also on democratic issues (2007).
