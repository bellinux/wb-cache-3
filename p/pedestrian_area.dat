5|$|In the 2000s, the {{old city}} centre {{underwent}} extensive restoration works, meant to convert much of it into a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area,</b> including Bulevardul Eroilor, Unirii Square and other smaller streets. In some residential areas of the city, particularly the high-income southern areas, like Andrei Mureșanu or Strada Republicii, there are many turn-of-the-century villas.|$|E

40|$|Unpleasant {{strong winds}} in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>areas</b> are {{frequently}} encountered in built up cities like Hong Kong. Depending {{on the characteristics}} of the wind including mean magnitude, uniformity, ambient temperature, etc., the level of disturbance to users of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>areas</b> can be different. To evaluate whether the disturbance induced by wind is unacceptable or, more severe, dangerous to the users of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>areas,</b> various criteria had been suggested by different researchers while no unique criteria were agreed universally. This note describes the typical wind comfort criteria in respect to gust wind speed, the typical locations of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>areas</b> with frequent occurrences of strong wind and the general wind speed reduction measures. The pedestrian wind comfort study at the Hong Kong TVB City was used as a case study...|$|R

25|$|The {{top deck}} {{on the new}} bridge was {{originally}} just a flat space. Traversing the bridge in the harshness of winter was very uncomfortable, so an enclosure running {{down the center of}} the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area</b> was added by the 1970s. Originally meant to be a heated indoor <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area,</b> due to energy cost concerns, the walkway is mostly unheated. There are some heaters inside that keep the area slightly warmer than outside, and some heat loss from the steam mains, but it can still dip below the freezing point. The structure also adds a windbreak for the top level, improving conditions for people who choose to walk outside. In the summer, large overhangs also provide some shade.|$|E
25|$|Some more festivals are {{for example}} the Festival Feuer und Flamme (Fire and Flames), the Gartenfestival (Garden Festival), the Herbstfestival (Autumn Festival), the Harley Days, the Steintor Festival (Steintor is a party area in the city centre) and the Lister-Meile-Festival (Lister Meile is a large <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area).</b>|$|E
25|$|Architect Jan Gehl {{studied the}} new <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area</b> {{starting}} in 1962 and his influential reports and {{findings on the}} subject {{formed the basis of}} Copenhagen's subsequent broader policy shift toward emphasising pedestrians and bicycles.

50|$|The {{provision}} of bikeways {{may result in}} additional risk to pedestrians. This is particularly {{likely to be the}} case where cycle lanes are not readily distinguishable from <b>pedestrian</b> <b>areas,</b> e.g. due to the choice of surfacing or lane markers, or if the layout is confusing, or if the <b>pedestrians</b> <b>area</b> is inadequate for the numbers of people using the space. Pedestrians may easily stray into the cycle lanes without realising they have done so.|$|R

25|$|In 1985, {{the railway}} line was {{electrified}} to Wollongong, and in 1993 to Dapto. In 1986 the Wollongong Mall was completed. For {{a short while}} trams (trackless trains) {{were used in the}} mall, though this ceased due to dangers involved. The mall was re-opened to traffic after the initial test but re-zoned a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area</b> after and has remained one since.|$|E
25|$|Wanting {{to expand}} the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area,</b> the Ryerson Students' Union (RSU) campaigned for years to close off traffic from Gould Street. In 2010 a one-year pilot program was {{approved}} which was later extended by six months. On February 6, 2012, Toronto City Council voted to permanently close the street to car traffic, from O'Keefe Lane to Bond Street. The space was official renamed Ryerson Square. It features seating areas, potted plants and is used for a weekly farmers market, student group sign-up days and festivities associated with Ryerson’s week of welcome.|$|E
25|$|Winchester was {{the first}} city south of the Potomac River to install {{electric}} light.

A three-block section of downtown Loudoun Street was closed to vehicular traffic in the 1970s and is a popular <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area</b> featuring many boutiques and cafes.

25|$|City Gate {{is located}} within the Porta Reale Curtain, a curtain wall at {{the centre of the}} Valletta Land Front, located between St. James' and St. John's Bastions. A bridge {{spanning}} across Valletta's deep ditch leads to the gate. The gate was originally protected by a couvre porte, an advanced ditch and a lunette known as St. Madeleine's Lunette. During British rule, the lunette was demolished and part of the advanced ditch was filled in. The site was later occupied by the bus terminus, with the Triton Fountain at the centre. As of 2016, there are plans to turn the square around the fountain into a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
25|$|In his {{municipal}} planning work, Leavitt {{became a}} forceful practitioner of the City Beautiful architectural {{movement of the}} day. His design for the Lake Mirror Promenade in Lakeland, Florida, executed in the 1920s, {{is one of the}} best-known examples of the emerging movement in city planning which altered the course of landscape design and changed the face of urban planning. The promenade circles the side of Lake Mirror {{on the east side of}} downtown, and incorporated a loggia, a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area</b> with a mix of public and private buildings, and a large open circle of lawn designed to accommodate an obelisk sculpture (that was never built). The promenade, with its columns and other architectural elements, was meant to evoke ancient Rome or Greece.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010 a {{proposal}} was unveiled by then-Mayor Jerry Sanders and philanthropist Irwin M. Jacobs {{to divert traffic}} away from the central Prado areas of the park, such as the Plaza de Panama {{in front of the}} Art Museum and the California Quadrangle in front of the Museum of Man, and restore the areas to pedestrian use. The plan would provide replacement parking via a two-level parking garage {{at the site of the}} current Spreckles Organ Pavilion parking lot. The plan also called for changes in access to the park via the Cabrillo Bridge. The bridge would become one-way, eastbound only, so that people could enter the park via the Cabrillo Bridge but could exit only via Park Boulevard. Inbound traffic would be deflected via a new bridge offramp through the current Alcazar Gardens parking lot toward the new parking garage. The Alcazar Gardens parking lot would be for disabled parking only and for loading and unloading of passengers. The new parking garage would house 750–900 cars and would be landscaped on top. The plan became controversial because of its alteration to the appearance of the bridge and the possibility of charging for parking in the parking garage. In July 2012 the City Council voted to proceed with the Jacobs plan. Construction was due to begin in October 2012 and be completed in time for the park's centennial in 2015. However, the scheduled start of construction was pushed back to February 2013 due to a legal challenge from the Save Our Heritage Organization (SOHO). In February 2013 a judge voided the project, after which Jacobs withdrew his offer to finance it. Since the Park's master plan already called for removing the 67-space parking lot from the Plaza de Panama, the city went ahead with that portion of the proposal, removing all parking from the plaza and converting it into a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>area</b> with tree planters, seats, and tables.|$|E

30|$|The paper {{concerns}} {{a new car}} sharing system for <b>pedestrian</b> <b>areas,</b> like historical city centres. The transport system {{is based on a}} fleet of personal intelligent city accessible vehicles (PICAVs). The PICAV vehicle is a one person vehicle which is meant to ensure accessibility for everybody, and some of its features are specifically designed for people whose mobility is restricted for different reasons, particularly (but not only) elderly and disabled people. The PICAVs will travel in traditionally <b>pedestrian</b> <b>areas</b> and allow people to travel around parts of urban areas which are otherwise difficult or impossible for them to access.|$|R
