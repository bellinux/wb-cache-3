50|$|Unintended acceleration: A defect {{with the}} vehicle's {{accelerator}} or {{the layout of}} the pedals results in unwanted or accidental acceleration of the vehicle. <b>Pedal</b> <b>layout</b> issues led to product liability claims against the Audi 5000 in the United States, and more recently in a massive 2010 Toyota Vehicle Recall and suspension of production and sales of many of the most popular Toyota models.|$|E
50|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} of the CLRVs and ALRVs carried over features from the highly successful PCCs that they replaced, having a similar interior layout, and the same two green bull's-eye lights in the upper corners of the front, above the destination sign, which uses back-lit roller boards. Braking and acceleration were controlled by the operator with the same <b>pedal</b> <b>layout</b> used on the PCC's, including the dead man's switch which was used to apply the parking brake when the vehicle was not in motion.|$|E
50|$|A {{grand total}} 79 racing cars were {{registered}} for this event, of which 74 arrived for practice and qualifying. Fresh from their sad domination on the Mille Miglia, came two work teams of Scuderia Ferrari, and Officine Alfieri Maserati. The team from Maranello arrived with two cars, a Ferrari 335 S and a Ferrari 315 S. The former {{was to be}} driven by Peter Collins and Olivier Gendebien with the older car for Mike Hawthorn and Maurice Trintignant. In the Grand Touring class, one of the works driver, Wolfgang von Trips had an accident in the challenging Breidscheid section, following a change in a <b>pedal</b> <b>layout</b> in his Ferrari 250 GT. He was admitted to hospital with cuts and bruises and was unable to participate in the race.|$|E
5000|$|Motorcycles {{typically}} employ sequential transmissions, {{although the}} shift pattern is modified slightly for safety reasons. In a motorcycle the gears are usually shifted {{with the left}} foot <b>pedal,</b> the <b>layout</b> being this: ...|$|R
5|$|In the firstpractice session, Hill was fastest {{with a time}} of 1:21.664, twothousands of {{a second}} ahead of {{teammate}} Coulthard. Schumacher was third, with the Ferrari cars of Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger, who had been the leading two for most session, close behind. Blundell in the McLaren was sixth, with teammate Häkkinen finishing the session in 14th position, the Finnish driver complaining of steering problems with the car. The two Ferrari drivers used different <b>pedal</b> <b>layouts</b> in the 412T2 chassis: Berger's car was equipped with two pedals and a hand-operated clutch, whereas Alesi preferred the traditional three-pedal system.|$|R
50|$|Interest in dead-man's {{controls}} {{increased with}} the introduction of electric streetcars and especially electrified rapid transit trains, though dead-man equipment was quite rare on US streetcars until the successful PCC streetcar, which had a left-foot operated dead-man's pedal in conjunction with the right-foot operated brake and power <b>pedals.</b> This <b>layout</b> has continued to be used on some modern trams around the world. In conventional steam railroad trains, there was always a second person with the engineer, the fireman, who could almost always bring the train to a stop if necessary. For many decades this practice continued on electric and diesel locomotives, even though a single person could theoretically operate them.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s Morley {{reduced the}} housing and treadle {{size of their}} pedals {{significantly}} and eventually changed the chassis to black. 9VDC battery power with an AC adapter jack (wall-wart jack) became standard as Morley pedals evolved {{in an effort to}} compete with the new compact pedals from companies like Boss, Ibanez, and DOD. Morley also manufactured some small non-treadle style effects for a while. Morley was sold to a Chicago based firm, Sound Enhancements, Inc., in 1989. The modern Morley company continues to use the electro-optical circuitry and basic <b>pedal</b> <b>layout</b> pioneered by Raymond and Marvin Lubow in the 1960s, albeit with some refinements. Original Morley pedals were strictly AC powered, whereas the current models are powered by a 9V battery with AC adapter capability. Tel-Ray Morleys used a small light-bulb to drive the LDRs; modern Morleys use LEDs.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970 GAZ-21 Volga was {{replaced}} by GAZ-24 and the V8 adoption followed soon, dubbed GAZ-24-24. As the sedan's standard gearbox was now a four on the floor manual, the selector lever was accordingly altered. Unofficially these cars were called [...] "Chasers", and despite their novelty, the engine torque was disproportional to the chassis ability (to prevent excessive burnouts, the factory improvised by adding a 100 kg metal plate into the boot rather than altering the suspension design). This meant a very low service life and also required very professional driving. For that reason, the factory did not even bother creating a special select indicator, and externally it resembled a manual transmission gearshift lever (some cars even lacked a single brake pedal, and instead had the clutch/brake <b>pedal</b> <b>layout</b> that dubbed each other). The GAZ-24 had the common cord-actuated parking brakes, thus the central shaft brake was removed and replaced by an extension housing to fit the shorter driveshaft of the GAZ-24. GAZ-24-24 would be produced alongside standard GAZ-24 until 1985. That year the car got a major facelift and internal modernisation with engine and chassis elements from the GAZ-3102 Volga, resulting in the GAZ-24-10 model. The Chaser became GAZ-24-34 and was produced until 1993.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A human can {{maneuver}} {{mechanical systems}} by adjusting his/her own body naturally and effectively {{according to a}} target task by utilizing the kinematical and dynamic charac-teristics of operating systems acquired through sensory organs. If such human sensory and motor characteristics changing in the task can be quantitatively described, {{it would be useful}} to design and develop a novel human-machine system so that humans can manipulate a machine more instinctively and comfortably. This paper investigates the interaction between human sensory and motor properties at the foot during the operation of an automobile pedal, as an example of human-machine systems, and demonstrates the close relationship between the perceptual properties of force resistance at the foot and the loads for foot joints much depending on the <b>pedal</b> <b>layout.</b> Finally, based on biomechanical and perceptual analyses, a human-inspired design method of pedal dynamic properties is discussed.

40|$|Two {{observational}} {{studies were}} conducted to examine driver foot pedal operation characteristics which may influence pedal activation errors. Driver behaviors were observed during controlled closed-course and natural driving situations to document individual pedal operating characteristics. A {{substantial portion of the}} drivers in both studies shifted from park to forward and/or reverse gears without positioning a foot over or on the brake pedal. A small percentage of drivers used both feet for pedal activation. The results of these studies suggest that <b>pedal</b> design and <b>layout</b> should take these behaviors into consideration. Either method would likely be less accurate and potentially more hazardous than when the right foot is directly over the brake pedal, and suggests the efficacy of a mechanical interlock to prevent gear selection from park to either forward or reverse gears until contact with the brake pedal is made...|$|R
