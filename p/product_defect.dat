2500|$|One {{example of}} the gradual change that typifies {{evolution}} of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule {{through most of the}} 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in privity of contract. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a <b>product</b> <b>defect,</b> and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, Winterbottom v. Wright, the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The Winterbottom court recognized that there would be [...] "absurd and outrageous consequences" [...] if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.|$|E

The principle of <b>product</b> <b>defects</b> identification should change from mainly based on national and industry standards to rely on risk-benefit analysis to determine what unreasonable risk is. Performance-based standards should be introduced to solve the problem that standard could not catch up with the development of technology.

The study takes place within a global consulting organization conducting ongoing software maintenance for a Fortune 100 telecommunications firm by a project team assessed at Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3. This study reports on 991 work product reviews conducted across the evolution activities of the ISO/IEC 12207 Software Development Life Cycle Processes. After controlling for team and expertise differences, the study’s major finding is that corrective evolution projects inject a greater number of work <b>product</b> <b>defects</b> than enhancive evolution projects. This result does not arise from the schedule compression often associated with corrective evolution. Rather, it is concluded that the increase in work <b>product</b> <b>defects</b> is associated with the increased complexity of analysisstage problem diagnosis found in corrective evolution projects. The analysis is augmented by additional covariates including the number of work product reviewers, preparation time of reviewers, and size of the project...|$|R

While these two laws are still relatively ineffective against large Chinese manufacturers who are state-owned enterprises (as the defendant can simply have the <b>product</b> <b>defect</b> declared a state secret and then have the plaintiff prosecuted for revealing state secrets), they will enable Chinese consumers to seek some compensation from non-state companies as well as foreign manufacturers.|$|E
