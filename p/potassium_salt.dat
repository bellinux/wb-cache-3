For example, CsF reacts with hexafluoroacetone to form a caesium perfluoroalkoxide salt, which is stable up to 60°C, unlike the corresponding sodium or <b>potassium</b> <b>salt.</b> It will convert electron-deficient aryl chlorides to aryl fluorides (halex reaction).|$|E
5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a <b>potassium</b> <b>salt</b> source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E
40|$|What are <b>potassium</b> <b>salts</b> of {{fatty acids}}? <b>Potassium</b> <b>salts</b> of fatty acids are {{commonly}} called soap salts. They {{are used as}} insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and algaecides. The first pesticide product containing soap salts was registered for use in 1947 (1). <b>Potassium</b> <b>salts</b> of fatty acids are produced by adding potassium hydroxide to fatty acids found in animal fats and in plant oils. Fatty acids are extracted from palm, coconut, olive, castor, and cottonseed plants to form this active ingredient (2). Soap salts are derived from fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of 12 - 18 saturated carbons, and chain lengths of 18 carbons {{with one or more}} double bonds (unsaturated). <b>Potassium</b> <b>salts</b> may include oleate, laureate, myristate, and ricinoleate (1). Some <b>potassium</b> <b>salts</b> of fatty acids are used as multi-purpose food additives. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies them as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) (3). Residues from the use of this active ingredient, in accordance with labeling guidelines, are not anticipated to exceed levels that occur naturally, or levels that are intentionally added to food. <b>Potassium</b> <b>salts</b> of fatty acids have been exempt from United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tolerances for food and feed crops since 1982 (1, 4).

2500|$|Hypoadrenocorticism, {{also known}} as Addison's disease, is a {{reduction}} of production of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids by the adrenal glands. There is more familiarity with the glucocortcoids, such as cortisol; mineralocorticoids control the amount of <b>potassium,</b> <b>salt</b> and water in the body. It is most commonly caused by destruction of adrenal tissue, probably by autoimmune disease. Signs include increased drinking and urination, vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, shivering and weight loss; at times neither the causes nor symptoms are especially specific. Because of this it is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "the Great Mimic" [...] or [...] "the Great Imitator". It is possible not to see any symptoms of the disease until the adrenal cortex is 90% dysfunctional. Addison's can occur when regular steroid use is abruptly discontinued; during their use, the system the adrenal gland does not function at 100%. The system senses sufficient levels of these hormones in the body and does not signal for their production. Tapering the medication off gradually allows them to return to full production after discontinuation. About 35% of affected dogs are not diagnosed until they experience an Addisonian crisis, which outwardly appears to be a [...] "classic" [...] shock and is a medical emergency. Hyperkalemia can develop and cause severe bradycardia. Only typical Addison's patients have the risk of Addisonian crisis {{due to the lack of}} mineralocorticoids. Treatment is with supplementation of mineralocorticoids in daily pills or a monthly injection. The atypical form and the form caused by abrupt withdrawal of steroids do not need mineralocorticoids. Glucocorticoids are usually supplemented with oral prednisone.|$|E
