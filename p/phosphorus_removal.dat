25|$|Eutrophication poses {{a problem}} {{not only to}} ecosystems, but to humans as well. Reducing {{eutrophication}} should be a key concern when considering future policy, and a sustainable solution for everyone, including farmers and ranchers, seems feasible. While eutrophication does pose problems, humans {{should be aware that}} natural runoff (which causes algal blooms in the wild) is common in ecosystems and should thus not reverse nutrient concentrations beyond normal levels. Cleanup measures have been mostly, but not completely, successful. Finnish <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges. These efforts have had a 90% removal efficiency. Still, some targeted point sources did not show a decrease in runoff despite reduction efforts.|$|E

25|$|In Northern Ireland, {{phosphorus}} enrichment {{of lakes}} due to agriculture {{is a significant}} problem. Locally available laterite—a low-grade bauxite rich in iron and aluminium—is used in acid solution, followed by precipitation to remove phosphorus and heavy metals at several sewage treatment facilities. Calcium-, iron- and aluminium-rich solid media are recommended for <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal.</b> A study, using both laboratory tests and pilot-scale constructed wetlands, reports the effectiveness of granular laterite in removing phosphorus and heavy metals from landfill leachate. Initial laboratory studies show that laterite is capable of 99% removal of phosphorus from solution. A pilot-scale experimental facility containing laterite achieved 96% removal of phosphorus. This removal is greater than reported in other systems. Initial removals of aluminium and iron by pilot-scale facilities have been up to 85% and 98% respectively. Percolating columns of laterite removed enough cadmium, chromium and lead to undetectable concentrations. There is a possible application of this low-cost, low-technology, visually unobtrusive, efficient system for rural areas with dispersed point sources of pollution.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{if in the}} case of the Santos Submarine Outfall (SSO) there was any environmental benefits relative to potential eutrophication if instead of the primary treatment a CEPT, ST-AS or a TT- ASNR was used.

Wastewater mixing conditions in the near field plume was evaluated using the software CORMIX, and the results were coupled to a far-field model considering the conservation of mass flow. The results demonstrate that the use of a secondary treatment with partial ammonia oxidation promotes a reduction of only 30 % in the chlorophyll-a, while the use of a CEPT with phosphate removal promotes a better environmental response, resulting in chlorophyll-a concentration reduction of 69 %, similar results were obtained when tertiary treatment was considered for nitrogen and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removals...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{analyze the}} {{variation}} of physiological responses between Nymphaea tetragona Georgi. and Pontederia cordata L. {{and the water}} qualities under aeration conditions, the selected plants were cultivated in 12 purifying-tanks (aeration, non aeration), to treat heavily polluted river water. The characteristics of both plants were investigated, which included contents of chlorophyll and soluble protein, activities of peroxidase and catalase, accumulations of nitrogen and phosphorus, densities of tillers and roots, lengths of roots, culms and leaves, biomass of roots and shoots. The water qualities were analyzed correspondingly. Results indicated that aeration affected morphological and physiological characteristics of the plants and the water qualities and effects became more significant on N. tetragona than P. cordata. Biomass and length of roots, culms and leaves under the non aeration conditions exceeded that under the aeration conditions. Aeration contributed to the activities increase of peroxidase and catalase of the roots and the contents decrease of chlorophyll and soluble protein of the leaves. Nitrogen and phosphorus contents of the roots, culms and leaves increased under the non aeration conditions. Aeration resulted in tillers and roots densities of N. tetragona decreased, while they increased for P. cordata.

40|$|A hybrid ultrafiltration-osmotic {{membrane}} bioreactor (UFO-MBR) was investigated for over 35 days for nutrient and trace organic chemical (TOrC) removal from municipal wastewater. The UFO-MBR system uses both ultrafiltration (UF) and forward osmosis (FO) membranes in parallel to simultaneously extract clean water from an activated sludge reactor for nonpotable (or environmental discharge) and potable reuse, respectively. In the FO stream, water is drawn by osmosis from activated sludge through an FO membrane into a draw solution (DS), which becomes diluted during the process. A reverse osmosis (RO) system is {{then used to}} reconcentrate the diluted DS and produce clean water suitable for direct potable reuse. The UF membrane extracts water, dissolved salts, and some nutrients from the system to prevent their accumulation in the activated sludge of the osmotic MBR. The UF permeate {{can be used for}} nonpotable reuse purposes (e. g., irrigation and toilet flushing). Results from UFO-MBR investigation illustrated that the chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removals</b> were greater than 99 %, 82 %, and 99 %, respectively.
