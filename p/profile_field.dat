High {{resolution}} Stokes-I {{spectra of}} the Zeemansensitive lines at λ 846. 85 nm and λ 630. 25 nm {{were used to}} determine the magnetic field strength and the brightness temperature of a simple, relatively symmetric sunspot umbra and its umbral dots (UDs). We find a decrease in brightness temperature for central (∼ 30 %) and peripheral UDs (20 - 25 %) compared to the surrounding quiet sun. This corresponds to a difference in temperature of about 1600 K and 1200 - 1400 K respectively. The magnetic field strength within the umbra is derived from the Zeeman splitting of the Stokes-I <b>profile.</b> <b>Field</b> strengths within the umbra vary between 1500 and 3000 G. Further analysis of the λ 846. 85 nm spectra indicates that the magnetic field strength within the umbral features is not significantly reduced neither for centrally (≤ 3 %) nor for peripherically located UDs (1 - 2 %). The λ 630. 25 nm line yields an enhanced weakening of field strength of 7 % for an isolated located UD. The measured properties of UDs do not vary significantly during a 40 min observation sequence.

40|$|Because of impracticalities {{resulting}} from their much larger size, lensing systems in a millimeter wave band cannot {{be dealt with}} {{in the same manner as}} optical systems. One technique for implementing this lensing is to transform the phase of the incident field, using metamaterials such as frequencyselective surfaces (FSSs). In this project, the FSSs known as the gangbuster surface (GS) is used to achieve the lensing effect. We consider the GS above a perfectly conducting ground plane. Incident waves reflect totally, and the phase of the reflected waves depends on characteristics such as the type and period of the GS, the lengths of the wires, and the separation between the GS and the ground plane. Any change in the various parameters used to design the lens results in deterioration in the <b>profile</b> <b>field</b> intensity and the diffraction efficiency, among other unwanted effects. The goal is to optimize the lens for changes in the angle of incidence such that the intensity of the electric field and the resolution at the focal plane are both optimized. To accomplish this optimization, differences in phase distribution for various angles are minimized by using an existing genetic algorithm to modify the lengths of wires on the GS. The incorporation of an objective function into the genetic algorithm returns the optimal length of wire needed to achieve the desired phase distribution. Through the use of these different wire lengths, a GS can be constructed for a lensing system in the millimeter wave band that is stable for differing angles of incidence. 1...|$|E
40|$|A steamflood {{recently}} {{initiated by}} Mobil Development and Production U. S. at the Lost Hills No 3 oil field in California is notable for its shallow depth {{and the application}} of electromagnetic (EM) geophysical techniques to monitor the subsurface steam flow. Steam was injected into three stacked eastward-dipping unconsolidated oil sands at depths from 60 to 120 m; the plume is expected to develop as an ellipsoid aligned with the regional northwest-southeast strike. Because of the shallow depth of the sands and the high viscosity of the heavy oil, it is important to track the steam in the unconsolidated sediments for both economic and safety reasons. Crosshole and surface-to-borehole electromagnetic imaging were applied for reservoir characterization and steamflood monitoring. The crosshole EM data were collected to map the interwell distribution of the high-resistivity oil sands and to track the injected steam and hot water. Measurements were made in two fiberglass-cased observation wells straddling the steam injector on a northeast-southwest <b>profile.</b> <b>Field</b> data were collected before the steam drive, to map the distribution of the oil sands, and then 6 and 10 months after steam was injected, to monitor the expansion of the steam chest. Resistivity images derived from the collected data clearly delineated the distribution and dipping structure of the target oil sands. Difference images from data collected before and during steamflooding indicate that the steam chest has developed only in the middle and lower oil sands, and it has preferentially migrated westward in the middle oil sand and eastward in the deeper sand. Surface-to-borehole field data sets at Lost Hills were responsive to the large-scale subsurface structure but insufficiently sensitive to model steam chest development in the middle and lower oil sands. As the steam chest develops further, these data will be of more use for process monitoring...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTechnogenic soil (technozem) {{was created}} {{on the surface}} of the former sludge pond of the iron-ore quarry in the course of land rehabilitation. The upper chernozemic layer in the technozem was {{underlain}} by sandy or loamy layers. The soil land reclamation constructions were created 20 years ago: the chernozemic 60 -cm layer with classical granular fine and medium-size aggregates (1 - 5 mm) was sprinkled on the deep layer of sand. This construction was in agricultural use during the last 20 years. At present, the layers of prismatic coarse peds (> 50 mm) bounded by flat to rounded vertical faces and columnar, very thick, vertically oriented blocks (> 100 mm) have been formed at the depths 20 - 40 and 40 - 60 cm. The water regime of these soils differed from that of the background automorphic natural soils and was characterized by periods of water stagnation at the boundary between the two layers. In the course of 20 years, this type of water regime resulted in the development of a columnar structure in the lower part of the chernozemic layer. The coatings on the ped faces in this part of the profile had an increased content of Fe and Ca ions. There was no differentiation of the carbon of organic substances and carbonates in the soil <b>profile.</b> <b>Field</b> studies of water flows in this soil based on starch label and laboratory experiments on infiltration of salt solutions though the soil columns with determination of breakthrough curves demonstrated the existence of preferential water flows in technozem. Rapid infiltration of water through preferential water paths in chernozemic layer after abundant rainfalls and during the snowmelt season leads to the development of perched water above the textural boundary. This preferential water and matter flows are generated along the faces of the peds and form the perched water layer on the sand. Such kind of water phenomenon with preferential flows and perched water table formation transforms the granular aggregates into columnar blocks by the temporary gleyzation process...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this multi-case {{investigation}} was to identify the perceptions of preservice teachers about reading and reading instruction as they began reading methods courses and to determine any changes in these perceptions {{that occurred during the}} undergraduate teacher education program. The goal of this research was to accumulate classroom and field-based data that would help to build a better understanding of why preservice teachers believe the way they do, what types of experiences are needed in the undergraduate reading programs to impact change, and how and when changes manifest themselves. The research concentrated on preservice teachers participating in two required reading methods courses and their student teaching placements. The influence of their background in learning to read, the methods courses, the cooperating teachers, and the professor on the perceptions of preservice teachers were investigated. Three groups of individuals provided information for this study: 14 student participants, 17 teacher participants, and 3 key informants. The data collection process was divided into two phases based on the college curriculum schedule. The participant pool was narrowed {{at the end of the}} first phase, with 3 key informants chosen to allow for a more in-depth examination of the accumulating data. Several data sources contributed to this study.

Findings from the data provided evidence that perspectives do guide the practices of preservice teachers and that these perspectives are open to change.

Micromorphological study was made of thin sections from selected horizons in each <b>profile.</b> <b>Field</b> and laboratory study showed that Gray Podzolic soils formed under distinctly different climatic zones and vegetation have quite similar characteristics. They occupy similar low terraces with nearly level topography and are associated closely with Low Humic Gley soils. Parent materials and topography are the two most important factors influencing the genesis of these soils. Mineral assemblages in the profiles indicate the parent materials were preweathered sediments from acidic rocks. They are quartz rich, with very few if any weatherable minerals, ubiquitous heavy minerals and with dominantly kaolinitic clay. The few lower stability minerals found in several profiles can be traced to some rocks rich in those minerals in the catchment areas. Climatic variations between the soils are not consistent with the weathering stages found and differences in soil age are not enough to account for mineralogical variation through differential in situ, weathering. Therefore, differences in composition and preweathering of parent materials most logically account for the presence of minor amounts of relatively unweathered feldspar and hornblende in some of these soils. Soil development has resulted in a loosely bound, clay poor, s-matrix with low degree of orientation in the upper horizons, and illuvial B horizons with more oriented plasma, illuviated cutans and vughs in {{the lower part of the}} profiles. Pedoplasmation activity by termites and other soil dwellers is partially responsible for the high porosity and mixing of the soil materials and, possibly, for the addition of lime. Plinthite formation in the lower part of some profiles relates directly to iron mobility and accumulation associated with fluctuations of the water table.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{uncertainty in the}} measurement of paleoseismic offsets used to estimate fault activity and paleoearthquake magnitudes on normal faults: (1) That variations in fault geometry {{have a significant effect}} on throw-rates and fault offsets; and (2) that postseismic deformation can be a significant component of the total fault slip for moderate magnitude earthquakes. These hypotheses are tested using high resolution terrestrial laser scan datasets of normal fault topographic offsets and surface ruptures. The first hypothesis is addressed by studying the crustal scale Campo Felice active normal fault in the Central Apennines, Italy. Variation in throw-rate along strike since the last glacial maximum (15 ka ± 3) is measured from an offset periglacial surface at two hundred and fifty sites using cross sectional data derived from a high resolution terrestrial laser scan (TLS) dataset. The measurements are used to create a detailed throw-rate <b>profile.</b> <b>Field</b> measurements of fault geometry (strike, dip and kinematic slip direction) are also gathered. Variation in fault throw-rate is found to correlate with fault strike. A study of weathered band thickness on the exposed Miocene limestone bedrock fault scarp, thought to have been created by single past slip events on the fault also appears to correlate with fault strike. A strain-rate profile is calculated using the throw-rate profile and the field measurements of kinematic slip. In contrast to throw-rate, strainrate is independant of changes in fault strike and dip. It is suggested that strain-rate in comparison to throw-rate provides a more robust measure of fault activity as it is unaffected by changes in fault geometry. The outcome of this study is that paleoseismic studies on active faults should take into account fault geometry before choosing sites which may have anomalously high or low paleoseismic offsets. Fault geometry introduces significant uncertainty into the estimation of inferred paleoearthquake magnitudes from paleoseismic offsets and hence seismic hazard analysis. The second hypothesis is addressed through the study of near-field postseismic deformation (surface rupture afterslip) following the 6 th April 2009 6. 3 Mw L’Aquila earthquake, created by slip on the Paganica normal fault in the Central Italian Apennines. A novel use of TLS technology allowed the postseismic deformation at four sites along the L’Aquila surface rupture to be measured between 8 – 126 days after the earthquake. Complimentary measurements of postseismic deformation at a fifth site using a robotic total station were combined with the TLS datasets to describe the along strike variation in postseismic deformation. The near-field postseismic deformation measured occurred mostly in the immediate hangingwall of the surface rupture and increased with decreasing rate over time. The postseismic deformation measured is comparable to theoretical and empirical models which have been used to describe afterslip for previous earthquakes. The magnitude of near-field postseismic deformation was up to 60 % that of the coseismic offset in the near-field and suggests that postseismic deformation can form a significant component of paleoseismic offsets of moderate magnitude. Postseismic deformation was also found to be greatest above regions of the fault zone where a high coseismic slip gradient existed, suggesting that postseismic deformation occurs at the periphery of the coseismic slip patch within the fault zone. Regression relationships which relate surface offset to moment magnitude are populated by field observations of surface offsets where earthquake magnitude is known. These regression relationships are then used to infer paleoearthquake magnitudes from paleoseismic offsets. The field studies used to populate regression relationships do not routinely take into account the potential effects of fault geometry and significant postseismic slip. As a result paleoearthquake magnitudes inferred from such regression relationships are maybe over estimated. It is suggested that future regression relationships of surface offset and moment magnitude should factor in the effects of fault geometry and postseismic deformation in order to produce a relationship in which surface offset (both coseismic and postseismic) is described for a range of magnitudes and, where possible, any local effects of fault geometry are removed from the input dataset. The production of such a relationship will allow paleoseismologists to measure combined coseismic and postseismic offsets from field studies and to infer paleoearthquake magnitude with decreased uncertainty.
