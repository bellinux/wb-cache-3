25|$|Personal {{emergency}} response systems (PERS), or Telecare (UK term), are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> independent at home longer. An {{example would be}} the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for hypothermia risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild dementia). Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks. When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately.|$|E

25|$|Sixty-four people {{stayed the}} winter of 1917–18, with mining being {{carried out in the}} Agnes Mine. They were {{supplemented}} from May 1918, bringing the summer population to 300. Jervell sold his shares to the other owners on 2 April. The 1918 season saw twenty shipments and the arrival of a third locomotive. Nine additional buildings were constructed, and the Advokaten Mine was opened. The winter of 1918–19 saw 143 <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> the winter, rising to 250 the following summer. During the first years several names were in use for the settlement, including Kings Bay, Kingsbay and Brandal City.

500|$|... "I've {{considered}} [...] for two years, and in {{the last}} six months, it's seemed real clear to me. I realized that my job would become my career if I stayed. Some <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> with a series until the end, you know, and afterwards they often have some problems, I think, finding new opportunities. And I wanted a career after Dallas. There's great sadness in leaving my friends and the show – I was never bored with it – but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm realistic about taking care of myself financially. I didn't want to walk away blindly without plans. My plans are set. I have a project with a network that is ready to go that I can't talk about yet. It's a drama mystery." ...|$|E
500|$|In Mongolia, {{there was}} {{anger at the}} news. One {{high-ranking}} Mongolian official accused the Sumo Association of using the incident {{as an excuse to}} get rid of Asashōryū before he could reach Taihō's 32 tournament victories. [...] "I feel that they did not want him to break the record for most titles. This behavior is unjust. The Mongolian people disapprove." [...] The Zuunii Medee newspaper called for sumo broadcasts in Mongolia to be suspended. Reacting to the tense mood among the Mongolian public, a spokesman at the Foreign Ministry of Mongolia issued a statement that the [...] "resignation of Asashōryū will have no influence to the friendship between Mongolian and Japanese citizens." [...] and he requested <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> calm. Reaction in Japan was more mixed, with some of the public saying the yokozuna had to go while others said they would miss him. News media compared his case with earlier yokozuna Maedayama who was forced to resign in 1949 after dropping out of a tournament claiming illness but subsequently photographed at a baseball game. Both his stablemaster and the Sumo Association received criticism for their handling of this incident and Asashōryū in general.|$|E
40|$|The paper shows {{selected}} {{aspects of}} the microclimate change in the occupied zone of the large-volume buildings. The air temperature and some other microclimate parameters change because of heat emission from <b>people</b> <b>staying</b> inside there. There are shown exemplary methods and results of research conducted in sacral buildings and residential apartment buildings. It is based on author's research. The novelty is the research of the human heat emission {{in case of a}} big number of <b>people</b> <b>staying</b> inside sacral buildings. It can be useful for a large-volume buildings design (especially for the sacral buildings) and for microclimate shaping in many types of buildings and residential buildings also. In some buildings with a big number of <b>people</b> <b>staying</b> inside at the same time (such as the sacral buildings) heat emitted from people significantly influences on microclimate. Another situation is observed in residential apartment buildings, where heat and moisture gain are distributed in separate rooms. Human heat streams can be useful {{as a part of the}} heat balance of the room especially in case the big number of <b>people</b> <b>staying</b> in the room...|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he {{tried to figure out}} something Homer was really good at, and he {{came up with the idea}} of Homer being a good husband. While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E

2500|$|As {{the seasons}} changed, Van Gogh made {{paintings}} {{of those who}} worked indoors, like the basket maker. [...] Years after making the paintings, Van Gogh wrote in 1888 of the solitary nature of the occupation: [...] "A weaver or a basket maker often spends whole seasons alone, or almost alone, with his craft as his only distraction. And what makes these <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> in one place is precisely {{the feeling of being}} at home, the reassuring and familiar look of things." ...|$|E

God {{instructed}} Moses to have the <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> pure, wash their clothes, and prepare for the third day, when God would come down {{in the sight of}} the people, on Mount Sinai. God told Moses to set bounds around the mountain, threatening whoever touched the mountain with death, and Moses did so.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2014, despite {{previously}} vowing not to {{step into}} the 'morass' of the debate over the breakup of the Union, Connolly gave the clearest indication yet of his opposition to Scottish independence. In an interview with the Radio Times, he stated, [...] "I think it's time for people to get together, not split apart. The more <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> together, the happier they'll be." [...] He also wrote, referring to the Darien scheme, [...] "You must remember that the Union saved Scotland. Scotland was bankrupt and the English opened us up to their American and Canadian markets, from which we just flowered." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the onset}} of the operation, the Israeli {{government}} canceled all programs within 40km (24 miles) of Gaza, and requested all <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> at home or near shelter. All summer camps were closed and universities canceled their final exams. Additionally, all gatherings of 300 or more people were banned. Due to the trajectory of rocket fire from Gaza, many flights in and out of Ben-Gurion Airport were delayed or rerouted. and flights to Ben-Gurion airport were interrupted for some days after a Hamas rocket struck an area in its vicinity. Hamas called the FAA flight ban a [...] "great victory". Michael Ross wrote that the decision was driven by anxiety and caused considerably more damage than the potential danger it prevented.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} an {{accommodation}} hut just underneath the west summit since 1883. At that time the Alpine Club section at Munich built a wooden hut with places for twelve people. Although further development of the summit for tourism was criticised, more and more members supported {{the construction of a}} larger hut. This eventually resulted in the building of the Münchner Haus (...) [...] First, in 1896, a 200square metre site was dynamited out of the rock. The new mountain hut was completed on 19 September 1897 at a cost of 36,615 gold marks. It was equipped with a 21kilometre long telephone cable and a 5.5kilometre long lightning conductor. In the years 1911 to 1914 the hut was extended and given its present appearance. It offer 30 beds for overnight stays and is open from May to October. An average of 2,000 <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> there each year, in addition to day visitors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} control fire was a {{dramatic}} change in the habits of early humans. Making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food, simultaneously increasing the variety and availability of nutrients and reducing disease by killing organisms in the food. The heat produced would also help <b>people</b> <b>stay</b> warm in cold weather, enabling them to live in cooler climates. Fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay. Evidence of cooked food is found from , although there is a theory that fire could have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago. [...] Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time. [...] The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, with it being used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from {{tens of thousands of years}} ago.|$|E
