500|$|One of {{the first}} {{statutes}} passed by the First Congress, the Judiciary Act of 1789, divided original jurisdiction for the trial of federal crimes between the district courts and the circuit courts. The district courts were given jurisdiction over all federal crimes [...] "where no other punishment than whipping, not exceeding thirty stripes, a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, is to be inflicted." [...] The circuit courts were given concurrent jurisdiction over these crimes, and exclusive jurisdiction over all other federal crimes. The circuit courts also exercised appellate jurisdiction over the district courts, but only in civil cases. In capital cases, the Act provided that [...] "the trial shall be had in the county where the offence, was committed, or where that cannot be done without great inconvenience, twelve petit jurors at least shall be summoned from thence." [...] "No other <b>procedural</b> <b>provisions</b> were included, probably because the legislators were simultaneously considering amendments which would provide such security." ...|$|E

Since it allowed investors to file cases in state court without the possibility of removal to federal court and whatever additional procedural protections that venue would offer, it could not have been Congress's intent to have held investors to the statute's <b>procedural</b> <b>provisions</b> against their interests. In McMahon and Mitsubushi Motors, the Court had also held that similar language did not bar arbitration of claims.|$|E
50|$|Powell was {{the first}} time the Court had {{reversed}} a state criminal conviction for a violation of a criminal <b>procedural</b> <b>provision</b> of the United States Bill of Rights. In effect, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause included at least part of the right to counsel referred to in the Sixth Amendment, making that much of the Bill of Rights binding on the states as well as the federal government. Before Powell, the Court had reversed state criminal convictions only for racial discrimination in jury selection — a practice that violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|R
5000|$|The Supreme Court, noted Berman J, {{was free}} to condone {{non-compliance}} with a Rule of Court. It was also free to regulate its own procedure {{in the exercise of}} its inherent jurisdiction to ensure that justice was done. Rule 53 of the Uniform Rules of Court, which provides, inter alia, that proceedings on review [...] "shall be by way of notice of motion," [...] is a <b>procedural</b> <b>provision,</b> formulated for the benefit and assistance of a person aggrieved by a decision of a person or body referred to therein. There was no good reason why such a person could not waive the right afforded to him by the Rule. It could not be said, therefore, that the provisions of Rule 53 were peremptory.|$|R
5000|$|At oral argument, Welch and the United States {{argued that}} Johnson should be {{considered}} retroactive. The Court has previously held that only [...] "substantive" [...] rule changes are considered retroactive while [...] "procedural" [...] changes are not. Welch argued that because {{the effect of the}} Johnson ruling was to change the sentence range, the law {{should be considered}} substantive (and thus retroactive). Walker, arguing against retroactivity as an amicus, advanced the argument that, since the source of the ruling was a <b>procedural</b> constitutional <b>provision,</b> Johnson should not be held as retroactive.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Today’s {{enterprise}} {{data centers}} support thousands of missioncritical business applications composed of multiple distributed heterogeneous components. Application components exhibit complex dependencies on {{the configuration of}} multiple data center network, middleware, and related application resources. Applications are also associated with extended life-cycles, migrating from development to testing, staging and production environments, with frequent roll-backs. Maintaining end-toend data center operational integrity and quality requires careful planning of (1) application deployment design, (2) resource selection, (3) provisioning operation selection, parameterization and ordering, and (4) provisioning operation execution. Current data center management products are focused on workflow-based automation of the deployment processes. Workflows are of limited value because they hard-code {{many aspects of the}} process, and are thus sensitive to topology changes. An emerging and promising class of model-based tools is providing new methods for designing detailed deployment topologies based on a set of requirements and constraints. In this paper we describe an approach to bridging the gap between generated “desired state ” models and the elemental <b>procedural</b> <b>provisioning</b> operations supported by data center resources. In our approach, we represent the current and desired state of the data center using object models. We use AI planning to automatically generate workflows that bring the data center from its current state to the desired state. We discuss our optimizations to Partial Order Planning algorithms for the provisioning domain. We validated our approach by developing and integrating a prototype with a state of the art provisioning product. We also present initial results of a performance study. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of subsidiarity {{can be seen as}} a way of generating constitutional law because it covers an essential part of <b>procedural</b> constitutional <b>provisions,</b> i. e. the allocation of competences between member states and Community. In particular it proves to be a standard of constitutional quality because it takes into account, even enhances, the dynamic, success-oriented nature of the Community without leaving justified needs of legitimation unsatisfied. Its legal-dogmatic design means, as a result of the Amsterdam protocol of subsidiarity, that Community Institutions have to give reasons for their exercise of competence in every specific instance. In the case of environmental legal acts, compliance with this obligation is monitored. The discursive procedures attached to these legislative acts can also be understood as learning processes which lead to an increasingly better understanding of the meaning of the {{principle of}} subsidiarity as a way of generating constitutional law, and which also help this notion to gain acceptance and further development in the discussion on law and politicsconstitution building; environmental policy; federalism; institutions; law; legitimacy; subsidiarity...|$|R

40|$|In many {{legal systems}} today, it is {{important}} for evidence that is obtained for use in any judicial proceedings, especially criminal and civil prosecutions, to be obtained lawfully.

40|$|Initially, {{bilateral}} investment treaties (2 ̆ 2 BITs 2 ̆ 2) {{were intended}} as legal instruments {{to promote and}} protect investments from rich capital exporting states to the developing world. While BITs signed between developing countries (hereinafter South-South BITs) began {{to emerge from the}} mid- 1960 s onwards with the 1964 Kuwait-Iraq BIT, a typical BIT was until recently negotiated between a developed and a developing country (hereinafter North-South BITs). In order to examine these questions, this paper will investigate whether there are systematic differences in investment-rule making between South-South and North-South BITs. As noted by UNCTAD in its cursory review of South-South BITs, such an analysis has to be comprehensive and detailed enough to credibly identify whether or not South-South BITs in fact incorporate specific features. Accordingly, this paper will utilize a newly constructed database with 303 BITs signed by 101 countries from 1994 to 2006 analyzed according to a set of quantitative indicators of investment provisions, which in turn allows large-sample statistical analyses. Space constraints naturally preclude a comprehensive examination of the similarities and differences between all substantial and <b>procedural</b> BIT <b>provisions.</b> The focus is therefore on two clauses, which have often been in dispute between developing countries and developed countries in multilateral discussions on investment rules in the past, namely (post-entry) national treatment provisions and provisions on repatriation of investment-related funds...|$|R

These provisions vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may include the ability of a creditor to put a lien on a debtor's property, to effect a seizure and forced sale of the debtor's property, to effect a garnishment of the debtor's wages, and to have certain purchases or gifts made by the debtor set aside as fraudulent conveyances. The rights of a particular creditor usually depend in part on the reason for which the debt is owed, and the terms of any writing memorializing the debt.|$|E

40|$|The {{researcher}} analyses special {{procedural aspects}} and important tools of organisational change management (at {{the level of}} higher educational establishments). As part of the study, the expert survey was conducted {{for the purpose of}} collecting empirical data for the analysis of practical experience of active participants of educational changes. The author surveyed 65 specialists from Ukraine who study the educational change issues in higher educational institutions in their professional or social activities. The survey was conditionally divided into several sections: general, <b>procedural,</b> resources <b>provision</b> of change, instrumental, analysis of change results, informative and analytical, expert evaluation of governmental educational change administration in Ukraine.

The omission of {{at least one of these}} procedures threatens the result of the overall process of educational changes. The author suggests that the low efficiency of educational change implementation in Ukrainian educational establishments is caused by neglect or improper use of essential preparation tools and procedures of proper educational change management support (underestimation of needs for sufficient resources, advisory support, awareness-raising campaigns, administration support, stimulation of participants and necessity of their continuous training) ...|$|R

50|$|In 1978, Congress {{passed the}} Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). This law was enacted to protect tribes and their {{children}}; {{due to the}} high rate of Indian children who were being removed from their families and placed with non-Indian families, the children's Indian identities were lost and tribe survival was being threatened. In many cases, the children were removed from families who resided on Indian reservations, where the state government did not have legal jurisdiction. Many parents and children were denied due process, either by the state agency or the state court, leading to a finding by Congress that the states had failed to recognize tribal culture, relations, and standards. Congress set up both <b>procedural</b> and substantive <b>provisions</b> in the ICWA that are designed to 1) eliminate the need to remove Indian children due to cultural bias; 2) try to ensure that Indian children are placed in foster and adoptive homes that reflect Indian culture; and 3) to promote the use of tribal, rather than state, courts to adjudicate Indian child custody proceedings.|$|R

The EFTA Court held that provisions of the EEA Agreement as well as <b>procedural</b> <b>provisions</b> of the SCA are to be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights and that the provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights and the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights are important sources for determining the scope of these rights. With regard to the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time granted by Article 6(1) ECHR, the EFTA Court observed that the European Court of Human Rights held in a case concerning a delay of two years and seven months due to a reference by a national court to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling, that this period of time could not be taken into consideration in the assessment of the length of a particular set of proceedings. To take it into account would adversely affect the system instituted by what is now Article 267 TFEU and work against the aim pursued in substance in that Article, as seen in Case Pafitis. The EFTA Court held that the same must apply with regard to the procedure established under Article 34 of the SCA which, as a means of inter-court cooperation, contributes to the proper functioning of the EEA Agreement to the benefit of individuals and economic operators. The EFTA Court added that, the time period from the registration of the request to the delivery of judgment amounted to a little more than five months.|$|E

40|$|The insight {{upon which}} {{this article is}} built is that the common {{structures}} of these two legal regimes create incentives toward destroying the resources they seek to protect. The shift from legal freedom to exploit resources to strict limitation on property modification and the lengthy and public process to designate or list specific resources for protection provide the motive {{and the opportunity to}} legally frustrate the application of the statutes. This article seeks to understand how these perverse incentives are created and how they can be lessened. The <b>procedural</b> and substantive <b>provisions</b> of both legal regimes have evolved to reduce the perverse incentives created by the formal precipice character of the regulatory structure. Part I describes each regulatory regime and specifies the ways the regimes create incentives to destroy the resources they aim to protect. Part I also reviews the literature identifying such perverse incentives and what is known about the incidence of actual destruction. Part II addresses actual and suggested changes to the procedures for designation or listing the resources, while Part III looks at substantive changes in the laws that may have the purpose or effect of moderating negative incentives. Finally, part IV concludes by considering the extent to which accommodation reforms further, or compromise, the values that historic preservation and biodiversity laws advance...|$|R
40|$|While {{arbitration}} {{is practiced}} {{in nearly every}} region of the world, underlying assumptions {{of what it means}} to arbitrate a dispute or to be a “good arbitrator” are largely shaped by notions of role-perception and virtue. Such long standing conceptions tend to be deeply rooted and in turn have a significant influence on contemporary practice. Drawing on the concept of role morality, or the internalized expectations that guide an arbitrator’s actions and constitute a form of implicit law, 1 this paper presents a cross-cultural examination of how international arbitrators view their role in actively promoting settlement in the context of international arbitration proceedings. The result of both in-depth interviews as well as a 115 -person survey indicate that on the whole, international guidelines such as the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and the IBA Rules of Ethics * 2 for International Arbitrators have contributed to the harmonization of contemporary perspectives regarding the appropriateness of particular settlement interventions, such as suggesting settlement negotiations to disputing parties and engaging in settlement negotiations at the request of disputing parties. At the same time, historic and philosophical emphasis on the virtue of reconciliation is reflected in a slightly higher degree of involvement and effectiveness in assisting parties to reach settlement agreements in East Asia than in the West. Because of the flexible structure of international arbitration based on a Model Law system which allows countries to opt in or out of particular <b>provisions,</b> <b>procedural</b> variation pertaining to differing preferences for conciliatory or adjudicatory approaches to arbitration can coexist with a relatively high level of substantive legal uniformity across regions...|$|R
40|$|During World War II, the Manhattan Engineering District (MED) {{utilized}} {{facilities in}} the Buffalo, New York area to extract natural uranium from uranium-bearing ores. The Linde property {{is one of several}} properties within the Tonawanda, New York Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) site, which includes Linde, Ashland 1, Ashland 2, and Seaway. Union Carbide Corporation's Linde Division was placed under contract with the Manhattan Engineering District (MED) from 1942 to 1946 to extract uranium from seven different ore sources: four African pitchblende ores and three domestic ores. Over the years, erosion and weathering have spread contamination from the residuals handled and disposed of at Linde to adjacent soils. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) negotiated a Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) governing remediation of the Linde property. In Fiscal Year (FY) 1998, Congress transferred cleanup management responsibility for the sites in the FUSRAP program, including the Linde Site, from the DOE to the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), with the charge to commence cleanup promptly. All actions by the USACE at the Linde Site are being conducted subject to the administrative, <b>procedural,</b> and regulatory <b>provisions</b> of the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the existing FFA. USACE issued a Proposed Plan for the Linde Property in 1999 and a Final Record of Decision (ROD) in 2000.
