40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the distribution and nature of Fe oxides in plinthic soils on the sediments of Barreiras Group (in the state of Piauí) and Itapecuru Formation (in the state of Maranhão) in Northeastern Brazil. Four pedons were selected: a "plinthic, dystrophic, epieutrophic Gray Podzolic with low activity clay" and a "dystrophic <b>Plinthosol</b> with low activity clay" (both Plinthic Kandiustalfs) on the Barreiras sediments, as well as an "eutrophic <b>Plinthosol</b> with low activity clay" and an "allic <b>Plinthosol</b> with low activity clay" (both Plinthustalfs) on the Itapecuru sediments. Soil samples were fractionated into > 2 mm (pisoliths), water-stable aggregates (plinthite) and matrices; the aggregates and matrices were further fractionated into sand, silt and clay sizes. Dithionite extractable iron (Fe d) and aluminum (Al d), as well as oxalate extractable iron (Fe o), were determined for all fractions, and X-ray diffraction analyses were performed on the pisoliths. It was observed that the Plinthustalfs contain more iron oxides, exhibit more extensive plinthite development and have a greater potential for further plinthite development than the Kandiustalfs. The distribution of values for the Fe d indicates that plinthite formation and induration in all soils were accompanied by an enrichment of Fe oxides in all particle size fractions. This Fe segregation was accompanied by aggregation of particles leading to a greater degree of crystallinity, as indicated by analysis of the ratios of Al d:Fe d. Larger ratios of goethite to hematite, and relatively smaller amounts of silicates in the more mature pisoliths were revealed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Ratios of Al d:Fe d were larger in the Kandiustalfs than in the Plinthustalfs, and also larger than expected for Al-substituted Fe oxides. According to ratios of Al d:Fe d, Fe mobilization in all soils has likely occurred under reducing conditions, facilitated by organic matter on the soil surface...|$|E

The development of low cost technologies for amending agricultural soils in this environment is needed. Biological and organic fertilizers were tested in 20 farmers' fields in central Benin for rainfed rice production on acidic <b>plinthosol</b> under monomodal rainfall pattern conditions. Short time matured cowpea and native grass fallow were preceding NERICA 1 and Ina Okpè rice cultivars that are interspecific (Oryza glaberrima × Oryza sativa) and local varieties respectively. Cowpea and bush residues were incorporated into soil before rice seeding. Soil nutrients (C,N,K, Ca and Zn) contents were significantly depleted whereas null balance was observed for soil available-P content. An in-creased of soil content in Fe (> 130 mg kg- 1) was significantly observed in all the treatments. Highest yield of 1. 6 t ha- 1 was recorded in the treatment composed of cowpea and NERICA 1. The study technology was deemed suitable in deficient-P acid soil whereas the land foot slope position was excluded to avoid potential increasing of Fe content (iron toxicity of rice) in soil of the subsequent lowland. Minimum chemical fertilizer was required for improving rainfed rice cultivation on <b>plinthosol</b> in monomodal rainfall pattern ecology. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

This study evaluated P fractions and availability in a chronosequence of anthropic influence in a Haplic <b>Plinthosol,</b> in sites under no-till for different time periods: seven (NT 7), eleven (NT 11), and sixteen (NT 16) years. Labile P concentrations in the soil accounted for 10 %, 8 %, and 9 % of the total P for treatments NT 7, NT 11, and NT 16, respectively. The labile P values ranged between 99 and 122 mg dm- 3 andindicatied no time in no-tillage influence on labile P under in the studied <b>Plinthosol.</b> However, moderately labile P contents increased with time: NT 7 < NT 11 < NT 16 (237, 341, and 375 mg dm- 3, respectively). This increased followed the elevation in iron oxide contents, indicating a relationship between mineralogy and P accumulation. Regardless of no-tillage period, P contents extracted by Mehlich- 1 were lower, underestimating the available P content, {{when compared with the}} extraction using a P selective resin. The stocks of labile P were sufficient to maintain high crop yields, according to the recommendations for the Cerrado region.

40|$|Large {{areas of}} Plinthosols with {{ferruginous}} {{materials such as}} plinthite and/or petroplinthite are fairly common in the Brazilian Amazon basin. This work was carried out to investigate the chemical behavior, mineralogical composition and weathering stage of four representative soil profiles with plinthite and petroplinthite, in Iranduba, AM (Central Amazon). Three well-drained soil profiles at high elevations were studied (P 1, Plinthic Vetic Ferralsol; P 2 and P 3, Vetic Endopetric <b>Plinthosol)</b> and a contrasting poorly drained soil (P 4 Haplic <b>Plinthosol),</b> located at low elevation. After profile descriptions, soil samples were collected from each horizon, air-dried, sieved (2 mm), and analyzed for particle-size distribution, pH, exchangeable cations (Al 3 +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K+, and Na+), as well as available P and total organic carbon (TOC) content. The minerals present in the clay and sand fractions, {{as well as in}} the ferruginous materials were identified by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The weathering stage of these soils was assessed by means of Ki and Kr indexes, and the amounts of free and amorphous Fe and Al oxides by using dithionite citrate bicarbonate (DBC) and ammonium oxalate dissolution procedures, respectively. The results showed that all soils were extremely unfertile, with pH levels ranging between strong and moderate acidity, very low sum of bases and organic matter content, and of available P. The mineralogy of the soil profiles was very similar, mainly of the well-drained soils, with predominance of kaolinite and quartz in the clay and sand fractions, respectively. In the poorly-drained P 4, 2 : 1 clay particles were also observed. These profiles can be considered highly developed according to the Ki index, however, the Ki value of P 4 was higher, indicating that this soil was less developed than the others.

Fluoride toxicities in the environment are known to not be related to the disease. To investigate if, instead, CDR is caused by a nutrient deficiency in the environment, subsistence farms in an endemic CDR area near Kaduna, northern Nigeria, were investigated for bedrock, slope forms, soil types, and soil characteristics. The natural environment was investigated according to the World Reference Base, soil texture was analysed by pipette and sieving, and plant-available macronutrients were determined using barium-chloride or Ca-acetate-lactate extraction. The analyses showed that granite and slope deposits were the dominant parent materials. The typical slope forms and soil types were Lixisols and Acrisols on pediments, Fluvisols in river valleys, and <b>Plinthosols</b> and Acrisols on plains. Compared with West African background values, all of the soils had normal soil textures but were low in macronutrients. Comparisons to critical limits, however, showed that only the P concentrations were critically low, which are typical for savanna soils.

We characterized the morphological, {{physical and chemical}} properties of soils at four different forest fragments that occur in the savanna-forest mosaic of northeastern Roraima, north Amazonia. The methodology was based on transects crossing the entire island, from east-west and north- south direction, digging up five soil profiles for sampling and classification. In addition, the neighboring savannas were also sampled following the same strategy, at 100 m long transects departing from the border, allowing comparisons to be made. Latosols were the dominant soil class in all four islands, followed by Ultisols and <b>Plinthosols.</b> All soils were dystric, with low CEC and acid. Better chemical and physical conditions were observed in forested soils compared with surrounding savannas, in a given soil class. Thus, in spite of no variation on soil class at different phytophysionomies at a given gradient, specific chemical and physical attributes were significantly varied, exerting a positive effect for the establishment of forest vegetation. Despite their occurrence side-by-side in the savanna- forest mosaic, the present –day climate agrees with the existence of savanna in the flat landforms, whereas forest islands are conditioned by subtle, yet significant, soil physico-chemical variations, with no need to invoke any paleoclimate for explaining this relationship.

The Solonetz and Gleysol have higher fertility, as evidenced by the significant values of CEC (cation exchange rate) and base saturation.

All the USLE factors were generated in a distributed approach employing a GIS tool. The layers were multiplied in the GIS framework in order to predict soil erosion rates. Results showed that the average soil loss was 6. 2 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1. Relative to soil loss tolerance, 83 % of the area had an erosion rate lesser than the tolerable value. According to soil loss classes, 49 % of the watershed had erosion less than 2. 5 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1. However, about 8. 7 % of the watershed had erosion rates greater than 15 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1, being mainly related to <b>Plinthosol</b> soil class and roads, thus requiring special attention {{for the improvement of}} sustainable management practices for such areas.

However, its use may limit the succession of non-tolerant crops for long residual activity. The research objective with this work was to determine the persistence of imazethapyr, imazapic and their mixture in three soils in the Brazilian state of Tocantins. Three experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with four replications, each corresponding to the evaluated soil (Haplic <b>Plinthosol</b> (FX), red-yellow Latosol (LVA) and Haplic Gleysol (GX)). The treatments were arranged in a split plot design, with the allocated plots herbicides (imazethapyr and imazapic alone and commercial mixture) and the plots allocated the 11 evaluation times (1, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150 days after treatment (DAT)), and a control without application. Contacted up long residual effect of imazethapyr and commercial mixture of imazethapyr and imazapic, regardless of assessed soil. After 150 days of applying herbicides or the commercial mixture, their residues in the soil also inhibited approximately 94 % of the mass of the dry matter accumulation of the indicator plants. When imazapic was applied alone, there was a higher dry matter accumulation of the indicator plants, indicating less residual effect of this herbicide in the soil and this was attributed to the lower dose of this herbicide applied. The attributes of the soil pH, texture and iron oxides were what most affected the persistence of the herbicides. It can be concluded that the persistence of imazethapyr and imazapic is too long in the Brazilian state of Tocantins soils and the use of these herbicides in the region should be avoided due to the high risk of the occurrence of carryover,or be well planned, as land use in rotation for susceptible crops...|$|E

The modes and rates of relief inversion that lead the upper layers of the Araripe basin to their culminating position are examined in relation with geological structure and regional uplift, through the presentation and discussion of morphostructural patterns and types of escarpments, differential erosion landforms, soil sequences, modalities of scarp retreat, and possible differential vertical movements (tectonic inversion). The geomorphic and pedological contrast between the plateau (a near-structural surface covered by Ferralsols) and its lower surroundings (either an exhumed Pre-Cenomanian paleosurface covered by <b>Plinthosols,</b> or lower surfaces with relatively immature soils of Luvisol type, often associated with Leptosols) is explained through a study of the evolution of the cuesta-like scarps or glints and outliers that fringe the chapada above sedimentary depressions and basement surfaces. A reconstruction of the conditions and chronology of relief inversion and corresponding area reduction is proposed, according to principles and methods of morphostratigraphy and morphopedology. It brings elements for discussing recently published models of episodic burial and exhumation history, based upon interpretations of thermochronological data obtained in nearby regions.

In the same order, the sand content ranged from 529 to 794 g kg- 1 and 417 to 597 g kg- 1 and decreased with soil depth. Silt ranged from 55 to 105 g kg- 1 and 104 to 154 g kg- 1 and was irregularly distributed within the profiles. Clay ranged from 116 to 386 g kg- 1 and 269 to 449 g kg- 1 and unlike sand, it increased down the profiles. Both pedons were imperfectly drained and had plinthites in their subsurface. The pH ranged from 5. 5 to 6. 5 and 6. 0 to 7. 2. Organic C and TN were rated high in EF with values of 16. 76 g kg- 1 and 0. 37 g kg- 1 and medium in MF with values of 10. 68 g kg- 1 and 0. 17 g kg- 1 respectively. Also, available P was 11 and 8 mg kg- 1 and was rated medium in both soils. The average ECEC values were 5. 75 cmol kg- 1 and 12. 45 cmol kg- 1. The pedons were classified at subgroup level as Typic Plinthustalfs in USDA taxonomy which correlates as WRB-IUSS’s Haplic <b>Plinthosols</b> (Eutric).

40|$|Topography {{has been}} {{reported}} to be the major factor ruling the spatial distribution of Acrisols, <b>Plinthosols</b> and Gleysols on the seasonally flooded, low elevation plateaux of the upper Amazon basin occupied by Tertiary (Ica & Solimoes) sediments. In this study, detailed morphological and mineralogical investigations conducted in a representative 25 -ha site were combined with hydro-geochemical data to relate the vertical and lateral soil differentiations observed to the hydro-geological history of that part of the basin. As a result of the uplift of the Andes, several cuts in the extensive Tertiary marshlands have formed, at first, slightly incised plateaux of low elevation. There, weathering under hot and humid climates would have generated a reddish, freely drained and bioturbated topsoil layer and the vertical differentiation in subsoil sediments of a plinthite over an iron-depleted mottled clay. The second episode of soil differentiation is linked to the replacement of the forest by a savannah under the drier climates of the late Pleistocene, which favours surface runoff and the infill of the incisions by fine particles. This infill, combined with the return to the present humid climate, has then enabled the local groundwater to rise on the plateaux and to generate episaturation at the topsoil/subsoil transition close to the depressions. Nowadays, ferrous iron is released from the partly iron-depleted topsoil weathering front at high water levels during the rainy seasons. It moves from footslope to low-lying positions and from top to bottom in the soil profile according to the groundwater dynamics. The present general trend is thus to the lateral export of iron at high water levels due to subsurface and overland flows, its vertical transfer during the recession of the groundwater and accumulation in a nodular plinthite. In the latter, ferrous iron is adsorbed onto its softest iron masses where it feeds the neoformation of ferrihydrite that rapidly dehydrates into haematite...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of growing {{population}} pressure and limited fertile land availability, Nigerien farmers increasingly rely on marginal lands (Plinthosols) for crop production. These degraded lands, however, generally provide poor millet yields (< 100 kg ha- 1 yr- 1) due to their low soil nutrient content and imbalanced partitioning of water over the root-zone. This dissertation aims to provide scientific verification of the potential of small-scale water and soil conservation (WSC) techniques to tackle these two major crop growth limitations. The overall objective is to evaluate the biophysicail and socio-economic viability of WSC techniques in the Tillaberí region of Niger. In order to monitor WSC techniques, a field experiment was laid on a <b>Plinthosol</b> nearby Sadoré. The treatments include: zaï + manure (Z), demi-lunes + manure (DL), scarification + manure (SCAR), control + manure (CF) and control (C). Grain yields for the conventional practices (C and CF) were extremely low and soil-water storage in the rootzone remained below the critical value for drought stress, {{even if there was}} sufficient rainfall. WSC techniques, on the other hand, successfully mitigated drought stress. WSC increased grain yields to 700 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 for Z and to 250 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 for DL and SCAR. By applying WSC, soil-water storage increased above the critical value for drought stress. This was mainly {{a result of}} significant run-off reduction under WSC (i. e. from approximately 25 % for C to 5 - 10 %). WSC techniques were, on the other hand, found to have only little impact on soil evaporation. A design optimization study with a three-dimensional coupled surface-subsurface soil hydrological model showed that rainwater use efficiency of DL could be improved by increasing the density of DL bunds per surface area while decreasing the number of millet plants per DL bund. Soil quality analysis showed that, SOC content increased significantly for the treatments with manure application (CF,SCAR, DL and Z), from ± 2. 5 to ± 5 g kg- 1. WSC techniques did not improve physical soil quality, but did significantly improve biological soil quality. A socio-economic survey indicated that the adoption of WSC techniques in the region is limited by manure shortage and a lack of specific erosion knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Eucalyptus {{cultivation}} {{has increased}} in all Brazilian regions. In order to recommend good management practices {{it is necessary to}} understand differences in soil properties where eucalyptus is planted. In addition, aggregate stability analyses have proved to be a useful tool to measure soil effects caused by changes in management practices. Besides, the evaluation of soil erosion is an important tool for planning of conservationist management actions allowing appropriate changes on land-use and implementation of sustainable management strategies in the long-term. Thus, the objectives of this study were: i) to determine the main soil properties for different soil classes, and assess the relationship between aggregate stability and changes in soils under eucalyptus plantation, and ii) to predict the potential annual soil loss using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) coupled in a Geographical Information System (GIS). We studied representative soils within three eucalyptus cultivated regions. In the Espírito Santo state the soils selected were classified as dystrocohesive Yellow Argisol - PA 1 (Hapludult), moderately rocky Yellow Argisol - PA 2 (Hapludult), and dystrophic Haplic <b>Plinthosol</b> - FX (Phinthaquox). In the Rio Doce Valley, center-east region of Minas Gerais state, the samples were collected in dystrophic Red-Yellow Latosol - LVA (Haplustox) and dystrophic Red Latosol - LV (Haplustox). In the south region of Brazil the area encompasses eutrophic Red Argisol - PVe (Rhodudalf), dystrophic Red-Yellow Argisol - PVA (Hapludult), and dystrophic Haplic Cambisol - CXbd (Dystrudept). Physical, chemical, and mineralogical analyses were performed for the A horizon to characterize the predominant soil profiles. Aggregate stability was measured using the high-energy moisture characteristic (HEMC) technique. Aggregate stability ratio was greater than 50 % for all soils. This fact shows for highly weathered soils with large amount of 1 : 1 clay minerals, that the aggregate stability index was high. In the Espírito Santo we performed the USLE model in order to evaluate soil erosion. All the USLE factors were generated in a distributed approach using GIS framework. Results showed that the average soil loss was 6. 2 t ha- 1 yr- 1. Relative to soil loss tolerance, 86 % of the area presented erosion rate smaller than the tolerable value...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of biochar rate (0, 8, 16 and 32 Mg ha − 1) on the water retention capacity (WRC) of a sandy loam Dystric <b>Plinthosol.</b> The applied biochar was a by-product of slow pyrolysis (∼ 450 °C) of eucalyptus wood, milled to pass through a 2000 μm sieve that resulted in a material with an intrinsic porosity ≤ 10 μm and a specific surface area of ∼ 3. 2 m 2 g − 1. The biochar was incorporated into the top 15 cm of the soil under an aerobic rice system. Our study focused on both the effects on WRC and rice yields 2 and 3 years after its application. Undisturbed soil samples were collected from 16 plots in two soil layers (5 – 10 and 15 – 20 cm). Soil water retention curves were modelled using a nonlinear mixed model which appropriately accounts for uncertainties inherent of spatial variability and repeated measurements taken within a specific soil sample. We found an increase in plant-available water in the upper soil layer proportional to the rate of biochar, with about 0. 8 % for each Mg ha − 1 biochar amendment 2 and 3 years after its application. The impact of biochar on soil WRC was most likely related to an effect in overall porosity of the sandy loam soil, which was evident from an increase in saturated soil moisture and macro porosity with 0. 5 and 1. 6 % for each Mg ha − 1 of biochar applied, respectively. The increment in soil WRC did not translate into an increase in rice yield, essentially because in both seasons the amount of rainfall during the critical period for rice production exceeded 650 mm. The use of biochar as a soil amendment can be a worthy strategy to guarantee yield stability under short-term water-limited conditions. Our findings raise the importance of assessing the feasibility of very high application rates of biochar and the inclusion of a detailed analysis of its physical and chemical properties as part of future investigations...|$|E

Soil enzymes are sensitive to variations induced by natural and anthropo-genic disturbances (Gupta et al. 1988, Dick 1997). Vegetation, soil type, land use history and soil management strategy affect soil enzymes (Green and Oleksyszyn 2002, Wyszkowska et al. 2005). Many {{studies have suggested that}} soil enzymes can be used as indices of soil contamination, soil fertility and soil health (Masciandaro et al. 1998, Saviozzi et al. 2001). Previous studies demonstrated the significant relationship between soil enzymes and other soil characteristics, but the relationship is largely dependent on the species of enzymes and the environmental variables (Bergstrom et al. 1998). In contrast, some studies suggest that there is no relationship between soil enzymes and soil nutri-ents (Sakorn 1987). Urbanization has drastically altered soil properties and processes (Green and Oleksyszyn 2002).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that as soil fertility increases, {{the amount of}} carbon allocated to below-ground production (fine roots) should decrease. To evaluate this hypothesis, we measured the standing crop fine root mass and the production of fine roots (&lt; 2 mm) by two methods: (1) ingrowth cores and, (2) sequential soil coring, during 2. 2 years in two lowland forests growing on different soils types in the Colombian Amazon. Differences of soil resources were defined by the type and physical and chemical properties of soil: a forest on clay loam soil (Endostagnic <b>Plinthosol)</b> at the Amacayacu National Natural Park and, the other on white sand (Ortseinc Podzol) at the Zafire Biological Station, located in the Forest Reservation of the Calderón River. We found that the standing crop fine root mass and the production was significantly different between soil depths (0 – 10 and 10 – 20 cm) and also between forests. The loamy sand forest allocated more carbon to fine roots than the clay loam forest with the production in loamy sand forest twice (mean&plusmn;standard error= 2. 98 &plusmn; 0. 36 and 3. 33 &plusmn; 0. 69 Mg C ha&minus; 1 yr&minus; 1 , method 1 and 2, respectively) as much as for the more fertile loamy soil forest (1. 51 &plusmn; 0. 14, method 1, and from 1. 03 &plusmn; 0. 31 to 1. 36 &plusmn; 0. 23 Mg C ha&minus; 1 yr&minus; 1 , method 2). Similarly, the average of standing crop fine root mass was higher in the white-sands forest (10. 94 &plusmn; 0. 33 Mg C ha&minus; 1 ) as compared to the forest on the more fertile soil (from 3. 04 &plusmn; 0. 15 to 3. 64 &plusmn; 0. 18 Mg C ha&minus; 1 ). The standing crop fine root mass also showed a temporal pattern related to rainfall, with the production of fine roots decreasing substantially in the dry period of the year 2005. These results suggest that soil resources may {{play an important role in}} patterns of carbon allocation to the production of fine roots in these forests as the proportion of carbon allocated to above- and below-ground organs is different between forest types. Thus, a trade-off between above- and below-ground growth seems to exist with our results also suggesting that there are no differences in total net primary productivity between these two forests, but with higher below-ground production and lower above-ground production for the forest on the nutrient poor soil...|$|E
