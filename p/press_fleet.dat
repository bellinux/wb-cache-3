5000|$|The Marina's {{public life}} {{did not get}} off to a good start. The rushed final stages of design and production, {{especially}} in regard to the suspension, meant that many of the <b>press</b> <b>fleet</b> cars had an incorrect front suspension set-up whereby there was no camber change when the car rolled, which in turn produced [...] "almost heroic" [...] levels of understeer: Autocar reported that the car they were driving ended up {{on the wrong side of}} the road when taking a sharp corner. [...] This was a particular problem with the more powerful 1.8 and 1.8 TC cars, which were unfortunately the models the press were most likely to test, though the 1.3-litre models with their lighter engine did not suffer from the problem to the same extent. Early production Marinas were fitted with the original front suspension although a different lower link-arm (trunnion) was fitted quite quickly. The best estimate is that about 30,000 cars with the original suspension were sold to the public: many, though not all, had their front suspension set-up retrospectively corrected by dealers and before September 1971, less than six months after launch, front suspension [...] "uprights" [...] were being modified on the production line. The Marina was never intended, or designed, to have particularly exciting or sharp handling, but the early problems led to less-than flattering road test reports and it was undeniable that the Marina's handling always tended towards understeer, which for a rear-wheel-drive car was unusual, and body-roll. What Car? magazine, in a very typical review, described the understeer as [...] "noticeable", but called the car as a whole [...] "unobtrusively well designed".|$|E

50|$|As their {{revenues}} have been squeezed, newspapers {{have also been}} increasingly assailed by other media taking away not only their readers, but their principal sources of profit. Many of these 'new media' are not saddled with expensive union contracts, printing <b>presses,</b> delivery <b>fleets</b> and overhead built over decades. Many of these competitors are simply 'aggregators' of news, often derived from print sources, but without print media's capital-intensive overhead. One estimate put the percentage of online news derived from newspapers at 80%.|$|R

During World War I, she saw front-line {{service in the}} II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, {{culminating}} in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916. Schleswig-Holstein saw action during the engagement, and was hit by one large-caliber shell. After the battle, Schleswig-Holstein was relegated to guard duty {{in the mouth of}} the Elbe River before being decommissioned in late 1917. As one of the few battleships permitted for Germany by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Schleswig-Holstein was again <b>pressed</b> into <b>fleet</b> service in the 1920s.

50|$|He {{was educated}} at Denstone College, Staffordshire. After graduating in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford, and then {{teaching}} at Rossall, Sherborne and Tonbridge, and Royal Air Force College Cranwell, Mais later worked for National <b>Press</b> at <b>Fleet</b> Street. A prolific author writing over 200 books, he also broadcast for numerous wireless programmes for the BBC between the 1920s and 1940s. In 1913 he married Doris Snow (born Clifton, Bristol in 1892) in Oldland, Gloucestershire; {{the couple had}} two daughters: Priscilla (1916-1982) and Vivien (born 1920). After the marriage was dissolved (they never divorced), he got together with Jill Doughty (who was considerably younger). S.P.B. (who preferred to be called Petre), was an ardent campaigner for the English countryside and traditions, leading walks for people who came for a day trip by train from big cities, often from London. He began to broadcast Letter from America in 1933, a ground breaking venture at the time.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{agreement}} amongst historians that the mass media played {{a vital role in}} the national debate surrounding Anthony Eden's policies during the 1956 Suez crisis. However, little attempt has been made to study the relationship {{between the government and the}} mass media during Suez, nor, for that matter, what role public opinion played in the Prime Minister's thinking. This article examines Eden's propaganda strategy during Suez, then focuses on his assiduous efforts to increase the hostility of the British press towards Nasserism and enlist the newspapers as active supporters in a policy which ultimately meant war. It is argued that Eden was remarkably successful given his reputation as one of Fleet Street's most celebrated victims. Although he faced opposition from sections of the left???wing <b>press</b> throughout, <b>Fleet</b> Street was on the whole consistently more aggressive than was public opinion. This has implications not only for our understanding of the Suez crisis, but also for the much???vaunted strength and independence of Britain's fourth estat...|$|R
50|$|Two {{collections}} of Rodriguess work were published during his lifetime: Spitting on the Sheriff and Other Diversions (Fawcett Gold Medal, 1966), {{which consists of}} cartoons from various mens magazines, and Total Harmonic Distortion (Perfectbound Press, 1988), which reprints his work from Stereo Review. He also drew cartoons for Defending the Undefendable (<b>Fleet</b> <b>Press,</b> 1976), a discourse by libertarian economist Walter Block. In 2013, Fantagraphics Books published Ray and Joe: The Story of a Dead Man and His Friend, and Other Classic Comics, a collection of his pages from National Lampoon. In late 2015, Fantagraphics published a second collection, Gag on This: The Scrofulous Cartoons of Charles Rodrigues, which collects gag cartoons from the Lampoon.|$|R
500|$|On 1 July, the German fleet began a major cruise {{into the}} Atlantic; {{on the return}} voyage in early August, the fleet stopped at the Isle of Wight for the Cowes Regatta. While there on 6 August, Wilhelm II held a remembrance {{ceremony}} for the 25th anniversary of Wörths namesake battle. This was sharply criticized in the British <b>press.</b> The <b>fleet</b> returned to Wilhelmshaven on 10 August and began preparations for the autumn maneuvers that would begin later that month. The first exercises began in the Helgoland Bight on 25 August. The fleet then steamed through the Skagerrak to the Baltic; heavy storms caused significant damage {{to many of the}} ships and the torpedo boat [...] capsized and sank in the storms—only three men were saved. The fleet stayed briefly in Kiel before resuming maneuvers, including live-fire exercises, in the Kattegat and the Great Belt. The main maneuvers began on 7 September with a mock attack from Kiel toward the eastern Baltic. Subsequent maneuvers took place off the coast of Pomerania and in Danzig Bay. A fleet review for Wilhelm II off Jershöft concluded the maneuvers on 14 September.|$|R
2500|$|Poor {{construction}} {{quality was}} apparent {{even in the}} company's <b>press</b> department <b>fleet.</b> The British magazine Motor published a road test of an automatic 3500 in January 1977, and while keen to highlight the Rover's general excellence, they also reported that the test car suffered from poor door seals, with daylight visible from inside past the rear door window frame's edge {{on the left side}} of the car, and a curious steering vibration at speed which might (or might not) have resulted from the car's front wheels not having been correctly balanced. Disappointment was recorded that the ventilation outlet directly in front of the driver appeared to be blocked, delivering barely a breeze even when fully open; the writer had encountered this problem on one other Rover 3500, although he had also driven other cars of the same type with an abundant output of fresh air through the vent in question. Nevertheless, in March 1977, Britain's Autocar was able to publish an article by Raymond Mays – a famous racing driver and team manager during (in particular) the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s – in which Mays explained why, after driving it for 12,000miles, he considered his Rover 3500 was [...] "the best car he [...] ever had", both for its many qualities as a driver's car and for its excellent fuel economy even when driven hard. Similar ventilation problems persisted until 1980 and were reported in tests of the V8-S version.|$|R
