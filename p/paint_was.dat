5|$|In the American Civil War, {{camouflage}} <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> {{applied by}} both sides during the Union blockade of 1861–1865. Blockade runners aiding the Confederates sometimes painted their ships all in mist-gray, to hide themselves in coastal fog. One Union blockade crew may have painted their rowboat white, and its oars, and wore white clothing for a night reconnaissance patrol up an enemy-held river.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes were}} made during the renovation. The {{vertical}} marquee which had marked the theatre's presence from 1926 to 1980, was removed, the orchestra pit and auditorium seating were rebuilt, the dressing rooms moved, and the technical systems updated. However, the furniture, fixtures and interior signage were retained. Even the <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> carefully restored to its original luster. The renovation made it suitable again for live performances and filled Seattle's need for a touring Broadway musical venue. Renovation work was completed without federal, state, or local funds.|$|E
5|$|The wing-to-fuselage mating of {{the first}} A330, the tenth {{airframe}} of the A330 and A340 line, began in mid-February 1992. This aircraft, coated with anti-corrosion <b>paint,</b> <b>was</b> rolled out on 31 March without its General Electric CF6-80E1 engines, which were installed by August. During a static test, the wing failed just below requirement; BAe engineers later resolved the problem. At the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, Northwest deferred delivery of sixteen A330s to 1994, following the cancellation of its A340 orders.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} ways that <b>paint</b> can <b>be</b> {{recycled}}. Most often, the highest quality of latex <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> sorted out and turned back into recycled <b>paint</b> that can <b>be</b> used. Recycled <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> environmentally preferable to new paint, while still maintaining comparable quality. In many cases, reusable paints of the same color are pumped into a tank where the material is mixed and tested. The <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> adjusted with additives and colorants as necessary. Finally, the <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> fine filtered and packaged for sale.|$|R
5|$|X-ray {{analysis}} {{shows that there}} were a few preparatory drawings made with chalk before the <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> applied. This is left exposed in some areas, most noticeably in the Virgin's veil and mantle and in Christ's shroud. Infrared photography reveals little underdrawing but shows that the canvas underwent several changes before it was completed; Mary Salome was repositioned slightly to the left, the sizes of Nicodemus' arm and shoulder were reduced, and the Magdalen's face was painted over the Virgin's mantle.|$|E
5|$|A pier at Port Aransas {{was largely}} {{destroyed}} {{at a cost}} of $10,000. The hurricane caused extensive damage to rice, cotton, and vegetable crops in the region. An estimate several days after the storm placed the total quantity of rice damaged at 500,000 bushels, totaling $10million in monetary losses. However, Zoch (1949) reported that total damage from the storm was $6.7 million. Following the storm, thousands of automobiles in six states were affected by widespread peeling and blistering paint. The blisters, usually concentrated on the hoods, fenders and tops of vehicles, contained a small amount of water, and peeling <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> also reported on one Shreveport home. Most of the cars damaged were parked outside, and sheltered automobiles were unaffected. Although total damage from the phenomenon may have reached thousands of dollars, experts were unable to identify its cause immediately following the storm. Two deaths were attributed to the storm: a resident of Port Neches who was electrocuted, and a young woman who drowned in Matagorda Bay.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was {{displayed}} {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 the <b>painting</b> has <b>been</b> {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like the <b>painting</b> to <b>be</b> shown. The <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution <b>was</b> adopted. The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> restored in 2007.|$|R
50|$|Metro {{receives}} post-consumer {{latex paint}} (PCLP) from garbage customers. Technicians inspect the paint for recyclability: recyclable <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> sorted by color, and unrecyclable <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> disposed in landfills. The recyclable <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> then color-corrected. Additives are blended in, and the <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> then filtered, performance tested, packaged into pails and cans, and sold {{back to the}} public at a price intended to recover the program’s labor and material costs.|$|R

5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E
5|$|In the Age of Sail, {{deception}} {{was often}} used by ships, and <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage. A ship might be painted {{to look like}} another, it might have its cannon ports hidden by painted canvas to look harmless, or it might have additional cannon ports painted on to appear more powerful. For example, {{in one of his}} battles during 1778–1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of his ship the General Pickering, to appear {{as if it were a}} slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Marigene Butler, head {{conservator}} at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, oversaw a multi-national {{research project}} between 1983 and 1989. Her team investigated the provenance {{of the two}} paintings and relationships between them through technical analyses. At that time both paintings underwent further restorations. They examined the wooden supports, parchment fibres and priming layers of the Philadelphia painting. A sample of <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> taken from the seraph-Christ's wings; analysis found particles of pure ultramarine, the most expensive pigment at the time. The team identified red organic lake in the stigmata wounds, and vermilion and lead white on Francis's cheeks. Infrared reflectography found a base layer of paint overlaid with hatching and fine brush strokes on an additional layer. The greenery was painted with a copper resinate that over time has darkened to brown. The mountains and sky were painted with ultramarine and lead white. Compared to the Turin painting, the Philadelphia version shows little evidence of underdrawing.|$|E

5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> thinly applied. Rusty nail holes {{can be seen in the}} lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|The testing {{showed that}} the base layer onto which the codex was painted is {{composed}} of gypsum, a material used as a base layer for paintings since antiquity. The black <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> analysed with RBS and {{found to be a}} carbon-based pigment consistent with other pre-Columbian Mexican codices. The red colour used in the codex is red ochre, an iron-based pigment. There is very little blue colouration in the Grolier Codex and the presence of the distinctive Maya Blue pigment could not be confirmed. Analysis by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) revealed the blue pigment used on the codex does not contain cobalt and does contain clay. Its elemental composition matches that of palygorskite, the main inorganic component of Maya Blue. However, some other materials such as lapis lazuli could not be ruled out since PIXE only identifies elements, not compounds. The investigators concluded that the codex does contain some original pre-Columbian materials but could not confirm that the document is authentic.|$|E
5|$|With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead {{poisoning}} became {{common in the}} work setting. The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. An important step {{in the understanding of}} childhood {{lead poisoning}} occurred when toxicity in children from lead <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> recognized in Australia in 1897. France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.|$|E

50|$|The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{publicly}} {{sold for}} charity when Rockox died in 1640, {{but it is}} unknown who the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> sold to. In 1700, a panel named Samson and Delilah was bought by Prince Johann Adams Andreas I. This <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> likely Rubens' <b>painting.</b> However, when the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> part of the Liechtenstein Collection in Vienna, Austria in the eighteenth century, the painter was identified as Jan van den Hoecke, who was a principal assistant of Rubens in the 1630's. The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> then sold in 1880 in Paris, where it was later found by Ludwig Burchard in 1929.
