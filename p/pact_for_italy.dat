40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} possibility of social <b>pact</b> <b>for</b> HRD in Korea based on {{an analysis of the}} recent social dialogues and social <b>pacts</b> <b>for</b> HRD in advanced European countries and the survey analysis of the Korean labor and management. Through this research, the policy alternatives were presented to establish the systems of the social <b>pact</b> <b>for</b> HRD systematically linked to the lifelong learning - lifelong working - lifelong welfare on the various level. Particularly, this research is focusing on exploring the micro foundations of the possibility and the way of promoting the social <b>pact</b> <b>for</b> HRD in Korea. There are two reasons of emphasizing the social <b>pact</b> <b>for</b> HRD at this point. One is that the social <b>pact</b> <b>for</b> HRD is the most powerful alternative which can achieve the national competitiveness aiming at the economic effectiveness and the social balance simultaneously. The other reason is that the social <b>pact</b> <b>for</b> HRD is the most effective way that can change the paradigm minimizing the social conflict between labor and management. ...|$|R

5000|$|In January 1994 Giorgio La Malfa {{returned}} to {{the leadership of the}} Italian Republican Party (PRI), replacing Giorgio Bogi, and the party's national council decided to leave Democratic Alliance (AD) - of which the PRI had been a founding member - and to enter the <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy</b> coalition. Therefore Bogi, Giuseppe Ayala, Libero Gualtieri and others left the PRI and launched the [...] "Republican Left", which continued to be part of AD and joined the larger Alliance of Progressives.|$|E
50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1992 by Mario Segni as a split from Christian Democracy. The main goal of the party was electoral reform from {{proportional}} representation to a first-past-the-post system. In 1993 it merged with Democratic Alliance, which had identical goals, but, when that party decided to take part to the Alliance of Progressives with the ex-Communist Democratic Party of the Left, Segni set up an independent party again: the Segni Pact, which contested the 1994 general election in coalition with the Italian People's Party, named <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy.</b>|$|E

50|$|Rocco Buttiglione first {{attained}} {{attention on}} the Italian political stage when in 1994 he became secretary of the Italian People's Party, {{the largest of the}} parties that emerged from the collapse of Christian Democracy, formerly the largest party in Italy since the Second World War, after the Tangentopoli corruption scandals. The People's Party had presented itself along with Patto Segni in the centrist alliance <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy,</b> in which it came third after Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right Pole of Freedoms/Pole of Good Government and the centre-left Alliance of Progressives.|$|E
50|$|The CCD {{was founded}} in January 1994 by members of Christian Democracy (DC) who opposed the party's {{transformation}} into the Italian People's Party (PPI), and advocated an alliance with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI), which was launched on the same day, while the PPI advocated a centrist alliance with the Segni Pact called <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy.</b> Its leaders were Pier Ferdinando Casini and Clemente Mastella. The CCD represented the right-wing of the defunct DC, while the PPI was largely the heir of the party's left-wing, especially after the split of the United Christian Democrats (CDU) from the PPI in 1995.|$|E
50|$|The party {{emerged in}} January 1994 as the {{successor}} to the Christian Democracy (DC), Italy's dominant party since World War II, following the final national council of the DC and the split of a right-wing faction led by Pier Ferdinando Casini, which had formed the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD). The first secretary of the PPI was Mino Martinazzoli, which led the party to a big defeat (11.1% of the vote) in the 1994 general election, fought in coalition with the Segni Pact, under the <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy</b> banner. After the election, Martinazzoli was replaced as secretary by conservative philosopher Rocco Buttiglione.|$|E

5000|$|The party contested the 1994 general {{election}} within the <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy</b> coalition, {{along with the}} Italian People's Party (PPI), and the PS leader Mario Segni was [...] "candidate for Prime Minister". The PS included in its lists Republicans (Giorgio La Malfa, Alberto Zorzoli, Vittorio Dotti, Danilo Poggiolini and Carla Mazzuca Poggiolini), Liberals (Valerio Zanone, Pietro Milio and Luigi Compagna), Socialists (Giuliano Amato, Giulio Tremonti and Claudio Nicolini), Democratic Socialists (Enrico Ferri and Gian Franco Schietroma), and several former Christian Democrats (Mario Segni himself, Diego Masi, Gianni Rivera, Alberto Michelini, Enrico Indelli, Elisabetta Gardini, Michele Cossa, Livio Filippi, Vincenzo Viola, etc.).|$|E
50|$|The early-1990s Tangentopoli scandals {{destroyed}} the party which fell under 1% of the vote, making it dependent on alliances with other parties to survive {{under the new}} electoral system based on plurality. In 1992-1994 the PRI lost most of its voters and members. The party was divided in three groups: one led by Giorgio La Malfa joined the <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy</b> (Patto), a second one led by Luciana Sbarbati joined Democratic Alliance (AD) and a third group left the party and formed Republican Left (SR). At the 1994 general election some PRI members, including Sbarbati, were elected to the Italian Parliament {{from the list of}} AD, while others, including Carla Mazzuca, were elected with Patto Segni. At that time the party seemed quite finished.|$|E
50|$|During the {{transformation}} of the Christian Democrats into the Italian Popular Party, he invites the party, at the Constituent Assembly in Rome in 1993, to choose, with determination, {{as a result of the}} new electoral system, an alliance between the center and the left. He does not accept the decision of the party to stand independently - as a coalition of center - in the general election of 1994, in the <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy.</b> Therefore, decides to join the movement of the Social Christians, founding the movement in Ferrara and becoming National Director. In 1994 he creates in Ferrara one of the first juntas of the center-left in Italy, becoming Head of Culture and Tourism. In 1995, he is a candidate for Mayor of Ferrara (supported by the Greens, Labour and Social Christians) winning about 20% of the votes.|$|E

50|$|In the new {{majoritarian}} system, Martinazzoli's party placed {{itself in}} the center, between the left (which included the heirs of the Italian Communist Party) and the new Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, which had allied with the northern regionalist party, Lega Nord, and the post-fascist Alleanza Nazionale. His will not to ally {{with any of them}} caused numerous politicians (such as Pierferdinando Casini and Clemente Mastella) to leave PPI and form the Centro Cristiano Democratico, which supported Berlusconi. At the 1994 elections, Martinazzoli formed a center alliance known as <b>Pact</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy,</b> including PPI and other democratic centre forces. However, the result of the election was disappointing, with PPI obtaining 11%, some one third of DC's consensus before its dissolution. In the same year, he accepted to run as mayor of Brescia for the new centre-left formation L'Ulivo, winning the final ballot and acting as mayor until 1998. In 2000 he lost the competition with Roberto Formigoni for the presidency of Lombardy.|$|E
