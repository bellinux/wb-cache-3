40|$|Effective gas {{management}} {{is vital to}} the success of the longwall mining in the Bulli seam, in the Southern Coalfield, Sydney Basin, NSW, Australia. The evolution of gas drainage methods and practices are discussed with respect to gas type, gas drainage lead time and prevailing geological conditions. Both underground to inseam drilling and surface to inseam drilling techniques are described at both pre and post-drainage conditions. Post-drainage of gas from longwall is discussed for its effectiveness, practicability and efficiency. The long term benefit of the method selected is examined with respect to gas capture efficiency. An alternative method of surface based goaf drainage, using medium radius drilling technology to drill horizontal boreholes above and/or below the <b>production</b> <b>seam</b> into the partial caving zone prior to longwall goaf formation is proposed...|$|E

40|$|Laser brazing is a joining {{technology}} which is typically employed {{in areas with}} particularly high quality requirements, e. g. to create zero gap roof joints in automotive <b>production.</b> These <b>seams</b> have to be leak proof and are situated {{in an area of}} the car body which is in direct view of the customer. Hence, seam defects and imperfections are inacceptable and require extensive rework whenever they occur. Resulting high rework costs can be avoided by investigating the causes of these imperfections in order to prevent their formation. One type of imperfection which may occur during the laser brazing of galvanised steel are dark deposits on the seam surface. This paper examines the mechanisms leading to the formation of this type of imperfection. Results on the properties of surface deposits are presented along with conclusions regarding the systematic reasons behind their formation.

40|$|Predictive {{deconvolution}} {{is widely}} {{treated as a}} universally applicable tool for multiple removal and wavelet compression. The fundamental assumption of random reflectivity is seriously compromised in geological situations where the reflection sequence comprises {{a small number of}} dominant horizons. This situation is not uncommon in coal environments. Where the primary seismic objective is high quality imaging of particular target horizons, an improved result can be achieved if the deconvolution is designed according to assumptions more relevant to the geological situation. We outline a simple example of this approach, aimed at imaging a <b>production</b> coal <b>seam,</b> of thickness 5 - 10 m, at a mine in the Bowen Basin, Australia. Using horizon time picks from a preliminary volume, the full reflection package associated with the seam is extracted and deterministically filtered to obtain an estimate of the intrinsic wavelet. A Wiener spiking filter, designed on the extracted wavelet, is then used to deconvolve the seam package. In comparison to the predictive deconvolution approach, this model-based procedure provides improved resolution of the top and base coal interfaces. In addition, derived amplitude and frequency attributes are more robust in terms of known geology. Variants of this simple model-based procedure should have relevance in a range of dominant-horizon situations where predictive deconvolution is invalid...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFluid {{transport}} through microporous carbon-based {{materials is}} inherent in numerous applications, ranging from gas separation by carbon molecular sieves to natural gas <b>production</b> from coal <b>seams</b> and gas shales. The present study investigates the steady-state permeation of supercritical methane {{in response to a}} constant cross-membrane pressure drop. We performed dual control volume grand canonical molecular dynamics (DCV-GCMD) simulations to mimic the conditions of actual permeation experiments. To overcome arbitrary assumptions regarding the investigated porous structures, the membranes were modeled after the CS 1000 a and CS 1000 molecular models, which are representative of real microporous carbon materials. When adsorption-induced molecular trapping (AIMT) mechanisms are negligible, we show that the permeability of the microporous material, although not significantly sensitive to the pressure gradient, monotonically decreases with temperature and reservoir pressures, consistent with diffusion theory. However, when AIMT occurs, the permeability increases with temperature in agreement with experimental data found in the literature...|$|R

Environmental impacts may occur if mining operations are not adequately managed. Effects data for tropical ecosystems {{are required to}} assess risks of contaminant exposure and to derive water quality guidelines (WQG) to manage these risks. Currently, risk assessment tools and WQGs for the tropics are limited due to the sparse research on how contaminants impact tropical biota. As {{part of a larger}} project to develop appropriate risk assessment tools to ensure sustainable nickel <b>production</b> in <b>SEAM,</b> nickel effects data were required. The aim of this review was to compile data on the effects of nickel on tropical marine, estuarine, pelagic and benthic species, with a particular focus on SEAM. There were limited high quality chronic nickel toxicity data for tropical marine species, and even fewer for those relevant to SEAM. Of the data available, the most sensitive SEAM species to nickel were a sea urchin, copepod and anemone. There is a significant lack of high quality chronic data for several ecologically important taxonomic groups including cnidarians, molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, macroalgae and fish. No high quality chronic nickel toxicity data were available for estuarine waters or marine and estuarine sediments. The very sparse toxicity data for tropical species limits our ability to conduct robust ecological risk assessment and may require additional data generation or read-across from similar species in other databases (e. g. temperate) to fill data gaps. Recommendations on testing priorities to fill these data gaps are presented...|$|R
40|$|Through my postgraduate, fashion practice-based {{research}} project, The Living Wardrobe, I {{have become}} increasingly interested in garment design that specifically facilitates future alteration and modification. There is potential for such a simple design approach to encourage habits of reduced consumption when garments are kept in use by adapting to wearers&# 039; changing needs. Once a common provision in garments, the capacity for alteration is largely missing from contemporary women&# 039;s wear. The economies of mass <b>production</b> reduce <b>seam</b> allowances to the minimum required for assembly, while complex industrial construction methods deter intervention. At the same time, the practical skills of repair and alteration are rarely learnt anymore. So passive has fashion consumption become and so disposable are the products that a dropped hem, ripped seam or missing button usually consigns a garment to the (charity) bin and justifies another trip to the boutiques. In an attempt to disrupt this cycle, my research looks at design strategies {{with the potential to}} re-engage the wearer in habits of wear, repair and remake. Designing garments with the adaptability required for prolonged, active use enables garments to better keep up with the times, changing style (not merely fit) over time. This approach to product longevity considers the use of the garment across multiple lifetimes, acknowledging that a garment may have several sequential owners. Through a discussion of recently developed garment prototypes, this paper will outline the challenges I have encountered in designing garments to actively engage consumers in this cycle of wear, repair and remake...|$|R
40|$|Gas <b>production</b> {{from coal}} <b>seams</b> has {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention around the world and in particular in Australia with its rich resources of coal. In general the coal bed methane (CBM) resources are located at lower depths (i. e. less than 1000 m) compared to conventional gas reservoirs. This increases the chance of a horizontal fracture to be developed if hydraulic fracturing is used to enhance gas production from a coal seam by connecting the cleates more effectively to each other and to the wellbore. During gas production, due to changes in stress fields, fractures, from the very small scale of coal cleates to those extending a few meters and large scale fault planes may get highly stressed and slide to some extent and experience changes in their apertures. The potential for this depends on the magnitude of in-situ stresses and also the geometry of the fracture plane with respect to the direction of principal stresses. This is a dynamic process which results in continuous changes in productivity of a CBM reservoir. This paper aims at studying the potential for fracture reactivation during the production life of a CBM reservoir and how this may result in changing the permeability of the coalbed by communicating small fracture planes to each other. The Mohr-Coloumb criteria was used to investigate the sliding potential. Also, to demonstrate the significance of stress changes due to gas <b>production</b> from coal <b>seams</b> on changing the sliding status of small fracture planes (here the coal cleats) a number of fracture planes were generated randomly and the sliding potential was assessed for these planes with respect to depletion rate. It is seen that increased production will change the results to a large extent: this shows how the secondary porosity and permeability may change significantly as a result of communication of cleates on a random basis during the production life of the coal seam. Changing the stress regime in the field, e. g. from normal to strike-slip, also changes the results significantly. The results are presented in this paper and conclusions will be made...|$|R
40|$|The {{current trends}} towards {{increased}} coal <b>production</b> from <b>seams</b> at greater depth {{has led to}} increased demands being placed on the methane drainage and mine ventilation systems. This study has been directed towards the development of computer models to simulate and analyse the gas flows in methane drainage ranges and the airflow and pressure distribution in mine ventilation networks. The {{first part of this}} thesis describes the conventional techniques of methane drainage currently employed and the mathematical approach used to model gas flow in the methane drainage range. It also discusses how, when combined with measured underground data, predicted results can be used to assess the performance of the range. Subsequent analysis techniques will suggest measures that can be undertaken to optimise this performance and assess the effect of selective network reconfiguration. The second part of the thesis includes a discussion of the increasing application of booster fans in U. K. underground coal mines and a critical analysis of the mathematical methods used to model airflow and pressure distribution in mine ventilation networks. One particular method was adopted in a simulation model used to analyse networks with booster fans and specified face airflows. Both simulation models developed have been used to analyse representative underground methane drainage ranges and mine ventilation networks. The thesis concludes that the accuracy of the methane drainage models can only be guaranteed when developed in conjunction with suitable measured data. The mine ventilation model requires user guidance through the solution and analysis procedure. Results are presented in a simple graphical manner and this approach, rather than the 'black box' non interactive approach, is to be favoured in the analysis of mine ventilation networks...|$|R
40|$|Fugitive {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from unconventional gas extraction processes (e. g. shale gas, tight gas and coal bed methane/coal seam gas) are poorly understood {{due in part to}} the extensive area over which these emissions may occur. We apply a rapid qualitative approach for source assessment at the scale of a large gas field. A mobile cavity ring down spectrometer (Picarro G 2201 -i) was used to provide real-time, high-precision methane and carbon dioxide concentration and carbon isotope ratios (Œ¥ 13 C), allowing for ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù decision making and therefore an efficient and dynamic surveying approach. The system was used to map the atmosphere of a <b>production</b> coal <b>seam</b> gas (CSG) field (Tara region, Australia), an area containing pre-production ‚Äúexploration‚Äù CSG wells (Casino, Australia), and various other potential CO 2 and CH 4 sources (i. e. wetlands, sewage treatment plants, landfills, urban areas and bushfires). Results showed a widespread enrichment of both CH 4 (up to 6. 89 ppm) and CO 2 (up to 541 ppm) within the production gas field, compared to outside. The CH 4 and CO 2 Œ¥ 13 C source values showed distinct differences within and outside the production field, indicating a CH 4 source within the production field that has a Œ¥ 13 C signature comparable to the regional CSG. While this study demonstrates how the method can be used to qualitatively assess the location and source of emissions, integration with atmospheric models may allow for quantitative assessment of emissions. The distinct patterns observed within the CSG field demonstrates the need to fully quantify the atmospheric flux of natural and anthropogenic, point and diffuse sources of {{greenhouse gas}}es from individual Australian gas fields before and after production commences...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation Abstract Water {{transport}} in eukaryotic {{cells is}} a highly regulated and fine-tuned process. Water channel protein known as aquaporins (AQPs), constitute the main cellular water transport system, preserving water homeostasis by maintaining specific selectivity-mechanisms. Dysfunctional AQPs induce {{a wide variety of}} diseases in humans thereby enhancing the clinical significance of structural and functional knowledge. Macromolecular structural research requires large amounts of pure, stable protein to initiate crystallization trials. To achieve this, genetic engineering and overproduction systems such as the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) are employed. The next step, crystallization, involves arrangement of the macromolecule in a repetitive fashion. Once crystals have been obtained, these are exposed by synchrotron radiation (X-rays), producing a diffraction pattern. This reciprocal representation of the arrangement of atoms in the unit cell is converted back to real space by a Fourier transform, which generates a atomic model of the protein. This thesis is based on a comparative study of the production levels of all human AQPs, an production and purification analysis of eukaryotic transhydrogenases, and a structural and functional investigation of the spinach AQP SoPIP 2; 1 with associated mutants. The human AQPs produced in the study displayed a considerable variety in production yield. Although the <b>production</b> yield <b>seamed</b> to depend on multiple factors, a correlation could be drawn between the extent of protein inserted into the membrane and phylogenetic relationship, providing further insight into eukaryotic membrane protein production. Furthermore, zebrafish transhydrogenase was successfully produced in P. pastoris, but although the production yield was sufficient, further optimisation of purification conditions is required in order to obtain sample suitable for crystallization. Finally, crystal structures and water transport assays of SoPIP 2; 1 phosphomimicking mutants as well as of SoPIP 2; 1 in complex with mercury have given novel insights into the mechanism of plant AQP gating...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of subsurface hydrostatic pressure to allow natural gas desorption {{is an integral}} step in the <b>production</b> of coal <b>seam</b> gas (CSG). During this dewatering stage, viscous stresses can cause the liberation and transport of fines, which are predominantly comprised of inorganic clay groups such as smectite, illite and kaolin, from within the coal matrix. Dislodged particles migrate in production fluid through fractures towards the wellbore where capture and deposition can deteriorate the reservoir 2 ÃÜ 7 s permeability. Once in the wellbore, these particles can adversely affect the performance of mechanical equipment such as pumps. This study uses direct numerical simulation of a synthetic coal fracture to help elucidate the particle detachment process. This is approached using a coupled lattice Boltzmann-discrete element method to capture both physical and physicochemical interactions based on Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Preliminary testing with the developed model suggests that particles move almost freely along the bounding surface regardless of electrostatic interactions, and that Hele-Shaw predictions of particle lift in particular can be inadequate. Further, larger-scale simulations indicated that the DLVO parameters can significantly impact the vertical position of propagating fines with variations in eroded mass of over 100...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} coal seam gas {{drainage}} {{rely on the}} use of reservoir pressure reduction to promote gas desorption from the coal matrix. Studies in coal mining gas drainage operations, particularly in coal seams that are deeply undersaturated and have low permeability, found the rate of reservoir pressure reduction was prohibitively slow. In such conditions, lengthy production delays have been experienced while additional gas drainage drilling is undertaken in an attempt to reduce seam gas content below specified threshold limits. Such drilling represents a high additional operating cost and yields low total gas production whilst adversely impacting the mine 2 ÃÜ 7 s gas drainage drilling schedule. In extreme cases known zones of difficult to drain coal are avoided resulting in a loss of potentially recoverable coal and gas reserves. An alternative method for enhancing coal <b>seam</b> <b>production</b> which does not rely on reservoir pressure reduction has been identified. This method, known as the cyclic inert gas injection method, involving the injection of nitrogen, has potential application in deeply undersaturated and low permeability coal seams enabling seam gas to be removed and permeability increased without the need to reduce reservoir pressure to the critical desorption point. The cyclic inert gas injection method is presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Australia is mining {{at greater}} seam {{thicknesses}} than most similar western countries {{and particularly the}} US. The approaches developed by other countries and previous research and innovation are not necessarily directly transferable. Furthermore, the increasing scale of <b>production</b> in thick <b>seam</b> longwalls challenges the maintenance of safe and healthy face environments in Australian collieries. High production rates, longer faces and higher ventilation quantities and velocities further exacerbate dustiness. An ACARP funded scoping study has been undertaken to examine dust problems that are being faced by Australian thick seam longwall mine operators, evaluate options and recommend priorities for improvement. The study involved a number of stages. A detailed survey of six Australian thick seam mine operators to identify individual mine issues was undertaken. A comprehensive literature review, with emphasis on publications from {{the last ten years}} was undertaken on Australian and foreign developments. Views and advice from recognised dust experts both within Australia and overseas were sought. Some approaches to assessment of dust compliance and analysis of trends exhibited were undertaken.

40|$|Alkanes {{comprise}} a substantial fraction {{of crude oil}} and refined fuels. As such, they are prevalent within deep subsurface fossil fuel deposits and in shallow subsurface environments such as aquifers that are contaminated with hydrocarbons. These environments are typically anaerobic, and host diverse microbial communities that can potentially use alkanes as substrates. Anaerobic alkane biodegradation {{has been reported to}} occur under nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic conditions. Elucidating the pathways of anaerobic alkane metabolism has been of interest in order to understand how microbes can be used to remediate contaminated sites. Alkane activation primarily occurs by addition to fumarate, yielding alkylsuccinates, unique anaerobic metabolites {{that can be used to}} indicate in situ anaerobic alkane metabolism. These metabolites have been detected in hydrocarbon-contaminated shallow aquifers, offering strong evidence for intrinsic anaerobic bioremediation. Recently, studies have also revealed that alkylsuccinates are present in oil and coal <b>seam</b> <b>production</b> waters, indicating that anaerobic microbial communities can utilize alkanes in these deeper subsurface environments. In many crude oil reservoirs, the in situ anaerobic metabolism of hydrocarbons such as alkanes may be contibuting to modern-day detrimental effects such as oilfield souring, or may lead to more benefical technologies such as enhanced energy recovery from mature oilfields. In this review, we briefly describe the key metabolic pathways for anaerobic alkane (including n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and cyclic alkanes) metabolism and highlight several field reports wherein alkylsuccinates have provided evidence for anaerobic in situ alkane metabolism in shallow and deep subsurface environments...|$|R

40|$|Permeability {{is a key}} {{parameter}} in the <b>production</b> of coal <b>seam</b> gas (CSG). Laboratory {{experiments have}} been carried out extensively to study the coal permeability. Typical approach includes injection of fluids (e. g. water and gas) through coal samples and permeability can be determined from measured pressure drop across the sample and flow rate. Some of these studies have demonstrated coal permeability variation during water/gas flow. These permeability variations have been attributed to physical blockage of flow paths by fines migration and/or coal creep. Investigation of these studies has indicated some limitations: (i) 	Effluent water was not characterized which could include characterization of produced fines, dissolved elements in the effluent water. (ii) 	Coal characterization (coal rank and mineralogy etc.) was not conducted so that a correlation between the permeability variation and coal and fines characteristics could not be investigated. This is an important missing information which can help understand the root causes for the permeability variation. (iii) 	The effect of coal creep was not separated from that of fines migration on the permeability variation. So, it was difficult to analyze and conclusively demonstrate the impact on coal permeability of each mechanism. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate to what degree fines migration is responsible for coal permeability variation during water flow. A systematic physical and analytical modeling approach is proposed for this purpose. The approach includes designed water flow tests, characterization of coal samples, analysis of effluent water and analytical modeling of permeability damage. The results demonstrate that permeability is affected by fines migration during water flow in coal. A good correlation between the permeability variation and fines production is observed. The fines produced from coal are found to be mainly coal and clay. Analytical calculations of the interaction energy between the observed fines and coal surface suggest that clay fines are easier to be mobilized than coal fines. Bituminous coal fines appear to mobilize more easily than anthracite coal fines. The analytical tool predicts reasonably the observed permeability variation...|$|R
40|$|Sulfur Extended Asphalt Modifier (SEAM) {{in solid}} pellet form is {{currently}} being marketed as an additive for hot asphalt mixtures. Typically 40 % of the bitumen phase in the asphalt mix can be replaced by SEAM using conventional mix design and production techniques. A number of full scale trials using SEAM {{have been reported in}} the literature, and except for some concerns regarding rutting and moisture resistance, it appears that overall the SEAM modified mixes have the potential for improved mechanical performance compared to conventional asphalt. The objective of this paper is to examine issues that surpass pure analysis of mechanical characterisation of asphalt mixes incorporating SEAM. The paper contains a brief overview of sulfur production, recovery processes and the global sulfur supply. It also highlights the fact that the sulfur industry is different from many other important modern mineral industries in that the disposal of surplus production of sulfur is becoming a more important issue than that of how to maintain sustainable production. To enable the reader to appreciate why in a SEAM modified asphalt excess sulfur crystallize out of the bitumen phase into the voids system, a cursory introduction to elemental sulfur allotropes and their thermodynamic stabilities in the solid and liquid states is also included. As SEAM technology is aimed at encapsulating large amounts of sulfur in asphalt mixes, a section is dedicated to examining the microbial oxidation of inorganic sulfur, its potential effects on bioleaching of polluted sediments and the relation between oxidised sulfur and the toxicity of mercury in aquatic systems. During the <b>production</b> stages of <b>SEAM</b> asphalt mixes, the sulfur component will convert from the solid into the liquid phase which requires careful thermal management to control gaseous emissions. As a consequence, this paper includes a general review of exposure limits for sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide emissions and their short and long term health effects on healthy and asthmatic individuals. Finally, the potential for metal corrosion in the presence of elemental sulfur is investigated...|$|R

New South Wales (NSW), Australia, contains large coal seam gas reserves in different sedimentary basins. In addition, southeast of NSW, along with Victoria, is one {{the most active}} seismic regions of Australia (i. e. South-East seismic zone). Despite the numerous potential sources of stress data, only 95 maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) orientation measurements for NSW were available in the World Stress Map database prior to this study, mostly from shallow engineering measurements. Coal seam gas exploration in several basins of NSW, including the Gunnedah, Clarence-Moreton, Sydney, Gloucester and Bowen-Surat basins, provide the opportunity to investigate the SHmax pattern in this poorly resolved part of the continent. We compiled 236 (A-E quality) horizontal stress orientations from different part of NSW and present the first detailed stress map of NSW within six stress provinces. The database contains 331 (including 318 A-D and 13 E quality) SHmax orientations consisting of 186 stress indicators from borehole breakouts, 69 stress measurements from shallow engineering methods, 46 stress indicator from drilling induced fractures and 30 stress indicators from earthquakes. SHmax in the Clarence Moreton Basin is approximately E-W; in the Gunnedah, Bowen and Surat is NE-SW; is generally ENE-WSW in the Sydney Basin; and has a variable pattern in the Gloucester Basin. Herein, we compare the observed stress pattern with the previous plate scale models and show none of the models could predict the stress pattern. We also show several examples of stress rotation (spatially and in a single well) due to different geological parameters particularly faults, fractures and intrusion of volcanics into sediments, which particularly is important for exploration and <b>production</b> of coal <b>seam</b> gas & shale gas reservoirs and can significantly affect stimulations. Hence, {{it may not be}} appropriate to base fracture design on the SHmax orientation observed from just a few wells in a basin or field.

The fellowship explores the practical, technical, theoretical and aesthetic considerations pertinent to the application of vitreous enamel to jewellery. By demonstrating the great potential of enamel as an exciting and innovative material the research aims to overcome negative preconceptions about enamel common within the contemporary jewellery community. Over the duration of the project a range of techniques and processes have been developed with the aim of informing and extend creative practice in enamel and introducing experimental enamel techniques to the wider contemporary jewellery community, providing greater scope for experimentation and the development of individual technical explorations. The practical aspects of the project have been focused on the production of jewellery forms using electroforming techniques in combination with rapid-prototyping and 3 D printing techniques. In contrast to the technologically advanced processes used to make the underlying form simple rubber stamp printing techniques have been explored for the application of surface mark, pattern and text. The electroforming technique uses the electrodeposition of metal on an expendable base mandrel to form a self-supporting layer. This allows for the <b>production</b> of <b>seam</b> free three-dimensional forms that can be enamelled in the round without the problems associated with enamelled over traditional soldered constructions. A range of materials can be used to create the mandrel forms, including wax, rubber or plastic. In this case 3 D printing techniques using the Z-Corp machine have been utilized to create a simple test forms. The following describes the production of the illustrated indicative test samples: ‚Ä¢ A simple form is printed in plaster using the Z-Corp 3 -D printing equipment, the resultant form is then infiltrated with Z-Bond Cyanoacrylate to allow it to withstand an extended period of immersion in the copper acid solution used in the electrodeposition process. ‚Ä¢ Several thin layers of metallic paint are applied {{to the surface of the}} printed 3 -D model to render it electro-conductive. ‚Ä¢ A layer of copper approximately 1 mm thick is subsequently built up on the surface of the form over several days through electro-deposition. ‚Ä¢ When the required thickness has been achieved the object is removed from the tank and the Z-Corp material core is steamed out of the object. ‚Ä¢ The hollow object is then coated with enamel using a variety of industrial and jewellery enamels, application and firing techniques. ‚Ä¢ A simple rubber stamp produced using a rubber eraser, scalpel and lino-cutting tools is used to print the surface of the enamelled object with a variety of mark, text and pattern. ‚Ä¢ The printing medium for this stamp printing is either an onglaze that is fired directly onto the underlying enamel or a sticky medium such as ink onto which powdered enamel can be dry sifted. The enamel adheres to the printed medium and excess enamel can be removed leaving enamel only in the printed areas. Subsequent firing will burn away the sticky binder leaving only the enamel to create mark and pattern on the surface of the piece. Conclusion This poster describes only one of many techniques explored during the period of the fellowship but it serves to illustrate the wide potential of enamel especially when approached with an open mind and an eye for innovation. Enamel for jewellery needs not always concern itself with tradition but can borrow from a wide range of art and design practice, as in this case printmaking, to produce exciting and innovative pieces. ...|$|R
