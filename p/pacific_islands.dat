40|$|The {{present study}} explores the health issues {{surrounding}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> youth health development. The present study conducted a literature review on youth health issues in New Zealand {{and found that}} most are cultural and social related. A second literature review of theoretical dispositions {{to account for the}} emergence of youth heath issues found that <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> concepts, medical sociology theory and youth health theory were relevant explanations for the emergence of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> youth health issues. The present study conducted focus groups with <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> young people about youth health issues to see if the information from the literature review corresponded with the participants’ responses and whether the theoretical explanations were consistent with the participants’ responses. The present study found that a correlation exists between the literature review and the participants’ responses. The present study maintains through the participants’ responses that the key to addressing <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> young people health issues is to involve their families throughout the process of assessment and in the development of response plans. This means the perspectives of those in youth health policy arenas, the perspective of service managers and the perspective of professionals are required to recognise that the perspective of the young person is an essential domain for understanding the cause of and for resolving <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> youth health issues. ‘Talanoa ile I’a’ is the story of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> young people living in West Auckland. It is based on responses to questions posed to participants of the study in relation to <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> youth health development issues. The present study contends that in order to understand, identify and resolve <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> youth health issues it is important to talk to <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> young people themselves. The present study did not conduct any research with youth policymakers, youth health services or health professionals but preferred to explore youth health with <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> young people themselves. The present study is built on the participants’ responses and provides both warning signs and building blocks for youth health policy, youth healthcare services and youth health professionals. The present study is a <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> approach to <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> youth health issues; it is ‘by Pacific for Pacific’...|$|R
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{colonisation}} of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>islands</b> and eventually Australia by the Acrocephalus warblers from Asia was complex, with multiple colonisations of even remote archipelagos. Although the Hawaiian islands were colonised about 2.3million years ago, the other islands were reached much more recently, in the mid-Pleistocene (between 0.21.4million years ago) or even later. The nearest other warblers geographically to Nauru are the Carolinian reed warbler and the nightingale reed warbler.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> economies {{have found}} it {{difficult}} to achieve sustained economic growth and hence sustained improvements in living standards. But what is required to establish whether the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> economies are growth failures is a valid counterfactual. In this paper, matching methods based on the propensity score are used to find the most appropriate set of comparator countries for the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> economies. The paper also pays close attention to geography as a fundamental growth constraint facing <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> countries since they {{are some of the most}} remote in the world. The results show that ignoring spatial autocorrelation, whereby economic growth rates depend on the growth rates of neighbouring countries, biases estimates of how slowly the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> economies have grown conditional on other growth determinants.

40|$|New Zealand Rugby (NZR) {{recognise}} {{there is}} {{a significant difference between the}} number of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> rugby players, and the number of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> people participating in non-playing rugby in Auckland. Through exploring the perspectives of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> rugby community members, this project aims to help NZR develop a better understanding of this ‘issue’. Key recommendations are proposed for moving forward towards greater awareness and appreciation of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> culture. Eight <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> rugby community members were selected based on their experience, insight and ability to share their perspective and that of their wider community. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted and a breadth of rich, insightful data were collected, allowing for key themes to develop. We learnt that to the Pacific people, this ‘lack’ of participation in non-playing rugby is not necessarily an ‘issue’ and that instead a better understanding of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> way is needed. We adopted two lenses that represent the stories and key messages of the interviewees. Firstly, ‘Appreciating <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> Cultural Values’, which encompasses the importance of family, the significance of church and church commitments, and the strong service orientation of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> people. The second lens, ‘Perspectives on Leadership’, is strongly underpinned by the Samoan proverb “The pathway to leadership is through service”. We heard that <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> philosophies on leadership encompasses informal, collectivist approaches, focusing on people and relationships which augments titles and roles. It was revealed that Europeans are usually viewed as the authority figures and the systems are often aligned with a more European approach. An overall theme that developed was the idea of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> people ‘navigating two worlds’ as they live as a <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> New Zealander. Our recommendations are based around NZR enabling the Pacific people to continue to journey through these two worlds within the rugby community through focusing on two key areas; a) enhancing the understanding of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> culture within the New Zealand Rugby community and b) creating a shared understanding of leadership between Pakeha and <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> members of the NZR community. These are linked to four recommendations; 1) development of a <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> advisory group, 2) implementation of cultural awareness workshops for decision makers, 3) insights driven implementation and communication, and 4) a targeted leadership initiative for 20 - 25 <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> rugby community members. In summary, we acknowledge that this is not a process of fixing an issue but instead an opportunity to engage with and better understand the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Island</b> community within rugby. We believe in turn this will lead to more involvement of Pasifika people in non-playing rugby activities, enhanced playing experiences, and a strengthened New Zealand Rugby communit...|$|R
