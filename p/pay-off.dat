5|$|The crisis {{point for}} the UERL was the need to redeem the five-year {{profit-sharing}} secured notes on 30 June 1908. The UERL {{did not have the}} money. Speyer unsuccessfully tried to persuade the London County Council (LCC) to inject £5million into the UERL and used some of his own bank's money to <b>pay-off</b> disgruntled shareholders threatening bankruptcy proceedings. Eventually, Speyer and Gibb managed to obtain agreement from the shareholders to convert the notes into long-term debt to be repaid in 1933 and 1948.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform and {{experimentation}} {{and for the first}} time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other consumer goods. The authorities made sure that the workers received proper wages. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to <b>pay-off</b> the debts.|$|E

We provide examples that allow explicit verification of our theoretical findings and also show that the inefficiency cost of path-dependent <b>pay-offs</b> can be significant.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{theory of}} coalitional games with transferable utility {{is based on}} the assumption that all parameters of such games, including the expected <b>pay-offs</b> of coalitions, are exactly determined. In real cooperative situations, this assumption appears rather umealistic. Then the coalitional <b>pay-offs,</b> formally represented by the values of characteristic function of the game, cannot be represented by crisp real numbers. The fuzzy set and fuzzy quantity theory offers adequate tools for the modelling of vagueness connected with expected <b>pay-offs.</b> The model of TU coalitional game was investigated in numerous papers and summarized in [5 J. In this paper we focuse our attention to the fact that fuzzy expected <b>pay-offs</b> of coalitions can be easily transformed into fuzziness connected with classes of the complete games. This transformation can be well defined and under simple assumptions also unique. This uniqueness of the relation between fuzzy <b>pay-offs</b> in TU games and fuzzy class of deterministic TU games generated by them is analyzed in the submitted paper. game, coalitional game, coalition, fuzzy <b>pay-offs,</b> fuzzy class of games...|$|R

25|$|Counter punchers usually {{wear their}} {{opponent}}s down by {{causing them to}} miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the <b>pay-off.</b> They usually try {{to stay away from}} the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.|$|E

Again he ran on a campaign to rid the city of vice and police corruption. Ill-health made him less exuberant than his earlier mayoral term, but he nonetheless persisted with his reforms. Twenty-six men on the police force were demoted or dismissed and the chief constable was replaced by Walter Mulligan, who was the youngest chief in Vancouver to date.
