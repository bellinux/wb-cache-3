The asbestos, of chrysotile variety, was coated by impregnation in <b>poly(hexamethylene</b> <b>adipamide)</b> solution {{and the results}} of testing the tensile properties of the asbestos/polyamide/epoxy composite system are presented. The interest was focused on the influence of the asbestos content in the composite together with that of the polaymide content deposited on asbestos. No satisfactory reinforcing effect was found, especially when comparing with previous studies on coating the chrysotile by in situ interfacial polymerization. Nevertheless, a qualitative model was proposed to correlate the effect of the different phases contained in the composite with the experimental behavior encountered...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this study has been the enhancement of understanding the role of fibre pre-treatment in determining the thermal expansion behaviour and glass transition temperature of fibre-reinforced thermosetting polymers. Asbestos fibres were pre-treated with <b>poly(hexamethylene</b> <b>adipamide)</b> and used afterwards as filler reinforcement in a bisphenol-A-based epoxy matrix. Two alternative processes of fibre pre-treatment were used. Thermal expansion coefficients and glass transition temperatures for the asbestos-nylon-epoxy composites were experimentally determined. Results are qualitatively explained by theoretical models in which {{the concept of the}} boundary interphase is considered. The effects of asbestos and nylon content as well as of type of pre-treatment and adhesion between the phases are investigated. © 1988...|$|E
40|$|In situ intercalative {{polycondensation}} {{is applied}} for the preparation of polyamide (PA) n, 6 -clay nanocomposites, namely poly(ethylene adipamide) (PA 2, 6), <b>poly(hexamethylene</b> <b>adipamide)</b> (PA 6, 6), and poly (dodecamethylene adipamide) (PA 12, 6). For this purpose, two different polymerization routes are considered; a low-temperature melt polymerization technique and the conventional solution-melt one. Under the specific experimental conditions, lack of clay exfoliation is detected through XRD measurements, which is proved irreversible even when twin-screw extrusion is attempted as an additional step. The resulting PA n, 6 -clay structures are found dependent on the diamine moiety length; more specifically, an intrinsic interaction between the polyamide monomer and the organoclay surfactant is indicated. An ion exchange occurs between the two competitive species, that is, diamine and surfactant cations, leading to flocculated clay structures. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Carbon fibers were {{coated in}} situ {{with a thin}} film of <b>polyhexamethylene</b> <b>adipamide</b> by an {{interfacial}} polycondensation technique. The modified fibers {{were used for the}} preparation of epoxy-based unidirectional composites. Specimens of these materials were immersed in water until equilibrium conditions were attained. The weight gain at equilibrium was determined {{as a function of the}} immersion temperature, the fiber volume fraction and the polyamide content deposited on the fibers. Water penetration in specimens made with uncoated carbon fibers increases when the volume fraction decreases. Introduction of the polyamide interlayer initially increases the water absorption, but reduces it at higher immersion temperatures and/or higher polyamide contents. The treated specimens were subjected to the short beam test to determine the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS). The data show that the ILSS decreases with water penetration but increases when the immersion temperature increases from 40 to 70 °C. The overall performance encountered is discussed in terms of the possible roles of the polyamide interphase while taking into account mechanisms concerned with matrix plasticization interphase degradation and residual stress relaxation...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} and tribological properties of electrospun fiber mats are {{of paramount importance}} to their utility in {{a large number of}} applications. In this work, mats of electrospun fibers of <b>poly(hexamethylene</b> <b>adipamide)</b> (PA 6, 6) with average fiber diameter of 238 ± 22 nm are characterized for their crystal structure as well as their {{mechanical and}} tribological properties. Post-spin thermal annealing was used to modify the fiber morphology and crystallinity within the fibers. Morphological changes, in-plane tensile response, friction coefficient and wear rate were characterized as functions of the annealing temperature. The mechanical and tribological properties of the thermally annealed PA 6, 6 fiber mats exhibited significant improvements through the Brill transition temperature, comparable to the improvements observed for amorphous polyamide electrospun mats annealed near the glass transition temperature. The effective wear rate of the electrospun fiber mats is well-described by a previously proposed modification of the Ratner-Lancaster relationship that relates wear to the yield behavior of these nonwoven mats.

30|$|Waltz et al. {{used the}} conductometric {{titration}} {{to calculate the}} amount of amine end-group in nylon 66 (<b>polyhexamethylene</b> <b>adipamide).</b> The pre-treatment of the sample under study, consisted of dissolving the polymer using purified phenol and shaking the system. Then 95 % ethanol and distilled water were added. After that, conductometric titration was carried out using, 0.1  N hydrochloric acid and slow stirring. As phenol {{was not a good}} solvent for the determination of the carboxyl end groups because after equivalent point, it reacts with the base, the benzyl alcohol is used instead. Even though the conductance found was lower than that expected for the solvent previously used (phenol–ethanol–water) and the cut point of the two straight lines was not so sharp, the results obtained by conductometric titration were in agreement with the ones obtained by titration using an indicator [7]. In this research work to analyze the amine and carboxyl end-group is necessary to dissolve the sample of polymer under study, which considerably increases the time needed for the determination. Another important statement presented, is to find the correct solvent or mixture of solvents that do not incorporate an error in the interpretation of the results obtained.|$|E
40|$|The oxygen {{compatibility}} of six polymers used in oxygen {{service was}} evaluated after exposure for 48 hours to oxygen pressures ranging from 350 to 6200 kPa (50 to 900 psia), and temperatures ranging from 50 to 250 C (122 to 302 F). Three elastomers were tested: CR rubber (C 873 - 70), FKM fluorocarbon rubber (Viton A), and MPQ silicone rubber (MIL-ZZ- 765, Class 2); and three thermoplastics were tested: <b>polyhexamethylene</b> <b>adipamide</b> (Zytel 42), polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon TFE), and polychlorotrifluoroethylene (Neoflon CTFE M 400 H). Post-aging changes in mass, dimensions, tensile strength, elongation at break, and durometer hardness were determined. Also, the compression set was determined {{for the three}} elastomers. Results show that the properties under investigation were more sensitive to oxygen pressure at low to moderate temperatures, and more sensitive to temperature at low to moderate oxygen pressures. Inspection of the results also suggested that both chain scissioning and cross-linking processes were operative, consistent with heterogeneous oxidation. Attempts are underway to verify conclusively the occurrence of heterogeneous oxidation using a simple modulus profiling technique. Finally, the effect of aging at 620 kpa (90 psia) and 121 C (250 F) on ignition and combustion resistance was determined. As expected, aged polymers were less ignitable and combustible (had higher AlTs and lower heats of combustion). Special attention was given to Neoflon CTFE. More specifically, the effect of process history (compression versus extrusion molding) and percent crystallinity (quick- versus slow-quenched) on the AIT, heat of combustion, and impact sensitivity of Neoflon CTFE was investigated. Results show the AIT, heat of combustion, and impact sensitivity to be essentially independent of Neoflon CTFE process history and structure...|$|E
40|$|Insulated {{rail joints}} (IRJs) are safety {{critical}} {{components in the}} electrical signalling system of rail corridors. They are subjected to dynamic loads generated by heavy rollingstock – track system interaction and degrade faster than the other components of the rail track. Degraded IRJs diminish {{the reliability of the}} signalling system, thus posing a serious threat to the safety of rail operations. Therefore there is a pressing need for closely examining the failure mechanisms of the insulated material endposts inserted into the discontinuity in the rail at IRJs with a view to improving their service life, reliability and efficiency. Only limited literature are available examining different IRJ endpost materials, and focussing on contact pressure and contact stress distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} endpost, disregarding the damage to rail end and endpost materials. In this paper, a detailed 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out to quantify plastic deformation and damage to endpost and railhead materials of IRJs due to a wheel load which causes the rail steel shakedown limit to be exceeded. A modified Hertzian contact pressure distribution is considered in this simulation. A 5 mm endpost thickness is considered at the discontinuity in the rail which is required to form the IRJ. Three popular IRJ endpost materials are employed in this study, these being fibreglass (FB or fb), <b>polyhexamethylene</b> <b>adipamide</b> (Nylon 66 or ny) and polytetrafluoroethelene (PTFE or ptfe). 2000 cycles of a 174 kN dynamic wheel load (in pressure format over the contact patch) are applied on the top of the rail surface in the vicinity of the IRJ with a dynamic load factor of 1. 16. Equivalent plastic deformations along with vertical and longitudinal plastic strains for loaded and unloaded conditions are presented. The strain plots depict damage of endpost materials and ratchetting failure of the steel in the vicinity of the rail ends. The ratchetting failure modes follow the established trend of decay in ratchetting rate in successive wheel load cycles. Comparisons of strain and stress on the railhead surface and in the railhead sub-surface considering all three different endpost materials are put forward. Out of the three endpost materials, fibreglass is the best performing material considering ratchetting damage...|$|E
40|$|Electrostatic fiber formation, or electrospinning, {{offers a}} {{particularly}} simple and robust method to create polymeric nanofibers {{of various sizes}} and morphologies. In electrospinning, a viscoelastic fluid is charged so that a liquid jet is ejected {{from the surface of}} the fluid (typically in the form of a drop supplied by a needle or spinneret) and collected on a grounded plate, creating a nonwoven fiber mat. Modification of the diameter of the fibers as well as the porosity, specific surface area, and mechanical properties of the mat allows one to tailor electrospun mats for specific applications. Despite the widespread and rapidly growing use of electrospinning in the fabrication of novel nanomaterials, there are no simple, universal methods of predicting, a priori, the properties of electrospun fibers from knowledge of the polymer solution properties and electrospinning operating conditions alone. Changing a single fluid or processing parameter can affect the jet and fiber formation through several mechanisms. For example, using a different solvent can change several properties of the electrospinning fluid, such as the dielectric constant, conductivity, surface tension, and solute-solvent interaction. The work in this thesis seeks to develop a simple relation for predicting terminal jet diameter during electrospinning, which accounts for solution viscoelasticity as well as solution conductivity and operating parameters that can be easily measured and controlled. The mechanical and tribological properties of electrospun fiber mats are of paramount importance to their utility as components in a variety of applications. Although some mechanical properties of these mats have been investigated previously, reports of their tribological properties are essentially nonexistent. In this thesis, electrospun nanofiber mats of poly(trimethyl hexamethylene terephthalamide) (PA 6 (3) T) and <b>poly(hexamethylene</b> <b>adipamide)</b> (PA 6, 6) are characterized mechanically and tribologically. Post-spin thermal annealing was used to modify the fiber morphology, inter-fiber welding, and crystallinity within the fibers. Morphological changes, in-plane tensile response, friction coefficient, and wear rate were characterized as functions of the annealing temperature. The Young's moduli, yield stresses and toughnesses of the PA 6 (3) T nonwoven mats improved by two- to ten-fold when annealed slightly above the glass transition temperature, but at the expense of mat porosity. The mechanical and tribological properties of the thermally annealed PA 6, 6 fiber mats exhibited significant improvements through the Brill transition temperature, comparable to the improvements observed for amorphous PA 6 (3) T electrospun mats annealed near the glass transition temperature. The wear rates for both polymer systems correlate with the yield properties of the mat, in accordance with a modified Ratner-Lancaster model. The variation in mechanical and tribological properties of the mats with increasing annealing temperature is consistent with the formation of fiber-to-fiber junctions and a mechanism of abrasive wear that involves the breakage of these junctions between fibers. A mechanically robust proton exchange membrane with high ionic conductivity and selectivity is an important component in many electrochemical energy devices such as fuel cells, batteries, and photovoltaics. The ability to control and improve independently the mechanical response, ionic conductivity, and selectivity properties of a membrane is highly desirable in the development of next generation electrochemical devices. In this thesis, the use of layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of polyelectrolytes is used to generate three different polymer film morphologies on highly porous electrospun fiber mats: webbed, conformal coating, and pore-bridging films. Specifically, depending on whether a vacuum is applied to the backside of the mat or not, the spray-LbL assembly either fills the voids of the mat with the proton conducting material or forms a continuous fuel-blocking film. The LbL component consists of a proton-conducting, methanolimpermeable poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) /sulfonated poly(2, 6 -dimethyl 1, 4 - phenylene oxide) (PDAC/sPPO) thin film. The electrospun fiber component consists of PA 6 (3) T fibers of average diameter between 400 and 800 nm, in a nonwoven matrix of 60 - 90 % porosity depending on the temperature of thermal annealing utilized to improve the mechanical properties. This thesis demonstrates the versatility and flexibility of this fabrication technique, since any ion conducting LbL system may be sprayed onto any electrospun fiber mat, allowing for independent control of functionality and mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of the spray coated electrospun mats are shown to be superior to the LbL-only system, and possess intrinsically greater dimensional stability and lower mechanical hysteresis than Nafion under hydration cycling. The electrochemical selectivity of the composite LbL-electrospun membrane is found to be superior to Nafion, which makes them a viable alternative proton exchange membrane for fuel cell applications. The composite proton exchange membranes fabricated in this work were tested in an operational direct methanol fuel cell, with results showing the capability for higher open circuit voltages (OCV) and comparable cell resistances when compared to Nafion. by Matthew Marchand Mannarino.
