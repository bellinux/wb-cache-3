This ability {{is due to the}} lipophobic nature of fluorocarbons, as fluorosurfactants tend to concentrate at the liquid-air interface. They are not as susceptible to the London dispersion force, a factor contributing to lipophilicity, because the electronegativity of fluorine reduces the polarizability of the surfactants' fluorinated molecular surface. Therefore, the attractive interactions resulting from the [...] "fleeting dipoles" [...] are reduced, in comparison to hydrocarbon surfactants.

40|$|Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) organic monomolecular (monolayer) films {{containing}} {{fatty acids}} and their perfluorinated counterparts separate into phases under certain conditions. These <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>surfactant</b> containing mixed-phase {{systems have been}} shown to exhibit many favourable attributes in comparison to non- <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>surfactant</b> monolayers. In this thesis project, two of these films were investigated. One film is a 2 : 1 ratio mixture of arachidic acid (C 19 H 39 COOH – AA) to perfluorotetradecanoic acid (C 13 F 27 COOH – PA), which phase-separates into hexagonal domains ~ 6 ìm large (2 : 1 ratio of AA to PA – 2 AA 1 PA). The other film is a 2 : 1 mixture of stearic acid (C 17 H 35 COOH - SA) to PA, which phase-separates into linear domains ~ 300 nm wide (2 : 1 ratio of SA to PA – 2 SA 1 PA). Through the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM), and various synchrotron photoemission electron microscopy-based (PEEM) techniques, the films were characterized. As properties such as molecular organization, and dispersion of the molecules in the film, affect film function, it is necessary to use a variety of techniques to better understand order and composition in the films. First, the well-known and previously-studied film, 2 AA 1 PA, was used to better understand contrast mechanisms in the energy filtered x-ray photoemission electron microscope (X-PEEM) at the CLS. Through the use of techniques such as secondary electron emission microscopy (SEEM), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and x-ray linear dichroism microscopy (XLDM), the effects of secondary electrons, valence character, and polarization dependence were studied so as to better understand their contribution to contrast in energy-filtered PEEM-based spectromicroscopy. Second, the composition and organization of a novel system (2 SA 1 PA), was characterized using traditional near-edge x-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. As the size of the domains in the 2 SA 1 PA system are below the spatial resolution limit of PEEM spectromicroscopy, methods involving selective phase dissolution, and spectrum subtraction, were used to acquire phase composition and molecular order information. The high lateral and vertical spatial resolution of AFM allowed physical imaging and confirmation of sample structure, as well as very accurate domain height determination. X-PEEM supplements this with chemical sensitivity using high spatial resolution spectromicroscopy. Therefore, using AFM and X-PEEM as complimentary techniques, it is possible to physically and chemically characterize phase-separated monolayer films...|$|R

These micellar aggregates are resulting from the self-assembly of the insoluble P 4 VP/fluorinated complexes into a core surrounded by the soluble PS coronal chains. Their characteristic features have been studied {{as a function of}} various parameters including the composition of the PS-b-P 4 VP copolymer, the tail length of the fluorinated surfactant, the 4 VP/FS molar ratio, the number of carboxylic acid group (1 or 2) on the surfactant, the presence of the PS block and of the fluorine atoms on the surfactant. Dilution of these initial micellar aggregates triggers a morphological reorganization resulting in the formation of more stable vesicles. The extent of this morphological transition is related to the solubility of the P 4 VP/fluorinated complexes during the dilution process. This transition is complete for short P 4 VP/FS complexes, incomplete for long P 4 VP/FS complexes, and not observed whenever an alpha,omega-difunctional FS is used in P 4 VP/FS complexes, leading to a cross-linked core.

Sulfur, fluorine, and carbon mass balances indicate that mineralization occurs immediately following the degradation of the initial perfluorinated surfactant. Near complete conversion of PFOS and PFOA to CO, CO_ 2, F^-, and SO_ 4 ^(2 -) occurs due to pyrolytic reactions at the surface and vapor phase of transiently collapsing cavitation bubbles. The initial PFOS or PFOA pyrolytic degradation occurs at the bubble−water interface and involves the loss of the ionic functional group leading to the formation of the corresponding 1 H-fluoroalkane or perfluoroolefin. The fluorochemical intermediates undergo a series of pyrolytic reactions in the bubble vapor leading to C_ 1 fluoro-radicals. Secondary vapor-phase bimolecular reactions coupled with concomitant hydrolysis converts the C_ 1 fluoro-radicals to carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and HF, forming a proton and fluoride upon dissolution.

Wastewater treatment plants and other anthropogenic sources have been identified as significant sources or pathways for the introduction of perfluoroalkyl compounds into Lake Victoria ecosystem. In this study, elevated concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate was found in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Kisumu, City of Kenya. An alternative analytical method to liquid chromatography/ mass spectroscopy for analysis of perfluorocarboxylic acids in abiotic and biotic matrices where high concentrations are expected is also presented. Derivatisation of the acid group to form a suitable alkyl ester provided a suitable compound for mass spectroscopy detection coupled to gas chromatography instrumental analysis. The acid is esterified by an alkyl halide i. e benzyl bromide as the alkylating agent for Perfluorocarboxylic acids quantification. The study also involved degradability measurements of emerging <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>surfactants</b> substitutes. The stability of the substitutes of <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>surfactants</b> was tested by employing advanced oxidation processes, followed by conventional tests, among them an automated method based on the manometric respirometry test and standardized fix bed bioreactor [FBBR] on perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), a fluoroethylene polymer, fluorosurfactant (Zonyl), two fluoraliphaticesters (NOVEC ™ FC 4430 and NOVEC ™ FC 4432) and 10 -(trifluoromethoxy) decane-sulfonate. Most of these emmerging surfactants are well-established in the market and have been used in several applications as alternatives to PFOS and PFOA based surfactants. The results of this study can be used as pioneer information for further studies on the sources, behaviour and fate of PFOA and PFOS and other related compounds in both abiotic and biota compartments of Lake Victoria and other lakes. Further an overview in degradation of emerging perfluorinated compounds substitutes is presented. Contribution in method development especially for acid group based fluorosurfactants is presented. The data obtained in this study can particularly be considered when formulating policies and management measures for preservation and sustainability of Lake Victoria resources...|$|E

Perfiuorinated surfactants are an important class of specialty chemicals {{that are used in}} AFFF agents and have physio-chemical properties that differentiate them from hydrocarbon surfactants. In the past, the environmental behavior of <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>surfactants</b> has received little attention, and how the unique properties affect the behavior of perfluorinatedsurfactants in the environment and their potential impact on co-contaminant transport and biodegradation are unknown. An analytical method was developed to determine perfluorocarboxylates in groundwater. Solid-phase extraction and in-vial derivatization techniques were used to form the methyl esters of perfluorocarboxylates that were then analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Perfluorocarboxylates containing 6 to 8 carbons were detected in groundwater samples collected from Naval Air Station Fallon, NV, Tyndall Air Force Base, FL, and Wurtsmith Air Force Base, MI, with total concentrations Redacted for privacy ranging from 3 to 7, 090 p. g/L. The homologous series of perfluorocarboxylates observed in groundwater from the three military sites as well as in commercial AFFF mixtures consisted of even and odd number perfluorinated carboxylates, which is indicative of the electrochemical fluorination synthesis process. At Wurtsmith Air Force Base, MI, perfluorocarboxylates detected 500 m from the source area were estimated to have a minimum residence time of 5 to 15 years. Additionally, the perfluorocarboxylate concentrations observed in groundwater are significantly lower than the corresponding methylene blue active substances concentrations, which indicates that there are additional anionic surfactant species present in the groundwater.

Target analytes comprised polar herbicides, pharmaceuticals (including antibiotics), estradiol hormones, perfluorooctansulfonate (PFOS), perfluorinated alkancarboxylates (including perfluorooctanoate PFOA), nonylphenol, its carboxylates and ethoxylates (NPEO surfactants), and triclosan, a bactericide used in personal care products. Analysis of water samples {{was performed by}} solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography triple-quadrupole (tandem) mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). By extraction of 1 L water samples and concentration of the extract to 100 µL, method detection limits (MDLs) as low as 0. 05 - 0. 1 ng/L were achieved for most compounds. Lake water samples from seven different locations in the Southern part of Lake Maggiore and eleven samples from different tributary rivers and creeks were investigated. Moreover, rain water was analysed to investigate the atmospheric input of the contaminants. The following compounds were regularly detected in very low concentrations in the lake water: caffeine (max. concentration 124 ng/L), the herbicides terbutylazine (7 ng/L), atrazine (5 ng/L), simazine (16 ng/L), diuron (11 ng/L), atrazine-desethyl (11 ng/L), the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine (9 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (10 ng/L), gemfibrozil (1. 7 ng/L), benzafibrate (1. 2 ng/L), the surfactant metabolite nonylphenol (15 ng/L), its carboxylates (NPE 1 C 120 ng/L, NPE 2 C 7 ng/L, NPE 3 C 15 ng/L) and ethoxylates (NPEnOs, n= 3 - 17; 300 ng/L), <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>surfactants</b> (PFOS 9 ng/L, PFOA 3 ng/L), and estrone (0. 4 ng/L).

40|$|Due {{to their}} high surface energy, {{hydrophilic}} surfaces {{are susceptible to}} contamination which is difficult to remove and often ruins the surface. Hydrophilic-oleophobic coatings have a diverse engineering potential including applications as self-cleaning surfaces, extended life anti-fog coatings, and environmental remediation in the selective filtration of oil-in-water mixtures. A successful design model for hydrophilic-oleophobic behavior has been developed using <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>surfactants</b> covalently bound to a surface. Within this design model, a variety of materials have been explored which the surfactants are covalently bound to a substrate; similarly, the surfactants may also be incorporated as a monomer into bulk copolymers. ^ Surfactant based surfaces exhibited simultaneous hydrophilicity, necessary for anti-fogging, and oleophobicity, necessary for contamination resistance. The combination of these features rendered the surface as self-cleaning. Surfactant based brushes, composed of polyethylene glycol and perfluorinated constituents were grafted on to silica surfaces. The relationship between brush density and stimuli-responsiveness was determined by varying grafting conditions. The resultant surfaces were characterized with respect to chemical composition, brush thickness, and wetting behavior of water and hexadecane. Optimized surfaces exhibited stimuli-responsive behavior such that the surfaces will be wetted by water but not by oil. ^ Surfactants were incorporated into random copolymers to create self-cleaning polymers which could be easily coated on to surfaces post-synthesis. Acrylic acid, methyl methacrylate, and hydroxyethyl methacrylate were used as comonomers; feed ratio was varied to establish compositional limits of stimuli-responsive behavior. Polymer composition dictated coating durability and self-cleaning performance as determined by water and hexadecane contact angle. The ability of select coatings to mitigate fogging was assessed in two extreme environments: transition from - 20 °C to humid laboratory environment; exposure to steaming water vapor. ^ Silica membranes of varying pore size were modified with stimuli-responsive surfactants. Membranes showed the ability to selectively pass water and restrict passage of oil, demonstrating a reusable method of separating oil-in-water emulsions. Selectivity of oil-in-water emulsions and permeate flow rate of each individual fluid were quantified for the surfactant modified membranes. Permeate flow rate was characterized with respect to individual droplets and bulk fluid. ...|$|E
40|$|Perfluorinated {{tensides}} are {{of environmental}} concern {{because of their}} high stability, their potential for bioaccumulation and their toxicological characteristics. In some industrial applications, however, e. g. the electroplating industry, {{there is still no}} proper substitute for these substances. In electroplating processes, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) {{is by far the most}} commonly used perfluorinated surfactant. PFOS as a technical product usually contains small amounts of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). An alternative to the <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>surfactants</b> that has been applied successfully in certain electroplating processes is polyfluorinated 6 : 2 fluorotelomersulfonate (6 : 2 FTS). For the determination of PFOS, PFBS and 6 : 2 FTS in electroplating processes, a sensitive and selective analytical procedure was developed. The tensides are separated from the chromate matrix by a liquid-liquid extraction combined with an ion-pairing reagent and analysed by LC-MS. This method shows a good reproducibility and high recoveries in the range of 82 - 118 %. A central goal of this work was the separation of PFOS and 6 : 2 FTS from the process waters of an electroplating process. This was achieved by studying the adsorption of these surfactants on ion-exchange resins and activated carbon. The experiments showed that PFOS and 6 : 2 FTS are better adsorbed on ionic sites than on non-polar ones, with both the ion-exchanger and the activated carbon. To determine the influence of the chromate-containing matrix, adsorption experiments were conducted at different chromate levels. As suspected, the adsorption efficiency decreased at high chromate concentrations. This effect of chromate was stronger for PFBS and 6 : 2 FTS than for PFOS. Continuous cleaning of a process water was simulated on a laboratory scale under various conditions. The results of this experiment showed that both the ion-exchanger and the activated carbon can effectively adsorb very low levels of PFOS, PFBS and 6 : 2 FTS. In a comparison of the adsorption isotherms, the ion-exchanger has a superior capacity and adsorption efficiency to the activated carbon. This is particularly true for PFOS that was adsorbed from a highly concentrated chromate solution (4. 0 g/l CrO 3) in a pilot plant (95 % efficiency on an ion-exchanger). The high affinity of the anion-exchanger for PFOS makes it better suited for a cleaning procedure by adsorption from electroplating processes. Some branches of the electroplating industry cannot substitute PFOS. The application of this surfactant would be possible, however, if the effluent to the waste-water stream could be reduced to a minimum by a clean-up procedure. A problem for the clean-up of the process-waters, on the other hand, is the presence of PFBS in technical PFOS products. PFBS is barely adsorbed by the ion-exchangers and can still enter the waste-water. The clean-up procedure described can only be reasonable when PFOS is applied in the process in pure form. For the further treatment of the ion-exchangers after they are loaded with fluorinated surfactants, there are generally two possibilities. The first involves a high-temperature burning of these materials that completely decomposes both the resin and the surfactants. Another way is to recycle the surfactants and reuse them in the electroplating process. The elution of these tensides with common water-based systems, however, is not efficient. Because of this, other methods for the recycling of the surfactants were investigated. Both the elution with ammoniacal methanol and the extraction with ethyl acetate and tetrabutylammonium bromide are simple and yet effective ways to recycle the adsorbed fluorinated surfactants. Although perfluorinated sulfonic acids can only be decomposed by a complex and costly high-temperature incineration, perfluorinated carboxylic acids can be decomposed by chemical oxidation. In this work, the oxidation of 6 : 2 FTS with peroxodisulfate was examined. The products obtained suggest that decomposition takes place by a stepwise degradation of the alkyl chain. This mechanism is very similar to the one suggested by other workers for the decomposition of perfluorinated carboxylic acids. Under electrolytic conditions, similar degradation products of 6 : 2 FTS could be observed. This suggests that the polyfluorinated tenside is also degraded to smaller fluorinated species during the industrial electroplating process. Because of the high demand for chemicals in the oxidation of 6 : 2 FTS with peroxodisulfate and the slow reaction of 6 : 2 FTS under electrolytic conditions, neither method is applicable to the cost-efficient decomposition of this surfactant on a technical scale...|$|E
40|$|Microfluidics {{is being}} used {{throughout}} academia and industry today to perform large numbers of experiments with extremely small volumes of fluids. By doing this, those that study microfluidics hope to raise through-put, lower cost and limit {{the environmental impact of}} scientific research. 2 Complementing the increased use of microfluidics, the use of perfluorinated emulsions in the field of droplet-based microfluidics is also experiencing large growth. 3 However, many of the products available today are either proprietary and/or poorly understood. While some chemical structures are known, some of the most scientifically intriguing <b>perfluorinated</b> oils and <b>surfactants</b> do not have their chemical structures or characteristics available to the public research community. During the course of our senior design project, we isolated one particular <b>perfluorinated</b> oil and <b>surfactant</b> mixture and performed a number of tests on the stability of the emulsions over a variety of different biologically relevant variables. To achieve this, we were required to design multiple iterations of droplet-microfluidic chips to create the simplest emulsions for study. The resulting designs gave us an excellent platform to study not only our emulsion system, but many future emulsions systems in a novel manner. We proved its efficacy by using the system to show great variance in the stability and surface energy of different pH droplets in QX 100 <b>perfluorinated</b> oil with <b>surfactant</b> as well as a characterizable change in stability when changing the concentration of phosphate and media constituents in the droplets. Finally, we further analyzed the emulsion with the help of Dr. Gerald Fuller’s coalescence lab in Stanford University’s chemical engineering department and observed changes in the viscoelastic nature of aqueous-perfluorinated oil interfaces over a variety of biologically relevant conditions. Though much was accomplished, there is still a need to further characterize both more aqueous conditions and more perfluorinated systems to truly shed light on the field. Additionally, more detailed viscoelastic analysis needs to be performed on these new conditions and oil-surfactant mixtures as well as a thorough pendant-drop style surface tension experiment on all experiments performed...|$|R

A promising approach for cartilage engineering consists of using of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and a differentiation factor combined with an injectable carrier biomaterial. We describe here a novel synthesis route for native collagen microspheres that does not involve the use of potentially toxic crosslinking agents. An emulsion was formed between a type I collagen solution and perfluorinated oil, stabilised by a biocompatible triblock <b>perfluorinated</b> copolymer <b>surfactant.</b> Spherical microparticles of fibrillar collagen were formed through a sol-gel transition induced by ammonia vapours. Electron microscopy observations showed that these self-cross-linked microspheres were constituted by a gel of striated collagen fibrils.

Human MSC rapidly adhered to TGF-β 3 -loaded microspheres and, after 21 d of culture, exhibited typical chondrocyte morphology and produced an uncalcified matrix made of the predominant cartilage components, aggrecan and type II collagen, but devoid of the hypertrophic marker type X collagen. Subcutaneous co-injection of MSC and TGF-β 3 -loaded microspheres in mice consistently {{led to the formation of}} a cartilage-like tissue, which was however hypertrophic, calcified and vascularised.
