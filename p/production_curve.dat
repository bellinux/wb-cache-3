After peak oil, according to the Hubbert Peak Theory, the rate of oil production on Earth would enter a terminal decline.

(CATL 1. 1) in the crude extract, without any purification. The quantification of the compounds was done by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) using the signal integration and an internal standard, N,N-dimethylformamide. Fungi were cultivated {{for a period of}} 20 days and quantification of the metabolites in the extracts was done starting from time zero, 2 days and after this period in an interval of 4 days. The maximum production of mycophenolic acid and citrinin was obtained at 12 and 8 days of fermentation, respectively. These results show that the 1 H NMR technique was efficient to define the <b>production</b> <b>curves</b> of mycophenolic acid and citrinin directly in the crude extracts. In addition, the technique made it possible to evaluate the purity degree of the substances obtained in the extraction process.

The data analyzed consisted of approximately 91, 000 daily milk yield records corresponding to 122 first, 99 second, and 92 third parity individual lactation curves. The functions were fitted using nonlinear regression procedures, and their performance {{was assessed using}} goodness-of-fit statistics (coefficient of determination, residual mean squares, Akaike information criterion, and the correlation and concordance coefficients between observed and adjusted milk yields at several days in milk). Overall, all the growth functions evaluated showed an acceptable fit to the cumulative milk <b>production</b> <b>curves,</b> with the Richards equation ranking first (smallest Akaike information criterion) followed by the Morgan equation. Differences among the functions in their goodness-of-fit were enlarged when fitted to average curves by parity, where the sigmoidal functions with a variable point of inflection (Richards and Morgan) outperformed the other 4 equations. All the functions provided satisfactory predictions of milk yield (calculated from the first derivative of the functions) at different lactation stages, from early to late lactation. The Richards and Morgan equations provided the most accurate estimates of peak yield and total milk production per 305 -d lactation, whereas the least accurate estimates were obtained with the logistic equation.

30|$|It {{is evident}} that the black curve (V L =  0) is {{much lower than the}} other three curves, which {{suggests}} that the desorption effect will greatly increase the productivity of the reservoir. The adsorbed gas provides about 25  % of the total recovery in the later stage of production. In addition, when V L increases from 0.2 to 2  cm 3 /cm 3, both the <b>production</b> decline <b>curves</b> and the cumulative <b>production</b> <b>curves</b> will rise with small extents. Its reason is that when the reservoir pressure decreases with production, the shale gas in the matrix will continuously desorb {{from the surface of the}} matrix pore, and the desorbed gas will feed the natural fractures and the hydraulic fractures, thus enhancing the productivity. Consequently, the gas rate will decline more slowly with larger Langmuir volume.|$|R
