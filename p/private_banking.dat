40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} explore how the type of bank {{ownership}} - local <b>private</b> <b>banks,</b> government-owned banks (public banks) and foreign banks - can affect relationship lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by using a unique data set from Bangladeshi banking sector. We found that <b>private</b> <b>banks</b> differ from government-owned and foreign banks in terms of relationship lending and credit facilities to SMEs. More specifically, our results suggest that unlike government and foreign <b>banks,</b> <b>private</b> <b>banks</b> do consider soft information from relationship lending while setting up the loan spread to SMEs. We can also confirm that exclusive banking relationship or repeated <b>banking</b> with <b>private</b> <b>banks</b> can soften credit conditions (loan maturity and covenants). Moreover, we found empirical evidence that banking relationship is important for <b>private</b> <b>banks</b> in terms of SME credit risk evaluation. Finally, as according to our expectation, the results confirm that regardless of prior relationship, <b>private</b> <b>banks</b> are more depended on collateral-based lending to SMEs than government-owned or foreign banks. © Foundation of International Studies, 2017. and CSR, 2017...|$|R
