6000|$|LIFE OF WORDSWORTH. To {{understand}} {{the life of}} him who, in Tennyson's words, [...] "uttered nothing base," [...] it is well to read first The Prelude, which records the impressions made upon Wordsworth's mind from his earliest recollection until his full manhood, in 1805, when the poem was completed.[221] Outwardly his long and uneventful life divides itself naturally into four periods: (1) his childhood and youth, in the Cumberland Hills, from 1770 to 1787; (2) a period of uncertainty, of storm and stress, including his university life at Cambridge, his travels abroad, and his revolutionary experience, from 1787 to 1797; (3) a short but significant <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> himself and his work, from 1797 to 1799; (4) {{a long period of}} retirement in the northern lake region, where he was born, and where for a full half century he lived so close to nature that her influence is reflected in all his poetry. When one has outlined these four periods he has told almost all that can be told of a life which is marked, not by events, but largely by spiritual experiences.|$|E

5000|$|Vasquez {{collaborated with}} Crab Scrambly {{to produce the}} storybook Everything Can Be Beaten, {{published}} by Slave Labor in 2002. Vasquez, credited as Chancre Scolex, wrote the story and Crab Scrambly illustrated it. Everything Can Be Beaten is about a strange person {{who lives in a}} room in which he can do nothing but beat kittens. However, an adventure into the outside world changes his perspective, and he discovers that [...] "everything can be beaten". The storybook inspired Urban Squall in 2008 to create the puzzle browser game Bloody Fun Day. Vasquez did the entire artwork for the deluxe edition of the Mindless Self Indulgence album If as well as the digital single [...] "Mastermind". He also directed the music videos for Mindless Self Indulgence's [...] "Shut Me Up" [...] and The Left Rights' [...] "White". Jhonen made the cover art for the album Zero Day by MC Frontalot and also indicated that he shows his artwork in galleries from time to time. He also did an art rendition of BioShock 2 called [...] "The Sisters". He was quoted saying the following about the rendition: [...] Who says kids are good for nothing other than emergency food in disaster conditions? I don't, because at this point my badass nieces helped out quite a bit for reference. I dragged them, much like Big Sister there, out for a quick photo session and we had a damn fine time in freezing winds posing like the little, demonic wee ones that they are. Being my niece, the youngest had no problem finding that place in her heart that allowed her to simulate the howling face of a child being dragged down a nightmare alley by an unspeakable horror. Throw in a tall, monstrous friend of mine to stand in for Big Sister and you have four people with chattering teeth and trying to steal my jacket. After that, the line-art came pretty easily enough, save for an adjustment <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> the balance between a more realistic style and not losing the strange cartoonishness. He also worked on a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle short called [...] "Don Vs Raph" [...] where Donatello and Raphael compete to see who is better, but the two always end up tying.|$|E

More specifically, {{the aim was to}} identify what resources and demands were encountered in each <b>period</b> <b>of</b> the asylum seeking, the resettlement, and the present life of Iranian refugees and how participants perceived and experienced these resources and demands. A qualitative approach, was used to capture in detail the life experiences of individuals. Nine Iranian refugees coming to Norway as asylum seekers or ‘resettlement refugees’ were interviewed with semi-structured interviews. They were recruited by snowball sampling and had stayed between seven to 21 years in Norway {{at the time of the}} interview. Results show that this group of Iranian refugees experienced demands regarding the location of the reception centre, lack of meaningful day-to-day activity, legal status insecurity, and lack of safety in their asylum seeking period. Moreover, they perceived social support as a helpful resource during this <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. Further <b>findings</b> show that Iranian refugees encountered demands in relation to employment, mastering the language, and discrimination and prejudice in their resettlement to present life period. In addition, they identified social support and education as a helpful resource during this <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. <b>Findings</b> indicate the importance of examining the post-migration life experiences of forced migrants in the host societies...|$|R

We also find that economic conditions vary in their influence on giving to subsectors, and gifts to public benefit and human services organizations increase significantly during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> recession. <b>Findings</b> from our study have direct implications for philanthropists, fundraisers, and policy makes as they seek to understand how economic conditions impact large gifts...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a model for {{physician}} staffing requirements that could be generally applied to any hospital department, taking into account factors such as occupancy level, professional absences, allowances, physician work duties and patient service levels.
