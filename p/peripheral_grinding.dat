40|$|Titanium foams are {{regarded}} as potent materials for biomedical applications such as bone implants, and are, if possible, manufactured close to their final shape by sintering processes. There are cases, however, {{in which it is}} necessary to generate the final shape by machining, and problems resulting from the porous structure and the material characteristics become critical. In this article, two important methods of machining, i. e. face milling and <b>peripheral</b> <b>grinding,</b> are investigated for their applicability to Ti foams, and their scope and limitations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rail {{grinding}} is a {{key maintenance}} activity for Network Rail. It is performed at night through possession of the track, so process speed is critical. Increasing the metal removal rate (MRR) of the rail grinding operations would {{be a way to}} improve the time taken for this operation. The aerospace industry has recently seen advances in grinding technologies that have increased MRR. This work was aimed at assessing their best practice and its application to rail grinding operations. Current Network Rail grinding operations include preventative and corrective re-profiling of the rail head. The majority of work performed in the UK is preventative re-profiling with current train speeds ranging from 1 to 10 mile/h. Opportunities exist to increase train speed and improve the productivity of this operation through the use of more advanced grinding technologies. The most relevant aerospace technology is high efficiency deep grinding (HEDG). This approach uses: a high surface speed of the grinding wheel, superabrasive tooling, and high workpiece feed rates to remove material quickly from the cut-zone. Productivity improvements were identified by applying theory on power requirements (by assessing the specific grinding energy) and chip thickness of the grinding process. Computer CAD/CAM modelling was also performed to assess the effect of changing grinding techniques on potential gouging of the track infrastructure and/or interference with example trackside obstructions. The work concluded that opportunities do exist to improve the current productivity of grinding operations. Utilizing HEDG technology theoretically provides a 100 % train speed increase (utilizing the same power available with the current setup) for preventative re-profiling. This requires the application of high surface speeds of the grinding wheel and superabrasive technology. Further increases in train speed require increased spindle power. The chip thickness experienced by grinding grains is reduced for a <b>peripheral</b> <b>grinding</b> setup and high wheel surface speeds that is beneficial for wheel wear. The application of HEDG technology cutting {{on the periphery of the}} wheel provided optimum conditions during CAD/CAM simulation to avoid rail gouging, and any potential collision of the grinding stone with modelled trackside obstructions...|$|E
40|$|The micro {{topography}} of the grinding tool has a considerable {{influence on the}} cutting forces and temperature {{as well as the}} tool wear. This paper addresses an analytical modelling of the micro-grinding process based on the real tool topography and kinematic modelling of the cutting-edgeworkpiece interactions. An approximate shape of the abrasive grains and their distribution is obtained from the confocal images, which are taken from the tool surface - determining the grain height protrusion and the probability density function of the grains. To determine the grinding forces, a transient kinematic approach is developed. In this method, the individual grit interaction with the workpiece is extended to the whole cutting zone in the <b>peripheral</b> flank <b>grinding</b> operation. Hence a predictive model of cutting forces and surface roughness in micro grinding of titanium grade 5 is developed. Finally, the simulated forces and surface roughness are validated by the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|High {{precision}} grinding tools can be manufactured using microcrystalline CVD diamond as grinding layer. The small and sharp {{edges of the}} crystallites act as cutting edges and - deposited onto tool base bodies - can perform grinding and honing processes. <b>Peripheral</b> and face <b>grinding</b> wheels as well as abrasive pencils have been manufactured using silicon, ceramics, graphite and cemented carbide as base body materials. High performance was achieved in the grinding of glass, ceramics, silicon, cemented carbide and hartened steel. Tool life was limited only due to wear of {{the tips of the}} diamond crystallites and not due to layer flacking. Workpiece roughnesses Ra of 5 nm were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Jig {{grinding}} is {{well known}} as a precision internal machining process for high precision products such as dies and fixtures. Investigation to realize high productivity and high accuracy is performed with different electrodeposited CBN wheels under various grinding conditions. Grinding characteristics such as grinding forces, torque and surface roughness were measured. The main results obtained are as follows. (1) Grinding accuracy improved {{with an increase in}} <b>peripheral</b> speed of <b>grinding</b> wheel. (2) Grinding forces and torque decrease with an increase in peripheral speed of wheel but increase with wheel depth of cut and work feed rate. (3) Grinding forces and torque increase with the cumulative stock removal which is caused by the progress of attritional wear of CBN abrasive grains. (4) A clear reduction of grinding forces is caused by quill motion overlapping the main axis and is induced by the decrease in the mean chip volume and/or the mean chip cross-sectional area...|$|R
40|$|There have been, in some rare cases, {{difficulties}} with clamping of inserts with U-holes in their tool holder. According to the complaints, the inserts {{could not be}} properly clamped or could fracture when clamped. A study has shown that variations in clamping behaviour are mainly depending by {{the position of the}} screw hole in the tool holder and the centering of the screw hole in the insert. The focus of this project has been the centering of screw hole in insert. It has been shown that the screw holes are not always enough centered in the insert. The problem may occur after a certain step in the production, i. e. <b>peripheral</b> <b>grinding.</b> Today, the centering can be measured by a certain measurement jig. The measurement jig has a very good Gauge R and R value but is not easy to use, especially {{if it is to be}} reinstated into the production. The aim of this thesis has been to use SmartScope for developing a new method for measuring the centering of screw hole in insert. The goal with the new method was to be able to measure faster and to be easier to use than the existing one. The project was started with exercises and exploration of some of the functions of SmartScope and its software Measuremind 3 D. Parallel with this, a study was made of the existing documentation for a better understanding of the problem. A method which measures how well the screw holes are centered in their inserts has been developed. The method consists of a number of measuring tools which are joined into a measurement sequence. Measurements of single inserts are fully automated. Provided that a system which picks and puts the inserts in specific locations can be implemented, a series of inserts can be measured fully automated. This method is faster and especially more automated than the current measurement jig. Measurements have shown that the accuracy of the method is well within the tolerance and that it has a good repeatability...|$|E
40|$|A {{collaborative}} research project {{was set up}} to study peripheral diamond wheel machining damage in silicon nitride ceramics. The objective of the work to be carried out at the University of Surrey was to study the nature and depth of machining damage in 3 point flexural rupture test bars made from 5 wt% Y 2 O 3 sintered hot isostatically pressed silicon nitride. The bars were machined to three surface finishes. The work carried out at Rolls-Royce by Mr R Quinn concentrated on the effects the machining damage had on the fracture strengths of the test bars. Work at the University of Surrey has identified in detail the nature and depth of machining damage in "coarse" 0. 4 mum centre line average roughness surfaces. Deep grooves up to 2 mum depth, 18 mum width are found to have been superimposed on the general surface roughness by singularly large diamonds in the 350 grit diamond wheel. Sub-surface median cracks normal to the machining direction were clearly identified in bar cross-sections using oblique, diffuse "penumbra" illumination in an optical microscope, an as yet undocumented technique. Cross-section views of the machined surface and sub-surface were made possible by the very difficult and delicate technique of producing sandwich cross-sections of the machined bars. An analysis of machining-induced median cracks has not been carried out in such detail before. Semi-elliptical in shape the median cracks extend from 6 mum - 45 mum below the machined surface, and range from 19 mum to 101 mum in length parallel to the machining direction. They initiate at the focal point of a tributary system of microcracks at an average depth of 4 mum - 5 mum below the machined surface. It is believed that the median cracks initiate at the plastic/elastic boundary of a plastically deformed surface layer. Therefore a residual compressive layer, formed by the overlap of localised residual stresses from multi-particle contact events. and bound by an underlying tensile field, is thought to have an average depth of 4 mum - 5 mum. A very innovative technique was used to reveal sub-surface deformation, where TEM X-ray microdiffraction spots were distorted by mechanical damage in the ceramic grain structure. The "arcing" or "streaking" of the diffraction spots tended to disappear at a depth of 4 mum - 5 mum below the machined surface. This is further evidence of the existence of a thin layer in residual compression, which has an average depth of 4 mum - 5 mum. This technique is not known to have been used before. Fine diamond machining with a 600 grit wheel produced a centre line average roughness of 0. 01 / 0. 02 mum. However, evidence of machining damage is still present in the form of "remnant tracks" which lie parallel to the machining direction and consist of material pull-out. They are remnants of machining damage under grinding grooves introduced in previous machining stages. Single point Vickers pyramid diamond scratches were implemented at different loads on a polished surface. The morphology of the grooves and material fragmentation and the sub-surface median cracks were examined. Many features were found to resemble the deformation/fracture formed under a deep grinding groove in the coarse machined surface. Work carried out at Rolls-Royce by R Quinn showed that an increase in the quality of surface finish is accompanied by an increase in the mean strength and Weibull modulus of the machined bars. Furthermore a distinct anisotropy in the fracture strengths parallel and normal to the "coarse" machining direction is evidence of anisotropy in machining damage formed by a <b>peripheral</b> diamond <b>grinding</b> wheel. X-ray diffraction tests carried out at the CEGB by P E J Flewitt showed that machining damage produces a long range biaxial residual compressive field with the highest component acting normal to the machining direction. These results are consistent with the nature of machining damage identified at the University of Surrey, namely the strength-controlling median cracks which lie parallel to the machining direction and the residual compressive stress which exists as a thin 4 mum - 5 mum layer below the machined surface. Processing flaws were discovered in the as-hipped billets received for the project. Their elemental composition and likely origin were examined. A three dimensional "cellular network" flaw ranging from 400 mum to 2. 1 mm in size (in different production batches) {{is believed to have been}} formed as a result of flocculation clustering during processing. Clusters of 1 mum - 3 mum metallic particles were also identified. They range from 5 mum - 45 mum in size. The contaminant particles are steel and were introduced as a result of the original ceramic powder ball milling process which employed a steel ball mill...|$|R
