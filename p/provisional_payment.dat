In practice, income details used could be two years out of date and were not even being supplied by the claimant on which to base any current payments. The result was awards were not even properly started for that year and may already have been overpaid.|$|R

50|$|In the tax {{law of the}} United Kingdom, {{tax credit}} {{overpayment}} occurs when a claimant has received more Working Tax Credit (WTC) or Child Tax Credit (CTC) than HMRC’s final end of year calculations awards them. This {{can be caused by}} official or claimant error or neglect, or simply because the <b>provisional</b> <b>payments</b> were based, as is standard, on out of date information. The mechanics as a tax system are discussed elsewhere (see Working Tax Credit and tax credit.) This article is solely about overpayment.|$|R
50|$|On 19 September 2008 the Amsterdam District Court granted LBT <b>provisional</b> {{suspension}} of <b>payment</b> (voorlopige surseance van betaling). On 8 October 2008 at 18.56 hours the Amsterdam District Court has revoked the <b>provisional</b> {{suspension of}} <b>payment</b> and declared LBT bankrupt (in staat van faillissement) with {{the appointment of}} Rutger Schimmelpenninck as bankruptcy trustee (curator).

50|$|In 2001, when IRD {{publicly}} {{raised the}} possibility of trading <b>provisional</b> tax <b>payments</b> as a means of reducing exposure to use of money interest, Ian engaged with IRD officials by helping to write legislation and come up with an actual system that would bring together taxpayers, an independent intermediary and IRD.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} method {{is the most}} common method. However a provisional tax payer can choose to estimate their <b>provisional</b> tax <b>payments.</b> Estimation allows the business owner to pay less or more tax depending on how they think their business is performing. Any underpayment is subject to interest, and no interest is paid on over payment, so it is important that they estimate their profit accurately.|$|R
50|$|Tax pooling allows New Zealand {{taxpayers to}} pool their <b>provisional</b> tax <b>payments</b> {{together}} in an account held by a registered tax pooling intermediary at Inland Revenue (IRD) so that underpayments by some can be offset by overpayments of others. Taxpayers receive/pay an interest rate that is higher/lower than IRD’s rates if they overpay/underpay provisional tax. Intermediaries operate under legislation {{set out in the}} Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the year}} the {{business}} files a tax return (due on the following 7 July for businesses with a tax year ending 31 March) and any under or overpayment is then calculated. Tax pooling was introduced in 2003 to remove some of the worry associated with estimating <b>provisional</b> tax <b>payments</b> by allowing businesses to pool their payments together so the underpayments by some can be offset by the overpayments of others to reduce/enhance the interest they pay/receive.|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Taxation) One of the {{canons of}} context {{requires}} that a liability {{will be in}} 1986 :para 4. 47). taxation is certainty. "Certainty taxpayer be reasonably certain of what any given set of circumstances" (Margo in this his tax Report, It is submitted that, at present, {{there is not the}} desired certainty regarding the treatment of unrealised foreign exchange differences. This is proven by the internal memorandum circularised by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, advising local Receivers of Revenue to put on hold all income tax returns with unrealised foreign exchange losses and all objections to the disallowance of these losses until such time that it has, in consultation with professional bodies, been able to establish an acceptable solution to the problem (Commissioner for Inland Revenue, n. d.). No finality has been reached to date and uncertainty therefore still prevails {{on either side of the}} fence, resulting in losses to both parties. As a result of the Commissioner's instruction not to assess income tax returns with foreign exchange differences, Revenue suffers significant losses from a cash flow point of view. This is because a taxpayer is entitled to base his first and second <b>provisional</b> tax <b>payment</b> for a particular tax year on his "basic amount", this being his taxable income or assessed loss for the last tax year for which he has been assessed. For many affected taxpayers, this is their 1984 tax year in respect of which they reported a considerably lower taxable income than for their last year of assessment. This means that their first two <b>provisional</b> tax <b>payments</b> in respect of a particular tax year can be extremely low in comparison to their taxable income for their last year of assessment. There are also quite a few taxpayers who had an assessed loss for their 1984 tax year who are therefore not required to make a payment at all. It follows, therefore, that Revenue could improve its cash flow position by not allowing assessments to fall too far in arrears. Conversely, disallowance response to pay tax on purposes. taxpayers lose where they have objected to the of their foreign exchange losses and are still awaiting a their objections as, in the meantime, they will have to the basis that the losses are not deductible for tax The direct effect of the disallowance of unrealised foreign exchange losses would be that the after tax cost of borrowings from abroad would be unacceptably high, thus creating a bias towards local borrowing. In a country in dire need of foreign capital, this situation is obviously totally undesirable...|$|R
