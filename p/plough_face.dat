60|$|Æge. My lord, it is; Though {{time has}} <b>ploughed</b> that <b>face</b> With many furrows since I saw it first, Yet I'm too {{well acquainted with}} the ground, Quite to forget it.|$|R
60|$|If I had {{not been}} angry clear through at that cub I might have let go. He <b>ploughed</b> my <b>face</b> in the dirt, and almost jerked my arms off. Suddenly the strain lessened. I got up, {{to see that the}} old hunter had hold of the other rope.|$|R
6000|$|Or weeding or <b>ploughing</b> with <b>faces</b> a-shining with much-toil wet; [...] While in {{this place}} and that place, with bodies unglorious, [...] their chieftains stood, [...] Awaiting in {{patience}} the straw-death, croziered one, caught in your net: [...] Went the laughter of scorn from my mouth like the roaring [...] of wind in a wood.|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} the mobile steam engine allowed steam power {{to be applied to}} {{ploughing}} from about 1850. In Europe, soil conditions were often too soft to support the weight of heavy traction engines. Instead, counterbalanced, wheeled ploughs, known as balance ploughs, were drawn by cables across the fields by pairs of ploughing engines on opposite field edges, or by a single engine drawing directly towards it at one end and drawing away from it via a pulley at the other end. The balance plough had two sets of <b>ploughs</b> <b>facing</b> each other, arranged so when one was in the ground, the other set was lifted into the air. When pulled in one direction, the trailing ploughs were lowered onto the ground by the tension on the cable. When the plough reached the edge of the field, the other engine pulled the opposite cable, and the plough tilted (balanced), putting the other set of shares into the ground, and the plough worked back across the field.|$|R
60|$|As {{he came in}} at {{the door}} out of the sunlight, with his bonnet {{on his head and}} a pipe hanging in his button-hole, he seemed, like Rorie, to have grown older and paler, the lines were deeplier <b>ploughed</b> upon his <b>face,</b> and the whites of his eyes were yellow, like old stained ivory, or the bones of the dead.|$|R
60|$|Finsbury {{brothers}} were ushered, at ten the next morning, {{into a large}} apartment in Michael's office; the Great Vance, somewhat restored from yesterday's exhaustion, but with one foot in a slipper; Morris, not positively damaged, but a man {{ten years older than}} he who had left Bournemouth eight days before, his <b>face</b> <b>ploughed</b> full of anxious wrinkles, his dark hair liberally grizzled at the temples.|$|R
40|$|Cultivation {{methods in}} organic farming are {{controversial}} discussed as the traditional <b>ploughing</b> system <b>faces</b> {{a variety of}} disadvantages, {{especially with regard to}} soil con-servation. To address these problems a mound cultivation system has been devel-oped. This paper presents a case study (on-farm-research) combined with expert interviews and economic modelling results. The aims of the study are to identify the most important cost driver, to calculate the cost of mound cultivation with regard to energy consumption and labour costs and to formulate conditions where this system is economically viable. Experience from on-farm-research and modelling show that the system is in particular suitable for large farms where the field labour organisation is a challenge. Mound cultivation means less time needs, less energy consumption, better soil conservation (erosion), and better conditions for catch crops...|$|R
6000|$|Determined not to {{be caught}} in this way again, the artist seized the reins, and ran the horse close {{alongside}} of the buffalo, whose tail was now as stiff as a poker. Once more the bull turned suddenly round. Heywood pulled the reins violently, thus confusing his steed which ran straight against the buffalo's big hairy forehead. It was stopped as violently as if it had run against the side of a house. But poor Heywood was not stopped. He left the saddle like a rocket, flew right over the bull's back, came down on his <b>face,</b> <b>ploughed</b> up the land with his nose--and learned a lesson from experience! ...|$|R
5000|$|Mulock was {{described}} as [...] "The man who did", his work ethic recognized even by those who sometimes disagreed with what he did. Sir Daniel Wilson referred to him as [...] "the mule". At a luncheon in his honour shortly after his 87th birthday, Mulock described his attitude on growing old: I'm still at work with my hand to the <b>plough</b> and my <b>face</b> to the future. The shadows of evening … lengthen about me but morning is in my heart. … the testimony I bear is this: that the castle of enchantment is not yet behind me, it is before me still and daily I catch glimpses of its battlements and towers. The best of life is always further on. The real lure is hidden from our eyes, somewhere behind the hills of time.|$|R
