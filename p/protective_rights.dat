In 1877 the Afghan Amir refused to accept a British Resident and in 1878 agreed a treaty with Russia granting it <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> in Afghanistan.

After the Resident was murdered in September 1879, the war recommenced. A British-led force occupied Kabul, defeating the Afghans en route at Charasia. Fighting continued and after defeat at Maiwand, a British force were besieged in Kandahar.

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of November 20, 1946 a French patrol ship seized a Chinese junk boat {{attempting}} to bring contraband into Haiphong. [...] While seemingly routine, the seizure of the ship would soon bring many more complications. Vietnamese soldiers reacted to the seizure by firing on the French ship from the shore. Armed clashes immediately broke out on land between French and Vietnamese nationalists. The French immediately worked to dissipate the conflict and stopped the outbreak by agreeing to respect Vietnamese sovereignty in Haiphong on November 22, 1946. This, however, {{was only the beginning}} of the incident. Once the news of the skirmish came to Admiral d'Argenlieu in Paris, he sent a cable to Jean Étienne Valluy, commander of French forces in Indochina, ordering him to use force against the Vietnamese in Haiphong. Valluy in turn sent an order to Colonel Debès, commander of the French troops at Haiphong, stating, [...] "It appears clear that we are up against premeditated aggressions carefully staged by the Vietnamese regular army... The moment has come to give a severe lesson to those who have treacherously attacked you. Use all the means at your disposal to make yourself complete master of Haiphong." [...] Debès responded to this by issuing an ultimatum to the Vietnamese in Haiphong demanding a withdrawal from the French section and Chinese sections of the city, including the port. In the order, Debès invoked the Franco-Chinese agreement of February 28, 1946 as justification for demanding the Vietnamese evacuation of parts of the city. Debès argued that the treaty gave France <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> over the Chinese in Vietnam and thus gave them jurisdiction to engage in combat. After the Vietnamese failed to evacuate in time, the French began a bombardment of the Vietnamese sections of the city, using both the French cruiser Suffren as well as an aerial bombardment. By November 28, 1946, Colonel Debès had taken complete control over the town.|$|E
30|$|In summation, {{the model}} of the German Ethics Council first and foremost, in fact, cannot and will not set any moral impulses, which {{propagate}} a certain vision of good (or the promotion of genome-based research for the purpose of improving public health); instead, its strength however is the concentration upon the <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> of the citizens, by spelling out the legal and organizational overlapping consensus and by strengthening trust in the participating institutions (Dabrock et al. 2011). By means of this procedural manner, research freedom will be strengthened in reality so that individual and public health can also benefit from it. Moreover, it enables an increased degree of <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> and control possibilities, which reduce donor inhibitions and thereby convince more people to donate specimens and to ease previous restrictions for their usage or to dispense with them completely. Simultaneously not only the interests of the collective will be kept in focus, but rather the protective requirement of each individual will be strengthened as well as an elevate transparency, an improved data security and a more frequent involvement of the ethics commissions. Moreover, there remains, of course, much scope for a plural society, to develop effective concepts of good, which include the participation in genome research without too much pressure of moral obligations.|$|E

40|$|The UK’s {{referendum}} {{decision of}} 23 June 2016, where voters elected {{to leave the}} European Union (EU), will fundamentally change aspects of national law. Much debate {{has focused on the}} constitutional implications of the decision and the procedure by which the government seeks to facilitate the exit. Further, issues of substance including the part played by immigration and the control of the UK’s borders have also dominated legal and political commentary. Yet there has been no critical examination of the effects it will have on motor vehicle insurance law. The statute governing much of the law (the Road Traffic Act 1988), along with the extra-statutory agreements providing protection for the third party victims of negligent uninsured drivers and untraced vehicles, are each profoundly influenced by EU directives. Given the Brexit decision and the resolution of the government to facilitate the UK’s exit of the Union, we argue that the <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> for such victims of motor accidents are likely to be reduced. Further, the advancement of the law, developed through the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, will be lost...|$|E
40|$|This paper poses {{questions}} regarding the ethical prioritisation in qualitative research studies on assessing a person’s or a group’s fitness to provide informed consent, arguing that this may have unwanted as well as desirable consequences, particularly in relation to rights of citizenship for socially marginalised populations {{who tend to be}} labelled vulnerable. Drawing on three theoretical perspectives (Arendt, Honneth and Bourdieu), it is suggested that the emphasis placed on a research participant’s capacity to provide informed consent cannot be regarded solely as a protective measure for ‘vulnerable’ groups, but is also bound up with their social positioning as socially ‘deficient’ according to liberal (classical and neo-liberal) models of citizenship. Participation in a qualitative study {{can be seen as a}} dimension of the civil and human right to freedom of expression, and this can be particularly important for those labelled vulnerable as freedom of expression is a precondition for recognition and parity of status. Nevertheless, the importance of informed consent is not rejected; instead, it is posited that the <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> accorded to vulnerable groups in qualitative research need to be considered alongside other human goods, such as the promotion of voice, agency and active citizenship...|$|E

Summary As an academic comparative constitutional lawyer, I come to the recent Constitutional Advisory Panel report and the issue of whether and how the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA) should be reformed from a particular – perhaps idiosyncratic – perspective. This is viewing the NZBORA as an influential version of a new general model of constitutionalism. This model grants to legislatures ultimate responsibility for the resolution of controversial rights issues {{while at the same time}} seeking to improve the rights sensitivity of the legislative process and increasing the <b>rights</b> <b>protective</b> powers of courts as compared with the traditional institutional form of parliamentary supremacy. At least in theory and aspiration, this general model provides an alternative to both the latter, venerable form of constitutional arrangement and its conventional rival, the model of constitutional supremacy, involving a fully constitutionalised regime of supreme, entrenched law enforced by the power of one or more courts to invalidate inconsistent statutes. As an experiment, this new model seeks to create greater balance between courts and legislatures on the resolution of contested rights issues than the traditional alternatives, whilst also providing an effective regime of rights protection.  ...|$|R

At the beginning of this rigorosum thesis I concentrate my attention on the first component of the legal protective system. Due to the elastic range of legal protection exclusively focused on human being as an individual, and as a person of law in the legal sense, it is allowed to try to achieve protection of all natural values of human being, that in the summary create the most personal, the innermost and the most intimate sphere of human being 1.
