5|$|The Charolais breed was small, {{and most}} closely {{physically}} resembled the Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type. The breed {{had a short}} head with small ears and a short, strong neck attached low on the shoulder. The body was short and rounded, with a broad croup and strong legs. They were {{generally considered to be}} small and inelegant. They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits especially so before the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their <b>pulling</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord is large, with stallions {{weighing}} {{upwards of}} , and is bred for traction ability and <b>pulling</b> <b>power.</b> The breed {{is found in}} many solid colors, although bay and roan are the most common, and {{is known to be}} gentle and easy to handle. Two slightly different types of Trait du Nord are found – a larger type used for heavier pulling and a lighter type used for faster work. The breed is considered to be endangered by the French government, with fewer than 100 new foal births a year. The national breed registry in France is working with local groups in an attempt to promote this breed and bring population numbers back up. The breed currently has a high risk of inbreeding, due to the low number of breeding stallions, and is at risk of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord, {{previously}} {{also known}} as Ardennais du Nord or Ardennais de type Nord, is a breed of heavy draft horse developed and bred {{in the area of}} Hainaut in western Belgium and in northeastern France. Originally considered a subtype of the Ardennes, it was recognized as an individual breed with the opening of a studbook in 1903. Developed in the fertile Flemish grasslands, it was bred for size and <b>pulling</b> <b>power</b> for agricultural work. By 1855, the horses bred near Hainaut were considered by some veterinarians to be superior to other Flemish draft breeds. The Trait du Nord was used extensively in mining from the late 19th century through 1920, with lesser use continuing through the 1960s.|$|E

The problematics of emission limits is discussed in the first subgroup. Major part of second subgroup is devoted to hydro mechanical powertrain. Finally wheeled and tracked chassis construction, tyre construction and automatic tire inflation systems are described at the end of theoretical part of the thesis. Practical part devotes to methodology and field measurements with the aim on various weight distribution of the tractor. Measurements were realized with CASE IH Magnum 370 CVX tractor. Obtained values are processed into graphs and charts. Subsequently the dependencies of wheel slip and <b>pull</b> <b>power</b> properties on <b>pulling</b> force of the tractor are created. Conclusion of the thesis provides recommendations for optimal weight distribution of the tractor for <b>pull</b> <b>power</b> operations...|$|R

5|$|The <b>pulling</b> <b>power</b> of the Trait du Nord made it {{popular for}} {{use during the}} Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry, {{including}} mining. In mines, steam engines and internal combustion engines {{could not be used}} due to the possibility of a gas explosion. The first horses were used in the mines in 1821 and the Trait du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in the mines and operating the pulleys used to lift coal to the surface. Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements, and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads. Good horses were able to pull , usually around twelve cars worth, along a railway. As early as 1920, the usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use, and in 1969 the last horse was removed from the mines.|$|E
5|$|The Dole Gudbrandsdal, Dølahest or Dole is a draft- and harness-type horse from Norway. The Dole Trotter is {{alternately}} {{considered a}} subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{and a separate}} breed; it is also considered {{a part of the}} Coldblood trotter type. The Dole Gudbrandsdal is a small draft horse, known for its <b>pulling</b> <b>power</b> and agility, while the Dole Trotter is a smaller, faster horse used for harness racing; the two types are commonly interbred. Both types are strictly critiqued before entry into the studbook, which has over time resulted in an improvement in the breed type. The Dole is originally from the Gudbrandsdal Valley, and is probably descended in part from the Friesian horse. Over time the breed has had Thoroughbred, Arabian and other blood added in, especially during the creation of the Dole Trotter in the 19th century. The first studbook was created in 1941, and the current breed association formed in 1947. Although originally used mainly as a pack horse, today the heavier Dole type is used mainly for agricultural purposes. The Dole Gudbrandsdal been crossed with other breeds to develop horses for harness racing and riding.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Martill {{suggested}} that the odontoid {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw of Istiodactylus served to fill the space where no tooth was present. This completed an arc-like bite that would have been necessary to sever morsels that would otherwise remain attached by a thread. Martill stated that few other animals are known with teeth similar to those of Istiodactylus, but pointed out the similarity to various types of sharks and reptiles, including the cookiecutter shark, which takes circular bites from fish as well as prey much larger than itself (including whales). Istiodactylus may also have taken circular bites from prey larger than itself (such as dinosaurs and crocodiles), but perhaps also from fish, for example by snapping at their backs near the water surface. Martill stated that there were many differences between the skull of Istiodactylus and extant scavengers, such as the lack of a sharp, pointed beak, which could have made it less capable of tearing flesh, but the long neck may have provided enough <b>pulling</b> <b>power,</b> and the claws on the fingers may have been used to manipulate carcasses. Martill agreed that Istiodactylus was most likely a scavenger that would have used its robust teeth to scrape meat from bones, as indicated by wear-facets on the tooth-tips (he proposed that scratch-marks should be looked for on dinosaur bones). He also {{suggested that}} if they were scraping away the last flesh from a carcass, like marabou storks, they would have been in the back of the queue for access to it.|$|E

25|$|A steam {{locomotive}} {{is a type}} of railway locomotive that produces its <b>pulling</b> <b>power</b> through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material – usually coal, wood, or oil – to produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanics}} of drag systems usually consist of {{any number of}} discs (drag washers) arranged in a stack on the spool shaft or in some cases, on the drive shaft. There is generally a screw or lever mechanism that presses against the washers—the higher the pressure, the greater the resistance. Drag washers are commonly made of materials such as steel, Teflon, carbon fiber, other reinforced plastics or metal alloys. Since large fish can generate a lot of <b>pulling</b> <b>power,</b> reels with higher available drag forces (which generate greater heat) for higher-test lines will use stronger and more heat-resistant materials than reels designed for low-test lines. A good drag system is consistent (generates the same force over and over), durable and smooth (no jerkiness).|$|E

500|$|When {{presented}} for grading and studbook inspection, the heavy-type Dole Gudbrandsdals are tested for <b>pulling</b> <b>power</b> and trotting. [...] In the lighter type, x-rays showing {{the knee and}} lower legs {{to be free of}} defects must be presented, and stallions must have satisfactory results on the track before they may be used for breeding. However, three-year-old stallions may be issued temporary licenses before they begin their racing career if their conformation, breeding, and trotting ability are considered acceptable. Trotting-type mares with proper conformation that are not fast enough during grading may be registered as draft-type Doles. These strict and organized standards have improved the quality of the Dole breed over the past few decades. Although the Dole horse is one of the smallest draft breeds, it shows great <b>pulling</b> <b>power,</b> and is also hardy and agile. They are especially known for their excellent trots, as is shown by the lighter sub-type of the breed. During the late 20th century, interbreeding between the two types became quite common; due to this, the breed became much more uniform in type, with fewer differences between the trotter and draft sections.|$|E
500|$|A further {{improvement}} was managed by altering {{the arrangement of}} the teams; by hitching horses one behind the other, rather than side by side, weight could be distributed more evenly, and <b>pulling</b> <b>power</b> increased.
