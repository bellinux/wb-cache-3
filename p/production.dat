5|$|Acetic acid is a {{chemical}} reagent for the <b>production</b> of chemical compounds. The largest single use of acetic acid {{is in the}} <b>production</b> of vinyl acetate monomer, closely followed by acetic anhydride and ester <b>production.</b> The volume of acetic acid used in vinegar is comparatively small.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world <b>production,</b> but it remains important for the <b>production</b> of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid <b>production.</b> As of 2003–2005, total worldwide <b>production</b> of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European <b>production</b> was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese <b>production</b> was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global <b>production</b> has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in <b>production</b> is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

5|$|Although {{existing}} sources do not record {{when the}} Mk. XIV went into <b>production</b> in the UK, they do record that operational testing started in January 1942 and <b>production</b> examples started reaching squadrons in March. It was manufactured by small machine shops and instrument makers, {{such as the}} Aron Meter Company. <b>Production</b> was too slow to meet the demand; between July and October, fewer than a hundred a month were being delivered. As the design was finalized, automated <b>production</b> was undertaken and by mid-1943, 900 a month were available. This was enough to equip the heavy bombers as they arrived from the <b>production</b> lines and by late 1942 the Handley Page Halifax was being delivered with the sight head already installed.|$|E
5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is partly because it took several years to reach full <b>production</b> and partly because U.S. <b>production</b> outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS <b>production</b> increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of <b>production</b> at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil <b>production.</b> As North Slope oil <b>production</b> declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. <b>production.</b> Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil <b>production.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} <b>production</b> {{possibilities}} curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} <b>production</b> possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for <b>production</b> of more of at least one good without sacrificing the <b>production</b> of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the <b>production</b> possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E

5|$|By 17 August 1942, <b>production</b> {{had climbed}} rapidly after Blohm & Voss BV 138 <b>production</b> was scaled down and licence work had shut down at WFG. <b>Production</b> now reached some 150 Ju 87 D {{airframes}} per month, but spare parts were failing {{to reach the}} same <b>production</b> levels.
